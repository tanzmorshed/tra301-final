"Java_Joe","4","17","18","13 November 2018"," Good movie but not really based on a true story.
","I'll put this out there right now. I'm no fan of Ben Affleck. I just never felt he was a good actor but I didn't let that keep me from seeing this movie everybody was talking about.<br/><br/>And yes, let me also put this right out there, the movie is loosely based on the ""Canadian Caper"" in which 6 American diplomats were safely hidden away in the Ambassador's home and then using faked Canadian passports were flown out of Tehran. I say loosely based because as everybody knows it was 90% Canada's involvement that these 6 people got out. It was Ambassador Ken Taylor who came up with the idea, the Canadian government that allowed these 6 to be issued passports and they were then returned home.<br/><br/>But that's not what this movie shows. No. It shows that Tony Mendez, played by Ben Affleck, was not only the mastermind of this but downplayed just about anything the Canadians did. Of course after a very Canadian, a.k.a. polite, dressing down by Ken Taylor Ben has since said that the Canadians did help much more than they did.<br/><br/>Having said that this is a good movie. There's some A-list actors in it. There's some great cinematography which shows that maybe Ben's skill lies behind the camera. There's some action scenes because you need action scenes today and there's a feeling of triumph when they finally get airborne and are off to freedom.<br/><br/>But that doesn't take away from the fact they played really fast and loose with the truth. It's like in U-571. It was the British that captured the Enigma machine but we need Americans to do it for an American audience because they don't like it when others are the heroes. And that's possibly the biggest flaw with this movie. Americans need to learn that they're not the greatest on the face of the planet and that other people have helped them along the way.<br/><br/>So thank you Canada for what you've done for us. I just wish this movie could have shown you in a better light."
"cheche1","Null","384","493","12 October 2012"," Good movie but took a lot of liberties
","This is a great movie. The story, acting, pacing, editing, etc. was just fantastic. Affleck's directing was solid, and the suspense will keep you entertained right through to the last seconds. I loved it. <br/><br/>It did have one irritating thing, though, kind of a big one. It pointed most of the accolades to Affleck's character and the CIA. This really was not true. It was Ken Taylor and the Canadians who really pulled 'the Canadian Caper' off so successfully.<br/><br/>""When Taylor heard a few years ago that Mendez had sold movie rights to his book (which, to be fair, is much more generous than the movie about Canada's role), ""I said, 'Well, that's going to be interesting.'....""The movie's fun, it's thrilling, it's pertinent, it's timely,"" he said. ""But look, Canada was not merely standing around watching events take place. The CIA was a junior partner.""<br/><br/>""The old postscript sent the message that, for political reasons, Canada took the credit. A sarcastic kicker noted that Taylor received 112 citations. The clear implication was that he did not deserve them.""(Sept/Oct., 2012, thestar.com)"".<br/><br/>So the USA does another revision on history here. I believe 'Argo' goes this far. Yes, it's based on a true story - the movie does it's best to allude that it sticks to technical accuracy. And it really does, in some ways. Historical pictures of flag burners, rioters, gate climbers, etc.. up against Argo film stills run by during the credits make it seem that the facts were adhered to down to the tiniest detail. In reality, it wasn't Tony Mendez or the CIA who were responsible for the success of this operation; actually they were barely there. <br/><br/>Since the movie premiered, Ben Affleck has added emphasis on the movie postscripts since then that gives kudos to the Canadians' role. This was after Ken Taylor politely complained, as a Canadian would tactfully do. But Affleck did this only after pressure from Taylor himself.<br/><br/>I can understand the need to spice up events to make them as exciting and entertaining as possible, don't get me wrong. But this film needs to let the audience know that more explicitly than it does, even after the changed postscripts.<br/><br/>Still, a really entertaining and riveting film, very well done, and easily worth seeing. As a matter of fact, don't miss it."
"jamesthealchemist","3","228","302","26 January 2013"," Based on the Truth?
","I am severely disappointed in this film for the main reason that we see US movie makers twisting the truth so that they come out looking like heroes. And I am not alone in this. The UK and French governments were quite rightly upset by the movie saying that their embassies had refused to help out the Americans in trouble. The UK embassy took the refugees in at great risk and kept them there until the Iranian guard was getting suspicious. Ben Affleck claims he had the refugees refused because he wanted them to appear to be isolated would be funny if it wasn't so clear that he actually wanted it to be the US who really saved them. At least the movie makers did have the Canadian embassy involved as it had been at the time. The movie should have said at the start that the facts had been changed in the name of drama. Movie makers have a responsibility when making movies based on the truth to let people know what really occurred. When they don't they are actually guilty of trying to change history and worse people believe what they see on the screen. And lastly seeing the guards at the airport chasing the jet in order to try and stop it was absurd. Why didn't they simply shoot at it or have the Iranian air-force force the jet to land. A joke of a movie so far removed from what actually happened and to say its 'based on the truth' really shows just how far the truth gets abused."
"woodiphora","2","301","405","9 December 2012"," Formulaic and historically inaccurate
","A reasonably competent movies from a technical point of view, but in other respects very misleading.<br/><br/>What I liked was Ben's restrained performance as the CIA field operative, and fun to see John Goodman in a straight role, but everything else was a bit lacking. Iran is an extraordinary, culturally rich and diverse country, but it is portrayed as populated entirely by thugs and fundamentalists, with the rest of the population invisible or cowering victims. I'm not being an apologist for a state with poor human rights and a dictatorial government - but it is not what is portrayed in this movie.<br/><br/>The basic fact that for a short period several American consulate workers were in hiding and were flown out under fake identities is true, but a lot is missed out. They first hid in the British consulate, but were moved to Canada House on British advice (as best as I can glean from various Internet sources), and the whole operation was a joint venture between at least three countries. What we get is a 'Yankwash.'<br/><br/>The film-makers have said that people forget that ""this is a movie"", and deliberate latitude and creativity is necessary for entertainment purposes to make it watchable and engaging. Okay, so if that is the case then what is left is formulaic: bad guys do something bad - maverick individual comes up with a daring plan - plan almost fails at the last minute - car chase - everyone alright now!<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but I just don't buy the excuses. This is a lazy way of film- making. The more accurate story could have been well told - with acceptable dramatic liberties such as condensing number of characters, timescales and even adding the (actually never happened) car-chasing-a- jumbo-jet-bit as they finally flee - without having to rewrite history t a degree that becomes offensive.<br/><br/>So, averagely enjoyable if it was fiction and a polished production from a acting and technical point of view, but a desperately inaccurate pastiche of what really happened - a great shame as the real story would have been just as good, if not better for being real."
"szezonmeister","2","563","833","25 November 2012"," Puzzling success for a disaster of a film
","I understand it may flatter US patriotism, or recall memories to those who remember the events and I don't even dispute Affleck's directorial and acting skills. However, this is a completely superfluous, empty and desperately predictable movie. The historical inaccuracy has been pointed out by several other reviews: no, things didn't happen that way, the Canadians deserve much more credit in that operation than this portrayal ever shows. Notwithstanding the role of the US in sustaining a puppet dictatorship during the Shah and actively interfering in a sovereign country's domestic politics for decades prior to the events. But this is only a secondary concern: historical accuracy is not the most important factor for a fiction, even when it's based on actual events. What I dispute is how incredibly shallow and predictable the storytelling is: cliché anonymous US CIA antihero agent with issues at home goes to a dangerous place, saves innocent lives, takes risks against orders, comes out victorious to reunite with his family. Who on Earth cares, seriously? And no, the fact that it's based on historical events - and therefore you can't argue with history - is not an answer precisely because the script takes so many liberties with the events. I don't care about the liberties taken with history but I care about the ability to portray convincingly the complexity of human emotions and relationships. There is none here. And make no mistake, a fictitious 2 min car chase at an airport is the closest you ll get to see some emotions (ie. anguish at being killed by the revolutionary guards). The characters come out of a cardboard factory, they have zero critical self-reflection about their own role in interfering with a foreign country's domestic affairs, total solidarity with each other and pure love for their partners. This is a Disney version of human psyche, a dishonest and partial historical account and a debauchery of time, energy and money ill spent. Affleck is an able actor and I hope will prove more convincing in his future efforts as a director, but what really baffles me is not the mediocrity of this film, it's the uncritical enthusiasm of so many for it."
"LordElrondd","4","84","119","12 February 2013"," Argo : PoliticalJust Political.
","This movie was so horrible that I can't even begin to describe it.<br/><br/>First, I'm going to break it down in 2 sections: the technical part and the historical aspect.<br/><br/>The Story was a mess and cliché. Such stories have been done so many times that 2 minutes within the movie you are able to guess every event and turnover that the story is going to take: An Unknown CIA agent who has troubles with his wife and family goes on a dangerous, life threatening mission to save the lives of Americans. In the process, he disobeys a direct order, accomplishes the mission, comes back home and gets a medal for it. And he is reunited with his family. And everyone lives happily ever after. The end.<br/><br/>That's the movie, summed up. And I can bet everyone can agree that it's a cliché and overdone story. <br/><br/>Other aspect is the historical aspect. I'm from Iran myself (but I don't live there now) so I know exactly what went down. Let me start by saying that the movie in fact IS a true story but it's not the WHOLE truth. They managed to ""forget"" some important notes that I'm sure lots of people noticed but chose to ignore it because of all the undeserved hype around the movie. First thing is that the U.S government could give up the Shah at any time and got the hostages back in a moment's notice. But they didn't. Why? Didn't the lives of 60 US citizens outweigh the life of a dictator who needed to be brought to justice? This was never mentioned. Secondly, the Canadians role; it's very popular among the people to call that mission ""Canadian Caper"". The Canadians had a HUGE role in this process. In fact they had the main role. They were the ones who issued REAL Canadian passports, they were the ones who arranged the flights and coordinated people within Iran. But we see their role cut down substantially to just the mere presents of the Canadian Ambassador. Thirdly, the movie fails to mention that the attack on the US embassy in Tehran was a result of decades of the US interference in Iran's politics and decision making; All the way from appointing prime ministers to staging coups. That's what drove the people to that point, and the film, once again fails to mention that. The film goes on to do what a typical Hollywood ""true story"" does. Dramatize actual events and make it into a Hollywood film. and a typical Hollywood ending scene (which never happened in real) <br/><br/>Once again, horrible, horrible movie. <br/><br/>Rating 4/10 : Only for the visual effects and production design which was adequate."
"nainfroid","2","233","348","28 November 2012"," Ben affleck can grow a beard
","I was watching this movie with 2 friends and none of us said anything until it was over. While I was watching it something was bothering me but I didn't say anything because I thought the other two were into it, Ben Affleck with a beard doing CIA stuff in 1980 Iran being a sort of archetype of what an cool movie should be these days...<br/><br/>Anyway I kept my mouth shut, and when the movie ended I looked at my two companions. They both seemed a little off, I couldn't tell if it was indifference or confusion or flat out boredom. One thing was clear though: this movie sucked.<br/><br/>First, at no point whatsover does one feel any connection and/or sympathy for the main character. Ben Affleck makes the SAME FACE during the entire movie, his eyes gazing in the distance and his mouth gaping ever so slightly, giving him an expression vaguely similar to what I imagine someone coming out of months of Electroshock Therapy would have. <br/><br/>I never saw how this 'acting' contributed to the 'character' in any way. In fact, there is almost no character to speak of, and you'd almost forget him if it weren't for the fact that he is in almost every scene of the movie.<br/><br/>Second (Spoiler I guess), even thought it started with a cool premise, the story unraveled poorly and I honestly didn't get the point. So what, they spent the whole movie training, all of it to get through a 5 minute scene at the customs where nothing really happens and another climatic 5 minute chase on the runway where clearly the car has no chance of stopping the plane, and in fact it doesn't, so there, the end? I mean, seriously?? <br/><br/>I can only imagine that this movie has such a good rating because most people haven't even bothered reviewing it. There was a bunch of other stuff I wanted to complain about but that movie was so bland that I forgot."
"doorsscorpywag","3","112","166","14 January 2013"," Argo F#ck Yourself
","Argo is not a particularly great film but tells an interesting story in a somewhat ironic fashion. Ironic because the central tenet of the tale is an imaginary movie and how Hollywood could create a lie to mask the rescue told in a way that is in itself as big a fantasy as the movie for that very rescue.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of Ben Affleck and enjoy his films and think he is a capable director. But sadly Argo is pretty dull and even the fake scenes made up to ratchet up any tension fall flat.<br/><br/>The acting is not particularly that good either. Not because the actors were at fault. Clea DuVall is a fine actress and Arkin and Goodman both excellent. But sadly the script does not give them a lot to work with. The fake scenes in the Canadian Ambassadors house are hardly riveting. Although we do get a bit of Led Zeppelin IV which showed they had some musical taste.<br/><br/>Afflecks character is pretty two dimensional with a bit of a sad family background thrown in to make us sympathetic. Sadly it does not work. The CIA look a bit more organised than Zero Dark Thirty but we do get the odd banging and shouting scenes at the climactic fake finale scene as they rush desperately to make the flight out of Iran.<br/><br/>That whole segment of the film was quite the worst part of the whole exercise and the shots of the Revolutionary Guard chasing the plane was frankly silly more than tense. Of course in reality they just turned up early in the morning and were waved with no fuss onto their escape flight and the movie cover was barely an aspect of the getaway.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the movie was how it makes a point that the British and New Zealand embassies turned away folks from the American embassy which was NOT remotely the case and both embassies played a part in keeping them safe. I understand that for the narrative and pace of the movie these facts were not addressed. But I don't understand why Affleck felt the need to lie about what these people did by saying they did NOT help. Why not just say nothing at all. I guess it is a sop to the uninformed American audience who like to think that their allies are so unreliable and it makes the American part in the rescue more important. <br/><br/>The Iranian's or Eyeranians as they have become known don't get much of a good deal either reduced to screaming lunatics rampaging around the streets hanging people from mobile cranes. But let's not forget how they ended up like this due to decades of Western interference. I am sure the vast majority of people there are decent enough folks. But America needs its boogie men and after all to be fair the hostage taking and probably rather frightening captivity of the other 50 odd Americans was not a fantasy. <br/><br/>Overall the lies and fantasy of Argo overwhelm the good parts of the tale and drag it into the realms of the nick of time Bourne type thriller without the car chases, shoot outs or cool martial arts fights.<br/><br/>Along with Zero dark Thirty and Lincoln another revisionist pap fest wrapped in red white and blue. Which is a shame as the real story was quite a decent tale on it's own but probably not as exciting."
"SampanMassacre","1","245","381","16 October 2012"," Dull and Overrated
","In a particular scene, one of the ""hostages"" (one of the escaped Americans from the taken-over Iranian Embassy) is looking outside the window of the safe house, and he sees, right on the street, a guy getting shot... The guy looking out the window has a blank expression, and this sums up the overall suspense and vibe of ARGO that, until the last twenty minutes when the characters are trying to silently escape through the airport, has little momentum and simply goes through the motions.<br/><br/>The aspect about the fake film, that will provide a cover to save the hostages, is rushed, and although Alan Arkin has funny lines, there are very few obstacles for the characters to get that fake movie going... One step to another, all the characters seem to sleepwalk through each scene where people sit behind desks and talk to each other.<br/><br/>Affleck's directing style is good, it looks good, but his performance is dull and listless... Much like those hostages that we are supposed to feel for but, with their horrendously distracting 1970's wigs and mustaches, they're just wallpaper in a wallpaper experience.<br/><br/>This is the most overrated movie of the last decade."
"CalRhys","Null","138","211","24 February 2013"," Intense Film Packed With Emotion
","Argo is the political thriller based on the 1979 Iranian hostage situation in which 6 Americans were left to fend for themselves in the centre of Tehran. CIA Operative Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck) is sent into Iran to evacuate the Americans out safely under the cover of being a film production crew working on a picture called 'Argo'.<br/><br/>The film is absolutely amazing and definitely one of the best films I've seen in a long time, throughout 2012 and 2013 so far we have been treated with some great films such as Skyfall, Django Unchained, Life of Pi, Les Miserables, Zero Dark Thirty and more, but in my own personal opinion Argo takes the bait as the best of them all. Proof is present as it won 3 BAFTA's for best picture, best director and best editing, also nominated for a further 8 Oscars in 85th Academy Awards.<br/><br/>The film is packed with a sense of threat, peril and intensity all portrayed exceptionally well through the ensemble cast including Ben Affleck (The Town), John Goodman (Big Lebowski), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), Alan Arkin (Edward Scissorhands) and Victor Garber (Titanic). The ending is by far the most intense ending I have seen in a long time, visually presented in such an astounding way.<br/><br/>Director Ben Affleck started out his auteur career after his directional debut Gone Baby Gone became critically acclaimed, three years later The Town came out with an Oscar nomination. Now 2 years on we have Argo, Affleck's best film by far."
"tercero","1","253","404","24 February 2013"," What a load of sh*t
","I can't believe how this piece of garbage has been hyped. It's a revisionist hunk of crap that only shows how out of touch Hollywood and the American public really are. The main character, Tony Mendez, was in Iran for 1 and half days. It was the Canadians who created the background story. It was the Canadians who issued the passports. It was Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor that took ALL of the risks. Yet, Ben Affleck seems to think if you tell a lie long enough and to enough stupid people, they'll believe it. After the fiasco that was U-571, you'd think Hollywood would have the decency not to go about spreading such misleading information. Apparently not. I'd give ARGO a zero if it were possible. It's disappointing that it's nominated for an Oscar. Argo - And Ben Affleck - You suck."

","It could not be more islamophobic if it tried. I am not saying the Iranian revolution was something pretty. It really wasn't. Here is a list of the disturbing in the portrayal of Iran in Affleck's Argo: -When the Iranian people spoke Farsi in the film there were no English subtitles. If an American spoke farsi there magically appeared subtitles. -Every single Iranian in the film was angry. This was the only emotion they could express. According to Argo all Iranians are hostile. -Showed no culture, not a single educated Iranian of there own right. There was one ""good"" Iranian who was a housekeeper to the Canadian ambassador. No character development at all, she serves her purpose and leaves. Apparently fled to Iraqi cause thats going to end well for her children. -The streets of Iran were made to look like the streets of hell. The streets are shown with either one of these characteristics 1. angry Iranian mob protesters who are in favour of the Khomeini 2. militia terrorizing and murdering it own citizens 3.objectified Iranian dead bodies.

"SpitfireIXB","3","48","71","24 February 2013"," A Very Misleading Movie - Garbage By Affleck
","Here we go again. This time a really exciting true story has been dumbed down with mostly fabrications by Ben Affleck and his writers for reasons unknown.<br/><br/>Argo claims to be an accurate account of the evasion and escape of six American embassy staff from Iran. Tag lines for the movie Argo state ""the movie was fake but the story is completely true."" Nothing could be further from the truth. Argo is as fake as the movie cover story in the true story and, in fact, this movie cover story was concocted by the Canadians not the CIA.<br/><br/>Argo is mostly a complete fabrication of the events surrounding the evasion and escape of the six American Embassy employees from Iran and not only deters from the exciting true story (see Escape From Iran, the Canadian Caper) but does a tremendous disservice to the staff of the Canadian embassy, especially the late John Sheardown. Mr. Sheardown was the first Canadian the Americans contacted for asylum and he and his wife, Zena, actually did hide some of the American evaders in their home in Tehran for almost three months. Yet, the late Mr. Sheardown and his wife are not even mentioned in the movie, Argo. Also, the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor and his wife were relegated to the role of mere overwrought, if not somewhat incompetent, bystanders. This is misleading in the extreme. Argo's original credits stated that the awards received by the Canadian Ambassador and his staff for their role in the evasion and escape were undeserved since it was a complete CIA operation. This is a lie. Ambassador Taylor called these postscript lines ""disgraceful and insulting"" and demeaning to the Canadians involved. This movie's claim that Canada was ""allowed to take credit"" for the operation because the escape plan was a secret CIA operation is also a misleading lie. Argo's claim that there was only some cursory help from the Canadians is a misleading fabrication.<br/><br/>U.S. President Jimmy Carter commented on the accuracy of the Argo story when he appeared on CNN recently (Thursday night, Feb 21, 2013). President Carter said: ""90 per cent of the contributions to the ideas and the consummation of the plan was Canadian, but the film gives almost full credit of the plan to the American CIA."" Also, in a recent address to Queen's University, President Carter called ""Argo"" a complete distortion of what happened. He stated: ""I saw the movie Argo recently and I was taken back by its distortion of what happened because almost everything that was heroic, or courageous or innovative was done by Canada and not the United States."" Argo's claim that it was a completely a CIA operation is untrue and an insult to the Canadians who helped the Americans to evade capture and escape from Iran. The Canadian exit visas and passports issued to the Americans were forgeries made on authentic documents and passports that were supplied by the Canadian government not the CIA. In truth, the CIA agent was actually in Iran for less then 36 hours and he was not even at the airport when the Americans exited Iran. It was the Canadian Ambassador, his wife, and his staff who smuggled the Americans through Iranian controls and checkpoints and onto the departing flight at Tehran airport.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck must apologize to The Canadian Ambassador; the ambassador's wife; the late John Sheardown's widow, Zena Sheardown; and all the other Canadian Embassy staff members who made the escape of the six Americans from Iran possible. Also, Mr. Affleck should then apologize to all Canadians. I was going to say Argo-f**k yourself to Mr. Affleck but why bother.<br/><br/>From a technical point, the cinematography is very good and with several exceptions, the cast was adequate. However, Argo's script is something you should not put aside lightly, it should be thrown with great force.<br/><br/>This story needs to be remade, perhaps using the script from ""Escape From Iran - The Canadian Caper"" and not turned into some mindless drivel that is represented by the movie Argo. The true story of the evasion and escape of the six Americans from Iran is so exciting and full of tension that it would definitely keep you on the edge of your seat, unlike Argo which is full of something else.<br/><br/>3/10 stars for the cinematography only."
"tangcy9","1","59","90","3 March 2013"," A very shallow movie
","I watched Argo last night and was very disappointed. It is just a typical Hollywood commercial movie. It is probably entertaining, but definitely not thought-provoking. The directing is just so so. That explains why Ben Affleck did not get nominated for best director. It should not be given the best picture, either. Among the 9 movies nominated, I have watched Lincoln, Les Miserables, Django Unchained, and Life of Pi besides Argo. I must say Argo is the worst one. After 10 years people won't remember it as a must-see in life. <br/><br/>I watched the Italian movie The Unknown Woman on TV before going to the theater for Argo yesterday. Obviously the Unknown Women is far more superior to movies like Argo."

"jdneukom","2","49","74","13 February 2013"," Criminally Overrated
","Where to even begin? Maybe with the positives?<br/><br/>Well, I found the pacing to be pretty good, and this film wasn't an overlong snooze-fest like Lincoln, so that made it somewhat entertaining. Some of the camera work was very good--I really liked some of the shots they took. Bryan Cranston was amazing in his role--it made me want his character to be the lead actually. Alan Arkin also shone in his role. Finally, the editing was good and is rightfully nominated for an Oscar.<br/><br/>SPOILERS!<br/><br/>All of the other Oscar nominations are pure folly. Best Picture? Absolutely not. Really? A more boring Oceans 11 meets the streets of Tehran is good enough for Best Picture these days? How sad is that? Best Screenplay? So, turning an interesting, real-life caper into a droll, boring, formulaic Hollywood movie is a good thing? The dialogue was generally trash when Goodman and Arkin weren't delivering one-liners. At no point did any character say anything about themselves or their situation that felt like it actually mattered or had any impact. Best Sound? Seriously? In a movie that has a soundtrack populated with Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, and Scottish bagpipes? Sure, real original....You can go to any college bar in America and hear that soundtrack. Did America's movie establishment collectively snort a few lines of PCP-laced coke before watching this? Is that how it came to be such a great experience?<br/><br/>As for the picture itself, aside from the nominations, this played quite fast and loose with actual historical facts, which is kind of a no-no when doing a film based on reality. To divide the credit 95:5 USA:Canada is about a 50-point swing from where it probably should be, and Canadian reviewers have said as much. Also, the fact that Iranians are writing in that they feel the need to say they are not from Attila and the Hun and they aren't all bloodthirsty psychos bent on pillaging and murdering is pretty telling. Hollywood hasn't produced a film so stereotypically wrong about a whole race of people for, what, 3 months? I mean, Persian culture developed mathematics for crying out loud! Yet, this group of people has no more human qualities now than territorial apes? The fact that this was set in Tehran, which makes Iranians kind of important to the story and not a SINGLE Iranian is portrayed with any shred of a conscience is deeply troubling. The pigeonholing of Iranians as barbarians and Canadians like a little, ineffectual brother is absurd.<br/><br/>I was struggling with the fact that the movie would have been so much better had Ben Affleck's character actually been played by Chuck Norris! That says something (and not that I'm a fan of Walker, Texas Ranger which I'm not). The worst part, aside from 35 minutes of Affleck-face screen time, was the meeting he went to and completely shredded everyone's ideas (which were stupid, but...no one had any other ideas, seriously? In an intelligence agency?). He subsequently proposed something so preposterous that no intelligence agency would EVER have green-lighted it, except for that it actually happened...hmmm...HOW? Maybe some more background about how this proposal made it through! Surely, that's not still classified at this point. This is how you immerse your audience in the story, Ben, you need to be stronger with the details--and give history buffs a reason to say, ""hmmm, that's something I didn't know!""<br/><br/>TL;DR: As for my rating being 2/10, which may seem overly harsh, well, an OK movie, technically, was ruined by historical pandering, a suspense-less caper that was oh so predictable, and a series of implausible action scenes with virtually no action in them. That this and Lincoln will be duking it out for many Oscars really makes me happy that I don't go to the cinema all that often anymore."
"nazgulero_0","1","67","106","23 February 2013"," Beyond bad...
","This movie is so bad, I don't even know where to start. None of it makes any sense. Many basic movie making mistakes make it look like it is done by an amateur film crew. A guy waving a burning US flag, and it is more than obvious that it is CGI burn. An Iranian woman running towards the camera and looking directly into the camera, not even angry, but clearly having fun. In the next shot, from the side, she is gone. That is basic continuity. The head of security for the US embassy out of the blue decides to open the door to 'reason with these people', only to be taken hostage within 5 microseconds. That is beyond stupid. The entire film crew plot never makes any sense and is never put to work, as everything comes down to a security guard at the airport by accident reading about the filming of the movie. Right. What are the chances of him having a magazine on his table, and accidentally stumbling upon just that article ? The guard then calls the office in LA, which had already been shut down, but Goodman and Arkin for some inexplicable reason HAVE to go there in a hurry, even at the expense of ruining the shooting for another movie. What do they want in that office, and why the hurry ? The final car chase at the airport is the low point. There is no way an open jeep can keep up with a commercial airliner at full takeoff speed. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Just another Ben Affleck ego trip, as we are treated to many, many closeups of his face."

","Honestly, I came into this movie with so-so expectations as the trailer I saw in a different movie made me give myself a 50% chance to watch it, up in the air if you will. But from the moment the movie began up until the end, I was gripping for the characters the whole way, the way movies should be.<br/><br/>The opening of the movie played a huge part in setting the tone of the rest of the film. As I had no history or prior knowledge to the events that transpired in Iran in the 1980s, the brief amount of a history lesson was just enough to maintain my interest. Throughout the film, there are times when I might have started to wander through long bouts of dialog, but witty comments by the characters kept me entertained. By the time the climax was about to hit, I was sitting on the edge of my seat, biting at my fingers, awaiting their next move.<br/><br/>Well done Ben, well done."

A propaganda film at its best (which is not much considering that Kristen Stewart probably has more acting skill than Ben Affleck) It just seems to gloss over the fact that it was America and its allies were the real VILLAINS who put Iran under the rule of the puppet master in the coup in the first place, so they could exploit the country and stop it from progressing. This was just the people taking back their country. if the same puppet had threatened America in any way, they would have gone after him like they did to Iraq, Afghanistan, (Insert name of Muslim country here).

Then we see many images of children ( the dialogue in the film is ""sweat shop kids"") putting together the images of the 6 people so that they can get captured - and tortured and ""have their nails pulled out"" - This dialogue comes from the film.<br/><br/>So, I don't want to go on with this and I hope you've got an idea for why I do not like this film."

"gregsrants","8","187","352","9 September 2012"," Get Ready To Hear ""Argo for Best Picture""
","No movie being showcased by this year's Toronto International Film  Festival caught our interest as much as Ben Affleck's directorial  follow up to The Town. Argo, based on a true story and starring  Affleck, Bryan Cranston, John Goodman and Adam Arkin, tells the  astonishingly true story of how a CIA exfiltration specialist attempts  to free six Americans who have taken shelter in the home of the  Canadian Ambassador during the Iranian hostage crisis.  The story opens on November 4, 1979 when Islamist militants took  control of the U.S. Embassy in Iran. 52 Americans were taken hostage  and held for 444 days until their eventual release. But six American's  were able to sneak out of the Embassy and find refuge unbeknownst to  the Iranian rebels. The CIA, lead by agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck)  hatched a plan to rescue the house entrapped Americans by posing as  producers of a fictional science fiction film. The idea was that Mendez  would land in Iran and then convince the six Americans to assume roles  as screenwriters, directors and co-producers of the film and they would  all fly out of the country together once location scouting was complete  in 48 hours.  In an effort to have the mission legitimized, Mendez recruited  Hollywood producer Lester Siegel and Special Effects man John Chambers  to green-light the script and give the entire project credibility.  If the entire notion of the plan sounds like something that only  Hollywood could come up with  well, you're half right. But Affleck  sticks to the facts of the true events and ravels a bite-your-nails  type thriller that is guaranteed to be rewarded with year-end  nominations for Best Picture, Best Director and most certainly Best  Supporting Actor for Alan Arkin.  Every note, every frame of Argo looks authentic. Affleck, who received  incredible support for his last directorial effort, The Town, ups the  ante and films Argo with the confidence of a maestro at the top of his  game.  The movie shifts between locations of Iran, Hollywood and both the CIA  Headquarters and even the White House in this brilliantly crafted  adventure. Each scene and character oozes with atmosphere and purpose  and Affleck confidently and flawlessly directs himself as the expected  hero of the film  a man who risks his own life and career for the  lives of six strangers.  Towards the concluding chapters of the film, audiences are sure to be  on the edge of their seats  even if they are aware of the historically  recorded outcome (shades of Apollo 13). Once the rescue attempt his its  apex, the audience at the Toronto screening erupted in an applause  never before experienced by this reviewer in his thousands of  theatrical screenings. That reaction is a testament to Affleck's  direction that grabbed audiences by the emotional drawstrings keeping  us involved in our character's fates and caring for their safe return.  Argo is not only an important piece of history that many of us were  completely oblivious  but it is also one of the better films of this  or the past few years."
"rgblakey","10","253","485","12 October 2012"," Affleck delivers another amazing film
","After years of being one of those actors that was hit and miss with people, who would have thought he would become one of the most sought after great directors in the industry. After his last film The Town received so much acclaim and award nominations everyone was wondering if it was just a fluke. His latest film Argo takes on the actual events during the Iran Hostage Crisis finds him once again taking on double duties with directing and starring, but can he bring these events to life and create another great film along with it? <br/><br/>Argo follows the unbelievable true story of six Americans that have found shelter with the Canadian ambassador in Iran when the revolution reaches a boiling point. The CIA works alongside some heavy hitters in Hollywood to create a fake film production to concoct a risky plan to try and get them out of the country. For a movie that focuses on a situation that was so dire and heavy, this film comes off a bit lighter than expected. Ben Affleck has crafted a brilliantly entertaining film on numerous levels. The story alone is intriguing watching their unbelievable plan come to life. During this time of the film it delivers some really funny moments, without falling to far off track and confusing the kind of film this is. The acting here is top notch with everyone involved, including Affleck himself delivering some awesome performances. The dynamic between Affleck and Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston is perfect creating a duo that both entertain as well as keep this story on track. The biggest treat in this film are brilliant and a lot of time funny performances from John Goodman and Alan Arkin. These guys really bring all the Hollywood aspect to the film to life while delivering Oscar worthy performances that will hopefully be recognized. The gritty look to this film really helps to capture the vibe and tone of the film while combined with the attention to detail, helps take you into the time period it takes place.<br/><br/>Brilliant directing, acting, story and some fun sci-fi references throughout takes Argo into the realm of one of the best films to come along in some time. Affleck proves once again of his talent as a director and that The Town was no fluke. This is a must see film that will no doubt be all-the buzz when award season comes around and deserves every bit of it."

","""We had suicide missions in the Army that had better odds than this."" Lester (Alan Arkin) <br/><br/>Although the historical events depicted in Argo for extricating six embassy employees from Iran during the infamous 444 day hostage debacle may not have happened just as director Ben Affleck and writer Chris Terrio depict them, the movie is an edge-of-the-seat thriller done better than any other film of its kind this year. The above quotation by Lester, a Hollywood producer recruited for the gamble, captures the danger and promise of the escapade.<br/><br/>The reason for my A- rather than A is the ending escape sequence, which is pure Hollywood, preposterous and entertaining. If you're not rooting for the personnel to get away, then you must be an old timer who worked for fundamentalist Islam's Ayatollah Khomeini.<br/><br/>The strategy devised by Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) was called the ""Hollywood Option,"" and more to the point, the ""best bad idea,"" a bold masquerade in which Mendez and the six were disguised as Canadian filmmakers seeking a location for a low-budget sci-fi film. The tension, expertly maintained by director Affleck, rests almost solely on whether or not their fiction is uncovered. Affleck underplays Mendez in a posture necessary for remaining cool in the face of Iranian authorities seeking Americans to hang.<br/><br/>Besides evoking the late seventies' dorky fashions of ubiquitous mustaches, long hair, and large glasses, Argo recreates the volatile environment of world affairs when relief from Vietnam did not mean relief from rogue governments like Iran's, as the condemnation of Salman Rushdie has taught well. Every Iranian bureaucrat and soldier carries a hidden threat in beards and bearing. At the airport, the multiple check points ramp up the anxiety, enhanced no doubt by our experiences with post 9/11 TSA.<br/><br/>If you're disappointed by that Hollywood ending, wait for the post-credits sequence, which juxtaposes photos of Tehran at the time with the film's stills. If that bit of realism doesn't satisfy you, then enjoy the superior acting of John Goodman as make-up artist John Chambers and Arkin. Now that's the real Hollywood."

","ARGO, directed by and starring Ben Affleck, receiving rave reviews all across the board, has the makings of a great story – not only because it's a true one. Declassified by the CIA since the nineties, dealing with the 1979 Iran Hostage Crisis, it's not the Embassy hostages we're centering on. There were six people who silently escaped the takeover, hiding in the Canadian ambassador's house. The CIA is at a loss – they have only one idea concerning bicycles and it's not very bright.<br/><br/>Enter Affleck's Tony Mendez: we first see him waking up with an empty beer can on his dresser, so he's got the makings of the typical maverick hero. While watching BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES on TV, he has an idea – become a producer of a bogus science fiction movie and, scouting a location in Iran, get the Americans out. A fantastic premise and an opportunity to blend classic cult films with a modern thriller And with John Goodman (as a makeup artist) and Alan Arkin (as a wry producer) on board the Hollywood end, ARGO just can't miss but it does.<br/><br/>The six people that need saving have zero personality, making it hard to feel for their plight. Although we see clips of hangings and executions in Iran, there's hardly a feeling of impending danger or threat. While the clever aspects, mixing a fake press conference for the sci-fi flick with Iranians making real demands, are edited nicely, the movie-making scheme, which had so much potential, feels rushed. And Affleck himself lacks the edge of a central character, much less a heroic one.<br/><br/>The best part is the last half hour as the seven (including Mendez), using fake passports as a Canadian production crew, move through an Iranian airport for the departing plane. Despite every ""last minute"" cliché thrown in the pot, as least there's some urgency. But with a lack of interesting or involving characters leading to the escape, ARGO falls short of the immense hype.<br/><br/>For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com"

","Creating suspense when a movie's outcome is pre-ordained is a high art. ""Lincoln"" (2012) did it. ""Flight 93"" did it. ""Apollo 13"" did it. ""Flags of Our Fathers"" did it. What they shared in common what great characterization. ""Argo,"" on the other hand, is almost solely about the narrative. What little characterization in the script is extremely pedestrian, and none of the hostage actors (except for Tate Donovan) has the chops to infuse it with credibility and empathy.<br/><br/>The casting problem extends to Affleck himself. Always a piece of wood on camera, he again simply speaks his lines rather than embodies them (the scene where the CIA scuttles plan A excepted). Plus, since the movie went to great pains in the credits to show how physically similar the actors were to their real-life counterparts, why didn't Affleck get a portly, curly-haired Latino (Luiz Guzman comes to mind) to play Tony Mendez? The movie could have been more interesting if the story line had followed the actual events of the embassy workers being shuttled from the UK embassy to the Canadian embassy and receiving help from the New Zealand and Denmark embassy staffs. Then, I could have forgiven the hokey and completely fictitious climax. As it was, though, I nodded off a few times prior to the airport scene and simply didn't care at that point whether the hostages pulled off their caper.<br/><br/>Like the pasta boiling, this movie needed some zesty sauce to be more than limp and bland."

It is filled with A-list actors such as Alan Arkin, John Goodman, Victor Garber, and Bryan Cranston who each contribute to this incredibly moving film, which is based on a declassified true story.<br/><br/>It takes place during the Iranian revolution of 1979 and 1980 in Tehran. More than sixty Americans from the US embassy were held as hostages, but six of them escaped and were hiding out in the home of the Canadian ambassador (Garber). Tony Mendez (Affleck), a CIA extraction specialist, came along to concoct a plan to rescue these six Americans.<br/><br/>After speaking to his son while watching a movie one night, Mendez had a creative yet genius idea. He and the escaped hostages would pretend to be the film crew of a new sci-fi movie called ""Argo"". With the help of Hollywood makeup artist John Chambers (Goodman) and producer Lester Siegel (Arkin), this fake crew made their story quite credible.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck did a spectacular job directing this film, which pretty faithfully follows such an unbelievable story. Every actor is convincing as his/her character and the cast was impeccably chosen. Make sure you stay in the theater to watch the credits. You'll see some real photographs and clips that mirror Affleck's film and actors.<br/><br/>""Argo"" is basically only rated R for language, making it appropriate for most teens, in my opinion. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, whether you're an adult who remembers watching this on TV or you're a kid who doesn't know anything about politics. It is extremely dramatic, exciting, and heart wrenching, but also hilarious on many occasions. When the movie ends, the entire audience applauds and cheers.

The story, which falls perfectly into the category of you-can't-make-this-kind-of-thing-up, is based upon Tony Mendez's rescue of six isolated US diplomats out of Iran, during the time of the Iranian hostage crisis of 1980, through the means of creating a fake film production as cover.<br/><br/>Director Ben Affleck proves here just how incredibly mature and restrained a filmmaker he's become, molding what is inherently a political story, yet wisely setting aside the politics. He masterfully handles the changes in tone very fluidly, from one moment being edge of your seat tension, to the next of inspired comic relief. It brings back memories of 70's thrillers, when craft and entertaining went together hand-in-hand.<br/><br/>The cast of veteran character-actors is worth the price of admission alone. Nearly every speaking role is occupied by a recognizable face, with the likes of Philip Baker Hall, Bob Gunton, Michael Parks, Kyle Chandler, John Goodman, Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and more. This is easily the best cast of 2012 and, better yet, they all brought out there A game.<br/><br/>'Argo' is not a film to miss, its subject matter being more relevant than ever and will be a major contender come award season (and deservedly so.)<br/><br/>9/10 -Pycs"

","This is a good movie which probably would have been an even better movie if the story had been based on actual facts. The operation to smuggle out the six Americans was primarily a Canadian, not American, action and the lead hero was the Canadian ambassador who protected the Americans and then arranged for them to leave the country. This is not to say that the United States had no role, because it did, but contrary to the movie, it were the Canadians who took the lead. Also, the fact that the American official sent to escort the Americans was Hispanic is not even mentioned, which would have added another dimension to the story. The movie also demonizes the Iranians who are portrayed as little more than uncontrollable rabble, when in fact, what happened in 1979 was the culmination of a long series of grievances harbored by many Iranians against the United States. This does not mean that the Iranians should be excused for what they did when they stormed the embassy, which was a blatant violation of international law governing the protection of embassies, and for which the Iranian government must be held to account, but their actions must be examined within a larger historical and political context, something which the movie to its credit alludes to, but does not incorporate more fully into the story. Ben Affleck gives an excellent performance as the CIA person and the story moves forward at a brisk pace with a lot of tension and excitement; it's a good movie. But it's not a documentary."

","Few films have angered me more than this entirely predictable, utterly facile and dreadfully formulaic piece of Hollywood excrement. The only advantage gained from wasting an evening witnessing it was a fuller appreciation of the systemic corruption within the media industry that threatens to award it several Oscars.<br/><br/>The faults are obvious and well documented. The events concerned are ridiculously exaggerated as the most exciting incident actually occurring was the provision of wrongly dated visas by the CIA who didn't appreciate that Iran had a different calendar to the West. Otherwise the whole operation was largely mundane. The main contribution by the CIA had been the provision of fake passports and visas whilst it was the Canadians who were most pivotal in the execution of the project. Naturally Hollywood did not wish to publicize this inconvenient truth about the matter.<br/><br/>But the film itself is equally mundane. Ben Affleck is arrogantly wooden and the hostages appear to be more cartoon stereotypes than actual people in that situation. All suspense is lost as we know from the outset what the outcome will be and to be frank I found it difficult to remain awake for the duration.

It is important to make sure that most of the audience was not alive when the events occurred - just stress the few cultural references that they know and give a slide show at the end to convince them how real it all was. And add a one sentence disclaimer so that all those friends that did help aren't too offended.<br/><br/>I personally prefer the first two types of film that either give credit to the very real people who actually did risk their very real lives or be honest with the audience that this is make-believe.<br/><br/>Or at the very least - make something that can stand on its own without having to pretend that most of it actually happened."

One side is a good one and wants to save fugitives from certain death and second side is a bad one and wants to kill them as being spies. Totally cliché. The plot is shallow, barren, predictable and after while becomes boring. I don't think that the events described in the movie really happened this way and are authentic. Many countries protested about it (Iran, Great Britain, New Zeland and even Canada) so the storyline is very disputable. Acting was in the background cause the purpose of the movie was patriotic. Ben Affleck acting skills are weak as always. Alan Arkin and John Goodman are great actors as always but hadn't chance to show more themselves cause the script is barren. Directing is disputable and you may not like it. If you expected to see a good and realistic political drama watch ""Syriana"". This movie is not what you were expected to be.

","""Early in the morning on Sunday, January 27, 1980, Mendez, ""Julio"", and the six American diplomats, traveling with real Canadian passports and forged entry documents, made it easily through security at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport""<br/><br/>That's the real story according to Wikipedia. They easily boarded the aircraft and they left! Was it based on chance? I'm sure it was to some extent. To an audience of year 2012 the whole thing looks like a huge high adrenaline gamble with 1/100 chance of success but considering that year 1980 was 25 years away from the dawn of information age, it was absolutely possible to easily fake everything and get out of the country with aid of an insider at airport. I have no problem with dramatizing a simple true event in order to make an appealing movie out of it and that's what Chris Terrio did exactly, following all the clichés of Hollywood but somehow the end product came out to be the worst possible story. Here is why:<br/><br/>1. I have no respect for CIA but I do not believe that they are stupid otherwise God helps us all. Since they are not stupid, they would never approve of a mission heavily relying on luck. This mission as odd as it looked, had reasonable chance of success with aid of a local agent to place fake entry papers at airport and I'm sure they had such aid and for obvious reasons, they just ditched him out of the screenplay (and the public story of the true event). Without that local agent, that would be a suicide mission as pictured in the movie and I'm sure no one in Washington would approve such mission. ""If they are going to die, let them die in streets of Tehran, it's much less embarrassment for us""... this would be their logic.<br/><br/>2. We are talking about Tehran's International Airport in the year 1980. Passengers boarded on the plane? fine, they are still in Iran. call the airport administration and ask them to revoke the clearance of the flight. It takes time? Plane took off? Fine! Ask air force to intercept. It normally takes an hour and half for a 747 to get out of Iranian airspace. Bottom line, provided that we accept what pictured in the movie was what actually happened, they had ZERO chance of success after exposure at Tehran's airport.<br/><br/>3. They managed to reconstruct an imitation of Tehran with computer but almost all of the real time street scenes were shot in Istanbul. Iranian cities have very distinct architecture. You can shot a movie in Istanbul and claim that it was Cairo or Damascus but that doesn't work for Tehran. If you want to picture Tehran or other Iranian cities, you have 2 ways. either you go there or recreate them with computer using the thousands of clips available on Youtube as your reference.<br/><br/>Besides what was mentioned, I would say the main problem with the movie was lack of a descent villain. It doesn't matter how stupid the whole idea is as long as it is presented appropriately. The revolutionaries and hostile situation are not considered as villains. A single person should represent them as villain. A person who presents from the very beginning of the movie till very end were he is defeated (or wins) as the final resolve. I like to know who was the story consultant! Overall it was a flat boring movie from start to finish. The screenplay was awful, horrible dramatization of real events, relying all on chance, it could be emotionally involving for the people who were involved with the hostage situation but absolutely not emotionally involving for ordinary audience. BTW! What happened to Julio? The other guy who were supposed to be with Mendez?????<br/><br/>This is not a movie I recommend someone to waste his time on. If you haven't seen it, just move on!"

","The timing of this film is highly suspicious as reported by Patrice Greanville of The Greanville Post: ""Appearing in late 2012, prior to the US presidential election, and in the midst of an all-out propaganda campaign to demonize Iran and take America to war against that long-victimized country (a stealthy dirty war of sabotage and assassination has been waged against Iran for quite some time now by NATO assets and the Mossad, with probably ample support from the Gulf royal mafia), the film can only add fuel–what else–to the flames. This film, under the guise of a thriller, can only exacerbate anti-Iranian feeling in America and elsewhere, and, in passing, perhaps as an unwitting bonus, give the sinister CIA a cuddly wink of approval. Which is exactly what you'd expect from nincompoop liberals like Affleck and Clooney."" This film is also a whitewashing of CIA history. No, the CIA is not a force for good. CIA officers are not cool. There's nothing exciting or honorable about imperialism."

","This review may be coming a little bit late, considering i saw the movie back in November, but i wanted to check one or two things before i write it.I wanted to see whether or not the movie will receive any Academy awards buzz from the the Golden Globes and the various Guild awards.I wanted to wait, because i could not believe the hype surrounding it.I saw it, and i was not that impressed at all.So after some amount of time has passed and the seven Academy nominations have been announced, i thought it was time for a second viewing, in order to try and change my mind about the movie, but-no.<br/><br/>First of all, i enjoyed Gone Baby Gone and The Town of Affleck's repertoire much more than i did with Argo.I would even recommend Zero Dark Thirty (Bigelow's recent take on historical events, that are important to American society)ahead of Argo.That being said, Affleck's based-on-true-story-sci-fi-flick has it's strenghts.<br/><br/>The fact that the movie is solid enough and that a thorough enough background-check on the events depicted in it, are made, admittedly do the movie some justice.It's well and accurately written, but a nomination is as far as it can stretch itself.Never mind the fact that Affleck is still weaker in front of the camera, than he is behind it, this is clearly visible.One might even wonder how he has that experience as an actor and as a director and be so far ahead with the material when at the helm of a movie.<br/><br/>So, the era is accurately depicted, even the jokes, sets, clothing, music-all fits the bill, although Led Zeppelin's When the Levee Breaks is probably 10-12 years earlier, thus not from this period.But i'm willing to close my eyes on this one, considering the love i have towards Plant&co.On that subject, Aerosmith and Dream On were more accurately chosen, although only for the trailer.<br/><br/>The technical part of the movie was almost excellent, i mean there isn't any breakout aspect to put in the running for some awards (although some people obviously think there is), all in all everything was good enough.Maybe only William Goldenberg can get a nod over the others, but he'll have stiff competition from his other movie, Zero Dark Thirty and himself.As this is pretty evident by now, he has two nominations in one category for two different movies.So, it will be pretty interesting to see which movie do the critics hold in higher regard-this category will tell.For me, that should be ""Zero"".<br/><br/>So, technically good, historically accurate, even a little tense, so what's the matter, you might ask.Very simple.Contrary to popular belief, that has been planted in most people's minds, there actually was no acting in this movie.Not a single part was properly played by nobody, including you, Mr. Arkin.I can't understand where did this nomination come from, but in my eyes it is totally undeserved.Arkin and Goodman were of course fine, fun to watch, but the parts they played, others have played so long ago and to a better extend.When we start off with Sunset Blvd. and stop at present-day Hank Moody, there are people much more prepared to the challenges of playing a movie guy.Arkin was fine, but for 10 minutes of screen time you just can't receive that kind of reception and you just can't make this big of an impact.It is not normal.Not that they are, those awards and guild-members.<br/><br/>So, if i have to sum it up in a nutshell-the screenplay was good enough, the directing was decent as well, the acting was stiff at best (i'm looking at you, Ben), the era was pretty impressively(although inaccurately story-wise) depicted (still looking at you, Ben), the technical part was top-notch (William Goldberg), but all in all this does not make up for the ""masterpiece"" many of you claimed it to be.<br/><br/>If i had to recommend it, i would, simply because of it's must-see- based-on-true-story(although if we have to go there, discussing how accurate it really is, we'd be in for a long night) factor.But, as i said earlier, i'm not that impressed and there is nothing all that much to be impressed with.And Best Picture?No way!!<br/><br/>My rate: 6.5/10"

","Americans like redoing wars in movies – and they do not avoid the lost wars. The hostage crisis in 1979 which cost president Carter a second presidential mandate was not exactly a war, but a conflict generated by the departing paths of the Iran in revolution after the overthrow of the Shah and on its way to become an Islamic Republic and the United States government which supported for many decades the old regime. One rescue mission went terribly wrong, but this is not the one shown in Argo but the lesser known and successful one in which six employees who escaped the embassy when events started and were hidden in the house of the Canadian ambassador were taken out of Iran, under the false identities of Canadians working for a Hollywood movie. As with the Rambo series for example, the story is first of all a pretext for action entertainment, and a way of making audiences feel better about a problematic episode in the American history. Same as with Rambo, success with audiences and in this case also with critics (which I am a little surprised) was achieved, but this does not make in my opinion for good cinema, and of course does not really change history.<br/><br/>Does it matter that the film is inspired by a true story? That's an interesting question, and I would say that the answer is to a large extent No. It is not really the factual truth that matters when you watch a fiction movie, but the artistic news. Reality sometimes exceeds imagination, but art is first of all about imagination, and not necessarily about the imagination of the makers but of the one of the receivers, the viewers in the case of movies. The analysis on the Internet show discrepancies between the real events and the story on screen – this is not what bothers me but the result. The final chase for example between the Iranian police cars and the commercial airplane taking off would fit fine a James Bond or Mission: Impossible film, but not one labeled a true story. There was enough material in the story for a much deeper psychological processing, both of the CIA and other people involved in the plot, and of the American confined in the Canadian ambassador's house and waiting for the rescue. Ben Affleck and the other authors of the film went for the broader audiences using the action film tools and inflating the role of the Hollywood producers and of the Americans in general in the whole story. It was a fair and legitimate choice which probably improved the rating, but did not in my opinion make the film better.<br/><br/>I do not like Ben Affleck as an actor. He inspires me dullness in most of the roles he takes, simply made me lose interest in more than a few characters I saw him acting. This is the case here as well. I am not inspired by his Tony Mendez, I cannot distinguish his hero from many other similar action movies heroes, I never got his motivation for making the tough decision of going rogue in order to save lives and accomplish his mission, his divorcée and remote father background is as banal as it can be in the script and Ben Affleck the actor does not pour any life in it. Actually as a director and script author he may be more interesting, his director hand is sure and witty, and as an action movie director he is above average. His image of the 70s is precisely executed, with the help of costumes and sets artists and despite use of stereotypes (like excessive smoking). As with many other of his films Argo promises more than it delivers."

"keobeo-taylor","4","5","6","11 October 2014"," Solidly entertaining but another example of US historical revisionism
","Let me start by saying as a piece of entertainment Argo is very good. Good acting, good editing, great music and solid direction by Ben Affleck and some great casting (The actors are almost splitting images of the real people concerned, see the films end credits) The attention to visual detail is superb. The reason I'm only giving this film a 4 star rating is the historical inaccuracies. The film only as a postscript acknowledges the Canadian input into the hostage rescue, and this was only added to the film after a test screening. OK the final tense scenes at the airport never happened in real life and that is excusable as it adds nail biting tension to the drama but to depict the rescue as solely a CIA endeavor is inexcusable. This is American cinema at its most disrespectful and nearly as bad as the historical re-write in the film U571 where the Americans claimed to have captured the German Enigma machine whereas in reality the British captured it. Entertainment is an important release in these troubled times but keeping historical accuracy in films is more important IMO. The real story is a triumph over multi national cooperation and has enough meat to make a great film, so why alter the facts? Argo is a good entertaining story but could have been a classic film without the stars & stripes BS."

","The film starts with the title card ""Based on a True Story"". Yes, you can base a film on a true story and then fictionalize parts of it. But it is another thing to add way too many obvious tension-building fabrications to suggest that their escape was inches away from doom. Aside from these implausibilities within the manipulative plot, this movie jumps with energy by wise dialogue and quick pacing. <br/><br/>Many things are done with assured direction that is easy to see why it was nominated for many Academy Awards. There is sharp exchanges between government entities. Using the ""E.R."" template, all these conversations take place in motion while the characters are en route to somebody's office or some other place. This type of staging is effective in propelling this risky drama in the backdrop of the hate-fueled protests in Iran in the late 1970s. I also enjoyed the tension-filled early technology, when a phone was still leashed to a wall inside a room. <br/><br/>But these spoilers had me groaning<br/><br/>I wonder if the potential hostages had to really parade themselves through a busy marketplace as part of their disguise. I really wish it was true that the CIA pulled the plug by deliberately removing the flight reservations (why??), and leave a CIA operative stuck in Iran empty-handed. I really wish it was true that the housekeeper of the Canadian embassy was interrogated as the Americans were heading to the airport. Or that one of the dozens of students piecing together shredded photos recognised one of the Americans as they were boarding the airplane. Or that police vehicles were chasing down the 747 as it was lifting off. <br/><br/>.End Spoilers<br/><br/>I really wish it was true that this winner of Best Picture earned it's stripes by the authenticity of this caper, based on a true story.

","The film is so integrated into the propaganda system, that its subliminal warning of Iran's ""threat"" offered as Obama is preparing, yet again, to attack Iran. That Affleck's ""true story"" of good-guys-vs-bad-Muslims is as much a fabrication as Obama's justification for his war plans is lost in PR-managed plaudits. As an independent working journalist, I say that 'Argo' is ""a propaganda movie in the truest sense, one that claims to be innocent of all ideology."" That is, it debases the art of film-making to reflect an image of the power it serves.<br/><br/>The true story is that, for 34 years, the US foreign policy elite have seethed with revenge for the loss of the shah of Iran, their beloved tyrant, and his CIA-designed state of torture. When Iranian students occupied the US embassy in Tehran in 1979, they found a trove of incriminating documents, which revealed that an Israeli spy network was operating inside the US, stealing top scientific and military secrets. Today, the duplicitous Zionist ally - not Iran - is the one and only nuclear threat in the Middle East.<br/><br/>In 1977, Carl Bernstein, famed for his Watergate reporting, disclosed that more than 400 journalists and executives of mostly liberal US media organizations had worked for the CIA in the past 25 years. They included journalists from the New York Times, Time, and the big TV broadcasters. These days, such a formal nefarious workforce is quite unnecessary. In 2010, the New York Times made no secret of its collusion with the White House in censoring the WikiLeaks war logs. The CIA has an ""entertainment industry liaison office"" that helps producers and directors remake its image from that of a lawless gang that assassinates, overthrows governments and runs drugs. As Obama's CIA commits multiple murder by drone, Affleck lauds the ""clandestine service.. that is making sacrifices on behalf of Americans every day.."

","We already know that Ben Affleck is better as a director than an actor. He tells a story uniquely with his own cinematic art and style. In Argo, this is a new challenge for him. Making a large and historical drama thriller. Argo is based on a declassified true story about Tony Mendez rescuing six US diplomats from Iran. The movie depicts the story in a much suspenseful way. Affleck's directing talent shines once again with modern and old Hollywood vibe. The film is both dark and light, funny and thrilling. Argo is undeniably entertaining, compelling, and exciting.<br/><br/>Firstly the performances, Bryan Cranston did what he does best. John Goodman and Alan Arkin are the delight and the comic relief of the film. Ben Affleck portrays Tony Mendez pretty well. He gave enough depth to the role. Now as a director, you may notice his trademarks(Though, it's not set in Boston and there were no masked criminals). He brings his style of suspense to the picture. The storytelling is not only straightforward, but it also builds the tension starting by exploring what's going on until it proceeds to the next action. It never stops being gripping.<br/><br/>What's impressive is it can balance its various tones decently without being a mess. Outside the storytelling is a solid craft. The film looks credibly retro. They obviously wanted to make everything look the same to the real life story. The production design really captures the eighties like their vehicles, clothes, and the awesome mustache and beard. The camera is shaky which larges the scale and makes the absurd climax exciting.<br/><br/>Argo is sensational as a film directed by Ben Affleck. It provides great suspense, drama, and humor which made itself so remarkably charming. This film proves that Affleck can make bigger films than just Boston crime dramas. His style of bringing tension is the classy formula of the film. The rest of the filmmaking is solid. Argo is simply a classic. No matter how ridiculous the premise sounds, it's still undeniably smart and spectacular."

The sheer volume of outright lies (not just historical inaccuracies, these lies were inserted to make it an American story) is honestly mind boggling. I'd rather not spend too much time explaining each of the fabrications individually, but I highly recommend you look them up yourself (such an interesting story). It's not like all Argo does is claim that the American's did all the work either, there's moments where the Canadians are disparaged by the CIA team that we're supposed to believe did all the work themselves. A particular low- light occurs near the end of the film when a member of the CIA team outright says that they did all the work but they'll let the Canadians take credit for it. I'll admit that being a Canadian, I'm definitely biased, but this film is too disgusting for me to give any more than a 1/10."

","Ben Affleck continues hitting them out of the park. Based on a true story, Argo re-enacts the events that freed American foreign service employees from their hideout in the Canadian Embassy. The setup involves Affleck's character, Mendes, putting together the cover story of a Canadian film crew scouting locations in the Mideast for a sci-fi movie. Alan Arkin & John Goodman are hilarious as Hollywood hotshots producing this surefire scifi hit. The process follows Mendes as he enters Iran and has to BS his way to some skeptical and hostile Iranian theocrats who almost don't know how to respond to the possibility of a scifi movie set in Iran. Mendes must also deal with frightened and reluctant Americans who are being forced out in the open to pose as a movie crew. Affleck does a good job of injecting suspense and dread all through this section.<br/><br/>But the real nail biter is their exit from Iran. As in other movies of this ilk, the chase heats up with the Iranians on the heels of the Americans. Affleck throws into this chase a huge boulder of an obstacle when President Carter pulls the plug on the film crew ex-filtration & decides to go with Delta soldiers instead. If you want to know what happens, I advise you to see the movie or read the news accounts. <br/><br/>This just goes to show you that not all CIA covert actions are led by armed fighters like Jason Bourne and launched by the Treadstone department.

In reality Americans never knew of this operation because CIA gave Canada all the credit. The American nation wasn't told of this until some president unclassified this about 15 - 20 years ago. But that wasn't enough so in 2012 movie producers probably sat down and said ""we need to make an award winning film to show the whole world it was we the Americans not the Canadians that did this astonishing rescue mission."" So the hidden message of this film is ""America is the best country in all of the known world."" At the end you can see the American flag in the background so at least your subconscious would notice it.

The rescue, back story, etc. are all amazing, and I can see why this became such a hot project to be attached to.<br/><br/>My problem with this movie is the ending. Now I know that they are saying that this movie is ""based"" on a true event, rather than the actual event. So that gives them some poetic license. But in this movie, their escape onto the plane is literally seconds away from being blown in multiple instances, and I'm sure while this escape was daring, stressful, etc., I'm sure it wasn't this razor-tight. For me, even if boarding the plane was more uneventful than shown, I still would have liked it, and probably thought it was more faithful to what really occurred.

And finally ""TBS"" although this movie does relate to real historical events, it is Totally Bullshit.<br/><br/>Argo is sorta based on real events, but as it goes along, it gets more and more like a comic book version of what happened in Tehran in 1980. Six Americans escaped the takeover of the American Embassy and were able to hide in the Canadian Ambassador's house after they were hid by the British and with help from the New Zealanders. If you believe this movie the British turned the American's away.

The facts were that it was a very brave Canadian Ambassador who stuck his neck out and orchestrated the escape.<br/><br/>This embarrasses me as an American. Americans have accomplished a lot and have shown extraordinary bravery. But that does not mean that every heroic act has to be falsified that it was done by an American. Movies like this and The Great Escape and U-571 are a slap in the face to other nations and belittle us as taking credit for other countries heroism. (In the Great Escape, Americans and British dug tunnels to escape from a POW camp, IN real life the Americans were transferred out before the big breakout and the Brits escaped. In the movie it was the Americans who escaped including a motorcycle riding Steve McQueen who hurdles the barbed wire on his bike.) In U-571 some American Sailors enter a sinking German Submarine to grab a German code breaking machine, Very heroic, except that the sailors were British.<br/><br/>If you are an American you should be embarrassed by this kind of stuff. If another country, say Italy made a ""true"" movie of how they landed on the Moon, wouldn't you think its a joke? That's this movie.<br/><br/>On top of that, the socko ending never happened. The Ben Affleck character (who was part Mexican in real life) did not take them to the Bizarre, they did not have their tickets cancelled, they did not have a problem with security, and there was no chase down the runway. IN fact they went to the airport at 5 in the morning and caught a plane and flew away. <br/><br/>If you're gonna make a movie based on true events, tell us up front that what you're presenting is a total pack of lies.

The Shah himself and his father whom had gotten deposed by the same Americans and Englishmen years earlier, only tried to modernize Iran. Mossadegh was of course better, but the Pahlavis both loved Iran and tried to make it a better place. What really happened was that the Shah himself turned on the people that had helped him come to power, aka the Americans and the British.

I will put aside for the moment that there is no characterization to speak of here, that it is flimsy as procedural, that its politics are unnecessarily uncomplicated (good CIA battles evil Islam), its tone uncertain, with all the goofy movie-making stuff sticking out like a sore thumb. The film is soulless, painting by numbers. <br/><br/>The movie was fake after all, but the mission was real.<br/><br/>In Affleck's case, there is something worse. Because you see, he does not attempt to 'write history with lightning', as was said about Birth of a Nation a century ago. He softly rewrites the thing. The Canadian stuff has (rightfully) received the most backlash. Imagine this—the CIA analyst who advised Affleck, there had to be one, thought it would be a good idea to end this insinuating the CIA did all the job, but graciously let Canada reap the publicity. <br/><br/>But this was too blunt and it backfired, bringing to the fore the more subtle marginalization of Canadian intelligence work all through the film, which otherwise would have perhaps passed with little notice. The film after all establishes that the Canadian ambassador has taken the six in, even though in his fleeting screen time, he hovers about as a 'kindly concierge', as another reviewer put it.<br/><br/>You will see a more insidious version of this mentality in the opening few minutes of the film, sketching past US intervention in Iran—the film admits US backing of the Shah and his oppressive regime into power, human rights abuses and so on, but curiously, this part is mainly animated in the form of storyboards, mirroring those we see later of the fake film, as something near- mythical that happened in another time and world.

"tavm","8","11","19","1 November 2012"," Argo is a worthy drama of the events of the rescue of some Americans during the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979-80
","The movie's title is the title of the script for a ""proposed"" film that Agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) suggests as a cover for a rescue mission concerning six Americans held as guests with some Canadian representatives in Iran in order to avoid capture by the Iranian terrorists during the hostage crises of 1979-80. It's presented like a real '70s film in a documentary-like style that takes its time in getting to the climax. Certainly having such worthy support from John Goodman, Alan Arkin, and Bryan Cranston contributes immensely to the compelling drama of the situation and Affleck's direction doesn't seem false in presenting the way things happened during that tense time though I'm sure some liberties were taken. So on that note, Argo is recommended as a historical docudrama. P.S. Loved seeing many of the vintage news footage including one from ABC saying a late night rerun of ""The Love Boat"" will be delayed for 15 minutes for Ted Koppel's report on the latest Iranian development. That would eventually become ""Nightline"". Oh, and this was the second time I watched a movie with the '70s version of the Warner Bros. logo presented this year. The first time was on Magic Mike."
"Galina_movie_fan","9","16","30","7 November 2012"," From Gigli to Argo - Bravo, Ben Affleck!
","Based on the actual historical events from 33 years ago, new Ben Affleck's film ""Argo"" which he produced, directed and starred in, is an excellent picture and a gorgeous thriller. The film recreates the episode associated with the rescue of six American diplomats, who managed to escape from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran during the assault and seizure of the embassy by Iranian militant students-rebels on Nov. 4, 1979, and who found refuge in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador at the time, Ken Taylor. CIA in conjunction with Canadian government had come up with an ingenious and risky operation in saving and extracting the six from Tehran from which even a bird would not be able to fly undetected. The film depicts in details the operation that for long 18 years remained classified. I would not argue that ""Argo"" may not be historically absolutely accurate but am not going to blame its creators for that. ""Argo"" turns to be a fascinating piece of cinema and a very timely film, despite the fact that the story it tells took place over 30 years ago.<br/><br/>For many years, Ben Affleck was for me a lesser part of the creative and friendly alliance with Matt Damon. Matt was ""Talented Mr. Damon,"" and Ben - mostly, a pretty boy whose acting career hit the rock bottom with ""Gigli"", and who became famous as the first syllable in the created by media frenzy compound word Bennifer. I am happy to admit that I was wrong about Benjamin Geza Affleck. Well, he is still the first syllable in the compound word Bennifer, with the different Jennifer though, but he's got real talent as the film director with the sharp clear vision, undeniable craft, and confident style of directing. Ben Affleck is gradually becoming one of my favorite American directors: «Gone Baby Gone», «The Town», and now - ""Argo."" The latter is without doubt his best work so far and I highly recommend it. I would not be surprised at all that when the awards season arrives, both ""Argo"" and Affleck will be mentioned as the nominees for several prestigious awards. The film has a lot going for it. One remarkable scene follows another. From the first frames, ""Argo's director creates unbearable tension, pulls the viewer inside the screen and holds them there until the end. One of my favorite scenes has Tony Mendes (Affleck) riding a cab from the Airport upon his arrival to Tehran. Pay close attention to what he sees and how short cuts form the streets of Tehran intertwined. For this scene alone, I believe Affleck deserves nomination for directing.<br/><br/>Pay attention how the tone of the film changes with the Hollywood scenes and how much of professional knowledge of starting the film production details Affleck uses. Making two fine actors John Goodman and Alan Arkin playing the roles of two prominent film personalities who agreed to take part in rescue operation from Hollywood, brings real humor in the dramatic and intense story. The final part of the film is purest Hollywood of its best times when the tension becomes unbearable, and I say this with admiration, because these scenes do not depend on the dizzying special effects, but on the pulsing pace, intense interaction among the characters and their emotions, and the flawless editing that cuts among several scenes occurring simultaneously in different and distant from each other, parts of the globe. While watching the film, especially the final chapters, you squeeze the armrest of your chair hard and clench your fists so the nails dig into the palms.<br/><br/>As we grow older, it gets more and more difficult to lose yourself in the movie, which is after all, only an illusion, 24 lies per second. Rarely can a film completely convince the viewer that the line between him and the screen is gone. I am grateful to Ben Affleck for making me forget about that line while watching the best scenes of ""Argo"". I completely trusted him as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>I am not going to talk about plot details here. With this film, the less the audience knows about the plot before they watch the film, the better. I only say that bearded Affleck with longer hair looks as convincing in front as he is behind it. Bravo, Ben! I advise you to pay close attention to the prologue of the film before the credits. Affleck remarkably well used animating technique illustrating historical events that led to the crisis of the American hostages in Iran, 1979-1981. Don't leave the theater the film is seemingly over. It is not. For few minutes we are treated to the epilogue where the portraits of actors and their counterparts are compared, and some details of their after Argo lives are revealed.<br/><br/>I'd like to add few words about John Chambers, the character played by John Goodman. John Chambers was in fact one of Hollywood greatest make-up artists. His most famous work using the prosthetic make-up techniques for numerous ape –people from the first classic film with Charlton Heston, ""Planet of Apes"" (1968) and the characters of the series ""Star Trek"". Chambers was honored with Oscar for his work on ""Planet of the Apes."" It was the first Academy Award in the category for outstanding makeup. Compassionate human being, Chambers also devoted his talents to help with the face restoration to the soldiers disfigured during the war, as well as to cancer survivors."

Apart from the events in the movies that never happened in reality such as the bazaar and the airport scenes, there were many other things that came across really fake. The Iranian accent of most characters were fake (ex's: Sahar the housekeeper of the Canadians, and some of the revolutionaries). Most Iranian women in the movie were wearing the black chaadors, but at the time a lot of women were still not wearing these (especially not the chaador) at the time. And even the way they were wearing their chadors and acting like Ninjas was really unreal. Everything was just so so fake!!! Traffic in the streets at that time, really doubt it!

Unfortunately, few people seem able to recognize its application.<br/><br/>*************<br/><br/>8 stars for craftsmanship averaged with 2 stars for historical accuracy equals 5 stars. The intro to this movie is most engaging and tends to convince viewers unswervingly from the start that this is a great film. If one investigates the history, however, almost every subsequent plot point is fabricated, apparently to maintain audience interest (for as many reviewers have commented, besides the plot and editing, this movie has little to offer in the way of writing, characters, acting, costumes, makeup, cinematography, etc.) During the credits, contrasting images of real characters and actors are presented that would lead one to believe great effort was made to tell the story faithfully. Don't be fooled. Contrary to what Mr. Afflect has said, the plot was more than tweaked a bit*. Good on NPR for calling him out on it. The salient facts in this case aren't classified, so what's the excuse for baldfaced lying to the audience?<br/><br/>*Examples of diversion from the truth: No excursion took place into the bazaar by the Americans. No secret photographs taken of the Americans. No shredded embassy photographs of the Americans. No sweatshop assembling shredded photographs of the Americans. The mission was never canceled, but President Carter did delay authorization for 30 minutes *before agent Mendez had even left for Iran*. Agent Mendez was in Iran for less than 36 hours and left the country separately, before the stranded Americans left. No phone call by Iranian guards to the studio. No problem with airline tickets. No confrontation at the airport. No (absurd) plane chase. Many people on the plane besides the American embassy workers cheered when the plane took off. Others have commented that the rescue effort was the brainchild of--and directed by--a Canadian, not agent Mendez."

","As the Iranian revolution nears a climax, a CIA specialist comes up with a risky plan to rescue six Americans who are hiding at the home of the Canadian Ambassador. The plan? A fake movie. <br/><br/>With two good films under his belt Ben Affleck has already solidified himself as a competent director. With Argo he ventures into the must see category. Argo is easily one of the best films of the year and reminds us of the films we use to love back in the 70's. Not only does the film look like it takes place in the 70's, but it feels like it too. Blowing the picture up to give it the grainy feel, greatly adds to the overall experience. <br/><br/>Multiple times I got the feeling that Affleck was trying to pull off an All The Presidents Men vibe, especially in the CIA offices and it works. While I'm sure Affleck took some liberties with the events, it never feels like any of this couldn't have happened. Affleck is a CIA operative and not once does he fire a gun, fight the bad guys or be 007. This film is 100% talking, yet is one of the most suspenseful films of the year. Where does the suspense come from? If their cover is blown, they are all dead. Can these people fake being a film crew? Does everyone make it out alive? Even if you know how the real story turns out, Affleck manages to keep the tension throughout the entire third act intact. <br/><br/>I do wish that Affleck would have given Canadians more credit though. They did most of the work, took most of the risk and in the film it feels as if they were babysitters while Mendez comes up with this Hollywood Option and does everything to get them out. So it does feel like Hollywood trying to take credit for something they were let in on, but that's a small gripe in a fantastic film. <br/><br/>Boasting an impressive cast: Ben Affleck, John Goodman, Alan Arkin, Bryan Cranston, Tate Donovan, Victor Garber, Clea DuVall, Rory Cochrane, Kyle Chandler and Ben Affleck staple Titus Welliver, everyone brings their A-game, no matter how small the role. Of course Affleck has to have his obligatory shirt off shot. <br/><br/>Argo is everything a movie should be, a great story, compelling drama and light hearted humour. Like I said earlier, it brings back the days of 70's cinema, complete with thick glasses, dorky haircuts and goofy moustaches. The film's credits put up the actors with their real person counterparts. Plus images from the film are literally taken from pictures taken during the events. It's a scary situation to be in and Affleck puts that front and centre. <br/><br/>Go see Argo"
"scottgavin87","6","11","20","3 December 2012"," Average movie with a great cast
","I really love Ben Affleck as a director, as I do Clint Eastwood or pretty much anybody who is willing to make a movie that sticks to its guns, is honest and well constructed. This movie is all that, but I was never as intrigued as I was during The Town, nor was I not aware that my wine glass was slowly emptying. I was agitated and not that involved. I cared for some of the characters, but not all of them. I wanted an Oscar-potential movie like Munich, but I got a good solid family drama, although based on a true story, felt much more contrived. This is not a great movie, although it is good. Affleck takes on the lead man with ease, easily adapting himself into a look never seen before on him. The other actors are near perfect, reiterating that this is indeed a well made movie, but the way the movie plays out is much like an episode of the A Team or Macgyver where you know that the good guys will always come through, somehow. Not that I was routing for the bad guys, not that I don't realize that most movies are equally- contrived, but something about the story was missing, perhaps an insight into what makes the Iranians tick, so that my judgement from a viewer perspective does not remain completely abstract."

","My review was approved at first by IMDb, but then the next day they silently removed it without any notification! This NEVER happened to me or friends of mine before, so this movie must get a lot of bad reviews that they try to limit, I guess! Well here it is again, assuming IMDb ""made a mistake"" (which in this case is hard to imagine). To IMDb: If you do not place this review, that please re-instate the old approved one, thanks!<br/><br/>Mr. Affleck does his normal wooden acting, earns some millions, gets the awards they promised him, gets his head on the poster and DVD packaging etc for vanity reasons. And the rest of the team never thought about anything but the money they would earn from making this film, not about the effects of it. <br/><br/>Some effects: <br/><br/>Canadians hate that the escape looks like an American CIA operation, just Google: ""Canadian Caper"" and find the real info on Wikipedia. This film says it is based on a true story, but that is hardly the case.<br/><br/>Iranians hate that they are portrayed as stupid/bad guys, when they brought forth numerous arts, artists, and renowned scientists, and their land is used as only a background for riots, while they are peace-loving people just like you and me and their land has great nature and landscapes. Also the Persian Empire is the oldest empire in the world that has brought more to humanity than you know, just Google Persian contributions to humanity, the list is very long and nowhere near complete.<br/><br/>Everybody that is involved in making the world a better place will boycott these hate filled movies from Hollywood, especially with Ben Affleck and the producers of this film involved, but not exclusively.<br/><br/>Best tip: grab a camera yourself and make your own film that shows us the truth, instead of these Hollywood lies.<br/><br/>A lot of people have done this, and by now most people know that we all are ruled by non-tax paying corporations with puppet politicians on a leash. That is what globalization is about. For these people and organizations, you are only good for providing cheap workforce, paying taxes and spending your money, oh and to keep your mouth shut and belief their propaganda.<br/><br/>One day this whole system will collapse, cause hate and greed will only lead to more hate and greed."

","Ben made a huge comeback after directing The Town and Gone Baby Gone - two movies more loved by the audience than by critics.. But now it's his time with 96% of Rotten Tomatoes, 8.4 IMDb rating and lots of positive (and even more) reviews. So, here is mine... Probably like most of other people I had great expectations to Argo and they don't fully matched with what I saw, but still this is one of the best films of the year. The good thing about screenplay is the story itself, a very dynamic, somehow intrigue and a beautiful plot. I liked the smart and very natural dialogues, the mix of documentary and film scenes. Even the happy ending was good because during the whole film I've got attached to those characters so much, I experienced every tricky moment, I felt nervous for police check they had to pass and I argued against president Carter to support Tony's (Ben Affleck) plan. <br/><br/>The acting panel is perfect in the movie. Ben plays so well that he can be palced next to Robert Redford, Clint Eastwood, Mel Gibson and Ron Howards - actors who turned to directors very successfully. He delivers a zero emotion performance of US government agent who aims to save hostages. He can probably get an Oscar nomination as a lead actor because Hollywood will love extremely positive hero.<br/><br/>But real star of this movie is Alan Arkin playing Lester Siegel - a widely acclaimed Hollywood director helping Tony to make a fake movie. He portrays a smart and funny director being pretty close to most of real directors of our time. He's most natural act in the whole cast of Argo and that is why Alan can get his fourth Oscar nomination, this time for supporting role.<br/><br/>What's the chances of winning Best Picture Oscar?<br/><br/>Chance of nominating is over 100% but not sure about winning. It is good, definitely good, almost perfect. But lacks a polish that is so much important for best picture winner. In the end, I did not clearly imagine Argo holding that title in February. However this is still possible as we've got Les Miserable premiere ahead and Tom Hooper promises a lot this year.<br/><br/>For Complete Review visit my blog: http://running-reel.blogspot.com/2012/10/movie-review-argo-2012.html"
"melina-m-gunnett","9","12","24","9 October 2012"," Hollywood has made many movies about the CIA. This time it is the CIA making the movie...
","I expected Argo to be a good movie, but I did not expect it to be an enjoyable one. I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>I am old enough to remember the Iranian Hostages being taken and the countdown that appeared every night on the evening news for over a year. I am not old enough to remember the details. The only rescue mission I remembered was the spectacular failure of Operation Eagle Claw and that is what I had thought this movie was going to be about.<br/><br/>Instead the movie was about a crazy plan to to rescue the six Americans that had escaped from the Embassy and had hidden themselves at the home of the Canadian Ambassador. I didn't remember anything about anyone having escaped the U.S. Embassy as it was taken over and for that I am thankful. It allowed me to fully appreciate the suspense as the rescue was attempted.<br/><br/>This plan didn't involve special forces and/or helicopters., but it was pure Hollywood. They CIA set up a movie company, backed a B-movie Science Fiction film and created positions for each of the six trapped Americans as part of the crew sent to scout locations. The plan was to simply fly them out of the country as part of the crew. Of course nothing is every quite that simple Argo was the name of the movie they were theoretically there to scout for. I did a quick search, but it does not seem that the script was ever made into an actually movie (Although there are three other films with that title.). Sad, I would have found in amusing to watch after having heard bits and pieces about it throughout this film. Perhaps the CIA still holds the option on it, or it really was bad enough that no one was willing to produce it.<br/><br/>While the never made Argo may have been a ""B"" movie at best, Chris Terro's script was anything but bad. He masterfully mixed humor and tension to keep everyone in suspense throughout the movie. Will they or won't they make it. You can probably find the answer on the Internet, but if you don't already know how it ends, I recommend waiting and seeing the movie first."
"brando647","9","6","10","22 June 2013"," A Tight, Suspenseful Dramatization of the Canadian Caper
","I'm admittedly pretty late to the Ben Affleck/director bandwagon. His first film, GONE BABY GONE, went under my radar and I passed on THE TOWN because I wasn't interested in another heist film. He's been collecting praise for his directing efforts for years but it wasn't until ARGO that I actually sat down and watched one of his movies. The premise was one that had grabbed my attention since originally reading about the Canadian Caper in an article on Cracked.com. The movie is based on actual events, but I'm not knowledgeable enough in subject to tell you what's accurate and what isn't. So it's safe to say that I watched this as a movie for entertainment and not as a propaganda piece for America or the CIA, as some have appeared to view it. ARGO is the tale of six staff members for the U.S. embassy in Tehran, Iran during a tumultuous time in which citizens of the country were rioting over the United States' involvement in providing asylum for the former Iranian Shah while he sought treatment for cancer. The riots soon grow out of hand and enraged Iranian civilians overrun the embassy, taking its staff of 52 hostage. Six Americans escaped during the fray and find sanctuary with the Canadian ambassador in his home. The clock is ticking and the U.S. is worried that the Iranians will discover the escapees, so the CIA becomes involved in forming a plan to retrieve them. Enter CIA agent Tony Mendez (Affleck) with a plan to enter Iran and walk the Americans right out through a commercial airport under the guise of a location scout for a Canadian film crew. It's one of those ""so crazy, it has to work"" scenarios.<br/><br/>ARGO is good. Best Picture good? Maybe. There might have been more deserving movies in 2012 but I don't feel that ARGO ruined any lives by walking away with the award. It's an incredibly good film that manages to grab its audience on an emotional level, and it tells an amazing story. Regardless of how it's portrayed in the film, the events depicted in the movie happened in one sense of another: the Iranians raged at the United States, 52 embassy staff were taken as hostages for a grueling 444 days, and six escapees were aided in escaping the country as a Canadian film crew. That alone is an incredible tale. This is Ben Affleck's vision of the events and, yes, they are very America-centric. You sort of have to expect that from an American film. Once you overlook that and just absorb ARGO as a piece of entertainment, it succeeds. Affleck does an excellent job of ratcheting up the suspense in the film. These characters are in a dangerously tight spot and you feel for them. They're terrified, paranoid, and never know if the next day will be their last. There is a scene in the middle of the movie where Mendez, in an effort to solidify their cover story, must take the six escapees into Tehran's bazaar where all eyes are on them after a few mere hours to try and learn their false identities. It's tense. Even knowing that everything turns out all right in the end, it's tense. I'd say that makes for a successful film.<br/><br/>I also loved the alternating vibes of the film. The scenes in Iran are taut and ominous. We're treated to multiple scenes emphasizing the rampant anti-American sentiment and the dangerous conditions. The scenes in Hollywood are loud and boisterous, with mansions, glamorous parties, and a soundtrack including Van Halen and the Dire Straits. The only instance of Western music once we're in Iran is an excellent use of Led Zeppelin's ""When the Levee Breaks"", used perfectly to reflect the tension as the American's celebrate the night before their big escape while Mendez is confronted with the possibility of abandoning the mission and leaving them behind. Back in America, everything is a bit more light-hearted with John Goodman and Alan Arkin portraying the Hollywood connections that helped Mendez create a fake movie from scratch and pass it off as a legitimate venture to fool the Iranians. Goodman and Arkin are a couple of scene-stealers and provide a bit of levity to break up the gloom of the Iranian situation.<br/><br/>If I have any complaint about the movie, I guess it would be that I was underwhelmed with the ending. The big climactic scene in Iranian airport where the Americans are within reach of freedom is a little too forced. The cuts between the Mendez and the escapees, the Iranian police, and the CIA offices felt as if they were trying a bit too hard to make it suspenseful. Still, I suppose it got the job done. ARGO is a fine movie and probably ranks somewhere in my top ten best for 2012."
"babakj-623-2841","9","6","10","3 March 2013"," level of Details in the Movie
","I was a 12-year old Iranian boy in Tehran during the actual hostage crisis, and I remember the events vividly. I have seen the movie three times and I keep getting amazed at the accuracy of little details embedded in the movie, 99% of which would be unnoticeable to all but the Iranians like me with be vivid memories of the events.<br/><br/>For example, the rifles that the Iranian revolutionaries carried were not the prolific AK-47, rather the German HK G-3 rifles that were taken from Shah's military. The movie accurately shows that. They could have used the easily available and cheap Ak-47 in the movie and no one would have blinked.<br/><br/>Or the Iranian visa stamp that Affleck's character received in his passport in Iran's consulate in Turkey was from the Shah's Imperial regime that had been overthrown a year before. And the Iranian consulate representative manually and diligently struck through the logo in Farsi, and replaced it with ""Islamic Republic of Iran"" by hand. This must have been lost to all but otherwise attentive Farsi speaking movie viewers, but is an absolutely small, but very powerful detail, given the historical phase the story is taking place. The fact that the movie production dug that deep into details is remarkable.<br/><br/>As for dress code and make-up, they were also spot-on right.<br/><br/>There is a glaring exception, however. Thinking that an Iranian revolutionary guard would pick up the phone and call up a Hollywood studio from Tehran airport on a moment's notice during passenger screening is simply preposterous :-) I also wish the 2-minute narrative at the beginning of the movie discussing the historic events was more detailed. It was all accurate, but not deep enough."

","Argo is a good movie because: <br/><br/>Argo at the introduction shows a time line of Iran's history leading up to the 1979 Islamic revolution. The character development is excellent. One senses the urgency for the characters and how the characters behave from the scenes from the taken of the American embassy. I like the part where the one person you think is going to crack helps out the most, which is so true in real life. The C I A is portrayed as governmental. However, some people who work for the C I A will sacrifice for a job and when successful are given no credit for the people involved. <br/><br/>I do not know how much of the real story was changed because of time constraints or in order to dramatized the movie.

As always, I despise the hand-held camera bits, the picture jerking around and the colors swirling in confusion. This, I understand, is how the director achieves ""believability"". There is no one character, or even a couple, you can focus on and root for. No involvement, in other words. Cardboard cutout characters lead to cardboard character audiences - i.e., me. I did enjoy the first five minutes, where a brief history of Iran in the years after WWII were shown. That ought to educate some of the younger people who can't figure out why the Iranis and Iraqis and other Nid-Easterners hate us so.

First of all I fell asleep several times while watching the movie and had to start it over and over again. So much for suspense. I am so tired of movies depicting Americans as the saviors of this world. I am so tired of American movies showing the people of other countries as bad and dangerous and inferior. Maybe the Hollywood movie people should remember that the US is a melting pot of people from all over the world and there is nobody living in this country, who did not come from somewhere else originally. I will never understand how this movie got nominated and won Academy awards. Actually that is not true, I understand that these awards are bought and obviously that year the gang around Ben Affleck spent enough money to win the price. I also understand that even IMDb is a forum where people vote and review just to promote a movie because they are paid for it.

And as mentioned, there are quite a few things that are heightened for ""entertainment purposes"" and most of them work nicely.<br/><br/>There are quite a few Iranians who actually help or try not to be pressed into doing evil things. The actual way of how Ben Afflecks character thinks he can help the people seems far fetched, but it is something that happened (again not as heightened as it is shown in the movie).

""Argo"" is one of those movies I would have passed up watching had it not been for one catch. The idea of the government using the making of a fake space / fantasy film to free hostages from Iran intrigued me. Once again, I'm very glad I listened to my instincts and took it in.<br/><br/>In 1979, six Americans are put in hiding by the Canadian Embassy when the U.S. Embassy is raided in Iran by militants. Everyone else in the building is taken hostage. The U.S. government decides to take the unconventional advice of CIA operative Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) to get the six diplomats out of the country. He will enter Iran and smuggle them out as a group of filmmakers scouting for shooting locations for a fake science fiction / fantasy film entitled ""Argo.""<br/><br/>Ben Affleck continues to surprise me. He's always done his own thing in Hollywood. He'll do smaller films playing less conventional characters like ""Dazed and Confused,"" ""Mallrats,"" and ""Chasing Amy."" The next thing you know he's taking the lead in blockbusters and popcorn flicks such as ""Armageddon,"" ""Daredevil,"" ""Pearl Harbor,"" and ""The Sum of All Fears."" Affleck's had his share of stinkers and received some unwanted attention in the tabloids as well. What actor hasn't?<br/><br/>One thing Affleck has done is prove he's a versatile talent in Tinseltown and isn't going away any time soon. He won an Oscar for his ""Good Will Hunting"" script and continues to collect awards for ""Argo."" The movie is nominated for an Oscar for ""Best Picture"" and it deserves the honor.<br/><br/>""Argo"" appealed to me in so many ways. I was born in 1972 and was completely caught up in ""Star Wars,"" ""Star Trek,"" and ""Planet of the Apes"" fevers. A movie based in that time period about people making a fake sci-fi movie as a front to save hostages is captivating.<br/><br/>Add to that the fact that award-winning ""Planet of the Apes"" makeup artist John Chambers helped the government get the hostages out of Iran.

The whole event is interesting to learn about.<br/><br/>""Argo"" is an exciting political thriller which will have you white- knuckled and gripping the edge of your seat.

Well, thiz movie has all three of them. Producer, Director and Actor Ben Affleck is smart enough to realize it and takes advantage of that. Ben Affleck is Tony Mendez, a CIA agent who is responsible for covert operation to extract six American embassy employees out of the rage of Iran revolutionary by pretending to be Canadian film crew. It seems that Ben Affleck has done a tremendous job as the Director. He starts with an effective prologue to provide sufficient information and every time the scene heats up, particularly when the scene of American embassy is invaded, he cleverly adds relaxing piano instrumental music to cool things down and doesn't try to provoke audience into infuriated reactions. Thiz is his third feature films behind the camera after ""Gone Baby Gone"" (2007) and ""The Town"" (2010). For the acting, Ben Afflecks looks cool, calm and confident. John Goodman, Bryan Cranston and Victor Garber give brief but consistent performances and the last but definitely not least, Alan Arkin creates a powerful and believable emotion as fearless Hollywood Producer. I also have to put some credit to the Production Designer Sharon Seymour who successfully makes everything look like 1980s such as costume, hairstyle, glasses, car, furniture, television, telephone, everything! How they put attention to detail is undoubtedly amazing. Personally, for me, the power of thiz movie is in the last half hour. Thiz is a good example of what you can get when great script and great editing are perfectly combined. My heart nearly stopped while watching thiz final scene which takes place in Iran airport. They use almost all aspects to create tensions from ticket, telephone, soldier, bus, you name it and they have done it. When it's over, there will be some satisfying and gratifying feelings. In the closing scene, when the camera pans over the toys of Star Wars, Planet of the Apes and other sci-fi movies one by one. It simply wants to remind us that they are not only inspirational icons in our pop culture, but also they have ever saved lives.

"jafar-iqbal","9","5","8","9 November 2012"," Another brilliant Ben Affleck effort
","Cinema these days is dominated by remakes and reboots and sequels and adaptations; there are rare exceptions, sure, but film studios and filmmakers seem too scared to attempt something original. Everything is based on something. There's always a source material. So it's no longer about how original a movie is, but how original that source material is. Which brings us nicely onto Argo, which is inspired by one of the most original source materials out there.<br/><br/>It's more or less a case of truth being stranger than fiction with Argo. Six American diplomats living in Iran have to go into hiding during the 1980 Iranian Revolution. The CIA concocts a plan to bring them back, by making them pose as the film crew for a fake science fiction movie.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe that all of this actually happened – that the American and Canadian governments were able to fool the Iranians to such a farcical extent is fascinating, and so it's no surprise that director Ben Affleck wanted to tackle it. He's also a producer on the film along with George Clooney, which tells you how much faith there is in the subject matter. This is a film about the strength of the human spirit, and the lengths that people will go to protect their own, a theme that seems to run through all of Affleck's writing and directorial efforts.<br/><br/>Another staple of Affleck's films is his knack at picking a stellar cast; and the cast for Argo is fantastic. Bryan Cranston. John Goodman. Alan Arkin. Scoot McNairy. Victor Garber. Kyle Chandler. Chris Messina. And that's not even the full list of excellent supporting cast. So many brilliant actors acting brilliantly. It's a treat to watch. Each of the lead actors gets a moment to shine, whether it's Arkin and Goodman trading barbs, Scoot McNairy's airport performance, or Cranston's running around. But just like in The Town and, arguably, Good Will Hunting, Affleck is the one giving the best performance of the movie. He is a quiet presence, letting the personalities around him strut their stuff while he holds it all together. The comparison to Clint Eastwood is blatant: an actor-director capable of bringing the best out of himself.<br/><br/>The film has flaws. There are inconsistencies, and a few logic slip-ups, especially in the climax of the movie. Sure, they help amp up the drama, but jars the movie slightly. Too many characters means a slight confusion about who and where everyone is. And I wish I had more emotional investment in the six hostages, as I don't care too much about their survival as I do about the whole plan itself.<br/><br/>But I'm nitpicking, because I think criticisms are needed. Whatever faults there are in this film, they're overshadowed by so much good. Conception and execution of this story are top-notch. Ben Affleck proves once again that he is fast becoming one of the best actor-directors out there. Yes, this is not an entirely original film but, if you're gonna adapt something, make sure it's done properly. Argo is, fortunately; a must-see."
"Raphezir","6","8","15","14 January 2013"," Decent but overrated
","I didn't really want to watch Argo in the first place but with all the hype going on about the award nominations and people claiming Affleck got robbed... So I gave it a try. Yes, the movie is OK - and really good job on the visual aspect of the movie but those people, who are praising the acting, just got caught by the story. There is not much acting going on in this movie. You expect to see 6/7 people scared to death and trying to mask this fear but you only see 3. I'm not saying they suck but none of the performances are outstanding. I don't even understand why people get caught by this story anyway. I just thought: That's what you get for supporting dictators like this piece of s***. Not saying any of those hostages deserved what was coming to them but it didn't really let me suffer with them, especially not with those 6 who got away. It seems the audience just likes to celebrate some American heros. It's the same effect with ""Lincoln"". The movie is OK but the story is a national (or even global) treasure, so people praise the movie and the acting into an unrealistic level.<br/><br/>Another problem is: Everybody knows what's going to happen. So many of the efforts to create tension just fail and appear kinda pointless, especially the chase on the runway.<br/><br/>The movie looks good and it is well done but it does not deserve awards for acting or best motion picture."
"georgep53","8","8","15","13 October 2012"," Strong Hostage Drama
","This is a really good thriller based on the little known attempt to rescue 6 Americans hiding in the Canadian embassy during the Iranian hostage crisis. Director Ben Affleck skillfully ratchets up the suspense while delivering a believable performance as Tony Mendez a CIA technician who devises a highly imaginative escape plan that could easily qualify for an episode of Mission:Impossible. Chris Terrio's adapted screenplay explains the basis for Iranian hostility toward Americans before settling into a human drama focusing on a group of low level diplomatic operatives facing the possibility of imminent death. There's good supporting work from Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin and John Goodman."
"jdennist","7","8","15","12 October 2012"," A solid film, not a masterpiece
","The film falters most when it forces itself into comic and thriller molds. I was worried that the film would play up the ""isn't this SUCH a wacky, harebrained idea"" angle, and in the first act, especially the Hollywood scenes, it kind of does. And the third act is guilty of too much overt button-pushing; without giving anything away, a lot of it feels pretty artificial, which would be less of an issue if this weren't ostensibly a true story.<br/><br/>Another fault I found was how thinly drawn the hostages actually were. I never really felt like they were particularly rounded as individuals, and the one with the most dialogue (Joe Stafford, I'm pretty sure) did little more than fret and grouse. By not developing the hostages as characters, the film undercuts, in my view, its own stakes and whatever level of emotional involvement the audience may have had.<br/><br/>With all that, I still thought it was a well-made film; Affleck's direction isn't outstanding, but the film moves smoothly, the suspense is decently well-managed (the script may be more to blame than anything else), it's technically solid (some iffy CGI aside), and the acting is just fine. Affleck is muted, but that's acceptable for the role of Mendez; Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and John Goodman all do quite well, and I personally wish they had more to do. The rest of the cast do just fine, but they aren't given quite enough to work with.<br/><br/>And that's what I think might ultimately hurt the film's Oscar chances; there's no performance in the film to really latch onto. Arkin is being pegged as a contender, but he really doesn't have THAT much to do; the acting is perfectly fine, but really, I find ARGO to be a solid thriller and not much more.<br/><br/>Perhaps what the film should've done is focused less on the suspense and more on the psychology of role-playing. Playing these parts was a matter of life and death for these people; that was a theme the film should dug into deeper.<br/><br/>And maybe that's why I didn't love ARGO; it doesn't have much real depth to it. It's enjoyable, it's well-made, butthere's not too much at the core."
"CinematicInceptions","7","3","4","22 September 2017"," Not best-picture worthy.
","I don't like to believe the myth that Hollywood loves movies about itself, but this movie proves that myth true better than any other I've seen. It's a cool story for sure, but it gets too wrapped up in the premise of making a fake movie. There is a lot of time spent shooting down other ideas and going through the process of publicizing a fake movie. It was necessary and sometimes entertaining to see, but it could have taken up less time. Even the ""Argo f--- yourself"" line adds to sense that the movie is rather full of itself.<br/><br/>What I found more interesting was the details of the plan to rescue the six Canadians. Ben Affleck's character Tony is at his best when he's trying to get the hostages to buy into his plan and working to get them home. There was a much more human element to it, and they were more in line with what I think is more of the purpose of movies that are based on real events. When events are described in the news or in many historical books, it is easy to forget that they are about real people with real stakes, and dramatizations of such events help to put those sorts of things into better perspective. Argo is paced much faster and made a bit more entertaining than most non-fictional movies, but it neglects its characters for the most part.<br/><br/>For these reasons, I don't agree with it winning the Best Picture Oscar. There was too much that could have been better, and a little too much narcissism laced into it. Perhaps someone who really enjoyed it could convince me of its value and quality, but I find it to be overrated and not true to itself. Overall Rating: 7.2/10."

","So first of all, for a good political story get the book and read it. it worth it specially the Canadian version if you don't want to pay dues to real ""hero"" Mendez. all read the Wired Magazine version of it.<br/><br/>the story of this movie and not the real events is about US gov collaborating with Hollywood to fake a whole project, fool themselves in a massive deal (hoping it helps a ONE phone call that a revolutionary soldier MIGHT make to some random number in Hollywood). Which is a big deal if you are a X-file fan. but this movie does not expand on that at all. that how close CIA and Hollywood were when it came to the whole set and process. <br/><br/>it also tells the story of a literal nut-head who decides to go to Tehran,Iran in its most chaotic days to bring these consulate-kids out, the result they go for a walk in Bazar and some streets which actually puts them in real danger, to make some story for a 10 min border interview. But hey, when the plan is coming from Hollywood-CIA this is the way it is, vs. Department of state who was going to make them a biking team with a Swiss passport or something. <br/><br/>Anyway, the development of the story is horrible. they literally kill tons of time about Mendez family, turkey, visa office, airport, driving through streets to see hanging and shooting and internal debates over what to do. does it really adds to the depth of complexity of situation? nope. does it show that Tehran was a hell? yes. so then it should be a hard mission? no, cause they just had to focus on airport story. they did not need to hide and seek on the street. <br/><br/>lets say its like making a Rockey balboa showing so many crazy contenders that will end up never fighting with Rockey cause he could just talk his way through the final round! and wait there was one phone call which supposed to be a massive cliff hanger. was it? damn no. it was flat dumb. <br/><br/>after all this flat, black and white story. i should say, remaking the white mountains you see on north of Tehran was done perfectly. and the guy at the end who interrogate the hero silent Aflec, is also does a great job of doing a real experience. but there is not Oscar for extras! and wait did Aflect play like a real spy? yes he did. totally ignore-ble and blending into any set of the cast of any scene.<br/><br/>So all in all, did this movie deserve a presidential recommendation with Naval background to get the Oscar? the answer is in the movie!"

","The great production design is the best thing about this disappointing movie, which falls well short of expectations. The emotion is so muted it's non-existent. No one seems to show fear. On most actors' faces, it looks like passing indigestion. These are people facing imminent death!! The poetic licence taken with the real events is very disappointing. Why ignore the fact the Canadians were the ones who in real life sheltered the escaped US embassy staff? It's wrong. The plot, obviously, is thrilling, so why does the script plod so much? For once, the soundtrack is not intrusive enough, it doesn't help build tension. The dialogue between the fugitives is mostly flimsy. Their characters aren't clear. John Goodman is a great presence as the Hollywood special effects man. The Hollywood producer is great, too. Ben Affleck doesn't have enough gravitas as the CIA hero who goes undercover as a movie producer in Iran. He must have been too tired to think about acting. The visual look of the film is one positive - the clothes, hair styles and furniture are all beautifully restrained and look authentic."
"rmax304823","7","3","4","7 September 2013"," In The Beginning, There Was the Shah.
","It's an important movie because the incident that began this whole Middle East muddle in which we now find ourselves -- let's think of it as the index incident -- is fast disappearing down the memory hole. The Iranian takeover of the U.S. embassy in Teheran in 1979 is as remote from younger Iranis as the Vietnam war is to our college students. It's something they read about in history books. The mutual enmity has become functionally autonomous; it's an ongoing thing and now feels as if it's always been there.<br/><br/>So it's important if only for its educational value. It's also a suspenseful story in itself. While the enraged Iranis storm the American embassy and occupy it, six of the staff escape out the back door and are finally given safe quarters in the house of the Canadian ambassador, while the rest of the staff are not so lucky. No one has any idea of what will happen to the six escapees. They could be caught and murdered momentarily. And they have no way of getting out of the country.<br/><br/>Enter Ben Affleck as Tony Mendez, intrepid agent of the CIA, whose book this screenplay is based on, alas. I hope no one expects a personal memoir by a CIA hero to reflect any characterological weaknesses such as self doubt or vanity or hesitancy or fear. Affleck is grimly determined throughout, despite the company's attempts to shut the operation down. ""I will get you out. That's what I do,"" he tells his terrified wards repeatedly. The outrageous plan is to give the six Americans new identities as location scouts for a film company.<br/><br/>The script, and Affleck's performance, turns Mendez into a cipher. He seems to have only one trait -- that obsession to get them out. But then the script doesn't give any of the six hostages any personality either. They each have one trait, if that many, and are otherwise impossible to distinguish from one another. Well, that's not entirely true, because you can tell the men from the women.<br/><br/>The story itself is intrinsically strong. The problems of getting a new identity and fooling the house-to-house Irani searchers at the airport, are spelled out in a jumbled kind of way. But Affleck, the director, and his cameraman seem to have caught some sort of palsy that has been endemic in Hollywood for the last decade or more.<br/><br/>The hand-held camera is hardly ever still. The cuts come quickly, one upon the other. There are swish pans, wobbles, innumerable close ups of static faces where there need be no close ups at all. That's during the contemplative periods. During the action scenes, forget it -- a kaleidoscope of flashing images. As a result, the movie has taken on some of the visual qualities of a rock video, or a TV commercial for pimple cream, exercycles, or SUVs with Ma Deuces on top. ZOOM, BANG, Ooops, pardon me! The stylistic quirks juice up a story that needs no more juice than it already has. A suspense thriller doesn't need to convince us that it's supposed to be thrilling. I mean, cf., ""All The President's Men"", and count the close ups and wobbles.<br/><br/>But the directorial and editing style may just be trying to keep pace with the headlong layout of exposition. A brief but very valuable and dispassionate historical introduction is quickly tossed aside in favor of in favor of shots in which some Suit rushes into an office somewhere, grabs a phone and shouts, ""WHAT? They can't DO that!"" And I couldn't tell who ""they"" were or what they weren't supposed to do.<br/><br/>Except for Affleck's robotic honcho, the performances are okay, and some are better than that. Thank God for Alan Arkin and John Goodman, who inject a necessary dose of humor and cynicism into the movie. Even without them, the movie would have been better than the average junk pouring out of the studios, if only because of its political and historical significance. Yet, I'm getting awfully tired of being yanked by the ear from one place to another. Why don't ""they"" take a breather and watch ""Lawrence of Arabia"" again?"

Ben Affleck needs desperately to read Timothy Weiner's Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA, which is based on thousands of recently declassified documents. <br/><br/>If Affleck ever does decide to make his way over to the library and educate himself, he'll regret having made this film, which glorifies the caustic incompetence agency, when in reality it should be shuttered for the good of people everywhere, including the United States.<br/><br/>A highly irresponsible film, given that the vast majority of viewers will believe that it portrays a true story."

Seriously, he was like a stick during the whole movie, it seem like he just didn't care at all. Only John Goodman and Alan Arkin including Bryan Cranston had good roles. What's really disappointing that Alan Arkin only appeared in the Argo for like fifteen minutes and already he deserves a supporting actor in a role? That simply doesn't make sense. All the other actors suck and bought nothing to the table. I seriously wanted to turn off the movie also because this Argo is terribly boring! No action, no suspense, no nothing.

","The movie suggests that it is telling the ""real"" story about what happened to the six Americans trapped in Iran during the Iran Hostage Crisis and how they escaped the country. It is a fanciful mumbo-jumbo of how the CIA, using good old American ingenuity, created this ingenious cover story of ""Argo"" and to the relief of the timid Canadians, who were getting nervous and scared about harbouring them, whisked them magically and suspensefully out of the country and back to freedom. All would be well, if it there was even a shred of truth to it. Instead, it is all fiction, but to a new generation of American youth, this will be how it ""really"" happened. You can hear them now chanting, ""USA!!USA!!"" <br/><br/>So why does Hollywood make a movie like this? Well, for one, you do not make a movie for Americans showing ""anyone else"" having to rescue them. Their egos just will not stand it. It has to be Americans who rescue their fellow Americans, for god forbid that the ""greatest nation on earth"" should ever be in a position to need rescuing!! A movie, based on the actual facts of the incident, remembered in history as the ""Canadian Caper"" would keep American audiences away from the cinema in droves. But bend the truth, make an American CIA agent the hero, and Voila!! Not only a box-office hit, but an Academy Award winner for Best Picture!! <br/><br/>Who cares if this pictures takes a dump on America's few remaining friends. England, who originally harboured the fugitives and then snuck them to the Canadian ambassador's house, and New Zealand, who actually helped transport the fugitives to the airport for their flight to freedom, were said in this movie to have ""Refused to help"". Well thanks for nothing guys. The Canadian ambassador, Ken Taylor, who in real life quietly led the US contingent through the airport and out of the country with no fanfare, just quiet common sense, is portrayed and afraid and clueless.<br/><br/>Maybe the moral of all this is, next time America needs help, their friends should tell them to go ask Hollywood."
"kids_ohana","10","12","25","9 November 2012"," A Rescue of the Ages
","A Rescue of the Ages<br/><br/>An Oscar nomination movie for sure. Argo is one of the best movies of twenty twelve and excellently combines historical fact with Hollywood drama. Adding in amazing actors like John Goodman (John Chambers), and Alan Arkin (Lester Siegel) was just a cherry on top. Lastly, the director (Ben Affleck) pulls off the challenging task to make the plot simple and never stops moving.<br/><br/>Predictably, whenever a movie based on true events come out, Hollywood does an amazing job designing a movie with little semblance to what actually happened. However, in Argo the movie stays remarkably close to what actually happened with small parts of added drama; where the plane is taking off and the cop cars are chasing the plane down or when they travel to the market. Even the credits of this movie are worth watching; showing pictures of the Iranians in the streets that have been recreated in the movies paying close attention to minute details.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the acting was superb. Alan Arkin (Lester Siegel) and John Goodman (John Chambers) were able to bring just the right amount of humor and playfulness to a serious movie. Meanwhile, Ben Affleck (Tony Mendez) brought the drama to the movie as the man sent to rescue the American hostages. Finally, the actors for the six Americans that hid in the Canadian embassy displayed an uncanny resemblance to their counterparts right down to their clothing. <br/><br/>On the other hand, Argo does not accurately show several events and people in the story. For example, America had a part but Canada played the main role in the rescue of the Americans. In addition, in the movie the Iranian rioters seem contrived and unrealistic; this demonstrates that director (Ben Affleck) did not either have a) the budget to accurately portray this shot, or b) that this scene was difficult to choreograph giving the nature of where the scene was filmed. However, if you are looking for a great movie and don't mind small miss portrayals then Argo is perfect.<br/><br/>Possibly, one of the hardest things in Hollywood to do is to keep the plot simple to understand and to keep it moving. Nevertheless, Ben Affleck pulls it off keeping the plot easy to follow and gripping. Moreover,with one quote from Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) he capture all the drama of the movie. ""Right... Look, I gotta tell you, we did suicide missions in the Army that had better odds than this."" <br/><br/>Argo, featuring great actors like Alan Arkin (Lester Siegel) and John Goodman (John Chambers) keeps the plot simple and concise while combining Historical fact with Hollywood drama. All in all Argo is a must see thriller."

As far as we're concerned, there is no difference between US and Canadian citizens when we watch TV. There are actually classes up here to teach Canadian actors to sound more American. Why...because a significant demographic of Americans don't want to watch 'Lesser' nations on THEIR TV. Shocking or abysmal to the more enlightened? Sure. So you change the facts to make the movie sell.<br/><br/>This is why Ben made the main protagonist American... for the 'Canadian Caper'; It sells.

","Yeah 1 star sounds extreme, I know. But the reality is that the people who actually saw the film need to bring the film's rating down somehow. <br/><br/>In reality I'd give this film 6 stars on 10. While Ben Afleck is a great actor and a great director, the script is just horrendous when it comes to the standards for what should constitute Best Picture.<br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/><br/>We are introduced to several characters. They are in Iraq when the people turn on the US embassy and start kidnapping the people in there. These characters are the 6 or so that escaped the mess and are seeking refuge in the Canadian embassy.<br/><br/>The first major problem of the movie is that none of these characters are characters. They have no arcs. And even worse, they have no static personality. It's hard to care about a group of people who don't display any form of humanity. <br/><br/>Anyway, next problem: Ben Afleck. While he shows that he can act, his character is also boring. He's divorced, he has a son that he cares about, he's the tough but smart guy who's gonna go in and save everyone. It's super unoriginal and his character doesn't do much to make you care about him.<br/><br/>A lack of character, and thus heart, really sinks the movie. Additionally, the film is not at all historically accurate, but I'll be honest I don't really hold things like that against a film. It's just worth noting, I guess, since some people get offended that the film is disrespecting historical figures through misrepresentation. <br/><br/>One more thing: I kind of found the depiction of Arabs as all insane kind of racist... it'd be awesome of they could have made some of the Arabs good people to fight that Western propaganda notion that all the Arabs are ""evil Al-Qaedas.""<br/><br/>THE GOOD:<br/><br/>John Newman and Christopher Walken's characters were awesome. I don't think it's how they were written, it's just that they are great actors to watch. They were a highlight.<br/><br/>Also, the directing was great. While I had no reason to care about the characters, Afleck still manages to successfully create tension during several small moments and during the final chase. <br/><br/>THE VERDICT:<br/><br/>This film has some value. It demonstrates Afleck's directing abilities, I enjoyed seeing John Newman and Christopher Walken's characters interact, and I did learn some history (even though it's inaccurate, I learned the real story by going on Wikipedia, would have never did that if I never saw the movie).<br/><br/>Yet, it lacks character, and as a result any humanity.<br/><br/>6/10. <br/><br/>A Best Picture this is not."

I tried watching it 2 more times from the comfort of my home, but I still wasn't very interested. Where the nominations come from, I dunno.

The CIA are trying to find a way to save 6 of the embassy workers who managed to escape the embassy during its takeover and are hiding in the Canadian ambassador's residence. The CIA comes up with the plan of creating a fake film company that's looking to make a sci-fi flick in the iranian deserts as a cover for bringing the escapees back to the US as part of the film crew. The historical accuracy is quite good, and it shows that there was adequate research done prior to the film.<br/><br/>The direction was also very good, as is the usual norm with Ben Affleck, whom I always respected as a director. The acting, cinematography, soundtrack are also quite excellent and the movie doesn't fall short of anything.<br/><br/>Especially towards the end it manages to hold you on your seat with suspense and then cheer at the outcome.<br/><br/>The problem with the movie is the hype. I do not feel that this movie deserves an 8.2 on IMDb nor the several nominations it has received. It's not a bad film, in fact it's quite enjoyable and performs well in every sector. However, it's still nothing spectacular. It doesn't make itself memorable. It doesn't provide anything of note to the viewer, it doesn't go much further than any other film. It's an average movie. I recommend it for everyone but, don't go in expecting to see the masterpiece of the year. You'll enjoy it as long as you forget about the praise the movie has received PRIOR to its release.

As a result, you don't get involved in the drama. The acting wasn't terrible, its just that the script, although based on a true story, sounded a bit amateurish.

","""Argo"" is the first legitimate Academy Award Best Picture nominee of the season. This movie is edge-of-your-seat intense. Kudos to Ben Affleck for directing a truly magnificent film. I just finished watching this movie, and I am absolutely whipped emotionally; my fingernail have been gnawed to the quick, and all I can think about right now is how I want to find out everything there is to know about this C.I.A. rescue mission. I am completely in awe with how much I truly enjoyed this motion picture.<br/><br/>In November 1979, as the US Embassy in Tehran, Iran, fell and the Iran Hostage Crisis commenced, six US Embassy employees were actually able to make it out of the US Embassy, and sought refuge in the home of the Canadian Ambassador. For almost two (2) months, these six (6) individuals laid in hiding at the Ambassador home before it got too risky for them to remain, and the C.I.A was called on to devise an exit strategy to get these individuals out of the country. The best ""bad idea"" by far was Operation Argo. <br/><br/>The C.I.A. would finance a Middle East Sci-Fi motion picture, complete with storyboards, script, press releases, etc. in order to allow one of their agents to pose as a Canadian Film Executive Producer. His mission would be to slip into Iran with the premise of scouting possible shooting sites for his film. Once in Iran, he would contact the six (6) US refugees and issue them fake Canadian dossiers, fake Canadian passports, and fake Canadian film credentials (i.e. – director, producer, writer, cameraman, etc.). The name of the film was called ""ARGO"".<br/><br/>Again, the intensity of the film is startling!! The scenes are well acted, well written, and impressively shot. Ben Affleck is a force to be reckoned with for his performance in front and behind the camera. And enough cannot be said about the writers Chris Terrio and Joshuah Bearman, whom I am sure, will also be well acknowledged and rewarded in this upcoming award season. Phenomenal performances by the films supporting cast as well, which included John Goodman as John Chambers, Alan Arkin as Lester Siegel, and Bryan Cranston as Jack O'Donnell. John Goodman's character John Chambers was awarded the C.I.A.'s highest civilian accommodation for his actions in this mission in real life.<br/><br/>GO SEE THIS FILM!!!! By far the best films to come out of Hollywood this year!!! I highly recommend this film. I love watching movies, and I REALLY LOVE watching GOOD MOVIES.

","Well, this movie was something. I had heard that it won some Oscars and being a big Breaking Bad fan, thought watching Bryan Cranston would be an enjoyable experience. Oh, how I was mistaken.<br/><br/>First off, this movie is ridiculously inaccurate. I've read how the character Affleck plays is only in Iran for 1 and a half days, and that it practically spat in the face of Canada - giving not half of the respect the nation deserved and played the ""USA! USA! USA!"" card.<br/><br/>Secondly, this film is incredibly insulting to Iran. OK, we all know Iran is not the most glamorous place in the world, however it is portrayed to be the equivalent of the bit of dirt and gum stuck between our shoes. In every scene, the Iranian people are angry, unforgiving murderers, executing people and generally causing havoc and terror<br/><br/>Finally, the actors are like cardboard cut-outs. Affleck has the same stupid face throughout the whole film and don't even get me started about the ""hostages"". I could not have cared less as to what happened to them. <br/><br/>Overall, this film is garbage. It is infuriating to think that this won an Oscar. This film is just a shot of pure American patriotism and misleading and false information."

I'm sure the real life story behind the film was very heroic but this certainly is not the film to tell it. <br/><br/>As for Aflek, frankly his performance was flat and lack lustre, it was almost like the whole film was a private joke between the actors ""lets see if we can bag an Oscar or two without actually performing!""<br/><br/>Watch the film as this is of course just my opinion, however take my advice and just don't pay to see it... you will thank me and if you thought the film was great, well hey you got a cheap night or entertainment!!!"

If Ben Affleck wanted something more exciting than the real life story, that took place in that place, in that era, he should've found a good historical fiction novel fitting the bill.

"cgerrits","Null","6","11","4 November 2012"," on the 33rd anniversary of the Embassy Take Over
","I saw Argo today. On what is 33rd anniversary of the start of the Hostage Crisis. While this was in fact a worldwide story, for me, I found myself awash with memories of that time and perplexed at the emotions this film triggered.<br/><br/>I have no recollection of the six who got out, though I am sure I saw it on the evening news. I do recall trying to marry the idea of how I could be safe in suburban DC while halfway around the World it seemed as if everything was falling apart. And I wondered how things like this could happen in the World. (Sadly, a question I still ask to this day.)<br/><br/>Superbly cast, an outstanding soundtrack, fantastic attention to detail. Argo is a story that is so far fetched that if it was work of fiction you'd struggle to find it believable. And yet. And yet, we sit in a dark theater, sniffling with strangers, gripped by a story that we all know the outcome of. <br/><br/>It was also interesting to contemplate how far technology has advanced in such a short time. One wonders in this age of almost instant communication how different the story would have played out if there had been facial recognition software and email instead of teletexts and telephones. Watching a character make a telephone call and waiting for someone to answer sparks the examination of how different communication was in a World where an answering machine didn't yet exist. <br/><br/>Also worth mentioning is the filming style. Cinematography was spot on. I started crying at the first shot of DC from the air. So glad Affleck didn't employ the popular ""hurky jerky"" filming method while shooting Argo. Though the times portrayed in the film were frantic I appreciated the subtle, patient portrayal of a story that unraveled like a spool of thread.<br/><br/>As a 6 year old child in the midst of a decaying marriage, and really, the start of my parents divorce, the Hostage Crisis is forever etched in my mind as a time of change not only in the World but also in my house. By the time we got to Day 444 I was in single parent home headed by the father. Was very poignant for me personally when a character in the film says that kids..""they need the mother."" That they dobut they also don't need to be in a house full of fighting and tension all the time either.<br/><br/>I challenge those of us old enough to remember that time to not be transported to who we were and what we felt back then; I challenge those too young to remember to learn about that time as see how years later repercussions still echo in our World today.<br/><br/>Job well done by all."

","It's got history in it, but it's not a history lesson. It's more of an exaggeration/dramatization of the true events it is based upon. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I mean it's a movie and we see movies to be entertained, which I think it did a relatively successful job. The acting is solid, the script is solid, the directing is marvelous. I said before with The Town: it isn't so much that the movie in-itself is a masterpiece, but rather it's the fact that Affleck has managed to pull it all together all himself, having a role in effectively every department of the movie. He's a great actor, writer and director. But having said all that, I don't think Argo is special enough to walk away with a Best Picture Win. It will get nominated for sure, but the movie isn't extraordinary. It's simply a solid feature, but it doesn't go to the next level to make it amazing. However, watch out for Scoot McNairy for a supporting actor nomination, and possibly a victory."
"Michael_Elliott","9","7","14","9 November 2012"," One of the Smartest Thrillers in Years
","Argo (2012) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Excellent thriller based around the secret CIA mission to try and rescue six Americans hiding out in Iran shortly after the hostage crisis broke out. CIA agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) decides to hatch a plot to make a fake movie and get the six out. It's only early November as I write this but I'm going to make a bold prediction that ARGO hears its name called out quite a few times come Oscar night. Director Affleck has once again created an incredibly well-made, incredibly tense and downright entertaining thriller that works on all levels and really comes across as something special. We've seen hostage movies before and we've seen political movies before but there's never been anything quite like ARGO. Thank God it's based on a true story or else who would believe this story? The secret mission of the CIA is just so incredible that it has to be true and using the Hollywood backdrop just makes for some pretty fun scenes and especially when you know a couple of the names like Oscar-winner John Chambers. The actual look of the film is quite striking as you certainly feel as if you're in the middle of the 1979-80 time period. Affleck has a great eye for the style of the picture and the cross between the 2.35:1 aspect ratio and some of 8 and 16mm footage. The performances are also another major plus with Affleck, Alan Arkin, John Goodman and Bryan Cranston all doing terrific work. Each and every actor no matter how small or major their part really comes across terrific and this helps brings so much credit to the story. I'm certainly not going to ruin the final thirty-minutes but they'll have you on the edge of your seat the entire time. After GONE BABY GONE and THE TOWN, Affleck had certainly put his name on the map for young directors and now ARGO just takes that to a new level. This here is certainly one of the best movies of the year and one of the smartest and most intelligent thrillers in a very long time."

","What do these have in common? <br/><br/>Both generated great gobs of money, both represent a dramatic distortion of the truth, both take another significant chunk out of American credibility.<br/><br/>It is bad enough that a majority of America receives its education (17th or lower in world ranking) from movies, in Argo's case ""based on a declassified true story"". When Ben claimed, in a recent interview, that the reason the Canadians integral role (90% Canada/ 10% USA - according to president Jimmy Carter and those actually involved) in freeing the hostages was not represented truthfully, he brushed it off quickly by commenting that ""there was not enough time to fit it all in"".<br/><br/>In other words, for Ben, making the Americans ""centre of the universe"" even under the guise of docudrama, trumps truth. The reality is that the small role the CIA did actually play, had the real potential of getting the hostages killed on their way out of Iran. Historically (pun intended) the CIA espionage folk put a wrong date on the passport stamp - which if not detected, and altered (again by a Canadian) would have meant instant detection, and potentially certain death on their way out of the airport - not to mention what would have happened to the Canadian embassy personnel.<br/><br/>Dramatic license must be extended to any historical account for time constraints or the inevitable lapse in research, however, when the focus is to distort and or pervert the truth, everyone involved suffers.<br/><br/>Ben in recent award shows, still attempts to use his youthful ignorance and surprised- face to pass off this travesty of history. I don't buy that, or the movie - nor should anyone interested in the truth. Historical accuracy can be every bit as dramatic and entertaining as BS with the added bonus of attracting a wider audience and staying on the charts for many more years.<br/><br/>No doubt, all those, who have or will receive monetary gain from this schlock will rally to its defense, somehow.

John Goodman, and Alan Arkin both showed some of the best work they have ever done, and my soft spot is for fellow Canadian Victor Garber who can play just about any role he puts his mind to (with the exception of comedy).

","In 1979, the Islamic Revolution overthrows the dictator Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who came to power sponsored by the United States government, and the leader of the revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, assumes the power. The Iranian revolutionaries invade the American Embassy in Tehran and the American officials are taken hostages.<br/><br/>However, six officials flee from the Embassy and are secretly hosted by the Canadian Ambassador at his residence in Tehran and the CIA directors summon the agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), who is an expert in bringing American citizens back to their country, to plot a rescue plan to save the group. Tony Mendez plots the most incredible plan to bring the six officials: to create a fake Canadian film to be shot in Iran and include the officials in the production crew. Without other alternative, Tony Mendez receives green light from his superiors and travels to Hollywood to set in motion his almost impossible mission to rescue the group. <br/><br/>""Argo"" is another great movie by Ben Affleck with a story that is the true Mission Impossible using a movie that was never made.

"Nz_amiri","3","4","7","21 November 2013"," Argo far from the truth
","In order to achieve better understanding of Argo, it's needed to know more about the Iran Hostage Crises and at the first step we should know about the effect of this event on both American politics and public opinion. It wouldn't be far-fetched to claim that Argo is the most political production of Holly Wood in recent years, although it claims to tell the true story of the secretive CIA operation to rescue Six fugitive U.S. diplomats who received refuge from the Canadian ambassador, hiding and fearing their possible discovery and execution, but obviously it is a device to show off American Champion Husbandry hat rooted in American exceptional-ism and the belief that America's Success is due to its special genius. So Argo tries to replace the American bitter experience in the Iran hostage crises with the sense of honor and success, by trying to depict a prominent CIA operation in a heroic way. It is undeniable fact that this event had a high negative affect on American's mind about what they always brag about themselves. ""The United States Is responsible for Most of the Good in the World and American are fond of giving themselves credit for positive International developmentsassuming that God is on their side""(StephenM.Walt 2011). According to this perspective and approach, we see after three years, In a May 1981 New York Times retrospective on the Iranian hostage crisis, A. M.Rosenthal ruminated about the effect captivity had had on the nation's psyche, he asked: ""Why the anger, the sense of mourning for those 52, who after all were government servants and expected to take risks when they served abroad? Who made the United States look like a clown?"" Then he argued that Americans mourned because ""not just the 52 but all Americans and worse still, our very government, had been taken captive and held in that embassy""(SCOTT 2000). In fact he tries to introduce the Iranian hostage crisis as an updated captivity narrative which emphasized the necessity of confrontation with the ""other,"" fears of innocents being violated, and the call upon heroic leadership to rescue both the hostages and the nation from threats to American identity. So this interpretation shows that ""The hostage crisis can be placed in the larger context of efforts to secure an American identity over and against fundamental threats, a practice grounded in ""zero-sum analysis of international action"" and a ""willingness to draw lines of superiority and inferiority between us and them""(SCOTT 2000) So we face a sort of existence of the notion of dualism in Americans culture which tends to define American social identity based on a specific quality and deeply discriminate between ""us"", as an American, and ""them"", between the ""self"" and the ""other"", and this is done usually because of a political motive. And Argo is a movie completely conforms to this view point of ""others""(Mousavi 2013). In a quite exaggerate way, Ben Affleck in the film Argo portrayed Iranian as savage and brutal people screaming lunatics rampaging around the streets and introduce every Iranian character a yelling indigenous nuisance and a suspicious bureaucratic stooge, or an absolute moron, The Iranians showed in Argo are in essence a screaming, loud mass of hysterical people. They torch flags, bang on cars, hit and stab innocent people and exploit children. They are frightening, suspicious, and essentially violent and aggressive. On the other hand, Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck), has appeared as a savior, and the six hostages are portrayed as heroes, who are all kind, compassionate and loving towards each other. This is the struggle to state the differences between ""us"" and ""them"" in American ideology. Throughout the movie, in all the scenes, Ben Affleck tries to highlight this sense of otherness, which are illogical, and threaten us (Americans) and fearing them is inevitable. The shadow of danger, threat and violence is the permanent theme of the movie, all the people are scary, the conditions are appalling, and the hostages are like defenseless lambs among wolves. Innocents are killed and are executed by hanging from cranes in public. Even old women are dreadful! Now the Mythic hero, Tony Mendes, in an extraordinary way survived the hostages that are being considered as the other movies heroes, from such a complicated situation in interaction with some savage moron security guards, For example in a ridiculous Chase and escape operation in film, you see the Revolutionary Guard chasing the plane in order to stop it! Instead of simply force the plane to land by the Iranian air-force. Cultural critic Nicolini states that Argo completely neglected to provide the Iranian side of the story, and said: ""The film is a sanitized version of the events."" She argued that ""there is nothing authentic about the film's manipulation of historical events,"" and described the movie as ""pure political propaganda."" <br/><br/>According to all points we mentioned, we can conclude that Argo tries with new narrative of the Iran Hostage Crises to bring the sense of success to Americans and make them 'feel proud' of the U.S and specially the CIA, because of it's worthy of praise in the underground operation. So we see Ben Affleck in the film Argo is twisting the truth in order to introduce Protagonists come out looking like heroes. Movie makers have a responsibility when making movies based on the truth to let people know what really occurred. When they don't they are actually guilty of trying to change history and worse people believe what they see on the screen. The film Argo instead of focusing on revolutionary Iran and having a neutral approach to submit the reality of that era events, tries to focus on the 'white Americans in danger' storyline. It's a story about Americans exceptional-ism, by introducing The United State as responsible for the most of the goods in the world. Lester Siegel's sentence can be playing a very enlightened role for this claim, when he says (after the survival of the hostages): we made history tonight!"

","Argo showcases the little-known Canadian Caper during the Iranian Hostage Crisis of 1979-81. Six US embassy workers had managed to escape capture and were secretly hosted by the Canadian ambassador and another Canadian embassy worker. After about three months, all US citizens managed to escape with fake passports on an ordinary scheduled flight. Nice story, happy ending. What adds some zazz to the story is that an elaborate cover story was created, in which the group of Americans had been scouting in Iran for a film location for a cheesy sci-fi flick. To corroborate this, a film script was created (or actually, re-used), a production company was set up, ads were put in Vanity Fair.<br/><br/>Fantastic story, but one that doesn't actually translate well into a movie. The storming of the embassy creates the movie's only visually dramatic scene. The agony of spending three months in a fairly cushy prison doesn't come across well on the big screen. The same goes for the setting up of the Hollywood back story. The film then tries to create a second dramatic highlight when the group has to go through passport control before boarding the plane, and it does so with lots of old-fashioned Hollywood cheese. In the end, the plane is chased across the runway by cars full of gun-wielding soldiers but manages to take off. Whew!<br/><br/>Argo isn't terribly bad or anything, it's just unremarkable."

The U.S. government tries to figure out a way of getting them out of Iran, and a CIA specialist, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) is brought in to consult.<br/><br/>After exploring their limited options, Mendez finally suggests the cover story of making a science fiction film, having the escapees be Canadian filmmakers looking for foreign locations. One important element: It has to be a real script, with a real producer and director, publicity, an office, everything. When the option is brought up to the escapees, they're not enthusiastic.<br/><br/>The Hollywood sector, played by John Goodman and Alan Arkin, supply the humor, and they're hilarious. On the Iranian side, we have suspense and tension as Mendez and the escapees posing as a Hollywood crew carry out the plan. The question is, can they get on a plane and out of the country? Affleck keeps the tension going and the ending is sheer edge-of-your-seat.<br/><br/>I don't understand how this film can be nominated for a Best Film Oscar and the director ignored.

","Solid direction. The movie starts very strong and basically continues well, however the actions and the entire cover-up story seem unnecessary - just until the final part, where every piece falls to its place in a manner that is way too unbelievable. It's like a James Bond movie, where Q gives Bond a gadget - and you know a specific situation would come when Bond will need just that exact thing. The entire last part is just too unrealistic in cinema terms. I haven't read the details of the true events, but I highly doubt ANYTHING was SUCH a close call. I especially hated the ""Apollo 13""-like ending.<br/><br/>Tension is kept throughout the movie, but the problem is that you already know there's going to be a happy ending (even if you knew nothing about the real events, like myself), so it loses a much greater potential it could have had otherwise.<br/><br/>Still, Affleck once again proves himself as a very competent director and the production design is excellent - from a non-professional eyes it looked completely believable as Iran, both in terms of locations and people. I think it deserved a nomination for production design. Alan Arkin was good as always, John Goodman was nice but didn't have a lot of material to work with and the rest of the cast were ""ok"" in their parts.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a good movie.

","It has been a month since I have seen this and I am struggling to write a comment, because of what I know I will see in another CIA-supported movie: Bigelow's movie about Bin Laden.<br/><br/>All movies bring history into the story, but movies 'inspired by actual events' take serious risks. My problem is not particularly about this movie. Oh, I've carried a prejudice against Affleck, because of his first film. As popular as it was, it got MIT wrong, NSA of the era wrong, and mathematical hunger wrong. Written by townies, it blew a tremendous opportunity. Both Damen and Affleck have done fine work since, and this one is surely a well made film. I am imagining that limiting himself to a 40 year old cinematic vocabulary, and relying on Clooney's experience made it easier.<br/><br/>The problems are that movies of this kind are market-driven, which means we see what we want to see. When you combine that with political agenda, you can get into serious trouble. Bigelow signed a contract with the CIA allowing them control over what is shown, and they used that to promote the lie that torture worked. We don't know what constraints Affleck is under; I assume they are inherited from the book which in turn would be constrained by the Agency.<br/><br/>In both cases (Bigelow and Affleck) the actual stories are engaging enough. Affleck didn't have to insert all that last minute cliffhanger stuff. He didn't have to make it seem that Canadians did little. He didn't have to make up that stuff about Carter. There was no reason to omit the planning for the disastrous rescue mission for the hostages. He could have noted that the current president of Iran was a leader in the 'student' invasion. He might have introduced the reason the US was so tepid in its response, related to lost nuclear technology that is now in the news. I suppose all of these may have been 'suggested' by the Agency liaison.<br/><br/>Oh well. <br/><br/>I did like the narrative folding. Here we have a somewhat fake movie about a somewhat faker movie, the two woven together by the notion of manufactured stories. That main fold is obvious enough. <br/><br/>I also liked the insertions — not on the book — of the internal movie references. The first was the direct copy of sets and movements from 'All the President's Men,' subtly establishing the work of the men we see as rushed creative discovery of the right story. That worked for me. <br/><br/>The second is the background thread about the man and his boy. Affleck's character is separated from his son. The movie he is 'working on' is a film where a father goes into an exotic land to rescue his son. At the end, we see him miraculously restored to his family, with a storyboard artifact denoting the new narrative. It was a bit too obvious for me, but well crafted narrative folding.<br/><br/>Viewers may be interested in the actual movie. It was not a raw, discarded script that was developed. It was instead a well developed science fiction movie that failed to get financing. Because of the legal limbo, the Agency was able to appropriate it. It was a real movie, and one whose notions are also folded.<br/><br/>It was written by Roger Zelazny, a then best selling Scifi author whose gimmick was to appropriate a magical world from religion or the occult and stage a story within a simplified replica work built on the pre-existing cosmology. His 'Lord of Light' adopted Hindu notions for the purposes of body-sharing. It was the basis of the script which was to be the biggest budgeted movie of the era, filmed while a theme park was built in parallel. The notions of relative truth in religion, of mixed identities, of intrigue, of manipulated fabrication can be folded into the richness of viewing this if you know about it.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
"Turfseer","6","4","7","2 January 2013"," Affleck employs dramatic license to make CIA Iranian rescue operation more suspenseful than it actually was
","I enjoyed 'Argo', but some people are talking this flick up as an Oscar winner for best picture. That I cannot see. However, it is definitely a story worth telling as it's a fascinating tale and reminds Americans about the dangers of a country like Iran.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most gripping part of the film is the opening, as the US embassy is about to be taken over by fanatical 'students' and supporters of the Ayatollah Khomeini, who just returned to Iran as a result of the 1979 revolution. Ben Affleck does a great job in chronicling how US embassy staff members went about shredding classified documents, minutes before the embassy compound is taken over by the fanatics. Equally fascinating is the way in which the six US staff members make their escape, as they simply walk out on to the street from an adjoining building, while the crazed Iranians are focusing on attacking the main part of the compound.<br/><br/>When I first heard about 'Argo', I thought the whole operation was much more extensive, involving a whole film crew entering Iran and actually beginning to film a phony movie there. It wasn't quite that complicated. CIA operative Tony Mendez's plan was simply to create the illusion that a movie was going to be made in Hollywood, by taking out an ad in a trade paper and holding a 'table read' of the script, which was covered by the press. Interestingly enough, the producer played by Alan Arkin is a fictional construct; only John Goodman's character, John Chambers, the Hollywood make-up artist, actually existed.<br/><br/>As the Argo story develops, with Mendez flying to Iran posing as a Canadian film producer and establishing contact with the Iranian film board, it all seemed quite plausible. And when Mendez takes the six members to a bazaar in the city, where their cover is almost blown when confronted by an angry crowd, that also seemed quite real. But when we finally arrive at the crucial scene, where the six must get past an Iranian ticket taker at the airport, without any proof that they actually came into the country, I wondered if that happened the way it's depicted in the film. It turns out that in reality, the Canadian ambassador's wife purchased three separate sets of tickets on three different airlines for the six embassy staff members. <br/><br/>Even more historically inaccurate is the suspenseful scene in the film, in which the Carter administration cancels the mission just as Mendez is about to attempt to whisk his charges out of Iran. In reality, the mission was canceled for only thirty minutes and that occurred BEFORE Mendez left the United States.<br/><br/>Finally, perhaps the most suspenseful part of the film, the confrontation with the Revolutionary guards at the departure gate, the call to Hollywood to confirm Mendez's cover and big chase out on the runway—none of that ever happened. Even without prior knowledge of the true history of the events depicted here, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that the chase on the runway was pure Hollywood.<br/><br/>Does Affleck's 'dramatic license', diminish the film's overall impact? Frankly, yes. Too much of what goes on, seems a bit far-fetched. Nonetheless, 'Argo' is still quite entertaining and is worth the price of admission. More credit should have gone to the Canadian ambassador Taylor, in his role in saving the US embassy staff members (the closing credits merely allude to the great co-operation between the US and Canada and say nothing specifically of Taylor's heroics). <br/><br/>Finally, I was most impressed by the casting choices for the six embassy staff members. The ID cards of the actual escapees are shown during the closing credits, juxtaposed with the actors playing them. Take a look at the resemblance between the real and the fictional characters. It's uncanny!"

","For a long time I haven't seen any movie who symphatises CIA that much. Especially timing of movie is interesting if we look at today's relations of Iran and United States. Movie is supposed to tell story of 6 US citizen stuck at Iran, however it just shows how Iran is bad, how Iranian's are full of hate and anger, all woman in street carries gun, sellers in Bazaar trying to fight with any tourist that they can see... I realized there is no single Iranian plays good character in the movie. Only decent and pretty face Iranian character according to script was a maid who doesn't help her government to find some suspected 6 individuals. This makes you good in the movie. Also it was fun to see machine gun security guards was asking for a key from a Swisss Cabin crew member in their own country, in their own responsible duty areas. This is no way possible in any part of world. I am curious who admires details in this movie did they ever thought about it. <br/><br/>For me this is a typical politics involved movie, creating a base that Iran deserves anaything don't worry if our CIA with full of good heart people does something in the world.

Every review I read about it, praised it, and said it was one of the greatest movies of the year. But I really expected more suspense and a better storyline. Of course, it is based on real events, but still I think Affleck could make it a little bit more thrilling. 60/70% of the movie is just about the preparations.<br/><br/>I don't think it was a bad movie.

"Willie-12","9","4","7","21 November 2012"," It's Time Affleck Gets The Attention He Deserves
","It's not an accident. There's a reason that Ben Affleck continues to shine as a filmmaker. As an old professor of mine once said, ""Consistency will expose you...either for good, or for ill."" And consistency has exposed Affleck as one heck of a filmmaker. He has now directed three films, and every one of them have been tremendous. First there was Gone Baby Gone, a film that was at the top of my list of best movies of 2007. Then there was The Town. Now, even though I didn't think that The Town reached quite as high as GBG, the difference between them was negligible at best. It's like saying which one is better: A million dollars or $950,000? Obviously a million's better, but I'd take the 950 Gs in a heartbeat. And now we have Argo. For me, so far, this is hands down the best movie of this year. Now that might change over the next 6 weeks or so, but I don't see that happening. Once again, Affleck directs in a way that makes it very evident that he has complete control over every detail of a film. I mentioned this in my review of The Town, but I'm going to mention it again. There are very few directors who can achieve that type of meticulous control, and still deliver an almost perfect product. And make no mistake about it...this movie is darn near perfect. Especially considering the fact that I knew how everything was going to turn out, and yet towards the conclusion of the film, I was on the edge of my seat. And so it's time now. It's time that Affleck gets the attention that he deserved to get with Gone Baby Gone, and The Town. And the attention better come in the form of two Academy Award nominations: One for Best Picture, and one for Best Director. If it doesn't happen this time around, then the Oscars will have comprehensively, and epically failed to accomplish their goal of nominating the very Best Pictures of the year. The only thing that I'm disappointed about, is the fact that we're probably going to have to wait two years or so before Affleck's next film. But I guess that's o.k. I'll just pass the time with a few more viewings of Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and Argo when it comes out on Blu-Ray."

","In French, we have this proverb saying: ""This was arranged by the filmmaker"". At the end of ""Argo"", we can guess that the conclusion of this story was arranged a little bit for more dramatization, but it's alright. I was a student during these events and I recall it quite well. The help of the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor was essential for these people. I also remember the harsh comments made by Ronald Reagan, right after all the other hostages came back safely in United States. Everybody knows that the previous president Jimmy Carter did all he can to bring back these people. It's real fine from Ben Affleck to let Carter speaks during the credits. It's a well deserved way to thank him. Alan Arkin is absolutely great in here, and he certainly deserves another Academy Award for his performance."

The whole cast do a great job with fantastic turns from John Goodman, Alan Arkin and Bryan Cranston. Affleck delivers one of his best roles in a long time. His performance as a man that has put everything on the line, including his very life, to help these six strangers is what gives the film its strength. He's an unshaven, borderline alcoholic man that has set his mind to saving people on the other side of the world. That cocky-as-hell-smug-American thing Ben Affleck was once mocked for is no longer here.<br/><br/>Behind the camera Affleck's work is equally as impressive. Realism is the key here. He pours a huge amount of detail into every single scene so that being convinced is one of the last things the viewer has to worry about. There aren't crazy visual flourishes or fascinating editing techniques to be found - just damn good filmaking to be enjoyed. Every moment is filmed with a confident hand that incorporates Rodrigo Prieto's excellent cinematography and Alexandre Desplat's great score. Chris Terrio's screenplay manages to work as a cracking thriller with brains. It's a true story but, of course, certain liberties must be taken when developing a true story into a movie. The climax is exciting and nerve wracking but a little bit too ""Hollywood"" in the way that plot-lines and events all coincidentally lead up to the same point in time. But hey, it works.<br/><br/>Argo feels like a classic film. It's a great showcase for Ben Affleck's filmaking and acting abilities. He has crafted an excellent period thriller that will resonate with today's modern day audience and will please cinema-goers that want a smart, suspenseful film that leaves you more than satisfied. It ain't perfect but it's damn close."

","To put it simply, this is a great movie. From the opening scenes that set the stage all the way to the stressful and exhilarating climax, this film is jam-packed full of excitement. <br/><br/>The movie starts with a few scenes from the revolution in Iran in 1979. The American Embassy is stormed and hostages are taken. However, a few of them escape the embassy, and getting these escapees out of Iran is the central focus of the film. The story is very well-written and thought provoking. While it does dramatize the events, it doesn't overdo it. The film never relies on action sequences, special effects, or even an epic soundtrack to create the tension; it's all directly derived from the story. I definitely see an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay in the near future. <br/><br/>As far as acting is concerned, every character is great. I particularly enjoyed Bryan Cranston (although that may be because I love Breaking Bad so much), because he was believably hilarious and serious at the same time. Ben Affleck does a great job with the lead role, but his character is quite static and somewhat one-dimensional. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, I just could have done with some more back story of his character. All the other supporting actors are great, and I particularly enjoyed the actors who played the hostages. I'd never heard of any of them, but they all did a great job. <br/><br/>All in all, this film is great. Great acting, great cinematography, and best of all, a great story.

"inkblot11","10","7","15","17 October 2012"," Superlative! Ergo, don't wait to see Argo
","Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) is called into a top CIA meeting soon after the country of Iran grabbed hostages from the American Embassy in 1979. Since the ""people"" of Iran booted the Shah from power and installed Ayatollah Khomeini, they are extremely unhappy that the Shah was given refuge in the United States. Hence, the hostage situation. But, what the Iranians don't know, at present, is that six diplomats escaped their own compound and found quarters in the Canadian embassy. Even though the government workers tried to shred important documents as the mob stormed the building, the new folks in power have put families in the task of re-assembling the pieces of the papers! Since resumes and photos of the staff are included, it is just a matter of time before they realize that some folks fled their clutches. Enter Tony. The CIA informs him and others at the meeting that the Canadians can't keep these folks indefinitely. So, how to get them out? Various proposals are put forth, from suggesting the six bicycle out of Iran, at a great distance, to giving them new identities as Canadian teachers or agricultural missionaries. None seem too plausible. But, Tony comes up with an even more outlandish idea. Why not pretend the six were in Iran as Canadian film makers, working on a sci-fi epic called Argo? Holy Darth Vader! But, since this is the ""best bad idea"" available, the USA puts Tony in charge. Naturally, he must make the situation as real as possible so he enlists a Hollywood producer (Alan Arkin), a well-known makeup artist (John Goodman) and an upper level G-man (Bryan Cranston) to help him work out the details. Even so, when Tony flies to Iran, it is with the knowledge that this is a very risky affair, which could result in the torture and death of all those involved. Will Mr. Mendez succeed in rescuing those Americans in peril? What a superlative piece of film-making this is and a triple threat from Oscar winner Affleck. Ben produced it, directed it, and gives a thrilling performance as Tony. Let's all suggest stuffing his arms with trophies! Also, the rest of the cast is likewise wonderful, with Arkin, Goodman, and Cranston turning heads, too. As a movie based on true events that weren't even made public until 20 years after the fact, Mr. Mendez is one of the most unsung heroes this nation has ever had. Naturally, the settings in Iran and Turkey are most exotically wonderful and very great care has been taken to re-create the looks of the late seventies. Well done. Most importantly, Mr. Affleck chose a Middle Eastern narrator to open the film, with a short history lesson on the reasons for the situation. As such, the CIA's coup d'etat, which ousted the duly elected Iranian leader from the fifties and placed the Shah in power, gets the culpability it deserves. Also exposed are the Shah's acts of torture on his own people and his plans to ""westernize"" this Muslim country. No, Affleck doesn't hammer these points but audiences should better understand, if they don't already, why there is such discord between Iran and the United States, to this day. The only minor caveat of the movie, which will not be so for everyone, is that there is a good deal of offensive language in the tremendous script. So, be aware. Nevertheless, don't miss out on one of the year's best films, no. Ergo, see Argo NOW."

"DICK STEEL","10","5","10","14 November 2012"," A Nutshell Review: Argo
","Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and now, Argo. Ben Affleck scores a hattrick with three acclaimed films that shows off his directing chops, and you'll probably find it tough to find anyone not convinced he makes a better director than in front of the camera as an actor. Producing the film with George Clooney and Grat Heslov, who did the award winning Good Night, and Good Luck, Argo is also based on history (with its fair share of dramatic licence of course) that uniquely combined Hollywood's role during the tumultuous times of the Iran hostage crisis of the late 70s to 80s.<br/><br/>With US-Iranian ties probably at one of its lowest points, the historical backdrop of this film provides a reminder of sorts to the escalation of conflict and how the US foreign policy of the time had set the agenda that sowed animosity for decades. It's also very much one sided, given that it's after all a Hollywood film, that provides perspective solely through the eyes of the CIA protagonist Tony Mendez (Affleck playing the role himself), an exfiltration expert, tasked to find the best amongst the worse solutions available in order to save the lives of six US diplomats who were temporarily holding up at the Canadian ambassador's house, with each passing day a day closer to them being found out, and possibly publicly executed.<br/><br/>There's the involvement of the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber) since their cover identities happen to be Canadian, revolving around a film crew who are in Iran to scout for locations for the titular science fiction space adventure, not to mention real fake passports obtained, and the provision of lodging for weeks of confinement and safe haven. And things aren't put in any positive light as well on the Iranian side, with the checkpoints along the way falling down like bowling pins without too much of a fuss or fight, and being none too smart in the way the treatment allowed for the inevitable outcome.<br/><br/>Like his previous film, Affleck crafts Argo with heist film tendencies, setting up the situation, the game play, followed by its execution, only for surprises to be kept to a minimum, but still having paced this with tension so high, you'll find yourself at the edge of your seat as the plan moved along at breakneck speed. Based on declassified material, some elements had literary liberty taken to spice up the plot, so it worked purely on the entertainment front, and not a substitute for a proper history lesson, which I suppose after this there should be a lot more interest in the Jimmy Carter administration's handling of the matters highlighted here. The inner workings, politicking and bureaucracy in various agencies from the CIA to the White House also gets its fair share of the spotlight<br/><br/>And let's not forget the more fun moments of the film where Tony Mendez had to act like a big shot in Hollywood, in setting up the bluff with special effects/costumer John Chambers (John Goodman) and producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) in making their pre-production efforts believable in order to lend credibility to Tony's cover when he moves into ground zero and provide the necessary training for his principals to memorize, with the usual spanner thrown in the works that come from within the group, and from external forces so that this is no walk in the park. Spy versus spy movies are always full of sexier moments, but this one pared these down to be closer to reality, where operations boil down to meticulous preparation, good old fashioned hard work, politics and to buckle down and be ready for any last minute emergencies that may come your way.<br/><br/>Technically, this film grabbed me right from the start when the old 70s version of the Warner logo came up, together with great attention to detail paid in recreating production sets, wardrobe and even had its film quality made to resemble something coming out of the era, relying also on archived footage to lend that documentary feel to the retelling of the Canadian Caper, as it is known. The purposeful casting and makeup also made the supporting cast look uncannily similar to the persons they're portraying, adding a degree of realism as well. Production values remain top notch throughout, with an unobtrusive score provided by Alexandre Desplat, that lent a hand in accentuating the many moments in the final third of the film when the action for this high risk mission kicked into high gear.<br/><br/>I guess everyone everywhere just can't resist the allure of Hollywood, so it makes it easy to pull wool over one's eye. The production of Saint Jack during its time to snook the authorities here is testament to it, though here it had a greater degree of danger attached, and through Ben Affleck's steady directorial hand, makes this one of the best films this year to sit through. A definite recommendation!"
"rhjones004","10","6","13","6 November 2012"," Funny how it's always about oil
","An excellent film, with more tension than the Golden Gate Bridge ;) The tone was set early on with the historical context, showing how the west created the circumstances that led to the Revolution in the first place, by installing the Shah and then supporting him irrespective of the human rights violations in his country (of which he claimed no knowledge, as the film shows). The filming of the protects and siege of the embassy were very realistic - at some points I thought they were using original footage.<br/><br/>Being of an age where I remember the events quite vividly, knowing Iranians with family back in Iran and Brits working there at the time, the film brought all that back to life for me. I didn't need the events around the actual escape spiced up (as Affleck has admitted) as the tension was already there. Just having the housemaid quizzed at the gate showed the tension and menace graphically enough for me. The scene in the spice market showed the chaotic mayhem that existed at that time in the country - no one was really in charge, anyone could take it upon themselves to exercise a bit of revolutionary action of their own.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get a true feeling about what such an event is like, including the psychological impact on those involved. One wonders about the Revolutionary Guards who slipped up that day - did they make it or was an example made of them? It shows that whenever you have an upheaval in a country - just as in the more recent Arab Spring events - the outcomes are very uncertain and the forces unleashed are almost uncontrollable."

"ironhorse_iv","8","3","5","10 April 2013"," A real movie about a fake movie.
","Nice movie full of thriller about Canadian Caper created and develop by Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck). The caper was a joint covert rescue by the Canadian government and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to try to get six American diplomats out of Tehran, Iran after the hostage events of the United States embassy of 1979. The six evaded capture during the seizure of the United States embassy by escaping to the home of Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber). Tony is inspired by watching Battle for the Planet of the Apes and begins plans for creating a cover story for the escapees being Canadian filmmakers scouting for exotic Middle Eastern locations in Iran for a similar science-fiction film with help from his superior Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston) makeup artist John Chambers (John Goodman), and film producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin). From all the supporting characters, the best is Lester. Alan's Lester get most of the great funny lines of the film. The Hollywood producer is the only one who is essentially fictional. Which is a bit ironic, since the character is himself presented as the embodiment of Hollywood BS. The real life 'Argo' screenplay that the CIA used to create their cover story came from an adaptation of Roger Zelazny's 1967 novel Lord of Light. It was once supposed to be a real attempt to produce the movie with the book's original title. After that production attempt had failed, it was utilized by the CIA, and the title was changed to Argo due to a knock, knock joke. As much as the movie tries to make glorified the CIA, the main source to help the diplomats. In truth, the role of the Canadian government particularly that of Ambassador Taylor in the extraction operation was 90% of the contributions to the ideas and the consummation of the plan. There are other historic inaccuracies that the film does, like saying that British and New Zealand's embassy turn the diplomats away. Grossly inaccurate. Sorry to burst your bubble, but all problem moments in the film, were dramatic license and not history. At best, it can be called ""based on true events"". Still, it's tries to give history about Iranian's culture in the opening, and the end credits, by posting the real life people side by side with that of the actor's portraying them. I didn't like Jimmy Carter's voice over talking about the events, as it felt like self-gratification for something, he hardly work on, just approve on. The movie kinda felt like propaganda. It felt like to demonize Iran, maybe since we (USA) still in conflict with them as of the time of this writing. But that depends on the context. In my opinion, it's a story that need to be told. But overall, the film to be honest gives a totally wrong picture of Iranian people. Showing them so savage in this movie or back watering. At the time of revolution there was an Anti-American atmosphere, as the Shah of Iran has been supported by the American government. Even though the revolution went in a wrong way. Today, Iranian people are more close to American people in battling for freedom and democracy in Iran. I hope this film is demonize that country's government, not its people. The film is excellent, but it will do nothing to further ""peace talks"" between US and Iran. If a silly film recently can ignite the murder of a diplomat in Libya, what will this one do? The action was great. I had to pause the film several times because of the tension. The screenplay for this film had some really slow parts. The thing that still picks at me about this situation was the lack of depiction of any of the 6 having, for lack of a better phrase, ""Survivors guilt."" One of the six diplomats, actor Scoot McNairy who plays Joe Stafford is made out of be a big time annoying jerk who question everything. He states out that he is mad at himself for keeping his girlfriend in the country when they could have escape. Later when Tony gives him an ideal plan of escape, he question it, and threating not to take part of it. This is awfully writing for that character. I've never really been a big Ben Affleck fan over the years but I have to admit, this was quality work. He should directed more. His acting in this film was OK. Not much to say. The film feels really genuine. If you're looking for some sort of ""Black Hawk Down"" shootout/rescue, than just get that movie and don't even bother with this. There is action, but not the one 'action movies' are based on. This is about doing it with no gun battles and car chases, and no one losing their lives and still getting the job done. Overall, I give it a great watch. Was it worth, winning Best Picture? Maybe, but it deserve that win. If you don't like the film, Argo you know what to yourself."

","I'm not going to add any vitriol to the debate about this movie's qualities. It's a story which should stand on its own two feet as a gripping account of an actual event. So why cheapen it with bits of fiction and poor scripting? Why leave gratitude for the Canadian role almost as an afterthought towards the end? Why not show the stress which the Canadian Ambassador must have endured, just as the stress of his guests was depicted? He, his family and staff were in just as much danger. Why dismiss the sensible actions of the British and New Zealand Embassies in one line: ""The Brits and Kiwis turned them away"", without explaining that the sudden arrival of a bunch of North American accents would stick out like a sore thumb to visitors and local staff alike in those diplomatic posts? Why the fictitious car-plane chase on the runway? The story had all the drama it needed from start to finish, without any help. The only partly obscured American flag in one of the closing scenes is the clue to the shortcomings which downgrade this effort to average entertainment when it could so easily have been much more worthy."

","Somewhat-overrated suspense film with 'colorful' Hollywood overtures involves Ben Affleck as Tony Mendez, real-life exfiltration specialist for the CIA whose bold plan in 1980 it was to get six Americans home from strife-ridden Iran, where they have been in-hiding since November 1979 when the U.S. Embassy was stormed by protesters over the CIA's involvement in Iranian politics. Mendez concocts a genuinely flamboyant plan--disguising the terrified group as Canadian filmmakers in the country to do pre-production work for a science-fiction film--but nothing about Affleck's leadweight performance suggests this kind of imaginative thinking. Affleck, who also co-produced and directed the film, does a good job at laying out the complicated scenario, however his button-pushing tactics at the final gate (leading to a nick-of-time climax) are a bit cheap. Audiences may feel the good will, and certainly the milieu is vividly captured. Alan Arkin, as a passed-his-prime movie producer, and John Goodman, as a Hollywood makeup artist, are both fine in support, though this section of the picture is undernourished. **1/2 from ****"
"tieman64","Null","3","5","24 January 2013"," CIA green-lights Affleck movie; Jason Bourne facepalms
","Directed by and starring Ben Affleck, ""Argo"" is based on a now declassified military operation which took place during the Iran hostage crisis of 1979-1980. Bizarrely for a western film, it opens with a segment which briefly sketches Western ""involvement"" in Iran. The gist of the segment is this: in 1953, the US, UK and their respective corporate cartels staged a coup and successfully overthrew the democratically elected government of Iran (specifically Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, who was set to nationalise local oil). They then installed Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, a brutal puppet who ruled as Shah of Iran until 1979, at which point he was overthrown by a local revolution led by religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini.<br/><br/>""Argo's"" introductory history lesson doesn't tell us this, but despite the rise of Khomeini being presented as a populist and spontaneous uprising, he was partially backed by both the US and UK, all with the specific aim of ousting Pahlavi, who had grown too big for his boots. Prior to his ousting, Pahlavi had begun to flex his muscles, refusing to sign away exclusive oil rights and beginning a programme to seek ""oil-sales policy independence"". The superpowers didn't like this. They staged another illegal coup, and the CIA began courting the Muslim Brotherhood and the Ayatollahs, all essentially right-wing fundamentalists. These clandestine operations echo CIA orchestrated coups against democratically elected officials in Guatemala, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Haiti, Guyana, Cuba etc etc, most of whom were trying to implement reforms, nationalise resources or help the poor. Can't have that.<br/><br/>Shortly prior to the toppling of Pahlavi, a ""soft war"" was waged against Iran. The West refused to buy Iranian oil, began a campaign of economic pressure, planted covert agitators to fan religious discontent, put embargoes in place, staged oil and banking strikes and began cynically protesting the presence of ""Iranian abuses of human rights"". Meanwhile Khomeini, who was being groomed to be the new leader of Iran, began appearing on Western news networks, which willingly gave voice to his propaganda. The message was clear: Anglo-American intelligence was committed to toppling their puppet. The Shah fled in January and by February 1979 Khomeini had been flown into Iran to replace the Shah's government and proclaim the establishment of his own repressive theocratic state. Almost immediately, the US began funding Iraq's decade long war against Iran.<br/><br/>Over the years, whistle-blowing would reveal the point of the Iranian fiasco: the radical Muslim Brotherhood movement behind Khomeini was endorsed specifically in order to promote the balkanization of the entire Muslim Near East along tribal and religious lines. In encouraging autonomous groups it was hoped that chaos would spread in what was termed an ""Arc of Crisis"", which would spill over into Muslim regions of the Soviet Union. Of course such arrangements never go quite to plan, but then, chaos partially was the plan.<br/><br/>""Argo"" takes place during the 1979 Iranian Revolution. During this Revolution, Iranians stormed the US embassy and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. Six American diplomats present in the embassy escaped and secretly found shelter in the home of a Canadian ambassador. ""Argo"" tells the story of the CIA's mission to rescue these six. It finds Affleck playing CIA hostage expert Tony Mendez, who concocts a brilliantly ridiculous rescue scheme. His plan? To pose as members of a Canadian film unit scouting locations for a kitschy science fiction movie. At its best, the film works as a comedy which pokes fun at science fiction conventions, the incredulity of Mendez's idea, and the assortment of Hollywood oddballs he gathers together in an attempt to execute his plan. Various cheesy scifi tropes – multi-ethnic aliens getting along – have the larger effect of humanising Iranians, science fiction used to warmly build bridges across a very specific West/East divide.<br/><br/>Elsewhere Affleck tries to take on bigger themes – the power of the media over the gun etc – but fails completely. His film eventually degenerates into a safe, conventional thriller. And despite its brief introductory coda, which pays lip-service to Neocolonial intervention, the film ultimately ignores the West's abhorrences and magically devolves into a thriller in which cunning CIA heroes evade menacing, monstrously portrayed Iranians. Iranians are still the enemy, prejudices are reaffirmed, the CIA is glorified, history's whitewashed and the film is designed to be self-aggrandising for Western audiences. Affleck's opening coda provides a veneer of objectivity, but the film itself salivates over the CIA, cool US foreign ""intervention"", and is hilariously blind to the political context in which it was shot and released (a decade of US military occupations on either side of Iran and an ongoing embargo and covert war on Iran itself). After all, six American lives are at stake!<br/><br/>Affleck (he'd play the pro-CIA Jack Ryan) and Matt Damon (he'd play the CIA hating Jason Bourne) wrote ""Good Will Hunting"" in the mid 1990s. That film contained a funny monologue in which Damon's character justifies never joining the NSA/CIA. If he joins, he rationalises, he'll be responsible for getting foreigners killed, foreigners he has no problem with, all so oil friendly puppet dictators can be put in place, which in turn will lead to his buddies losing their jobs at home to jobs outsourced to the enemy he just killed, all in the name of oil-spilling, environment killing oil cartels who then jack up pump prices on both him and his buddies. Damon's solution? Why not save time, ""shoot my buddy, take his job, give it to his sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard? I could be elected President."" <br/><br/>6/10 - Affleck's trying to conjure up 1970s political thrillers (""Missing"", ""State of Siege"" etc), but his source material is severely limiting; ""Argo's"" very funny first half quickly collapses into heavily censored, CIA sanctioned thriller clichés. Worth one viewing."

","You have seen this film before, only it was called differently and was about something else. The tricks are all there, the artificial tension moments, the eye tearing speeches and scenes, the brave people, the evil henchmen, etc.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck received an award for this film, but I can't really see any reason why other than Americans really liking their own stories and rewarding people for telling them. The acting was OK, but nothing spectacular. Actually, there was no role in the film that felt particularly demanding. The ""dramatization"" of the story was so cliché that I felt like barfing and it all took two hours. Worst of all, all the good scenes were in the trailer already.<br/><br/>Bottom line: this is an average film, made with leftovers from different TV shows and running on a recipe for this kind of movies. That isn't all bad, since we have enjoyed some of its kind before, but for an avid movie goer like myself, I've seen too many clones of the same thing and this brought nothing new. Luckily there is always at least one generation that falls for the cheap TV movie tricks that they employed here."
"david-546","5","3","5","31 December 2012"," I wanted to score this higher but.......
","OK it won best picture. But it really didn't deserve it. I stand by my original review of Argo. At least Ben briefly said Canada somewhere in his thank you. I think he may have even mentioned Ken Taylor by thanking Taylor. <br/><br/>I know. Don't get me wrong. As a thriller it was tension ridden and it did provide its thrills. That alone would have given the film high marks.<br/><br/>But..... As an historical thriller it is important to pay attention to the truth and not get all caught up in Hollywoodland. Oh sure a big part of the story was right on the truth but Ben just had to go and play with parts of it in order to make his thriller.<br/><br/>First off they underplayed the role of the Canadians and Ken Taylor. Sure they acknowledged the role of Taylor and the Canadians at the end but that was only after Affleck received complaints and actually talked to Ken Taylor. What you didn't talk to him before hand? Ben - he was a very important element in this film. It just wasn't all Hollywoodland and the CIA. Without Canada Argo wouldn't have happened. Canada was key. And it was the Canadians that pulled this off. Not Tony Mendes and the CIA. But then I am Canadian and we were slighted. <br/><br/>Second don't play with the credibility of the film. The story is already an incredible one. Why mess with it. Excuse me but Ben and Cranston talking on the phone as if they are in the same time zone just doesn't hold water. Worse the Iranian revolutionary guard calls the studio in Hollywood to confirm that the crew are who they say they are and once again we are led to believe that they are all in the same time zone. Give us a break. That couldn't happen.<br/><br/>But it was the ending where the film came off the wheels. The different time zones were bad enough but what the revolutionary guard don't have a telephone to call the tower and tell them to hold the plane? Worse that chase at the end was pure Hollywood. It didn't happen. Why again mess with the truth. Oh not enough thrills for the Hollywoodland audience? Give them a chase to get everyone excited.<br/><br/>Before that there was the tense scene through the marketplace. Great tension. But...... It never happened. Again another piece of Hollywoodland. <br/><br/>The film really held me throughout until we went into wind down and then it was WTF. Suddenly this very credible film about a real event turned into a Hollywood thriller complete with chases. Please. We are big boys and girls. We can handle the truth.<br/><br/>The opening was great giving us background. While I knew the background I am sure many wouldn't. So it was important to tell the US audience in particular that yes it was the US CIA and the British MI6 that helped arrange the overthrow of the an elected government to install their puppet the Shah. Controlling the oil was/is important to the west and they will do what it takes. The revolution of 1979 didn't come out of nowhere.<br/><br/>We did stay out of the politics but yes the Iranian hostage crisis destroyed the Carter Presidency. And we later learned that the incoming Reagan Presidency pre-arranged the release of the hostages on his taking office in return for arms and other favours. But that was Iran-Contra and another story. As well after the US government armed Iraq and the 8 year war was on between Iran and Iraq.<br/><br/>The Canadian caper as it should have been known was already an incredible story. Instead Ben turned it into a Hollywood thriller complete with a chase scene and rah rah American flag waving. <br/><br/>Best Picture of the Year? Not on your life. The Oscars blew it again."

Argo is a really well written, well directed, gripping movie, that spins easily between high drama and sharp wit. The fact that it's based on a true story is an added bonus.<br/><br/>Not only is the movie very enjoyable and tightly produced, but it's shot like one of those great 70s thrillers, like The China Syndrome or The Taking of Pelham 123. From the film stock to the production design, Affleck really covers every possible base in making a great looking period piece set in 1979 Iran.<br/><br/>Alan Arkin is glorious as the producer and there are some good laughs amid the tension, but in the scenes in Iran, it was easy to forget I was watching a movie, because it felt so authentic.<br/><br/>I came out feeling smarter. Is there any higher praise?"

","Following the overthrow of the Shah, Iranian students invaded the US Embassy in Teheran and held the staff hostage. 6 people escaped and took refuge in the Canadian Ambassador's residence, and the CIA mounted a covert rescue operation whereby the fugitives would be flown out in plain view, but in the guise of a unit carrying out pre-production work on potential Iranian locations for a Star Wars rip-off movie.<br/><br/>This film dramatises a true event and, if a little bit of research is to be believed, makes more of it than was actually the case. I don't mind that at all, because this is a fine film. The story is terrific, full of tension throughout, and the fact that these events of 30 years ago still reflect the current tensions in the Middle east mean that we can accept the oppressiveness, the peril, and the fear, as absolutely believable. This is one of the reasons why the film is so successful, the other is that everything is assembled perfectly. Ben Affleck as director has done a terrific job in making this film, and does just as well heading the cast. The rest of the cast are also excellent, and the images with the end titles show how well they captured the look of their real-life counterparts.<br/><br/>There is humour, as the trailer makes clear, but this is a tense drama even though you know the outcome from the start (and this is probably the film's greatest weakness: there are no surprises. This is far from being a deal breaker, though).<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"davidgee","8","3","5","15 November 2012"," Die Hard ending takes the edge of the ""docu-drama""
","The tension throughout ARGO is extremely close to excruciating. The scenes of fanatical mobs on the streets of Tehran (Istanbul stands in very believably) are seriously scary. A shot of a man hanged from a crane reminds us of the fate that would have awaited the six escapees hiding in the Canadian residency - and their 52 embassy colleagues who were held hostage for a year and a half. The Washington scenes have the frenetic bustle and urgency of TV's WEST WING. <br/><br/>The drama goes slightly over-the-top in the final scenes at Tehran airport, with some DIE HARD moments that threaten to undermine the story's credibility. Overall though, with excellent performances, a taut script, and direction (by Affleck) that gives the flavour of a documentary, this is a nail-biter of a movie."

","After a few minutes of setting the context(for us Westerners who might have forgotten or repressed it... this is very honest about the US' role in these things, even the negative; it does also make them out to be the main solution ultimately, but in ways, this is a Hollywood picture... a great, smart, entertaining one), we see the events leading to the hostage crisis, and six Americans get out of the backdoor, unseen, hiding in the house of the Canadian ambassador, though they still need further help... and when Jack Bristow calls for backup, you know things have gotten serious. This never for a second lets us forget the fury(this is tense from start to finish(and all from human beings, with next to no guns or chases - instead, methodically setting up and gradually escalating conflicts, you can follow it all never wondering how something suddenly happened), getting extremely close to being overpowering yet never crossing that boundary... in particular the claustrophobic scenes are unforgettable) of the Iranians(who are people, with faces, with tragic stories... we understand and sympathize with them, and there is basically no villain, nor a wholly wrong side), cutting between them, the codenamed Houseguests, and the CIA who frantically try to come up with a cover for sneaking them out - including exfiltration expert Tony Mendez(Affleck, too pretty to portray a damaged spy... alcoholic? Heavy smoker? Come on... sure, he's got a beard that makes him look like Garner had him sleep on the couch for a week, but still; in spite of this, he is otherwise convincing), who comes up with the idea of a fake movie(which becomes a big deal, making the point of how the medium captures our attention and inspires our imagination, a running theme). This leads to jokes about the business(done better than many other times) with Goodman as a make-up FX guru and Arkin as an eccentric producer. And with the intelligence agents, particularly our lead(who continues to be incredibly impressive as a director) and Jack O'Donnell(Cranston, determined), there is some black comedy, to relieve the pressure of knowing you might be dead tomorrow... it's funny(as two thirds of the material in this is, without detracting from it being nailbiting, rather, the two complement each other), and credible, as the entire thing is(until the contrived climax). The production design makes you believe it's the late 70's, with the huge glasses and porn moustaches. Every character has motivations that make sense, feel real, and the ones we don't spend much time with are effectively developed with the dialog and screen time they do get. The acting is great from all(the one complaint one could make is that there is no standout, no Jeremy Renner), and the cast is phenomenal(some of them getting far too little to do, like Philip Baker Hall!). There is a lot of disturbing, often violent(not bloody) content, a moderate amount of strong language, and brief female nudity(topless and from behind) in this. I wholeheartedly recommend this to any fan of political drama-thrillers. 9/10"

Ben's acting looks like someone acting. It's high school level at best. The story was 100% predictable. I almost shouted out each event as it was about to happen. The song placement and period set pieces were the worst part of this film. ""Make sure you pan over to the Star Wars figures, and dwell on them for a long time, a little longer, and CUT!"" We get it. He paid big bucks for Van Halen and a Led Zeppelin songs and they were totally wrongly placed and ran too long. (Cuz they paid big bucks for them, see?) Dance the Night Away comes on and I'm like ""What? Here?"" then it runs for like 10 minutes. The only good thing about the Led Zep song placement is that he put the needle on the right position of the record, though that was by the band's insistence. Ben can't act. Ben can't direct. The reason Argo won was because it glorifies the Hollywood elite and the Great Jimmy Carter."

","The fact that it is based on a true story gives additional value to the plot - regardless of authenticity claims or wishes. As the embassies are usually the places where even the fiercest enemies dare not to attack because their grounds are considered territories of respective countries and unauthorized entry is equal to declaration of war. But this hostile takeover really took place in Tehran in 1979 and only more severe events in Afghanistan prevented this conflict from emerging into a real war.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck has done a great job in creating true background and atmosphere, giftedly combining documentary and feature film frames. Tensions and race with time are maintained throughout the movie, characters are realistic and human, not self-destructing persons full of pathos as we see in many similar US movies. All the cast is good, but the finest roles are performed by John Goodman and Alan Arkin who - not being state officials - are more relaxed and witty.<br/><br/>Recommendable to those fond of historical thrillers. Moreover, the movie helps to comprehend many issues related to current Iran."

","Suspense thrillers most of the time work for me because the protagonist most of the time are forced to think outside of the box, which is part of why the bad guys lose because they never expect such an unconventional but well thought out move. Ben Afleck is one of my favorite actors and is really on track to becoming one of my favorite directors, out of the films he's made so far this is probably my favorite of his. This film is one of my favorite suspense thriller and what makes it great and all the more suspenseful is the fact it's based on something that actually happened.<br/><br/>I really like most of the accuracy of the film, it captured the look and feel of the transitional period of 1979-1980. From fashions, hair styles, cars, some old news clips you name it it's all there. This helped in successfully portraying the situation of civil unrest going on in Iran and the hostage crisis going on. But also most of what happened in the film did happen, in the end credits we see comparison with real life photos and scenes in the film.<br/><br/>The characters all are good. I really liked Ben Affleck as Tony Mendez, I love the fact he's not portrayed as some cliché stereotypical straight laced C.I.A. agent but just an ordinary guy that is best at his job of extracting people from nervous situations. You really get a good feel for him, as he is on mission you can tell behind the eyes he struggles to keep cool and is constantly concerned for the six people and if he really can pull this scheme off. I really like the fake movie cover scam Tony cooked up, which I personally felt was a great idea. It was unconventional, creative, plausible, most importantly actually worked. Let alone the fact the fake movie is a sci-fi and I'm a huge fan of that genre which made the scam all the more cooler.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston is great as Jack O Donnell. I like that he's not some cliché blowhole boss which I am personally sick of (honestly they can't be nice) but is actually a boss that is on the main protagonists side and a friend.<br/><br/>Alan Arkin as movie producer Lester Siegel and John Goodman as the late great makeup artist John Chambers are both great, they both helped make the scam a reality but I just love the fact both are selfless, their simply taking an opportunity to save lives which I feel is what any good person should do. I even like that there is some humor with them, Alan Arkin's character has some really funny lines like ""If I want to make a fake movie I want it to be a fake hit."" I felt that was kinda funny because he's right, one of the best methods of hiding is to be in plan sight.<br/><br/>Even like the six house guests which we don't know deeply but you do get a good feel for them which made them all the more sympathetic. Their all tired, on edge, just want to go home. I even like little moments like one of them has a little monologue where he regrets his dession to stay and should've listened to his wife at that time. That kinda thing I can sort of emphasize with, where in the aftermath of something you think back and realize if you did this or that at that time then you wouldn't be where you are now.<br/><br/>However for me what really made the film was in the suspense and story. I wouldn't say it's so much edge of your seat because you already know the ending of the film, but it's nerve racking because you wondering how. The pacing is good, it's not boring, I like some of the technicalities to make the scam work and most importantly you are constantly concerned about Tony and the six as they are going though the motions and taking action. There are some moments that make things nervous and kinda scary, like the security checkpoints they have to go though, driving though angry protesters. But also how there are scenes where we see some organization is slowly but surely putting together to pieces of the shredded mug list, this is sort of the time limit element we know once they complete the mugs of the six missing then they'll catch wind of the scam which is something were constantly hopping won't happen.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great film, Argo is an escapist journey.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"

","One of the truths you'll face once you start reviewing stuff with any sort of regularity is the fact that the hardest thing to review is something that's utterly average. It's not particularly good, but you can't in good consciousness call it bad either. So what do you say about it? For me, that's Argo in a nutshell.<br/><br/>Based on the 1979 Iran hostage crisis, it tells the story of American citizens trapped behind enemy lines once the Iranians seized control of the US embassy. And thus it's up to Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), a CIA consultant, to come up with a plan to smuggle the Americans out of the country. What we end up getting is a pretty good heist film, with the usual genre clichés and traditions. We have the plan, the rehearsals, the characters, the double talk, the tight situations. Yet it all stays grounded, because this thing actually happened. There are no high-speed chases or glamorous nightclub visits or over the top villains.<br/><br/>And that's kind of the problem. I'm not claiming that it should have any of those things, or that it's boring because it's trying to be realistic, but the fact still remains that not much happens on screen to capture our attention. The film actually starts very well with the storming of the embassy, but then we cut to Affleck's character and the film comes to a screeching halt as we spent what feels like hours just following this nondescript guy around as he tries to come up with a plan. And the plan itself is actually pretty interesting. I was getting kind of invested in this weird movie they were using as a cover. But then, just as it was becoming interesting, we cut back to the hiding Americans and we start the whole process of building up interest once again.<br/><br/>I really feel that I do not belong to this film's target audience. Because it really is a good film. Academy Award for Best Picture kind of good. It's just that its way of telling the story and its willingness not to emphasize the story in any way leaves something to be desired if you're like me, a guy who watches films for escapism. And in the end that's what this review is all about. It's my two cents about whether you'll like this film or not if you're like me. And thus I can safely say that I don't think this film is bad, and I'd even recommend it if I knew someone to be into realistic thrillers, but I didn't particularly enjoy it nor would I watch it again."

","Not unlike Katherine Bigelow's 2008 decent, but overrated ""The Hurt Locker"", this is not a film that merited an Academy Award nomination, let alone a win in multiple categories, because it dealt with a very limited (in scope and human importance) specific time and place, rather than a universal and timeless theme. And so it will simply not enjoy or realize longevity in the must- have, always-want-to-watch DVD category. The fact that this was nominated for and did in fact win Academy Awards is testimony to the vapid mentality of the Hollywood establishment. All-too recognizable character actors and an all-too easy directorial style rend to reducing this movie to merely interesting for the discerning."
"robertmike57","6","2","3","4 November 2013"," Spy Thriller Fiction Movie Inspired by a True Event
","I watched this movie just vaguely knowing it had high praise and won best motion picture and vaguely aware that there were people upset by it being inaccurate. I then read about what the actual events. This movie is nearly all fiction in its depiction of the extraction of the Americans from Iran. Of course, there would be no movie but a documentary devoid of drama if it was providing a historic account of what happened.<br/><br/>So I review as Argo as to the entertainment it provided as a Spy movie. On that level, it's above average, but far from great, let alone best picture. I found it engaging for a majority of the movie as that it drew me into the story and engaging. It did a great job of providing the historic background, costumes, news reports and the mindset of Americans in 1980. I enjoyed the fictional subterfuge of creating Argo the movie setting the stage for the CIA to rescue the Americans.<br/><br/>Argo falls far short after that . The subplot of Ben Affleck's relationship with his son seemed contrived and as I learned afterwards was fiction. The constant over the top message these escaped Americans faced certain death was forced, a far more likely scenario is they would had been placed with the other embassy hostages. The movie starts falling apart at the end of the 2nd act with Ben Affleck clichéd spy decision to buck the boss' orders to call off the mission. I can't envision the real life spy Bob Mendez doing such a thing. The 3rd act plunges into the ridiculous with its overwrought climax of the sinister hyper vigilant Revolutionary Guard chasing the plane carrying all 6 passengers in military vehicles and police cars. What would had happened was Iran would had ordered the Swiss Airline to land or the Iranian air force would had been dispatched to force the plane to land, if any of that were true.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck as director was great, Ben Affleck the actor, not so much. He would had serve this movie better by giving much more credit and screen time to the Canadians role in assisting the Americans. I give this movie a 7, but deduct 1 point for the deception this was a true story."
"chrisbrown79","3","2","3","5 September 2013"," Great film, if you ignore the lies
","This is a great film, well executed and full of suspense.<br/><br/>However I did take exception at the dishonest representation of the US's involvement in events, as summarised by Wikipedia:<br/><br/>""...the film gives the impression that the CIA managed the rescue almost single handedly, when in fact it was primarily orchestrated by the Canadians. Former President Jimmy Carter acknowledged this in an interview in 2013, whilst also praising the film. In addition, the film incorrectly states that the six American diplomats were turned away by the British and New Zealand embassies. The American diplomats actually spent one night in a British diplomatic compound before it was agreed by all involved that the residence of the Canadian Ambassador would be better suited.""(Wikipedia: Canadian Caper)<br/><br/>I would have given this a much higher score had Canada's involvement been portrayed fairly and the lies about the British and New Zealand embassies had been omitted. As a film about a factual political event which could still have been excellent if told truthfully, I don't see why it needed to be used as a vehicle for US self-congratulation.<br/><br/>Shame that what is superficially a fantastic film becomes quite disappointing when you do some research."
"Luigi Di Pilla","6","2","3","1 September 2013"," Munich is better than Argo
","I expected more drive and suspense. The first part was a little bit boring expect the first ten minutes. Only in the second part the countdown began finally but too late for me to give Argo more than an average vote. There are some slow paced sequences that could have been better. Ben Affleck directed this terrorist movie quiet well. In my opinion the other drama movie Munich has been realized much more credibly and cooler. Perhaps the stuff was not enough to develop more depth. Anyway, a great plus in Argo Is the real created atmosphere of the late 70ies. All mixed with nice rock music hits of that time. I liked a lot also the last scenes with the plane taking off Iran. I think that Argo is too overrated here and I would still prefer Munich even it is longer to watch. A must see in this genre is The Debt. Final rating: 6/10."
"bkoganbing","8","2","3","27 March 2013"," Hollywood Hyperbole
","Ben Affleck who originally got acclaim for his collaboration with best bud Matt Damon on Good Will Hunting, went out gloriously alone and came back with a Best Picture Oscar for Argo, the story of one of the greatest hoaxes ever perpetrated in the last century or even in the short time this century has been around. I'm sure Matt Damon would love to have had a piece of this one.<br/><br/>Based on writings of CIA operative Tony Mendez who engineered the escape of six American diplomats who were lucky enough to get out of Iran during the Ayatollah Khomeini craziness during the Iran hostage crisis, Affleck who sports a heavy beard that makes him totally unrecognizable as Affleck, but no doubt Mendez had such a growth. Only the voice lets you know from time to time that it is Affleck.<br/><br/>Our protagonist has a history of pulling off good intelligence coups and he's given an assignment by his superiors. When they learn that the American diplomats are hiding at the Canadian ambassador's home he has to devise a scheme to get them out. He's one of several people put on this problem. His solution is to appeal to the Iranian's sense of celebrity. Affleck creates the cover story of a movie being shot in Iran, a science fiction spectacular like Star Wars and these folks were there scouting locations in the desert. Hollywood contacts John Goodman and Alan Arkin were most helpful, their sense of Hollywood hyperbole comes in handy. In fact both make several jokes about the movie capital. Arkin got a Best Supporting Actor nomination.<br/><br/>Of course we know what happened. I remember the news breaking that the Canadians had gotten these diplomats out who should have been hostages along with the others. The Iranians huffed and puffed and vowed divine retribution on Canada for aiding the Great Satan. It all came to naught however.<br/><br/>Argo which is the title of the pretend science fiction epic so far represents the summit of Ben Affleck's career. Why he did not get nominated for Best Actor and Director is quite beyond me if the Academy thought the film that good. Now that the story is declassified we now see that the CIA can occasionally get it right."

Oh they must be so stupid...<br/><br/>I liked parts of the movie, it definitely had the artistic touch & the good performances & I enjoyed the brilliant presence of Alan Arkin, but all in all, it's just a paid propaganda, just another part in the never-ending anti-middle-eastern media campaign, just like Homeland which shows Beirut - the best place in the middle-east for nightlife activities & hangouts & tourism - as a safe haven for terrorists.<br/><br/>Was Argo good ? It definitely was, Did it deserve all the hype ? Off course no, Ben Affleck deserved more appreciation for the great jobs he did in both ""Gone Baby Gone"" & ""The Town"".

The spicy and interesting lines, the skillful and sophisticated rhythm control, the style of editing, the meticulous costumes and props as well as the suspense atmosphere are all outstanding parts of the film.

It really brought this part of history closer to me, even if some events didn't happen like that and were added for dramaturgical purposes. Also 'Argo' focuses on a small but very interesting part of the hostage taking, so don't expect everything to be covered. In the end when the credits roll, you can see how scaringly close they came visually to the actual events in 1979/80.

"StonedMagician","9","1","1","27 July 2019"," Excellent: 9.5
","I've never thought much of Ben Affleck. He was in that awful Daredevil movie, Armageddon, and Paycheck. All in all, not exactly the greatest resume for any actor. But then he made The Town, and my opinion changed dramatically. Here was a well-written, smart, suspenseful action thriller set in my native Boston that also happened to be the best heist movie in years. But I thought it was just a fluke then. Argo proves, without a shadow of doubt, that not only is Affleck capable of acting, but of directing as well. And not only does he pull off a feat of Hitchcockian suspense, but he makes what just might be the best film of the year. Argo takes place in 1979 during the Iran Hostage Crisis, during which the U.S. Embassy was stormed by political extremists and all but six Americans taken hostage for over eighteen months. The film follows Tony Mendez (Affleck), a CIA extraction specialist charged with escorting the six out of Iran safely. He ultimately chooses to create a fake film, and cast the six Americans as some of the production crew. From this point forward, the suspense is continuous, somehow never, ever pausing for a breath. The crew nearly starts a riot for photographing a storefront. A political protest blocks their only exit. The pictures of the six are reassembled by the Iranians, and are recognized to be missing. One of the men can't remember his fake credentials. The entire operation is cancelled while Mendez and co. are still in Iran. Not even the occasional jab at the Hollywood mentality can lighten what is a heavily emotional film. The writing is absolutely superb as well. Each character is a fully realized human being, with hopes, fears, and doubts about their survival. Each one reacts differently to their situation, a remarkable feat that makes each one a unique character, rather than a bunch of differently-colored flags that must be returned to base. In addition to simply being a superb experience, the historical aspect is very well realized. This is not a film about the Iranian Hostage Crisis; this is a film IN the Hostage Crisis, right down to the smallest details, from the post-Star Wars sci-fi craze to Russia's invasion of Afghanistan. Of course, I will not reveal whether or not the entire caper succeeds, but know that there as much hope as doubt throughout the picture, making success and failure seem equally plausible. Political thrillers everywhere have a higher bar to leap. Trust me when I say this, people: this is a good one."

However Argo is not like that, although I was a little cautious at first Argo is a fantastically gripping series of acts from start to finish. Ben Affleck deserves all the plaudits on this one, i never expected to like this one but due to his raw talent of filmmaking as well as acting he has created a masterpiece out of a little known but technical story. The end is sheer suspense. That is due to the built up scale of terror and trouble you know these victims are in.

"slokes","5","1","1","24 May 2017"," Making It Up As He Goes Along
","Hollywood movies get a lot of flak for messing with the truth. Sometimes it's because people don't appreciate that compromises have to be made to fit in a two-hour window. Other times, like ""Argo,"" the compromises wind up compromising what's on screen.<br/><br/>November, 1979. In Tehran, Iran, the Islamic Revolution is flexing its muscles. After the deposed Shah goes to the U. S. for cancer treatments, the U. S. Embassy is seized in retaliation, its personnel now hostages to pressure the Shah's forced return. Six Americans who escaped the embassy now hide, their days of relative freedom numbered.<br/><br/>It's a tense-enough situation, but director Ben Affleck and the creative team behind his star vehicle ""Argo"" can't resist giving audiences extra tension. His superior (Bryan Cranston) warns him of the high stakes if the refugees are discovered by the Iranian revolutionaries:<br/><br/>""Standing room only for beheadings in the square...These people die, they die badly.""<br/><br/>Did anyone think that was really going to happen? Iran had gone insane, yes, but the hostages at the embassy were still alive. The psychological tortures they endured, outside of being paraded blindfolded for the cameras, wouldn't become public knowledge until much later.<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine the Iranian revolutionaries so put out not having six more hostages. For all the introductory talk about the CIA propping up the evil Shah, the real reason for taking hostages isn't addressed in the film; Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor, whose embassy sheltered the refugees (who would become known as the ""guests"") points out in a DVD extra that there were four major factions in Iran fighting for supremacy. The hostages became a trump card for the radical Shiite faction. They didn't care about having all the embassy personnel, or they wouldn't have let some go in the days immediately after the takeover. What they wanted, and got, was the attention of the international media.<br/><br/>This would still make for an interesting film, if not one with totally fictional devices like car chases and an angry confrontation at a Tehran bazaar. You would need a director and screenwriter with more of an interest in the six refugees and their search for help in the days before reaching the Canadians than as simple MacGuffins for the main character, Affleck's exfiltration specialist Tony Mendez, who gets all the big close-ups.<br/><br/>The most egregious departure from the truth also makes the least sense within the confines of what's on screen: That Mendez opts to make his play to evacuate the six after being told the operation is a no-go by higher-ups in Washington. There was no such decision made at this late stage of the operation, but I guess Affleck felt he needed it to juice up the plot. Time and again, you sense Affleck just played with the real story like this, to give him an excuse for the heavy music and dramatic close-ups. Here, what you get, in the context of this already compromised story, is a guy who risks the six people on an operation that may never get off the ground.<br/><br/>I wish I minded all this messing around less, because I really do enjoy watching the movie. The editing is tight, the comic relief is funny, Affleck plays a cool hero with engaging poise, and the period costumes and set design are first-rate. I finally found out where my childhood collection of Hardy Boys books went.<br/><br/>Alan Arkin has a part as an irascible Hollywood producer which is a lot of fun. Many of the film's great lines are his: ""John Wayne is in the ground six months, and this is what's left of America.""<br/><br/>The Canadian Caper, as it is rightly known, is a good story. Too bad ""Argo"" does such a poor job of telling it. I know movies are like history's second draft, meant to be reviewed and put in the right context, but ""Argo"" pushes the entertainment button too often and winds up missing the mark."
"singlaa22","7","1","1","2 March 2017"," worst Oscar best picture winner ever

The 80's - or rather the late 70's atmosphere is well present in the movie despite somehow simplistic set-ups and presence of spare era elements - cars, clothes, etc.<br/><br/>The movie does a poor job of expressive the Iran atmosphere of that era, or at least the daily life or a hint of the culture of Iranian people under the regime, probably because it was filmed on a budget and mostly not on location.<br/><br/>So the plot line is quite well written and filmed. What's is shocking is the rave reviews considering the main character play is null. Unless you are a hard core fan of Ben, there is just no play from this character. He has decent play in other of his films, but here it seems he's forcing himself not to show emotions or expressions. The remaining of the cast does an OK job, Goodman is up to the job but all of them seem detached from each other, acting individualistically.<br/><br/>There are other historical hostages crisis movies out there, some of them are magical, tense and impregnate with local atmosphere of the specific times. This movie is not even at the bottom of the list."

No need to bring your crying towel here at all, but for a little insight into Iranian culture, and patriotic fantasy? this is your movie.<br/><br/>I am not even interested enough to do the research that would probably yield a true answer to whether this movie is really based on fact. Many reviewers contend it is not.<br/><br/>It is a wonderful premise, and could have been so much more, with proper development of the characters, even if not true.<br/><br/>It does bring out an idea I have been convinced of since the unarmed folks trying to make their way across a bridge to better conditions in Texas were shot by authorities during the horrific aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The government is definitely our enemy as normal working folks. You, as the majority, would be wise not to forget that.<br/><br/>This movie brings that to the forefront, with the official line of abandoning the mission, and it took two individuals to bring it off.

","A story about people escaping from Iran by pretending to be a SciFi film crew? A great concept for a movie! Initially I didn't realise this was based on a true story. I thought it was just someone's quirky take on a espionage thriller. It just goes to show that fact is often stranger than fiction.<br/><br/>Shame then that the execution of the movie was poor. Ben Affleck failed singularly to create any real tension throughout, bar a half- decent scene at the airport in which the Americans almost get caught at the last hurdle.<br/><br/>I think the biggest problem is that there's too little focus on the diplomats trapped in Iran - who should have been the main and most interesting characters. After a superb opening scene which features the Iranian Revolution, the focus switches to the US and the production of the fake SciFi film. Various Hollywood characters are introduced such as fake producers, that seemed boringly superfluous to me.<br/><br/>By the time Affleck makes it to Iran, all pace has been lost from the movie and it's never really regained. The scenes in Iran, which mainly consist of the diplomats arguing with Affleck about whether his plan is a good idea, turn out to be dull. Yes I know it's supposed to be true to life, but it's rather short on thrills and spills.<br/><br/>All in all in my view this movie was a flop."

"The-Sarkologist","6","1","1","1 January 2014"," Unfortunately the twisting of the truth drags this movie down quite a lot.
","I guess my problem with this film was that the writers were a little bit too lose with the truth, and it is another example of Hollywood rewriting the past to place a greater emphasis upon the role of the United States in a certain historical event, and to lower to the impact of other nations that were involved. Sometimes I wonder whether the United States would write themselves into history to the extent that it was through their efforts that the Roman Empire collapsed. Then again, this is coming from a country that actually has a debate as to whether Jesus Christ spoke English.<br/><br/>The movie is based around the events of the Iranian revolution in 1979 and 1980 and deals with the American hostages that were being held in the country during the fighting and it looked at one specific plan that involved operatives going into Iran as a part of a filming crew in an attempt to free the hostages. The operation was a resounding success, and the six hostages were brought home safely. However, as can be expected, if the movie followed the actual events then it would be a pretty boring movie. As it turned out, the hostages left Tehran at around 5:00 am in the morning and had not problems passing through immigration.<br/><br/>What upset people about this movie though was how they made the CIA front and centre and not only shoved the Canadian role to the side (and in reality it was the opposite, with the CIA only playing a minor role in the rescue) but actually suggested that two of America's staunchest allies (Great Britain and New Zealand) wanted nothing to do with the hostages. Further, the fact that this film won three Academy Awards, including best picture, only acts to cement this version of history into the social conscience (at least in America, were people tend not to question what comes out of Hollywood) and push the truth to the outer edge.<br/><br/>Okay, I liked this film, but as with most films based on real events, I am going to want to actually find out the truth behind the propaganda. Fortunately IMDb does a good job of bringing these truths to life, and the fact that the reviewers are people like you and I, who are not paid to write reviews, and simply put their own thoughts onto paper without any bias whatsoever, does act to level the playing field. Further, with the community reviews of IMDb, I am more inclined to go by what people say here than the paid reviewers that tend to flood the pages of our newspapers (which, by the way, are dying out in droves these days with the rise of the internet)."

","Argo is the third film in which Ben Afflect director and it won the 2013 Best Pictur at the Academy Awards. Having known of the film's success and critical praise, I was interested in finally watching. Argo is a Political Biography drama centered towards real live events. Argo opens with a breathless re-creation of the November 4, 1979, storming of the U.S. embassy in Tehran, in which 52 Americans were taken hostage by revolutionary forces. Everyone knows what happened to them over the following 444 days.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck stars as Tony Mendez, the real-life CIA operative and ex- filtration specialist who concocted the improbable solution. His idea was to fly into Iran by himself and fly out with the six refugees posing as a Canadian film crew scouting Middle Eastern locations for a low- budget Star Wars rip-off called Argo. The plot is relatively simple but it is how the film is executed which is what is entertaining. Argo doesn't hold back and we see the raw glimpses of the real world, the directing is top notch along with the acting from the cast.<br/><br/>Argo is a mix of political thriller and Hollywood satire. Maybe I was expecting more but Argo somewhat tends to drag along the way as it took me out of the overall enjoyment. It is very well done in its technical aspects but I wasn't too intrigued with the story. The film isn't too long as it feels appropriate. Argo is a specific film for a certain audience, and not everyone will enjoy it."

","I enjoyed the movie, but it seems a little odd that the real story of Tony Mendez's perfectly executed ""exfiltration"" scam had to be pruned back and simplified so much to make room for fictional scenes that would fit the pacing of a conventional action film. (See http://longform.org/stories/the-great-escape for some interesting details about the origins of the film-within-the-film and the houseguests' ordeal in Teheran that didn't make it into the shooting script.) All the name players (Affleck, Arkin, Goodman, Cranston) turn in fine performances; the escapees don't really emerge as distinct personalities, though Clea DuVall, as the most tightly wrapped of the group, is always good for a reaction shot at a tense moment. A few of the scenes leading up to the slambang finale at the airport seem a little implausible or contrived (the bumpy ride to the bazaar, e.g., which didn't actually happen), but as Donald Rumsfeld might have said, You go to see the movie that got made, not the one that should have gotten made and it's available on DVD from Netflix, btw.

The movie does have a good plot and a great ending but i felt like i was watching another Lionsgate low-budget action movie with the camera angles and cinematography. No offense to Lionsgate i understand your methods but come on Warner Bros., you have to sometimes grasp onto your productions. This movie had a phenomenal cast with a great performance by Ben Affleck in the leading role and great support with Alan Arkin, Bryan Cranston, John Goodman and the underrated Tate Donovan. But no significant parts for a big name actress, i thought this could've improved the movie big time. Also the camera angles and cinematography were great for an adaptation. I feel like they played it safe (Affleck and his production crew). They could have easily made this the best film of the year, with a controversial plot already why treat it like an action-suspense-thriller-crime-stereotype? Simple camera angles that capture the story and the great actors. Nope. In my eyes this was not achieved. The cinematography was over par, the acting was just what i expected, nothing better nothing worse, the movie was mediocre. If you disagree then that's fine it's all based on opinion. If you are reading this because you haven't yet seen the movie then i suggest you watch it while cooking or while doing the laundry. This is the movie with the type plot where you don't have to give 100% attention to know what is going on. Also you can pause the movie and leave the house to get groceries or such then come back two hours later and still remember and pick up where you left off. It's just not that submerging or hooking.

The only part which was good was how they contextualised the film during the beginning so you knew, if you didn't know what had happened or were too young to remember, everything that happens is the United States and Britain's fault otherwise it would've been a film that was basically full of screaming, angry Iranians and white people looking scared and hiding.<br/><br/>bad stuff happens, they come up with a plan, America saves the Americans and gives them unworthy honours. congrats. the end.<br/><br/>This is easily Ben Affleck's worst film to date, and I just don't understand how this film got any award nominations – but as usual America likes to blow it's own horn or pat itself on the back to back itself feel better after the terrible stuff they've done.<br/><br/>Oh, and the only other good thing about the film? – Alan Arkin."
"tianqiluo49","7","1","1","18 June 2013"," Argo f**k yourself indeed.
","Out of boredom, I decided to insert the long-ago-rented DVD into my DVD player. I was on a movie drought for days and was dying for entertainment. It suddenly occurred to me that this was the best picture and most likely worth a watch. So, I sat myself back and was filled with expectations. <br/><br/>Well, I have to say the movie started out good. Showing the background knowledge of the Iranian Revolution with a sexy voice for narration. I didn't know the history of the Iranian Revolution so I was considered myself enlightened. The first few scenes showing the Iranians intruding the American embassy was well-directed to say the least. The scenes indeed created tension. In the first scenes, we learned that the American embassy was overwhelmed by the mob and most of them were held captive. However, six Americans managed to escape from under the tunnel. Well, the incidents stirred up a hornet's nest with the related government agencies. The CIA decided to invoke their elite specialist, Tony Mendez, to extract the six trapped Americans, currently hiding in the Canadian embassy. Well, Tony was nothing short of a job addict, distant from his family. After talking on a phone with his estranged son , he stumbled upon an idea to pose as a fake movie producer to Iran to salvage the 6 Americans. To make the entire process authentic, he had to consult with an actual movie designer and producer, from whom he received significant assistance. When everything is set, he headed to Iran to implement his mission. In the end, he successfully rescued the 6 Americans from Iran and he got back with his family in the end. <br/><br/>Surprisingly, I was completely devoid of emotion during the entire process of the movie. Thanks to the dull and less than mundane performance by Ben Affleck who simply could not switch his facial emotions from scene to scene. As for the 6 Americans, they were one- dimensional to an extreme. I didn't feel anything for him, maybe some double takes on the young wife who was relatively pretty compared to others, but nothing more really. They were in danger, okay, shrug...Why should I care? Perfect indication of the failure of the script writers who failed to make the characters fleshed out. As for the plot, it was exceedingly formulaic. Guy goes to Tehran, guy contacts the 6 Americans, guy successfully gets them past Customs, guy reunited with his estranged family. When the plot can be simply concluded into four sentences, you can infer the plot's tremendously shallow. You can't blame Ben though, you can tell he really tried, sometimes too hard, to make this an entertaining story. Sadly, history cannot be argued. The course of the entire rescue was so flat and anti-climatic that even adding the fictional car-chase scene can't save the movie from falling into a huge puddle of predictability. While watching the end credits go by, I felt puzzled about why even bother making such a movie. There was no emotional fluctuations or should I say, no feelings at all after 2 hours. Is it the director's fault or is this movie too good for me to appreciate? <br/><br/>To conclude, this is an extremely over-the-top shallow, empty, with characters flatter than paper. You can't really blame Ben though, he really had extended to the end of his abilities. Point is, fundamentally, the source material was too boring to make it into a film. Whoever considered the source material should really examine his decision in retrospect. In a nutshell, don't believe the hype! This is far from the Best Picture league, no idea why even nominated in the first place. The award should've gone to Life of Pi but I guess Hollywood favors empty movies about American heroism to innovative stories about Indians. Shame on the judges, really. 7/10"
"abbz707","4","1","1","17 June 2013"," Disappointing and needless to say, insulting
","First, I will say what I did like about this film.<br/><br/>While I'm not a huge fan of it, I loved how the decision was made to give a throwback to the 70's filming style, the time period in which the plot takes place. I think it had a really good nostalgic feel to it that probably drew in a lot of people who were not only familiar with the style but actually remember watching the events of the hostage crisis as they unfolded on television. The use of real footage was a great way to make this film feel more real and bring the reality of the situation forward for those of us who didn't know the full story before as well. In that respect, I say well done.<br/><br/>However, there was too much else that was not good about this film.<br/><br/>Firstly, I don't appreciate how Ben Affleck skewed the story for his own personal benefit. I'm perfectly comfortable when films that are historical representations take a few liberties to make it more exciting and what not, but this was too much for me. I encourage you to read the real story of the event to get the fullness of my point, but to summarize a few points, Tony Mendez was not working alone, the whole movie idea was not his, and there is not even close to enough credit given to the Canadian embassy and congress for their involvement in the entire affair. So basically, Ben Affleck turned it into a story about him and his brilliance. I don't appreciate that as a viewer and find it narcissistic at best.<br/><br/>But it doesn't stop there.<br/><br/>Secondly, to be somewhat blunt here, I felt that as a viewer I was insulted by the idea that my brain could not wrap itself around a more complex plot. The storyline was so predictable that I got bored because I knew what was coming next. I know the real situation was far more complicated than what was shown but apparently Ben Affleck & co. didn't think the public could handle it. So instead the story is dumbed down to the point that it felt like someone was holding my hand throughout the whole thing so I wouldn't get lost. There may be some out there who disagree with me and I welcome the other side of this argument, but when I watch a film that is supposed to be Oscar worthy and have recently declassified information in it, I expect it to be a little more intimate and complicated. I don't expect to watch a film clearly targeted for adults and instead feel treated like a child.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the only reason this film won Best Picture for 2013 was because it told a fascinating story that was brand new information and it flattered Hollywood. It was ridiculously predictable, narcissistic, and extremely disappointing in the way of entertainment because of that. I thought Ben Affleck might have had a chance to do something great and I was excited to see what he accomplished. But I only came away from it feeling insulted as a film lover and having lost what little respect I had for the star in the beginning.<br/><br/>If you still haven't seen it and would like to, I don't discourage you completely from seeing it. However, I do encourage that you don't get caught up in the hype and really look at for what it is."

"zuma777","5","1","1","10 May 2013"," An ""OK"" Movie at the most
","I'm sorry to say that the movie business is being taken down like everything else in the world lately. The great US of A policy is affecting movie making in the worst manner. I guess the next major achievement will be about North Korea. Picturing Iran as a big hell-hole with a population full of thugs, militia, ignorant and anti-American people. When will Hollywood stop these awful stereo-types? Constantly picturing third world civilizations as half-humans. They do it with everybody; Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan and the list goes on and on. You know, these countries have schools, universities, their own movies, all the late technology and are constantly exporting engineers, doctors and scientists to Europe and the US.<br/><br/>The reason I've got angry this time is because this movie won 3 Oscars including best film. It's an ""OK"" movie. Period. Up until 1996 with Braveheart, the Oscar for best film really meant something. The movies back then really deserved it. In the 17 years after that, I could make piece with only 4 movies on that list; Gladiator, LOTR, Million Dollar Baby and Slumdog Millionaire. But we are being directed towards what they want us to see and believe. The Islamophobia plan is working like hell. My apologies if I deviated a little from the ""review mode"", but it's time to really think about what we're watching, listening and reading.<br/><br/>A great movie is one that touches you; either by actors performance, music, emotion, action, visuals or even comedy. This one didn't have any of those. A CIA agent with the help of Canada comes up with a plan to rescue 6 American diplomats from Iran during the revolution...you can guess the rest of the movie. Ben Affleck was so boring that I thought maybe being the director he was too exhausted to act.<br/><br/>Finally as I always say; go see it for yourself; if you're American or Canadian you might like it. If you're from any of the other 191 countries recognized by the UN, you will NOT."
"lee_eisenberg","6","1","1","25 March 2013"," ""Zero Dark Thirty"" was better
","Prior to the release of ""Argo"", I had never heard of the mission to rescue the six Americans from revolutionary Iran. The movie does open by talking about how the CIA overthrew Iran's democratically elected prime minister and left the shah in power to create a terror state. Unfortunately, the minimal focus on this leaves little understanding as to why Iran had the revolution, let alone why the Iranians took the hostages. It's especially important to understand this history given the tense relations between Washington and Tehran.<br/><br/>Other than that, it's interesting seeing how they devised the plot to rescue the hostages in a scheme that involved Hollywood and the Canadian government. Even so, this was not the best movie of 2012. Even ""Zero Dark Thirty"" was better. ""The Master"", ""Lincoln"" and ""Django Unchained"" were among the best."
"joachimokeefe","7","1","1","15 March 2013"," Shallow, dubious and gung ho but sublimely thrilling
","Are you watching, prospective next-Bond-film directors? This is how to do suspense in a movie, and keep piling it on right to the end. The supposedly true story of how 6 American embassy staff were rescued from the Canadian embassy in revolutionary Iran in 1980 by the trick of creating a fake sci-fi film production. Historically accurate? It's a 100% safe assumption that Hollywood will have taken gross liberties with the facts as it always will. That's how it's done, because real history doesn't do suspense like this.<br/><br/>But (I hope) you don't watch Hollywood for history lessons, you watch to be taken out of yourself, and Argo does a great job of that. You may consider that everyone but the Americans gets short-changed in terms of cultural stereotyping, and in that sense Argo is no more than an up-to-date Western, with more accurate period detail to cover its lack of genuine depth. If you like Ron Howard movies, Argo is of that genre, with more edge and sharper humour - a lot of metaphorical waving of the Stars and Stripes and obligatory Arab-bashing, but in the end it's a very exciting movie that pays off like few contemporary thrillers do."

Nothing negative here. <br/><br/>One added little trivial bonus if I may; so fun seeing all the old Western Electric telephones. Remember when that was all we had?

"gavin6942","8","1","1","18 January 2013"," Perhaps Not the Best Film of 2012, But A Darn Fine Film
","A dramatization of the 1980 joint CIA-Canadian secret operation to extract six fugitive American diplomatic personnel out of revolutionary Iran.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert calls the film ""spellbinding and surprisingly funny."" He points to John Goodman and Alan Arkin as the source of the laughs (and this is undebatably true). David Edelstein concurs, saying, ""Arkin and Goodman have the only colorful parts in Argo. The six fugitive Americans are like glorified extras."" This brings up an interesting point: this is the story of how the CIA rescued six Americans, but not a story about six Americans who were rescued by the CIA. There is a second story in here that can still be told.<br/><br/>Ebert further writes that ""Affleck is brilliant at choreographing the step-by-step risks that the team takes in exiting Tehran."" I have followed Ben's career for almost twenty years, starting with ""Mallrats"" (1995), and this is the first time I have ever read the words ""Affleck is brilliant"". If this is the last time, I would hardly be surprised.<br/><br/>But seriously, Affleck's fall (the Bennifer years) have given way to Affleck's rise. Perhaps the only way he could get higher than he is right now is by giving up acting altogether and focusing solely on directing and producing. Because, for me, the biggest problem -- heck, maybe the only problem -- with ""Argo"" was that it starred Ben Affleck. His presence on screen always seems to have a layer of cheese just beneath the surface. (He wanted Brad Pitt for the part... and frankly, that would not have been any better.) <br/><br/>As I write this, Affleck has just won Best Director and Best Picture from the Golden Globes, and the film is a contender for Best Picture at the Academy Awards (with Affleck's directing not even nominated there). While I have not seen any of the other contenders yet (and am therefore merely speculating), I find these wins hard to believe. Certainly, the film and direction are quite good and worthy of nomination, but if this was the best film of 2012, I feel like we might have been shortchanged.<br/><br/>Although, perhaps I am being too harsh. We have here a story that is well-told, well-paced, well-acted... with elements of suspense, humor and enough realism to educate people about a time in American (and Iranian) history that perhaps is not as not ""common knowledge"" as it should be. There was no effort to throw in a forced, pointless romance. Exaggerations only existed where necessary to heighten the tension.<br/><br/>I will have to return to this after further thought and seeing other contenders to make a proper comparison. But one thing is for sure: all eyes will be on Affleck to see what project he chooses next."
"eatfirst","7","1","1","26 November 2012"," Quality old-school thriller from the man with the Serpico beard.
","The Ben Affleck career renaissance continues apace with this masterfully measured and understated piece of directing, which adapts the so-bizarre- it-can-only-be-true story of a fake movie used as cover for a CIA rescue operation, into an old-school '70s-style political thriller laced with shades of self-reflexive Hollywood satire. Argo successfully balances scenes of seat-gripping tension and joyously grouchy humour that feels effortless but takes a sure hand to pull off. Minor historical inaccuracies have to be swallowed along the way for the benefit of snappier pacing. But overall this remains a fascinating true story, delivered with great performances, pin-sharp dialogue and award-winning facial hair, and would make a fine double-bill with the underrated Charlie Wilson's War. The new Eastwood? ...maybe."

","OK, this apparently only loosely based on the ""Canadian Caper"" of 1980 to smuggle out of Teheran the six American Foreign Service officers who get away from the embassy before the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, disguised as students, overrun the embassy. While there are a lot of historical quibbles with the plot, there was a need to generate tension in places where it wasn't quite so tense. Not that it wasn't tense, and dangerous, but it seems that the ending at the airport was not so close, that the diplomats were long out of the country without the Iranians being any the wiser. The narration about Mossadegh at the beginning seemed a bit one-sided, not mentioning that he was likely to turn the country into a Soviet colony, and stealing billions of dollars in Western property. Yes, the shah was a tyrant too, but the nation is still tyrannized all these years later. Anyway, despite the historical stuff it ended up being a pretty entertaining movie."

It really manifests the horror and the religious idiocy that even today exists in Iran.</li></ul><br/><br/>I believe Argo is a really good picture. It deserved an Oscar nomination. Well to say that it deserved to win is simply a very difficult thing, as it always is, because choosing the best is usually contentious when there are other good movies around. For all I know, if Lincoln had won, there would be people complaining why not Argo! I think Argo does hit the spot in these most tender times, and I think it is as accurate as it can be without loosing the cinematic appeal. It's a must-watch in my opinion."

I am glad I watched it but at the same time it is not something I would choose to watch again. So, for this film to receive the awards it has when you compare it to its contemporaries such as Django Unchained, Lincoln, Life Of Pi, is somewhat puzzling. There were no standout performances and it kind of trundles along until the inevitable climax which again, does not have any real standout moments.

The plot is deep( had to rewind a couple of times as I was initially unaware of the real life happenings), unpredictable and became more interesting as the film progressed.

Like most of Ben Affleck's films, Argo is 120 minutes and is timed perfectly with no drawn-out scenes, or rushed actions.

The tension between Iran and USA are coming towards a breaking point, and what could be better than to show to the American people how vile and dangerous the Iranian people really are? Iran isn't like anything the movie was trying to portrait. Yet many would believe in the story as true, and would think of Iranians as crazy religious maniacs who oppress women and enjoy killing and death. Once again there is always an agenda behind movies as such, they maintain a very rare kind of influence that we don't normally think about, but usually just accept because of the environment. <br/><br/>I would just advice any of you who are going to watch the movie to have an open mind."
"bob the moo","Null","3","6","30 January 2013"," A rather straight telling, but the story is engaging throughout
","Argo interested me not only because it was rather breathlessly discussed by critics when it came to ""best film of 2012"" time, but also because it was a true story that I knew nothing about – from detail to the ending it was all news to me. Watching it I still took it with a pinch of salt simply because I think it is wrong to approach any fictionalized version of a true story and assume that it is entirely gospel. The film walks a fine line between the dramatic and the absurd, almost to the point where if you left the cinema during one scene and then returned during another, you would be forgiven for thinking you'd come back into the wrong screen. It does this but yet it mostly pulls it off.<br/><br/>The film opens with an American embassy in Iran being stormed and the majority of people taken hostage, except a small group who flee to the home of the Canadian Ambassador and are hidden. The story is then about the extradition of this small group, before the Iranians work out that they are missing and hunt them down; with options limited, the plan is to send an agent into Iran posing as someone scouting for locations for a movie – and then leave the country with the small group acting as his colleagues and peers. This involves doing more than saying it out loud as it has to pass muster with the Iranians – so the CIA works with a Hollywood writer and a producer to greenlight a film, sell it to the press and take their small production into Iran. In telling the story the film pretty much plays it straight and allows the scenario to be whatever it is – so when it is a press junket then it is amusingly absurd but while it is in an Iranian airport it is really tense and the stakes are apparent. This approach works pretty well because it lets the film have these extremes alongside one another without one undercutting the other. The downside is that it does occasionally mean that the telling feels quite ""ordinary"" as it lacks an individual voice to the delivery – not boring by any means, but just surprisingly straight in the telling.<br/><br/>This can be seen in the cast because mostly there are not really characters here, since the film focuses on events and doesn't leave a lot of time for the people (understandably). Affleck doesn't really work in the lead and I'm not sure why he cast him; he is OK but his presence is not all it needed to be in such a straight film. The various hostages in Iran don't really make an impression beyond them being just that, but there is color provided by solid turns from Goodman, Cranston, Arkin and a few others. As director Affleck does a good job to make the mix of content work so well, but the real credit to the production is how of the period it feels – there is nothing that really seems out of place, from office to street it feels like it was filmed back in the late 70s.<br/><br/>Argo is an effective and engaging story that works partly because the telling is straight enough to let the events be however they are (absurd, tense, whatever). However this straight bat does also limit the film by making it feel a little ordinary in the delivery, without much flair or individual style to the telling, even if the attention to period is really well done."

","This was a pretty good film, with a solid material as a base and I was also pleasantly surprised with Ben Affleck accomplishing so much as a director. However, it didn't quite work out 'great' for me. Many reviews and wikipedia statements took great efforts to point out the historical inaccuracies and hence I am not going to comment on that.<br/><br/>What I would highlight was that the movie should have treated certain elements that were politically sensitive on a national-level more seriously. If you are going to talk about another nation's role on a real event, it is not right to twist the facts to the point of near-defamation, and it does not make business sense either because what will the viewers of the affected nations think about your movie? Just one sentence spoken in this movie has offended the UK and Canada in that respect.<br/><br/>A worse crime was committed towards the nation where the incident happened, which also made me disappointed. The whole movie was quite alike the cliché that you expect from this type of genre, including dumbing down the villains' intelligence. However, I did not like the way this movie has made the whole country (not just the rebels) looked one-dimensional in character and behaviour, almost barbaric-like in a way. I was also ticked off by the unwanted dramatic car chase scene at the airport. I know this movie is not a documentary and it should be allowed to add some drama flavours if it wishes, but Ben should have been more creative to generate the 'drama' instead of recycling 'angry mobs' and 'fanatic military officials' over and over again. Also, I wish that the movie make more room to focus on several more aspects, like shedding a little more light on the Canadian guy and what ultimately happens to those hostages who were trapped in the embassy."

I believe they did not have much ground for a movie here, true stories that are very interesting are rare nowadays.

I saw the film a few days ago and it has evaporated for me. I only remember a few isolated moments, a few witty lines, and some interesting (if underdeveloped) characters. I can't remember which actors played which roles. And also, I must say that I simply don't get why on earth Alan Arkin is getting so many awards nominations? Great performances by Suraj Sharma, Irrfan Khan, Tom Holland, Ewan McGregor, Aaron Tveit, Eddie Redmayne, just to name a few, are being passed over for this mediocre performance, that many other actors could have played just as well if not better?

It's abundantly clear to the Agency's ""exfiltration"" specialist, Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck), that the State Department is in over their heads. With such plans as having the embassy workers ride to the border disguised as teachers on bicycles in winter. It was back in his hotel watching Battle for the Planet of the Apes and talking to the son Ian (played by Aidan Sussman) that Tony (Affleck) has an idea. Disguise the hostages as a film crew and sneak them out right under the enemy's nose. After bringing the idea to his boss, Jack O'Donnell (played by Bryan Cranston) the plan gets the go-ahead. Later, they approach the make-up specialist who worked on The Planet of the Apes who has also done work for the Agency in the past, John Chambers (played by John Goodman). Chambers in turn introduces Mendez to a well-known producer named Lester Siegel (played by Alan Arkin). Once they've chosen a script, Argo, a science-fiction fantasy in the style of Star Wars, they go the extra mile in establishing it as a legitimate enterprise. Where it was simply a poster in the beginning, Siegel organizes a table-reading with known actors, press, and studio staff. While all this is going on, the Iranian government has sweatshop labor assembling the shredded photos so that they can identify anyone who they failed to capture. Also, our six escapees become increasingly fearful that they will be discovered.<br/><br/>I'm kind of a sucker for movies based on factual events, no matter how much the narrative diverges from history. A Beautiful Mind, The Insider, some that don't have Russell Crowe as the lead actor. That said, it doesn't guarantee I will like it. Case in point, I found J. Edgar unbelievably dissatisfying. Argo, on the other hand, is brilliant, in my opinion. The story is gripping, the comic relief is hilarious, and the suspense has me on the edge of my seat. As a lead actor, Affleck has had some notable flops. Gigli and Surviving Christmas among them. As the director of Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and now Argo, however, he is now three for three. You should definitely see this movie."
"rebecca-ry","9","3","6","30 November 2012"," Genius
","'Argo' is a fantastic film directed by Ben Affleck. It tells the story of six US embassy workers who managed to escape shortly before the 1980 Iranian US embassy hostage crisis. The six people find refuge in the Canadian embassy but it is only a matter of time until the hostage takers find out they're missing. <br/><br/>I have a massive amount of respect for Ben Affleck after seeing this film. It is brilliant and arguably one of the best films of 2012. The script and dialogue are fantastic; the film moves at a realistic pace (not to quick and not too slow) it builds momentum and the last hour is fantastic and is more like a fictional action film. The dialogue is funny, realistic and descriptive but the actors should be given just as much credit for this as the script writers.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck, as well as directing, takes the lead role as a member of the CIA whose task it is to try and get the hostages out of Iran with no problems. It is his idea to create a fake film to get the hostages out. Affleck's performance is good but not too over the top to overshadow other performances. He gives a realistic performance here and has clearly researched his character. Bryan Cranston does not have a huge role here but he is great; he provides a lot of great scenes with his wise-cracking, funny character. I really liked him in this and I'm glad to see he is getting more mainstream work. Scott McNairy is great here; since seeing him in 'Killing Them Softly' I have looked forward to his future career and this is a good follow up. His character is completely different but he tackles it with great confidence and is convincing. I look forward to seeing where his career takes him next. <br/><br/>Overall, I loved this film. It is a great, high quality film for modern history fans and even action fans to an extent (if you liked the Hurt Locker you might find this enjoyable). This is a fantastic film and I hope it gets some award recognition in 2013."
"aryafsharm","5","3","6","29 November 2012"," Brilliant movie and an equally brilliant depiction of a post-revolution Iran
","As an Iranian, I was cautious to watch Argo. Hollywood has a way of portraying Iranians in a way that pisses most of us off. From '24' to 'Don't Mess with the Zohan', Iranians are portrayed as America-hating Barbarians with untamed beards, and nothing is further from the truth. Iranians are relatively Normal people. They love America, and most of them look pretty normal. I was happy, ergo, that 'Argo' didn't live up to this stereotype. Instead, Argo takes a very non-biased approach to the matter. It doesn't glorify Iranians. It just tries to keep them out of the occasions. There are no Iranian antagonists, with a fake Arabic-sounding English accent and cunning ways, nor are there brave patriotic Americans who would do anything for their country. All it does it show Iran at a very chaotic time, and the only group of Iranians that are portrayed in the movie, are the fundamentalist Muslims who raided the U.S. Embassy in the late 70s, and that group is portrayed quite accurately. Any Iranian who takes offense in the way that ""Iranians"" are portrayed here, should understand that this movie isn't trying to make a generalization about the Iranian public, but is only showing a minority of angry bearded men and women in burkas, who do exist in the thousands and who did attack the U.S. Embassy.<br/><br/>While the events leading up to the movie are historically accurate, where the movie takes off with them is fictional. Without giving anything away, it revolves around 6 American workers of the American Embassy in Tehran, who fled the Embassy following the attacks and sought refuge at the house of the Canadian ambassador, and a joint operation between CIA and Canadian Authorities to extract them safely out of Iran. The story is pretty solid and the pace of the movie, specially the dialog is very fast. It is filmed mostly in the U.S., though it does briefly visit Istanbul as well. All the ""Iran"" bits were filmed in Hollywood, yet the locations were chosen wisely and it does look like Iran. The protests and the riots were also decently shot and the movie sure brings back bitter memories of those times for Iranians. The story unfolds Rapidly. It doesn't stray into unrelated sub-plots or feature, like almost every movie ever, a romance that has nothing to do with the story. The Final chapter of the movie is a hell of nail-biter and leaves you at the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck, who directs and stars in the picture, has grown from a medium actor into a brilliant film-maker and actor, and 'Argo' is his best work yet. A Job Well done!"

I think Ben Afflek has made a beautiful movie with so close to the reality atmosphere and each character justified with the character. I being a movie buff simply loved this one and recommends it to everyone. It is far better than Hollywood slasher movies or any teen comedy stuff, as it has its own charisma that involves you in each and every scene.

"vladimirkruglyak","8","3","6","24 November 2012"," The CIA agent surely looks brave and smart but at the price of Iranian security looking too primitive
","ARGO<br/><br/>By Vladimir Kruglyak <br/><br/>If you are a fan of James Bond, you'd like this film. Unlike the double-o-seven's fancy missions however, this movie is down-to-earth real. The American thriller directed by Ben Affleck, who is also a member of the cast as a CIA operative, is comparable to his previous work, The Town. As that movie, the current production is also imbued with authentic tension that will leave a long lasting impression of an eyewitness to the secret operation. Based on true events of 1979 hostage crisis, this movie captivates with its diplomatic contagion. Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) leads the rescue of six diplomats caught in the revolutionary turmoil — militant Islamic students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took ninety hostages. The aggravated crowd demanded that the escaped to the U.S. Shah of Iran be returned for a trial. While the Iranian government delayed expurgating negativity of the protest, the CIA agent Mendez ingratiated the covert escape scheme for diplomats and after brief preparations at Hollywood Studios, took off for Iran. He figured that in addition to the spread of Protestants' beliefs, the U.S. citizens may have another reason to be inside the foreign country, that is, to make a movie, and that is the bat that the CIA intelligence officer made against the odds. But as at the most bureaucratic government agencies, at CIA everything must be approved. And when Mendez's idea of taking the hiding diplomats out as a fake movie crew is about to become reality, he doesn't get approval from the high office and acts on his own. The desperate breakthrough at the well secured civilian airport seems improbable, and the successful escape depicted in this movie serves not as a simple tribute to the brave and surely lucky CIA agent but rather as a derogatory remark toward Iranian security forces. Starting with black and white documentary shots of the conflict at the American Embassy in Tehran in 1979, the film establishes its authority. Next follows the scene of burning the American flag complimented by the address plan of Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise. This sequence sets the nature of the plot to both inquisitive and cautionary. Our attention is constantly captivated by close ups into details such as gun barrel, eyes, and calligraphic on documents. The six characters that look like Pink Floyd fans are realistically panicking and truly believe that their days are over. Yes, the truth is ugly — you may be called a hero at your home country but abroad, you are a fugitive criminal with forged documents and no excuses to make if justice comes. In moments of culmination, when captivity is seconds away, the heat of emotions that is captured through shaky camera gives an impression of a covert view. This effect dismisses any apocryphal thoughts a skeptical viewer might have had. It feels as if the movie producers wanted to show the austere reality and that is what you'll see. Namely — a group of apprehended U.S. government employees trying to escape undetected from the foreign environment, but an impasse is in place and only small chances can help. In depicting these chances, the filmmakers should have eschewed a play of probabilities because even in 1979, when no cellular devices existed, a chance that allows fugitives to fly away right from the civilian airport just doesn't seem plausible. This triumph of doubt begins from perfidious Iranian woman whose mission of a ""snitch"" at the Canadian ambassador's house is a bit overdressed, given her fear and loyalty based on Islamic religion. Thus, the failure of multiple stratagems creates a hard-to-believe pattern, but this is the only rationale for a happy ending to arrive. By delaying the climax to the very end of the film, the Argo keeps us motivated for entire two hours. And it will be unfortunate to have a bathroom call during the movie. So, be prepared and stay put, you won't regret the experience."
"runamokprods","8","3","6","24 November 2012"," Intelligent, nail-biting and darkly comic
","Ben Affleck continues to prove himself one of our best, most intelligent 'mainstream' film- makers. In Argo he manages to combine nail-biting suspense created with a minimum of violence or standard movie action, a sharp, dark sense of humor about the weirdness of both espionage and Hollywood, and makes a film about getting American hostages released without giving in to jingoism. <br/><br/>Affleck even takes the time at the beginning of the film to put the Iranian revolution into a larger context of American involvement, thus making the Iranians' hostage taking horribly wrong, but also somewhat human and understandable. <br/><br/>The story itself is a doozey, and definitely fits into the 'you'd never believe it if it weren't true' mold. Using a fake movie as a cover-up for a long- shot rescue operation sounds like a bad episode of 'Mission Impossible' (or even 'Get Smart'). But here it is, a part of history. <br/><br/>I have only two small complaints about the film. First, other than Alan Arkin's and John Goodman's deliciously funny performances as the Hollywood end of the deal, not many of the other characters are given as much texture as they might, especially considering how strong the cast is. Perhaps the fear was slowing down the film with character details, but I would have gladly watched a few minutes more to know these people better on a human level. <br/><br/>More problematically there are a number of key moments where the suspense is trumped up needlessly by throwing in some very ""Hollywood"" conceits (coincidences, physical impossibilities, a climax that diverges pretty far from historical accuracy in pursuing 'drama' etc) in a film that didn't need them, a film where the whole point is how real world spy operations are miles from what we usually see in films. <br/><br/>Neither of these flaws seriously damage a very, very good film, but I couldn't help some minor disappointment when I felt the film go for the 'movie moment' over truth. But this is still a highly entertaining and intelligent thriller, and that's to be applauded."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","6","23 November 2012"," Nail-biting hostage rescue thriller without a single shot fired – brilliant!
","What makes this film so remarkable, besides the excellent work of all involved, is the fact that this is a true story, not simply ""inspired by"", but the true story itself, revealed to the world only after remaining a CIA top secret for 18 years. This is the rescue of 6 Americans in 1979, hidden in the Canadian embassy after 52 fellow countrymen were taken hostages by Iranian revolutionary forces in Tehran. The apparently perfunctory rescue plan, quipped ""the best bad idea by far"", turned out to be yet another testament to ""truth is stranger than fiction"". <br/><br/>The establishing scene looks so chillingly real that it would have you believe that this is a live documentary, depicting the mayhem during which the six slipped through to find refuge in the Canadian embassy. Initially, their existence was unknown to the hostage-takers but it was only a matter to time before the not-too-thoroughly shredded documents were put back together, revealing not only their existence but also their photos. <br/><br/>In complete control of the tension and the drama (not melodrama but real-life drama), director Ben Affleck takes the audience through the scheme of CIA professional rescue expert Tony Mendez (also played by himself, with admirable understatement) starting with fabricating a fake Hollywood Sci-fi project called ""Argo"", complete with screenplay, storyboard and lavish advertisement events. He then goes to Tehran alone, telling the custom that a crew of six people is coming on a separate flight to join him in seeking a filming location that will resemble a desolate alien planet. Enough about the plot (also a true story, pardon this reminder). <br/><br/>Afflect, as mentioned, wisely underplays the hero. The sanguine image projected to his rescue objects belies the doubts and fear that the audience are allowed to get glimpses of only when he is alone. His tenacious quality fully surfaced at his insistence on countermending orders from the highest authority to abort, and this feat was not possible without the support of sympathetic CIA chief, played by empathy-winning Bryan Cranston. <br/><br/>The angst alive on the faces of the six fugitives will leave indelible images in the minds of the audience. In a wide spectrum of various persona, they are all capably portrayed by a solid support cast. In particular, you'll remember Kerry Bishe (easily reminding you of Julianne Moore) playing the timorous wife who regrets staying back in Tehran with her career-ambitious husband when the first sign of political trouble appeared. In the end, the six display not a little courage, which was necessary to see them through. <br/><br/>The Canadian ambassador and his wife are played by Victor Garber and Page Leong with assured credibility, from their selfless risk of harbouring the fugitives to their own final safe exit. There is also a small but impressive role of the maid Sahar (Shelia Vand) who saw through the secret of these six ""guests"" in her employer's house, but in the eleventh hour chose to shield them when questioned by snooping Iranian security people. The punitive repercussions would be too horrible to contemplate and the movie makers take special care to show how she passed safely into Iraq, to the audience's sigh of relief.<br/><br/>Leaving the best till last, I now go to Alan Arkin and John Goodman, the two Hollywood men cooking up this outlandish scheme. Arkin, in particular, is good enough for a support Oscar, limited screen time notwithstanding, with just one scene in which he negotiates for the right of the screenplay ""Argo"". Being safely at home and being Hollywood people, these two provide some top-notch comic relief, but never to the extent of upsetting the continuously mounting tension culminating in a cliff-hanger climax.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this movie is that while you know how it ends, it manages to keep you hanging at the edge of your seat from beginning to end."
"azanti0029","8","3","6","15 November 2012"," A well made if somewhat fictional version of real events - but hey this is cinema!
","When the idea for 'Argo' was presented by Affleck and his team, I am sure some Producer somewhere around the table probably said something along the lines of 'Hey wasn't there already a movie made about this subject?' and the reply was probably 'Yeah, but no one will ever remember that version!' I do remember it,(Escape from Iran: The Canadian Caper) as a kid, sitting down to watch what I thought was going to be an action picture and as it turned out, was one of my first intelligent and well made feature film experiences as a young viewer, and I remember it vividly, so seeing this much larger budget version brought back pleasant trips down my movie memory lane.<br/><br/>Focusing on the true events of the undercover operation to rescue six American staff who escaped the clutches of the Iranian authorities when their Embassy fell in Tehran in 1980, this is essentially a spy thriller with a healthy dose of comedy provided by the Hollywood angle. The plan, devised by CIA fix it man, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) is to get them all out disguised as a Canadian film crew for the Sci-Fi blockbuster, Argo which is to be fronted by a Hollywood Producer (Alan Arkin, getting all the best lines) and his FX Cohort, John Chambers (John Goodman) The six staff are under some considerable stress having been couped up for 79 days and tensions rise when the audacity of the plan is revealed to them. The people back home get nervous, the operation is nearly cancelled, but if you've read your history you will know how it all ends.<br/><br/>Its hard to find fault in the movie. The production design, tone and colours brilliantly capture the period, the performances are all really solid, Affleck has really matured as an actor, and anchors the film with a perfect pitch understated performance and his direction also hits the mark. Arkin and Goodman make a suitably humorous duo 'If it has horses in it, its a Western!' but the real applause must go to the six actors playing the Embassy escapee's, who created believable characters and tensions with the small amount of well crafted scenes that they are given. Scoot McNairy proving his metal as a name soon to join the top ranks in Hollywood, and Rory Cochrane, Tate Donovan, Christopher Denham, Kerry Bishe and the always consistent Clea Duvall all hold their own nicely in the ensemble scenes where their performances lend gravitas to the realism of the dilemma their real life counterparts were facing. <br/><br/>This has 'Nicely packaged for the Oscars' written all over it just a bit too much though, so much so, I could count the nominations as the film rolled along, not that this is a bad thing (I am sure Affleck won't mind) The film does stray a little into the realms of fantasy with dramatic scenes of the bad guys in pursuit where the reality is they were never really that close, and Mendez appears to be white, where he looked more black/Hispanic in real life but of course who ever accused reality of making great cinema? These are understandable changes and a little dramatic license works well to ratch up tension in the final twenty minutes from not a great deal of real drama. Affleck could of perhaps given over the role to someone who actually was the same race as Mendez as there are no shortage of good actors out there, but I guess this project was his baby and as I know all too well, it may well have been his decision to play the pivotal role that got the film the green light in the first place though having George Clooney as a producer probably helped.<br/><br/>As Arkin says, if I am going to make a fake movie, then it is going to be a fake hit - So here, this slightly fictional version of the events will almost certainly be a hit with audiences and award ceremonies alike and to be fair to Affleck and the team, it is well deserved. Now, when will we see a good film about the failed rescue attempt?"

","It's not a surprise to once again see Ben shine through his directing, acting and in his producing give his audience such attention to detail. Ben gives a performance of a lifetime in Argo, and he definitely is the best actor to see in the film.<br/><br/>Ben's attention to detail and his casting director have made this film incredibly accurate. Despite the fact that portions of the film are dramatized for entertainment purposes, I find the film not only informative but brutally full of suspense. I say brutally because some points I was holding my girlfriend's hand very tight and I had white knuckles out of fear for what might happen to these characters.<br/><br/>The film plays out a story about six American diplomats trapped in Tehran, and in hiding for 444 days. The U.S. comes up with plans to get them out, but Tony (Ben Affleck) doesn't have good feelings about any of them. Finally, he's inspired to pretend to make a Canadian movie in Tehran to get them out under the guise of them being film crew.<br/><br/>I understand that there some inaccuracies and it's to be expected but I still stand by saying that it's a highly accurate film. Many films out there based on or inspired by true stories take liberty and dramatize things for entertainment purposes.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the acting from everyone in the movie, not just Ben. But all of the American diplomats had great development and some scenes with them seemed genuine and not even as if they were acting. I really enjoyed both Goodman and Arkin, and they give a lot of star power with their acting. I wasn't surprised that Bryan Cranston had involvement but I was wondering why he wasn't offered a bigger role since he can definitely handle himself.<br/><br/>Most of the time period stuff seems on par, and all the history seems to be top notch. I really enjoyed the flakes of comedy that showed here and there throughout the film such as the one-line catch phrase said by Ben, Alan and John.<br/><br/>Met with so much drama, inspiration to many, and topping it off with strong suspense, Argo is a film that is a memorable one to be viewed for a long time because it's an instant classic. Argo depicts many people of different nationalities as saviors, and heroic. That's something everyone can enjoy while watching this movie.<br/><br/>Argo is one of those films from 2012 that should be on everyone's ""do not miss it in theaters"" list. It's truly one of the top movies of the year and certainly one of the best in that last few years. I'd go as far to say that objectively, this is Ben's best work acting and directing wise."

Those who look through it are just embarrassed and the rating of this film on IMDb will drop considerably in the future. And this is really sad, because the movie starts out real good with a more honest account of historical events than ever produced in a movie of this size before. That honesty was the reason why I kept looking on the film and the action idiocy in the end almost made me turn off the damned thing. This could have been a great film if it had stayed true, even if just poetically with maybe invented stories that would have illuminated still further the problems involved. But that was not to be.

","I was convinced after Gone Baby Gone and The Town that Ben Affleck was a director of the highest calibre, but for those unsure, Argo leaves zero doubt. Based on a true story (from 1980) about a crazy rescue operation to get six U.S. hostages out of Iran – by disguising them as a Canadian film crew scouting for a B-grade sci-fi flick, entitled Argo – Affleck captures both the life-threatening seriousness and funny-in-hindsight absurdity of the dangerous mission with absolute perfection. He's also brilliant in front of the camera as Tony Mendez, the CIA agent responsible for the creation and execution of the plan; his downplayed above-the-title performance supplemented by a wealth of fantastic supporting turns from the likes of Alan Arkin, John Goodman, Bryan Cranston, Scoot McNairy and many more familiar faces. The seamless blend of tones, in addition to the well-measured tension, razor-sharp dialogue and flawless period recreation, creates an enjoyable and absorbing experience that culminates into one of the finest features of the year."

","Ben Affleck's ""Argo"" opens with a stunning prologue depicting the siege and takeover of the American Embassy in Tehran during the 1979 Iranian Revolution. The whole sequence is exciting and extremely involving. The leading up to the main core of the film's plot is also as engaging.<br/><br/>""Argo"" tells the true story of a fake movie which saved the lives of the Americans trapped during the crisis. There are obvious parts which are too ""movie-ish"" and ""Americanized"", however, without them it can't be considered a mainstream movie now can it? <br/><br/>When all other plans fail, the CIA allows their specialist Tony Mendez (Affleck) to go ahead with his plan - with the help of Hollywood make-up artist John Chambers (John Goodman) and producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) to front a fake movie studio, approve a science-fiction script, fly Mendez to Iran, and fly the Americans out of Tehran disguised as film crewmembers on a location shoot. No matter how ridiculous the plan sounds like, it's a true story nonetheless. And this is a thrilling depiction of the affair.<br/><br/>It's also a reminder of how powerful the movies can be, both by itself and the making of. This story takes place when two countries are both on the edge, and tensions are spiking on the extreme. Movie magic apparently eases and spellbinds both sides, you'll see what I mean when watching this.<br/><br/>The film also fiercely supports my notion that Ben Affleck is fast on his way into becoming a versatile filmmaker by his own right, and has already evolved into a promising one. Might he be the next Clint Eastwood? Too early to tell, yes, but Affleck shows no sign of sloppiness thus far. Affleck is fairly good in his performance but he directs the film with supreme confidence and skill, using subtle techniques to wring out the thrills.<br/><br/>I especially liked how the film really is a pure thriller instead of the obligatory car chases and gunfights (although the climax is technically a chase, it is subtly directed making it helluva exciting). Affleck, in the past decade being typecast as an action hero, now doesn't even fire a single shot in this one. I like that.<br/><br/>Technically, the film looks like it came out of a time capsule, with the production and costume design, '70s grain and even the vintage Warner Bros logo are at play - it delves you into the film even further. Editing is appropriately paced, yet Alexandre Desplat's music score could have been a bit better. Just my two cents.<br/><br/>With a strong supporting cast (Arkin and Goodman are hilarious in their parts, injecting surprising cynical humor; Bryan Cranston as Mendez's supervisor; Victor Garber as the Canadian ambassador who bravely risks himself while sheltering the Americans) and an intelligent, fiercely exciting, intensely moving, and appropriately terse screenplay. However the film's flaws may be, ""Argo"" is still one hell of a thriller.<br/><br/>Overall: 84%"

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","3","6","15 October 2012"," A tense, intriguing, sharp and witty thriller — incredible execution
","Exfiltration specialist Tony Mendez received the highest honor that can possibly be awarded in Intelligence for his work during the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979, and the man who played him and directed his story in ""Argo,"" Ben Affleck, will find himself quite decorated as well if he continues to make films at this quality of a clip. <br/><br/>The ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""The Town"" director has — at this point — completely erased his image as stale actor of the early 2000s and replaced it with a reputation as one of the most exciting directors working today. Those first two films depicted a gritty, hard-nosed America as seen through blue-collar Boston, and though ""Argo"" is a story that takes place halfway across the world and is so inconceivable it could only be true, he finds a way to make it unmistakably real and palpable.<br/><br/>After explaining the events leading up to the crisis in clever storyboarding fashion, ""Argo"" opens with an intense depiction of the invasion of the U.S. embassy and shows how six Americans escaped and took refuge in the home of the Canadian ambassador (Victor Garber). Several months later we meet Mendez, who is brought in to consult on the CIA's current plan to get the six out. After tearing holes in their various strategies, Mendez eventually concocts a plan to disguise them as a Canadian film crew scouting for shooting locations.<br/><br/>In order for it to be a convincing cover, Mendez must build an entire movie from the ground up. He enlists the help of skilled Hollywood makeup artist John Chambers (John Goodman) and wisecracking producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) to find a script and create some tangible buzz and legitimacy surrounding the film. They select a script called ""Argo,"" a bad ""Star Wars"" and ""Flash Gordon"" knockoff that calls for exotic locales with a Middle Eastern flair.<br/><br/>""Argo"" (the real film) is a tense journey from start to finish. Even for those familiar with the true story and the outcome will find reason to pause and think, ""they do get home safely, right?"" Affleck keeps the suspense high by pristinely communicating the stakes should they fail. Brutal punishment and likely certain death awaits them if so much as anyone suspects them of being American spies. Affleck captures the unstable and erratic nature of the angry Iranian mobs, drawing upon imagery from actual television footage and photos taken during the duration of the crisis from '79 to '81.<br/><br/>But much of what makes the film work can primarily be found in Chris Terrio's script, which is based on an article by Joshuah Bearman. It delivers the story in such a succinct manner and uses sharp and illustrative language to communicate the nature of the situation and the characters dealing with it. It's also impressively witty and clever even if a bit contrived in order to be so. Consequently, Arkin is at the top of his game as the lovable scuzzball producer, and Affleck, Goodman and Bryan Cranston as Mendez's CIA supervisor also benefit. This top-shelf ensemble cast adds every bit of legitimacy to the film as an Intelligence thriller.<br/><br/>Although incredibly subtle, there are numerous nods to the sci-fi films and TV shows of the '70s. Geeks will appreciate a little shout out to a famous sci-fi show of the time, but otherwise, these films are the unsung hero of the movie. Without the ridiculousness of the exotic Martian locales and other hallmarks of science fiction, we would've all but surely failed to extract the hiding Americans from Iran.<br/><br/>More down to earth and part of what gives ""Argo"" broader appeal is the way that it feels quintessentially American (with all apologies to the Canadians and their instrumental role in the events both real and depicted). Affleck takes the time to show moving imagery of how we responded to the crisis at home with the yellow ribbons and as far as saving the day, the film depicts us as not having so much pride that we couldn't let the Canadians get all the credit. Given international relations as they are now, it's refreshing to see this golden example of governmental collaboration.<br/><br/>""Argo"" is a golden example in its own right. Movies based on true stories don't get more compelling than this. Despite some incredibly suspicious timing as far as avoiding the bad guys and other stuff we're more accustomed to from works of total fiction, this film represents a crisp, clean and maybe most importantly, accessible execution of a bureaucratic thriller, especially one based on true events.

","This just a flat out enjoyable film that crackles with suspense, intrigue, intelligence (literally & figuratively) & some very sly humor. It also may be the year's best film.<br/><br/>This outrageous tale of hostage rescue would be impossible to believe if it weren't true & that alone makes it a lot of fun to watch. However the fun is weighted down by the seriousness of what is at stake --real lives in real situations. This is first & foremost a very serious film that doesn't ignore the lunacy of its plot. I can't remember a film that had it both ways -- being both very tense & wickedly funny at times-- & gotten away with it like ""Argo"" does.<br/><br/>Chris Terrio's script will be studied in film school. Director Affleck has been really good & really really good before (""Gone Baby Gone"" & ""The Town"" were hugely enjoyable), but here takes another big step forward by taking a wild, woolly, huge story & making it look so easy. The movie begins with a lollapalooza hostile takeover of the U.S. embassy in Iran (a great sequence that tops even the action scenes in ""The Town"") then dials that energy down a bit with never losing its tension & momentum. It also pulls off the trick that ""Apollo 13"" did by keeping us on edge with a story whose outcome was decided decades ago.<br/><br/>On top of all of this are some very good, if not, great work by the actors. Alan Arkin should be a lock for a Supporting Actor nomination & Bryan Cranston should be considered too. Both have the benefit of having some of the best lines in a screenplay full of them & make the most of them. Affleck is suitably restrained as the CIA ex-filtration agent who is the fulcrum of the heroics here. That restraint is key in making his command of the situation believable without question. John Goodman is in fine form as well.<br/><br/>I left the theater with a lump in my throat & damp eyes. It is that kind of movie."

","Argo is the best movie of the year- (so far).<br/><br/>Even though I knew the ending, I was still on the edge of my seat in suspense. That's how good it is.<br/><br/>It was inevitable that a CIA operation about making a movie would become a movie itself. In the wrong hands, it could have been as bad as the fictional sci-fi movie ""Argo"" that was the cover for the clandestine operation.<br/><br/>Not only does Affleck have the directing chops, I think his achievement is partly due to his age. I am very close in age to Mr. Affleck, and I remember watching the Iranian hostage crisis unfold nightly on the news. I didn't understand the history or politics that caused it (Affleck opens the film with an animated history lesson to bring everyone up to speed), but I remember its impact: the yellow ribbons, the daily count on the evening news, and the nightly updates from Ted Koppel that would become the newsmagazine ""Nightline.""<br/><br/>Importantly, I remember how the world worked then: everything was on paper, documents were created by typewriters, phones had cords, TVs had only a few channels that had to be manually changed. In short, I remember the world that could pull off this operation.<br/><br/>This world existed in an era when science fiction movies still dominated the entertainment arena, three years after Star Wars had opened. Every television and movie producer were hellbent on replicating that movie's success. Thus, prime time television (in addition to movies) had a disproportionate share of sci-fi imitators: Battlestar Gallactica, Buck Rogers, even Star Wars produced a Christmas special that starred Bea Arthur and Art Carney in 1978. I'm not kidding. In addition, many established shows like The Muppet Show, Fantasy Island, and the numerous variety shows jumped on the bandwagon. Although most of these productions were inferior, kids like myself and Mr. Affleck watched them anyway, and they were a formative aspect of our childhood.<br/><br/>I think this context is important to note: it makes the prospect of a making a science fiction movie in Iran not seem stupid or improbable. As it happens, the idea was credible to the Iranians as they were actively encouraging international business and were hungry for US dollars according to Joshuah Bearman who wrote about the operation in Wired in 2007.<br/><br/>Affleck nails the characters and physical details (the end credits display side by side the images of the real people and places next to those from the film. I dare you not to be impressed). His real-life character Tony Mendez said ""it was just like being there again.""<br/><br/>While I was at the edge of my seat, I was wondering in the back of my mind how much dramatic license Affleck took. How faithful is it to the real story? This movie snob had to find out.<br/><br/>The answer is: enough.<br/><br/>The famous screenwriter William Goldman advised other screenwriters not to write real stories; real stories are never as believable as fiction. <br/><br/>Affleck does his mentor proud. His deviations from the truth do not detract from the story at all. His changes intensify the drama, assist the pacing, and streamline the storytelling.<br/><br/>Spoiler ALERT: If you want to see the movie without knowing too many details, stop reading HERE.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston's and Alan Arkin's character are composites of several people. The staged reading at the Beverly Hilton never happened, it's an opportunity for Affleck to laugh at Hollywood's expense. It doesn't detract at all from the movie and hopefully gives him closure on Gigli.<br/><br/>Affleck is very kind to the Canadians; it turns out many of the ""bad"" bad ideas were actually theirs. Mendez had three children not one, but the one in the film is named Ian in memory of Mendez' late son and to whom the film is dedicated. He is shown in the photos on Affleck's nightstand.<br/><br/>Affleck's inspiration is depicted as occurring as he's watching Planet of the Apes with his son. It is not made clear in the movie, but John Chambers, the make-up artist he contacts in Hollywood, actually won an Oscar for make-up for that 1969 film.<br/><br/>The trapped Americans did not all stay at the Canadian Ambassador's residence, only some of the group were housed there, and they had several temporary hideouts in between. They left the American Embassy in a heavy downpour that is not recreated in the movie.<br/><br/>The group's tense visit to a crowded bazaar never really happened. And, as I suspected, the police cars on the runway were fiction as well.<br/><br/>During the closing credits, it is painful to learn Jimmy Carter could not brag about the success of this operation when a subsequent attempt failed tragically and contributed to his losing the presidency.<br/><br/>As a celebrity, Affleck has been very politically active, but shows a similar restraint by not making a political statement with this movie. He very efficiently tells an intriguing story. However, any informed audience member will be hard-pressed not to compare the events of this film with the current tensions that exist between the U.S and Iran that date back to the time depicted.<br/><br/>Before you bemoan an era gone by, where nations could could cooperate on covert operations such as this, you might be interested to learn that several hours before the movie's premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, the Canadian government closed its embassy in Tehran, ordered all Iranian diplomats to leave Canada, and ceased all relations between Canada and Tehran.<br/><br/>lemoviesnob.com"
"zardoz-13","10","3","6","13 October 2012"," Taut Suspense From Start 2 Finish
","The Iranian hostage crisis escape thriller ""Argo"" gives new meaning to the adage that truth is stranger than fiction. Ostensibly, this imaginative Warner Brothers release takes us back to the year 1979 when America as a superpower found itself cornered by a small but fanatical nation. Basically, Iran was exacting payback for our imperialist urges in the 1950s when British Prime Minister Winston Churchill persuaded President Dwight Eisenhower to help stage a coup and overthrow the civilian government. During the ill-fated presidency of Jimmy Carter, outraged Islamic militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in November after their cancer-stricken sovereign, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had been installed as monarch by America, fled the country for sanctuary in America. This unfortunate episode with Iran is not one of America's star-spangled moments, any more than the U.S.S. Pueblo debacle in North Korea. The radical strongman—the Ayatollah Khomeini—replaced the tyrannical Shah, and Khomeini's minions violated the sanctity of our foreign embassy and abducted 52 hostages at gunpoint. These brave Americans suffered in captivity for 444 days before the U.S. managed to negotiate their release. Television news turned this unforgettable event into a nightmare that polarized Americans and torpedoed Carter's bid for a second term. Now, some 33 years later, actor/director Ben Affleck and fledging scenarist Chris Terrio have appropriated this historic subject matter for an audacious as well as inspirational espionage caper. ""Argo"" should rank in the top ten of anybody's list of the best films of 2012. Despite its R-rating for profanity, ""Argo"" qualifies as the kind of true-life adventure that should please not only armchair historians but also make us all feel a little prouder of our red, white, and blue.<br/><br/>As the fury of a crowd besieging the U.S. Embassy in Tehran grows, a small number of diplomats—six of them—debate their options and quietly slip out a back door that the radicals aren't watching. They find sanctuary at the residence of the Canadian ambassador, Ken Taylor (Victor Garber 0f ""The Town""), and tried to sit out the situation. During the last few moments when Americans controlled the embassy, everybody struggled to shred top secret documents. The Embassy personnel managed to turn enough paperwork into fodder so that the six workers weren't missed by the invading Iranians. Nevertheless, with each day, the predicament of these diplomats grew even more dramatic. They fear that when the Iranians discovered them that they will die horrible deaths. The Central Intelligence Agency shares similar sentiments and it hatches several harebrained schemes to save the six. CIA executive Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston of TV's ""Breaking Bad"") invites one of best experts, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck of ""Good Will Hunting""), to sit in on the conference. Government officials present a number of scenarios for rescuing the hostages. For example, they plan to smuggle bicycles to them and await them at the border. Mendez takes a dim view of this option. Instead, he suggests they provide training wheels and meet them at the border with Gatorade. Nobody appreciates his sense of humor, and Mendez dreams up a scheme that seems even more insane. Mendez proposes to masquerade as a Canadian film producer, fly into Tehran, and waltz the six out under the nose of the Iranians as a team of filmmakers sent to scout locations for a science fiction movie! Eventually, despite massive misgivings, the CIA green lights the Mendez plan, and our hero goes into high gear to make it all happen with the help of an Oscar-winning Hollywood make-up artist, John Chambers (John Goodman of ""Red State""), and a shrewd movie producer, Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin of ""Inspector Clouseau""). They set up a production office and option an obscure science fiction screenplay named ""Argo"" for which Siegel has nothing but contempt. Revealing anything more about the elaborate plot would spoil many surprises as well as the nail-biting tension that Affleck orchestrates.<br/><br/>The worst thing you can say about ""Argo"" is that it unfolds too slowly and methodically. Affleck and Terrio rely on history, intelligence, and wit to depict this suspenseful thriller. They do an excellent job of providing us with all the necessary history of Iran. Leaving the theater as the end credits roll will only serve to deprive you of some other surprises. Affleck visited former President Carter and Carter remembers the moment when he met Mendez. Meantime, ""Argo"" skewers the film industry, too. John Goodman excels a sarcastic make-up artist and Alan Arkin brings multiple dimensional to Lester Siegel. Indeed, Arkin steals every scene in which he appears. Affleck and Terrio based their spine tingling saga on the 2007 article ""How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick to Rescue Americans from Tehran"" by Joshuah Bearman that ""Wired"" magazine published. You can go on-line and read the informative article. Incidentally, although things went pretty much as planned, the CIA had to keep the affair hushed up until 1997 when President Clinton officially declassified the operation. Nevertheless, the liberties that the filmmakers take to enhance the dramatic impact aren't as drastic as you might imagine. Affleck and company deserve credit for not making the Iranian adversaries look like cretinous, one-dimensional villains. ""Argo"" qualifies as one of the freshest, most stimulating films that you will ever see."
"mr-davis85","10","3","7","22 February 2013"," Ben Affleck snubbed for Best Director
","I'm calling it that Argo will win Best Picture this year at the Oscars, Alan Arkin will win Best Supporting Actor. Ben Affleck should have gotten a directing nomination, the most outlandish snub at this year's Oscars by far.<br/><br/>I for one especially appreciated that Ben Affleck accurately portrayed in his brief storyboard history lesson that we brought the hostage crisis on ourselves, a consequence of our attempts to nation build Iran. We murdered a ruler acting in the best interest of the Iranian people because he wouldn't give us oil and put in a despot who would. We grant that ruler amnesty when he is overthrown and what happened next, the Iranian hostage crisis. Some may call that liberal propaganda, me...I call it the truth."
"thekyles99","10","3","7","29 November 2012"," Now Argo feck yourself!!!
","Argo Affleck's Argo blew me away! 4/4 stars <br/><br/>I had a feeling upon seeing the first trailer for Ben Affleck's 'Argo' mostly due to the story within as i remember as a child still to this day watching in anticipation to the news channel as the 6 hostages were escaping the iron grip of the country Iran. I always new even back then even though at my age and still to this day the Star Wars movie was mostly in my thoughts , that the story of the escaping hostages would make one hell of a movie and thanks to Ben Affleck's directing abilities that far outshine his acting endeavours, we got a brilliantly executed story here, although with a lot of historical inaccuracies, still kept close to what actually went on during that frantic time.<br/><br/>The Iranian hostage crisis took place from November 4, 1979 to January 20, 1981 444 days in total that ended up with then President Jimmy Carter not being voted in for yet another term in the oval office. The CIA upon hearing that the American embassy had been taken over immediately spoke to their disguise and exfiltration expert Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) to figure out a way to get the '6' out of Iran and it's confines before being captured, which unfortunately if happened, would've surely meant the execution of the 6 diplomats as we all know quite well that the United States government do not answer to threats of terrorism...Mendez comes upon with the idea of enlisting a top movie producer and director to fabricate the shooting of a new sci-fi film named Argo that would go head to head with the then debuting sci fi giant 'Star Wars' with principle filming to begin in the deserts of Iran, with the end result being safely and quickly getting the '6' out of country before the Iranian militia get hold of them first.<br/><br/>Apparently a lot of people have voiced their displeasure, mostly Canadians, saying that the film and Affleck didn't show a lot of Canada's participation in this secret mission, making it more of an American deal. Myself a Canadian didn't get bothered at all of this and actually thought that Affleck did a good job (sure their are some or should i say a lot of liberties taken with this story, you know what though? It all = up to be a damn fine edge of your seat political thriller) and Canada got their dues in reality and not those that watched the events unfold on television during those 444 days know that the States were indeed grateful for Canada's participation through to the end. Take it for what it is folks, one of the best films that 2012 has to offer."
"henry_yan","10","3","7","16 November 2012"," Sometimes the bad ideas do really work.....
","This is by far one of the most impressive movies of 2012. There was a lot of attention to detail, right down to the opening frame, where you'll see the Warners Bros logo circa 1970's, befitting the era which the movie was set.<br/><br/>Let's start with the basics. Argo is set in Iran during the tumultuous year 1979, a time when the US embassy in Tehran was stormed and seized by a mob of lunatic Iranian yobs. By sheer fate (of being in a separate part of the embassy), 6 American staff members managed to sneak out and became refugees in the home of the Canadian ambassador. Enter Tony Mendez (played brilliantly by Ben Affleck) of the CIA, whose job description includes 'extracting' Americans out of hazardous environment.<br/><br/>The first half of the film devotes to building the premise of this ridiculously far-fetched idea of using a science fiction movie as the narrative of the entire escape plan. With dwindling options available and a rapidly deteriorating situation, the US government had no choice but to go along with this, thus proving once again that sometimes, the bad ideas do really work.<br/><br/>The second half quickens the pace when Mendez meets the 6 Americans for the first time and has to do a quick job of trying to convince them of the plan, and getting them to act and play their role as part of a film crew. Although Mendez's plan was stopped by the authorities, he proceeds anyway. The tension really hits the roof at the airport when this desperate group are but steps away from freedom. The editing work was very well done, and you'll feel your stomach going to knots. It's only when the plane announced they were safely on their way to Zurich that you can finally let go. I would imagine that was how the 6 Americans felt at that time.<br/><br/>Overall, this was an extremely satisfying movie. The look and feel of the movie felt authentic, right down to the deliberate decision to make the entire movie grainy and 70s. I would be extremely disappointed if Argo did not get a mention in the Academy Awards."
"WillyWhitby","10","3","7","14 November 2012"," Argo see it right now!
","I decided to go see this film purely on the basis it had Dream On by Aerosmith in the trailer and it looked pretty explosive. I have to say that it was one of the best few quid I have spent all year! <br/><br/>Argo is set in 1979 Iran at the time when the US embassy in Tehran was seized by Iranian rebels and revolutionaries. During the siege six workers managed to escape and sort refuge in the Canadian ambassador's house. It is Tony Mendez's(Ben Affleck) job working with CIA to get the hostages out of the city and back to the US. Not to give too much of the plot away and ruin it for you, it is his job to devise a plan to get them home by getting them involved in a fake sci-fi film developed entirely with the aim of getting them back home with many tense and gripping moments along the way. The defining line being ""so you want to come to Hollywood, act like a big shot...without actually doing anything? You'll fit right in!"" <br/><br/>Casting agent has done a brilliant job for this film I must say. Affleck's movies can either go terribly or brilliantly, thankfully his tip-top job made this a brilliant film making the character of Tony very believable and gritty. Bryan Cranston (a man who I only know from playing Hal in Malcolm In The Middle) plays Jack O'Donnell the CIA officer who seems to only person to have faith in the operation and his down-to-earth and realistic acting made him brilliant gutsy CIA individual. The aim of the operation was to make a phony Hollywood movie and John Goodman plays John Chambers a prosthetic artist who uses his knowledge of the city to set up a fake movie with all the bells and whistles. Alan Arkin plays Lester Siegel a leading Hollywood actor and the duo help make the operation happen and also provide the odd joke and key-line here and there. Of course a hostage movie can't be possible with some hostages and performances from Kerry Bische and Tate Donavon made the hostages that bit believable and you as the audience feel part of the group with the intimate moments of peril.<br/><br/>The whole idea seems very far-fetched and something you would hear straight out of Hollywood, but you keep having to remind yourself that these events did actually in real life and the life and death situations you see the characters really did occur to the people involved. Various photos during the credit rang this true, showing that the director (also Ben Affleck) did an exquisite job of getting all the scenes and people to look nearly identical the actual events of the end of the 70's in Tehran, right down to the burning flags and the 'in-fashion moustaches'. Big well done for the CIA in real life for actually pulling this job off for real! Bit of a clichéd but it had me right on the edge of the seats right until the very end with the fast pace of the escape getting your heart pumping, and (not knowing that these events happened and the true life outcome it because of my age) had me wanting to know the result with every minute passing.<br/><br/>Overall I'd say it's one of the best movies I've seen all year and hat's off for the return of Ben Affleck in an excellent protagonist and director role and he deserved multiple awards for so far the film of year! <br/><br/>www.willstolive.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/film-review-argo.html"

"cummingsjosh7","10","3","7","26 October 2012"," Three in a row for Mr. Affleck!
","Argo, the third feature directed by Ben Affleck, is simply stunning. Taking place during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis, Argo takes your breath away as it very accurately portrays the covert CIA operation, led by Ben Affleck, to extract six American hostages. In the midst of the Iran hostage crisis, six American citizens escaped out the back exit the of the U.S. Embassy. They took hiding in the Canadian Ambassador's home but were very much in danger as they were constantly being looked for by Iranian soldiers. CIA extractor Tony Mendez (Affleck) hatches a scheme to disguise the six citizens and himself as a Canadian film crew scouting Iran as a location for a fake movie called ""Argo."" The plan is then for them to hopefully sneak back into USA using the Iran International Airport, leading to a nail-biting finish.<br/><br/>At this point, Ben Affleck is a supreme director. The first two movies he directed (Gone Baby Gone and The Town) were outstanding and he has now outdone himself with his latest installment, Argo. Though Argo is not as gritty as the previous films directed by Affleck, the intensity level is just as high. As a viewer, you will have to wait patiently for the climax to build but I can assure you, you will be rewarded with one of the most tense movie experiences this year. Ben Affleck did a very nice job of letting the plot grow and develop on its own. You don't feel forced to care about these stranded American citizens. Instead, the movie sucks you into their dilemma and the film grows so organically that you find yourself worried and scared for these people without even realizing it. Even if you know the story, you will still be left in shock and awe as you witness this adaptation of the courageous mission that took place. Kudos to Ben Affleck for drawing me in and not letting go.<br/><br/>You may feel confused when watching Argo for the first 45 minutes of the movie. Like I said, the plot slowly builds. By this I mean, it almost seems like comedy for a brief period. Ben Affleck is trying to pitch a fake movie with Alan Arkin and John Goodman and there are some moments that are pretty hilarious. However, this part of the movie is very necessary as it lets the story shape into an exciting thriller with a huge pay-off.<br/><br/>Unlike Affleck's previous movies where the action is in, well, the action of the characters, in Argo, the action is all in the dialog. This is done with superb acting under the helm of Affleck. This is by far the best performance from Affleck thus far in his career. Bryan Cranston was amazing in this movie too but honestly, when isn't Bryan Cranston amazing? Cranston is one of the best actors around today and he shows that in this film. The best thing about Argo is that everything (the script, the performances, the dialog) was all very real.<br/><br/>Argo is an Oscar worthy picture. It really is a movie event at its finest and gives you hope for the future of film making. I will have to say that The Town is a little bit better of a movie but Argo is still a damn good film that leaves me eager to see what Ben Affleck does next. You do not want to miss this exciting political thriller. A+"

The Iranian Islamist extremist characters are all monsters and very intelligent and very scary. At times, I was reminded of Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now when he writes in his memoirs, ""Drop the bomb; exterminate them all."" This film really depicts the futility of trying to bargain with mad men. They are depicted as killer apes in human form; madness permeates the country from top to bottom. This is not religion in any way, shape or form; it is madness. Every scene is directed with such a deft touch by Affleck, and it is definitely one of the best films I've seen this year. Memorable is a word I would use to characterize it. Don't miss it."

","I will readily admit that I am a very critical person when it comes to movies. After all, a normal person doesn't contribute over 13800 (and counting) reviews to IMDb! However, ""Argo"" is an unusual film because I honestly can't think of a single negative thing to say about it! Really...it's THAT good! The film is about a joint effort by the Canadian government and the CIA to rescue a group of six Americans stranded in Iran during their revolution in 1979-80. It seems that most of the Americans in the US embassy were captured by extremists but a small group of folks escaped and sought shelter in the Canadian embassy. What happened next? See the film.<br/><br/>It's odd. In light of the film's greatest strength, how could the Oscar folks NOT have nominated Ben Affleck for Best Director? After all, in so many ways the film was wonderfully directed. Although I knew the fate of the six refugees, I STILL found myself reacting to the incredibly tense ending. I was actually chewing my fingernails and could feel my heart pounding. Additionally, the film was wonderful how it kept weaving the characters into a VERY complicated and wonderful story. The other unsung heroes of the film were the producers (and there were many) and makeup folks. They managed to really capture the look of the era and look of the actual characters in real life. And, finally, the script was just terrific. Overall a magnificent film--one that clearly is in the running for Best Picture this year. And, incidentally, the audience at the showing tonight broke into applause when the film ended! I can't say that it should win, as some of the films nominated are so different and I haven't yet seen them all. Heck, I'd love to see a couple take home the statuette as it's been a very good year for films.<br/><br/>By the way, if you are the sort to leave when the final credits roll, DON'T. Watch and see."

With this in place Tony just has to fly to Iran and hope the six diplomats can bluff their way past the crowds of American-hating Iranians and the Revolutionary Guards.<br/><br/>Stories based on fact have one big advantage over entirely fictional thrillers they can do things that would appear unbelievable in a work of fiction because they actually happened; escaping from revolutionary Iran while pretending to be making a Star Wars rip-off is certainly pretty unbelievable! Director Ben Affleck did a fine job capturing the feel of 1979; the film even looks like films of that era, He also does a great job acting as protagonist Tony Mendez. The rest of the cast, including the likes of Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin and John Goodman also perform well; I especially enjoyed the latter two who provided some nice laughs which lightened the mood nicely at times. Even though most viewers will know the mission was successful there are quite a few surprisingly tense moments; especially towards the end. There are inevitably some factual inaccuracies although I think they can be forgiven as the story works well and trying to make it entirely accurate would have served to lower the tension without necessarily adding to the story."
"JoeyNolfi","5","2","4","22 August 2013"," Argo: A Mixed Bag of Conflicted Ideals and Smooth Action
","Americans love watching other Americans win; whether it be at the Olympics, cheering an angry housewife as she berates a retail worker for an extra 20% off, or in a power struggle of Western values against Middle Eastern opposition. Countless international conflicts, thirty-three years, a fake film, and six would-be-hostage escapees later we have Argo, an ambitious (if problematic) two hour jerk-off to a ""winning"" America from director-star Ben Affleck. If you find yourself complaining about the ""spoiler"" just revealed, chances are you grew up with a ""Jem"" lunch box and/or didn't pay attention in history class; you're not Argo's target age demographic, and shame on you for being a waste of space (and tax dollars) in mid-80s elementary school.<br/><br/>Turmoil amidst foreign affairs in the Middle East lingered as the Vietnam War ended, the purple haze of the hippie generation wafting away, the legacy of the 1970s lingering as the dust settled; The stage for Argo is set amidst an era which ushered in a uniquely aggressive American perspective on foreign affairs and the United States' role in international crises, one that's hardly containable within a white picket fence crafted with optimism and a neighborly ""hello."" This post-""American Dream"" America serves as only a pseudo centerpiece for the glorious buffet of cultural critique Affleck initially serves up. The bulk of the film is a systematic retelling of the ""Canadian Caper"" rescue mission of 1979, the remaining course a condemnation of America's world presence as a vigilant virus of socio-cultural-political domination. Burka-clad women snacking on KFC, inept Government employees, and a nation easily distracted by the celluloid escape/fandom fantasy of Hollywood come to mind as pieces of the diverse American identity Argo seems to hate.<br/><br/>Affleck spends plenty of time attempting to convince us that America—Hollywood in particular—is filled with capitalistic, power-tripping pigs, but by the same token the artifice of the film industry is credited as the saving grace of the six American lives stranded in Tehran after a Revolutionary mob storms the U.S. Embassy, the Canadian Ambassador agreeing to shelter them in secrecy. C.I.A. specialist Tony Mendez (Affleck) enlists the help of movie industry power players John Chambers (John Goodman) and Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) to craft an elaborate plot to ""fake"" the production of a film (press kits, magazine articles, table reading and all) which will scout locations in Tehran, allowing the six potential rescuees to pose as members of the crew for their secret extraction. Still, capitalist Hollywood/blood suckling America rears its ugly head; ""If I'm going to make a fake film, I'm going to make a fake hit,"" Chambers asserts.<br/><br/>Much of the action revolving around the rescue itself is exciting, if rather formulaic. There's no doubt Affleck is a skilled filmmaker. His ability to harvest thick wads of newfound suspense from historical molds with well-known, pre-established outcomes is a testament to his precision and tact as a director. But, after the smoke clears, I'm left clawing for traction, searching for an auteuristic mark amidst the sheen of suspense for suspense's sake. It makes for a fun ride but a muddled message—especially when the outcome is already rooted in the history of reality.<br/><br/>Affleck breaks the ""Tell me something I can't look up on Google"" rule with Argo, but ultimately the biggest problems I have with the film are its wishy-washy, conflicted values. On one hand scenes of increasingly hostile, violent tension between the United States and Iran pepper the film with a sense of impending doom. On the other, it's a film hell-bent on assuring us that as long as you live in America, everything is going to be OK. The sentiment is inspiring, but simply doesn't bode well–especially with the climate of contemporary foreign affairs. Scenes of Iranian officials declaring revenge upon all parties (including Canada) for their involvement in the rescue are sprinkled throughout the closing moments of Argo, bringing the reality of worldwide conflict crashing through the dream veneer the celebratory comfort the success of the mission provides. For a moment you find yourself thinking that this is a film that finally gets it; a film which touts happiness as the fleeting, momentary emotion that it is. The world is not perfect, and Hollywood processes real-world conflict into spectacular fodder for a willing audience. In the ideal world of Argo Mendez returns to his home, embraces his wife, reunites with his son, and all is right after a wave of Uncle Sam's magic wand. The biting reality Affleck dangles over our heads for the majority of the film, however, proves problematic as it begs to reroute that sappy conclusion at all costs.<br/><br/>Argo is a ultimately a prelude to contemporary American sentiment, to the War on Terror, and to every ignorant New Yorker who smashed the windows of Persian-owned restaurants after 9/11. It's a film that fully acknowledges that the world isn't full of rainbows and sunshine—never has been, never will be. It's a stark reality mainstream film tends to generalize far beyond the scope of any real-world implications. Glimpses of such critique are present in Argo, but the overarching, influential hand of Hollywood control destroys any effects it might have had thanks to a hokey ending and melodramatic tricks. Argo ultimately falls victim to too many fantastical ""fixes"" that force the film out of touch with the reality it so desperately seeks to correct. Argo might end with a macho movie icon embracing a hot blonde while the American flag flies conspicuously in the front yard of their suburban home, but reinforcing the traditional pageantry of idealized American values means nothing in the face of those irate Iranians whom actually informed the world that ""Canada will pay."""

","The most impressive aspect of Argo is the reconstitution of the 70's era. It deserves an Oscar for ""costumes"" and ""props"". And that's about it...<br/><br/>The acting is bad, the use of 70's songs to set the mood is very poorly done. The inaccuracy regarding actual events is enormous... The ""added drama and suspense"" that directors evoke as ""artistic liberty"" in this case was ridiculous. SPOILER ALLERT!<br/><br/>When they are all going to the airport aboard a VW minivan, they run into a relatively small crowd who are staging some kind of protest on a street corner. I've encountered similar situations on my travels. What would does my driver do in such cases? What any driver would do (except in Hollywood): he backs up, does a U-turn, takes a different way; simply avoids the crowd. Even the locals do that, it's common sense. What do the characters in the movie do? They drive slowly right into the crowd, in order to get those dramatic shots of people banging on the van's windows... The whole sequence at the airport, with the Revolutionary Guards shooting at a door to open it, then chasing a 747 down the runway (ridiculous!), and only afterward going to the control tower to harass the flight controllers... The film loses the credibility it had built for almost 90 minutes.<br/><br/>Beasts Of The Southern Wild was way better than this; and so was Zero Dark Thirty; and so was ""The Life Of Pi""; and so was ""Django Unchained"". <br/><br/>Sometimes we complain that certain films have been written assuming that the audience are all morons; the fact that the members of the Academy chose ""Argo"" for best film says something about their level of intelligence...<br/><br/>Mind you, Argo is not a bad film... But it certainly does not deserve the hype and neither the ""best film"" award."

The acting left much to be desired with Ben Aflec giving his usual plastic performance.<br/><br/>That said, I was interested in the movie since I lived through the Iran hostage crisis. There was a lot of original news footage of the time intermixed with the movie footage, but not all that well integrated.

","Just saw 'Argo'. No idea why that won the Oscar for best picture. What a load of propaganda and feel good nonsense that was. The movie boils down to this: Iranians BAD.....Americans GOOOD. Iranians angry, shouting, idiots lusting for blood........Americans calm, collected, peace loving saviours. What a joke. It's as if I was watching an old Western movie with the Indians portrayed as dumb, grunting, scalp thirsty savages. And the cowboys the innocent, freedom loving heroes who only wish for a plot of land with some pigs and a field of corn on which their young'uns can grow to become model citizens of the good ol' US of A. This is 2013, please!! We all know America is the most bloodthirsty country in the world, with a history of messing with governments all over the planet in order to secure its position of power and wealth. EVERYBODY knows this. How can you then, in this day and age, make a film like this? This movie is so one-dimensional in its portrayal of the pain and anger of the Iranians that it hurts. <br/><br/>Come on Hollywood this is sooo old, please show some balls and make exciting movies again. Movies about the dark side of the US for example. Movies about things you really do not want the rest of the world to know about, but don't realise the rest of the world already knows. Here's an idea, why not make a movie about how the US destabalised Iran by overthrowing Mossadeq, which left a whole nation broken and crying until this day. Make this movie, show how ashamed you are of this part of your history. Show that you are grieving for all those people, all those families that have been torn apart. Let the world know how the US, who have liberty and democracy as the pillars on which they have grown so big, feel about taking away the democracy of a country. Make it an exciting movie with suspense, action, love, death, heroes, traitors, villains....., you know, a movie everybody wants to go see. You will win awards, become famous, earn tons of money, ride cool cars, get to swim in pools with many beautiful woman and as a plus you will have regained some self respect. <br/><br/>Movies are very powerful, they can change the tone, or feeling, of a whole nation on any subject. They can bring people together or they can widen the gap between them. They can heal wounds or they can open them even further. I am sad to see that you have chosen the latter in this movie. A wasted opportunity."

","Hollywood was never famous for telling the truth. But Argo is just not a very good movie. It is straight-forward, predictable, with no depth at all, dull dialogs (except for very funny John Goodman and Alan Arkin), non-authentic in terms of shooting location, pseudo documentary shaky camera to increase the drama, full of stereotypes and clichés, for the most parts just pathetic, and of course with clear political message who are the bad guys (and how they look like). Nevertheless, it hides behind the quasi political engagement the fact that some movie actors are simply not good movie directors (similar to Angelina Jolie's first movie). And it shows that judgment about a movie as entertainment is mixed-up with judgement about foreign policy of the USA."

","Movie, Argo was a deal breaker, something new for all to feed on. This script gained its audience due to its circumstantial past. Movie was straight forward, well executed. The best part was a simple direction. Argo could have had been a little more realistic, could have had been more elaborated to grasp upon. Movie had some low points, like some plots were too fast and some were too slow, no synchronization. Actors on the other hand did a fair job, nothing special. This movie is only valued because of the script and the truth of power it had to offer. All in all a good movie that will surely find its way to you. I surely enjoyed it."
"eastern0002","Null","2","4","12 February 2013"," Hollywoodian, as expected, and nothing else!
","Hollywood is really skilled in taking a line and wrap it in a bundle of exaggerations, lies and distorted images to the point to direct the spectator to forget the main story. I don't really know whether the story of the film is on exact reality of those years or is a mere adaptation. It is a custom in Hollywood films that are made about Korean, Iraqis, Iranians etc. to show them semi-barbarian people with deformed ugly faces and childish sinister characters. This cliché is always used to conceal truth. For example, as far as I remember, this was the story of the American female soldier who was wounded in action and was arrested by the Iraqi citizens who kindly hospitalized the girl but Hollywood later made a film showing how heroic American commandos rescued the poor injured girl from detention of Iraqis! The film tries to fairly brief Iranian contemporary history, national government of Mosadeq who was toppled down by a US-backed coup and the tyrannical regime of Shah, but when it begins the story you are suddenly plunged into untrue scenes. Though today, after three decades, almost all Iranians, even those students who stormed and captured the US embassy, reject this measure as a breach of diplomatic norms and international regulations but on those days, just coming out of a brutal US-backed regime, almost all political forces who played a role in the social life - including nationalists, socialists, democratic forces, students etc. - supported the move as an attempt to show disagreement with US policies in Iran and the Middle East. The people who gathered in front of the embassy were not only thugs and ruffians but university students and middle class members who favored modernism, independence and freedom. In fact, the hostage taking happened in a revolutionary era where no political force had monopolized power. There was a challenge between progressive and reactionary forces. Therefore, portraying Iran as a country of ""big brother"" in those months is absolutely unrealistic. The more ridiculous was the scene of hanging a man from a crane that was too queer to be believed. Such hangings were practiced when the new power stabilized itself and this had not yet happened in 1980. In those months, Iranian society was a vivid and interesting scene of debate on every issue including hostage taking. Everyday, in public places, in universities, in city squares, people freely gathered to discuss politics, and this is far from the pictures you see in Argo. The film is full of errors concerning names, pictures, customs etc. For example, IRGC members have uniforms like Cuban soldiers and even have long hairs that remind us of Camilo Cienfuegos and Che Guevara rather than IRGC members who never wear long hair! In Tehran Airport, a big picture of Ayatollah Shariatmadari was mounted while Shariatmadari, a moderate cleric, had parted his way from extremists from the beginning and was almost hated by them. The emblem of the Iranian airline and airport is a comic combination of Iranian lion and sward (used as national emblem before the revolution) and a mythical motif ""Homa"". Airport personnel mostly resembled servants of Imam Reza shrines who are responsible for cleaning the shrine and its yard rather than airport staff. Many other errors and guffs are seen and listing them is beyond the scope of s short note. At any rate, this was a Hollywoodian film, another sign that American mainstream always fails to grasp the true essence of events and phenomena."

","Thumbs up for Ben Affleck. He did a great job making a political story to a film in a very fair way. I respect that. And as an Iranian I believe that this is not a political game at this time, but a movie that can entertain you.<br/><br/>As an Iranian who is not a big fan of his country specially at 80s, but a big fan of cinema, I see this film is pure art and nothing else matters. You are watching it, not thinking about why or how this is, which means script has a lot to discuss, but instead, you think about people in it, characters, about Tony's son, about the house keeper, about the mad man at bazaar and yet, this is it! The film got you in! Why would I destroy such an entertaining moment watching this by an unfair political and nationalistic look? And why is this film entertaining? Because of Mr. Affleck's solid way of direction. That not only helps you to believe the story and people in it, but helps you involve and think about it and worry about upshot as well.<br/><br/>Not so long ago a revolution had happened in Iran and then, some bad mistakes happened too. I know that most of the people in Iran in 1979 and 80s were strangely violent and this film is all about a mistake that I can't ignore it as a human being, but I can't ignore the US government's involvement at Shaah's crimes at the moment. So, what I wanted from this picture, was a fair perspective of what happened and that is exactly what I got! Film is not trying to tell you that all Iranian People were bad and Iran is Devil! Also is not trying to tell you that USA is saint. See? <br/><br/>I can tell you that some important issues ... forget it! I almost cried at the end and nothing else matters, so ... I give it a 9 out of 10 for being entertaining, thrilling and fair enough to be one of my favorites as a boy born and raised in Iran!<br/><br/>Argo... go **** yourself!"

So, off to the movies we go to re-live the events in Hollywood splendor. - While the story of the 6 American citizens that escaped the embassy and thus avoid being captured, is a good one, the film itself is terribly slow the vast majority of the time. If not for the fantastic characters played by John Goodman and Alan Arkin, this movie might have put people to sleep. That is, up until the last 10 min of the movie....... even when you already know the outcome, it's still fairly tense.

This stuff all while bland, filler music is thrown together. Could this be anymore ""tense""?! There's no subtlety here and its boldly appalling.

Really standard storytelling, and nothing exciting at all.<br/><br/>And without the named actors, these movies would only be a documentary re-enactment on discovery or history channel.<br/><br/>I saw no feats of great acting in this movie.

"knowyourmovie","8","2","4","4 December 2012"," A must-see movie despite the historical inaccuracies and some story unevenness
","""Argo"" is a solidly built, but not always historically accurate drama with the several interconnected plot lines of varying quality masterfully woven together by the little known until now screenwriter Chris Terrio and by Ben Affleck who directed the movie and was one of the producers.<br/><br/>The Oscar-rumored ""Argo"" is another successful step in the Mr. Affleck's transition from one of the most unrealized promising young Hollywood actors to one of the most prominent young Hollywood directors, previously known for the well-done ""The Town"" (2010) and ""Gone Baby Gone"" (2007).<br/><br/>While I like ""Argo"" a lot and even consider it a ""must-see"" movie, the uneven quality of its intertwined story lines as well as some relatively easy noticeable historical inaccuracies do not allow me to call this heartfelt movie a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The first plot line is based on the historical events of the Iranian revolution of 1979, from its beginning, to its progression, to its results. While flawlessly executed from the professional perspective and offering the highest level of authenticity in almost every small but expressive detail, the powerful emotional tale told in ""Argo"" is plagued with the avoidable historical inaccuracies and simplifications. As a result, the movie misses an opportunity to seriously and thoughtfully explore the tragic historical events. That somewhat reduces ""Argo"" to merely a high quality entertainment piece that just happens to utilize the real life tragedy to skillfully play on our raw emotions provoked by it.<br/><br/>The second and the core plot line in ""Argo"" focuses on the remarkable story of the six American embassy workers. It features the escape from the occupied by the militant crowds embassy building, the difficult time they spent trapped in the Canadian embassy without much hope, and of course the complex and risky rescue operation that even included a fictional movie production company setup in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Just as the story of the Iranian revolution, the hostage rescue story, while well-written, well-directed, and well-acted, regrettably contains some historical inaccuracies. In a nutshell, ""Argo"" over-emphasizes the role of CIA at the expense of the Canadian and British allies whose role is unfairly distorted and downplayed in the movie.<br/><br/>In addition to the avoidable distortions, the story contains some pretty much unavoidable ""enhancements"" that I do not count against ""Argo"": the added suspense elements absent in the real life story the movie is based on.<br/><br/>Spicing a thriller up with some artificially injected suspense is often a necessary evil as in many cases it is almost impossible to create a watchable, appealing to the audience thriller and keep it fully realistic.<br/><br/>In the story told in ""Argo"" everything happens at the last possible moment, everything routinely hangs by a thread, and everything requires a little miracle to move forward. The reality, of course, was a little more uneventful and a little less suspenseful. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the two remaining story lines of ""Argo"" – the ""government agencies"" line and the ""Hollywood cover up"" line are far less authentic, far less original, and far more formulaic and ""Hollywoodish"" than the hostage rescue mission and the Iranian revolution stories.<br/><br/>Every time ""Argo"" attempts to reveal how the various government agencies worked together on the rescue mission details, the powerful original story yields to the one big, long cliché that has been shamelessly wandering from one movie to another for a long, long time.<br/><br/>The other quite unimpressive plot line was a secondary in nature story of the CIA operation getting a cover-up in Hollywood. While not bearing much significance in the movie, the ""Hollywood cover-up"" story has ironically become the most popular, the most well-known by general audience thanks to the movie marketing campaign effort.<br/><br/>It was painful to watch good actors Alan Arkin and John Goodman in this predictable, forced, and unauthentic low farce much more appropriate for a bad TV show than for a gritty political drama based on a true story.<br/><br/>In a striking contrast with the rest of the movie, this lightweight superficial story does not seem to make even a slightest attempt to seriously explore a captivating topic of the secret cooperation between Hollywood and CIA to save the lives of American citizens.<br/><br/>From the acting perspective, ""Argo"" is mostly a delight to watch.<br/><br/>The actors who played the hostages were believable in their memorable portrayal of the ordinary people experiencing an immense stress caused by the extraordinary, life-threatening circumstances.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck had a difficult task as well. In addition to directing the movie, he needed to be very careful in his performance as CIA agent Tony Mendez, ""Argo's"" main character. The key was to avoid the temptation of playing James Bond, Jason Born, or any other traditional action movie hero at all costs and instead, to portray an ordinary man with an extraordinary courage, honor, sense of responsibility, and unfailing love for the people who need help and protection.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Ben Affleck found all the right accents for his role. As a result, his decidedly restrained, unflashy, but nuanced and powerful performance was arguably the best acting work in the movie.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston managed to overcome the limitations of his clichéd ""boss"" character and was good as usual in the supporting role of Jack O'Donnell, Tony Mendez's supervisor.<br/><br/>Another solid, memorable performance in the movie was by Victor Garber who intelligently played the role of Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Argo"" once again proves that life is the best story teller. The movie is at its best when it remains close to the historical truth. The further it deviates from the truth, the more fictional elements it adds, the less satisfying, deep, and convincing it becomes.<br/><br/>Despite the historical inaccuracies and some story unevenness, ""Argo"" nevertheless remains a must see movie, and arguably one of the best movies of 2012. <br/><br/>knowyourmovie.blogspot.com"
"freemantle_uk","9","2","4","22 November 2012"," This is the best bad idea we have
","The story behind Argo is so extraordinary that it hard to believe and that it couldn't be made up. But it is history and after making two successful Boston set crime thrillers, Ben Affleck has stepped out his comfort zone to make a historic spy thriller.<br/><br/>In 1979 the Iranian Shah has been overthrown by the Islamic Revolution and the American is the Great Satan for their support for the dictator. The American Embassy is under siege and on 4th November the Iranians overtake the embassy and hold the Americans hostage. But six Americans escape before the invasion and find sanctuary at the Canadian ambassador's (Victor Garber) home. In Washington D.C. the CIA and State Department have few options to get the Americans out: they cannot use the usual cover identity of journalists, charity workers and English teachers. One expert at extracting people, Tony Mendez (Affleck) comes up with an unconventional way of extraction, pretend the Americans are all part of an Canadian film crew on a location scout and goes to Hollywood to form a fake production company.<br/><br/>Affleck has already shown himself to be a skilled director and Argo shows he is one of the best thriller directors around. Argo is different to his previous two films and Affleck was able to balance the tension and thrills with healthy amount of humour, satirising Hollywood and Washington. One of my favourite scenes that shows this is the fake film has a press conference intercut with the Americans in Iran watching an Iranian spokeswoman and Jimmy Carter making a speech. Alan Arkin supplied plenty of humour as the guff, old film producer, but it was never his expense. Bryan Cranston also has some fun lines. But for the most part the film is serious and the stakes as people's lives are on the line and there is every chance the Iranians can find. In the background the Iranians are reconstructing documents that can show who the missing Americans are and their counter intelligence operation is always on the go.<br/><br/>Argo is filled with period detail and does an excellent job blending a realistic spy operation and how the CIA operates with a more outrageous operation. It makes an interesting counter to piece to the Bond and Bourne series and the very realistic Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. This is a film that shows a CIA operation is all about the details, making sure there are no holes in cover stories, all the documentation is correct, etc. There is no gun play and the whole point is the CIA are trying to avoid any conformation, especially any situation could lead to a war.<br/><br/>I am personally a history, politics and spy nut, so this film was always going to appeal to me. The spying preparations were interesting but some of the moments I really enjoyed was some of the discussions between the characters, particularly the Americans in Iran about what's happening: it felt very real and nature, like there people really living in the time period, not a screenplay benefiting from hindsight.<br/><br/>Whilst the film is strong throughout the story does take a few liberties, namely making out Britain and New Zealand in Iran were useless when they were involved in the operation and nor showing Canadian Intelligence's part in the operation when in reality they must have been involved seeing it involved their ambassador. Also the final third of the film felt like everything that can go wrong will go wrong, building up the tension. But it all felt a bit too fault when so much bad stuff is happening, when the characters' nerves would have enough to build the tension.<br/><br/>Argo is a very enjoyable adult film that is deserving of its steady box-office success. It should get a few Oscar nominations and it does entertain."

I am also not a fan of Hollywood movies but when the guys in Tincletown get it right, they can produce movies that are unique to them; even the bad Disney movies with talking animals is unique (what else can you say about them).<br/><br/>I cannot say much about Argo. I have never been in Ira; I only know their great revolution from history and regarding the American hostage situation, my information is conspiratorial from progressive web sites. Those sites are fascinating with darkened reflections on the election of Reagan followed the next day by a deal to free the hostages. It was all too clever and coincidental for belief.<br/><br/>I would strongly suggest that you watch the film. It is very good, in our humble opinion."

","Although heightened up for dramatic purposes, ARGO proved to be an intense thriller. Even with numerous inaccuracies portrayed in the film it never once strayed far from its clever storytelling techniques.<br/><br/>Right from its opening sequence when the Time-Warner logo appeared on screen to its entire atmosphere of the film truly felt like it was a movie conceived back in the 70-80s era. Though not grainy or scratchy as one would imagine seeing an actual film from those decades director, Ben Affleck, cleverly brought the essence of the Iran Hostage Crisis of the late 70s as surreal as possible like we're watching an actual footage or documentary on film.<br/><br/>I highly appreciate the intensity that Affleck brought to the story and his brilliant vision of this true event to contemporary audience who may or may not aware of the real story.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Affleck managed to capture not only the ""feel"" of the 70s but also the dramatic chronology of the events.<br/><br/>Personally, I am aware of the Iran Hostage Crisis however I must admit that I had no prior knowledge that the whole rescue operation by CIA was made into a somewhat close resemblance to the 1997 film WAG THE DOG; in that the US government had some sort of collaboration with Hollywood studios to make up stories as a decoy for an actual political agenda.<br/><br/>But needless to say Affleck did an excellent job in dramatizing the event.<br/><br/>I would sum up ARGO as an intense rescue mission that has a more edge-of-your-seat moments a la 1995 APOLLO 13. However, ARGO brings the audience to a whole lots of intensity that I was practically tossing and turning in my seat in suspense.<br/><br/>As such, with its surreal editing and great script coupled with brilliant acting and direction by Ben Affleck there is no doubt that ARGO indeed reeks of Oscars all around."
"3xHCCH","7","2","4","16 November 2012"," It's Supposed to Be Real Events, But Still Unbelievable!
","When I saw the trailer of ""Argo,"" I already felt like the whole story was already shown. I did not feel like I wanted to watch it. The story of rescuing hostages in Iran by pretending they were shooting a movie is simply unbelievable. The star and director was one of my least favorite Hollywood actors, Ben Affleck. However, curiosity still got the better of me when nothing but stellar reviews came out when it was shown. There was even talk of Oscar nominations! This I had to see.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck plays Tony Mendez who came up with this wild idea. He plays it smartly low key in the whole movie. But in that key scene where he announces his idea in the first place, I still feel that Ben was deficient as the lead actor. I would not have been sold the way he delivered the critical line about his suggestion to film a fake movie. It is great though that the rest of the supporting cast succeeded very well in their respective roles. Alan Arkin and John Goodman were very funny as the Hollywood people who help Ben hatch the fake absurd sci-fi project which they dubbed ""Argo.""<br/><br/>The story is still as unbelievable as I thought. The whole scheme felt so shallow and lame, something only a B-movie producer would greenlight. We are talking about rescuing Americans trapped in Iran in the 70s under the Ayatollah Khoemeini here, and all they can come with was something as ridiculous and far-fetched as this one. But I guess what they say is true, that truth is stranger than fiction. <br/><br/>Fortunately, Ben Affleck the director was able to sell the whole movie to us in a very tight, tense and assured way. The climactic sequence of the escape proper was done in a rather clichéd Hollywood-y manner, but you can't help but hang on to the edge of your seats. The film editing, the very late 70s style cinematography, the realistic set and costume design all contribute to the success of story telling.<br/><br/>This is a very good suspense thriller yes, but to call it the next Oscar Best Picture I think is over reaching a bit. Like ""The Town"" before this, Ben Affleck has improved as a director, but the Oscar for Best Director for ""Argo"" may also be too much of an ambition. Nominations for both categories though are real possibilities, but are more certain in the Supporting Actor and the technical categories."
"HelenMary","8","2","4","15 November 2012"," tense, gripping and full of realism
","I didn't know much about the Iranian hostage situation, and thought that this film was going to be about how the hostages in the embassy were rescued, but it turns out that this is about six hostages that escaped and were holed up in the house of the Candadian Ambassador. Ben Affleck plays the CIA hostage retriever/negotiator sent to Iran to bring them back under the tenuous guise of a sci-fi film crew. <br/><br/>I'm not a huge Affleck fan, or should I say I wasn't. In this - where he acts, produces and directs, he was brilliant. If he doesn't get at least an Academy nod for direction I'll be very surprised. The direction was tight, close and everything was done to increase the suspense and the tension. The whole style of the film was of the period (late 70s), with muted colours and even film logos were of the time, which was a clever touch, and wardrobe was great. It looked just like an old film! For a tense premise, there was some humorous moments and the audience reacted, which is always a good sign. Goodman and Arkin were so fun to watch, and Cranston had some hilarious lines - but he's an incredible actor in anything. Part of the tenseness of the film was - for me - that it was all so real. There were no SFX to speak of, everything was closely filmed and intimate; you were right there in the action.<br/><br/>The downside of this film is that it is very flag-waving American, and damning of the Islamic Community. Yes, this is true story and yes the Iranians did do all this but, and it's a big but, in the film's favour, it did narrate at the start how it all came about and that didn't put America in a good light. It was presented factually and whilst not in an unbiased way, obviously you are 'cheering' for the USA/Canada, and it was fairly balanced.<br/><br/>In the end credits - stay for them - the characters (the actors) are shown next to their real life inspirations. The only one that is not freakily similar is Affleck himself. As well as staying for the end credits, keep an eye out for a giggly extra in the car in the crowd scene. LOL! Overall a brilliant film, highly recommend both for style, content and realism."

","They say 3rd time's a charm, and in this is certainly the case with Argo, Ben Afflecks 3rd directorial feature.<br/><br/>Argo is based on the true story of the 1980 joint CIA-Canadian secret operation to extract six Amercans diplomats from revolutionary Iran. Of course this is a one sided story depicting American heroism however it gives more scope than most of this sub genre.<br/><br/>The blown up film effect used by Affleck to achieve a natural graininess to the picture made for a truly rich perspective.<br/><br/>The performance from Affleck was decent, but it was the supporting cast that really brought the story to life particularly Bryan Cranston, John Goodman and Alan Arkin who was both a presence and hilarious. His thick accent lifts his dialogue to heights which reminds you why you watch movies. Also worth noting were efforts by the relatively unknown actor Scoot McNairy who played Joe Stafford and reminded me of Johnny Depp I could definitely see him climbing the ladder quickly. I wanted to see more of Bryan Cranston as that man brings so much intensity to a scene and it was also a shame not to have included the directors brother Casey Affleck in this film however all in all while some scenes tenacity may have been stunted the mounting tension pushed the plot to an almost melting point and had me on the edge of my seat gripped with empathy.The tension could be carved in half with a knife.<br/><br/>In short Argo is exciting, enthralling and engaging film with some solid performances and awesome picture the grittiness of the dialogue and grainy footage truly encapsulated an overall wholesome authenticity,this is one that is definitely worth seeing in the cinemas.<br/><br/>If you liked Steven Spielberg's Munich go see Argo. I score it 8.2 out of 10. Watch in a small group or with a significant other."
"lucyjohnsonmc","8","2","4","8 November 2012"," A well made historical movie which mucks up the history.
","This is a brilliantly directed movie and I didn't even mind watching Ben Affleck, who is a heck of a better director than an actor. Why 8 stars and not the 10-stars it should have received? Well,had this movie been about a fictitious central Asian country with a nod in the direction of actual events I would have been more comfortable with it. The trouble is that precisely because of the realism and attention to detail meaning the absence of CGI and the portrayal of Iran in 1979/1980 is uncannily accurate to the point of severe creepiness, ( eg All the actors looked exactly like the people involved and all the places look as they looked, right down to having the old Tehran airport look exactly like, well, the old Tehran airport), the danger is the viewer ignorant of the true history will not think to question the historical accuracy. What is true is that 6 American consular staff escaped when the US Embassy was stormed, and the CIA, with the help of the Canadians (and the British, and the kiwis) got them out. However The film exaggerates the CIA involvement, plays down the fact that the Canadians were NOT just babysitting the American diplomats, but risking their lives to help them and instrumental in planning and executing their escape.<br/><br/>Other troubling aspects were the oversimplified narration of pre-Revolution Iran was not very accurate, portraying the Shah as someone who forced westernization on an unwilling conservative shia population who revolted, rather than the (as historians now accept) revolution resulted from alliance between the urban secular Left and the rural Religious Right. Portraying the Iranian revolution as Cleric v Shah plays a little to US stereotyping of Iran and it could have taken 3 seconds to actually explain it properly and get the Shah's name right. The portrayal of ""most"" Iranians as gun-toting Shia fanatics (Hand me that Chador, Brother! And pass me the machine pistol while you are at it! Allahu Akbar!) was also troubling, though this image was later that was modified by the sense that ""OK, ""most"" Iranians who are not afraid to go outside"". Another moan is that it was not the CIA who bought the plane tickets to get the diplomats out, it was Mrs Taylor, the Canuk Ambassador's wife, at significant personal risk. And the British, rather than turn them away, sheltered the Americans and got them to the Canadian embassy because the Embassy of Little Satan was the first place likely to searched for the missing Americans, who could not be passed off as Brits. A further gripe is Affleck, whom I detest as an actor as much as I detest Di Palma as a director. He was OK in this, but, really, would it have been so hard to find a Latino actor to play a CIA operative called Mendez? I gripe because had Affleck not mucked about with history the movie would have been just as good, if not better and, well, true. I am annoyed because it was such a great movie, but fell short of Truth, which let it down. However, the film is worth it for the physical attention to detail, the riveting plot, suspense, intrigue, and dark humor. It is a wonderful, well-made movie by a talented director, whose acting limitations were mitigated because the main character didn't talk much. I found myself riveted and caught up in the story in a way I have not for a very long time at the movies, and I have to conclude historical inaccuracies, such as they are, are not anachronistic. Just American."

There wasn't one weak link in the whole cast if I'm honest. Not that they were great, but they were not all that bad either. The film, at first, grabs our attention and makes us what to know what will happen. However, the characters aren't so well written that we really care all that much. The only characters which I found the most interesting were John Goodman's character John Chambers and Alan Arkin's character Lester Siegel, who aren't in any danger throughout the film. <br/><br/>The film then begins to center on Ben Affleck's character, Tony Mendez, and I don't personally believe he brings enough to him to make us care about his wife and child and also his desperate attempt to get the six men and woman out. Towards the end, the film started to drag out a tad bit, they were delaying the inevitable. And I found the whole last 20 minutes to be quite unnecessary and over the top, which didn't suit the tone of the whole film if I'm honest.<br/><br/>The film is enjoyable and contains decent acting. Pity about the characters and about the last 20 minutes. But, excluding the last 20 minutes and for what it is. I'm giving a 7/10."

","When it comes to deciding what movies to watch, there are a few certain things that I carefully consider. It narrows down to the cast, types of genre, and the length of the movie. When I watch the trailer, I feel ""This is not a type of movie that I would be interested in. But, that changes my mind after finding out the identity of protagonist whose face is covered with bushy beard, Ben Affleck, who is both director and actor with experiences of delivering a heart-breaking performance in ""Town."" In ""Argo"", he plays Tony Mendez, CIA technical operations officer that is destined help six Americans escape from Iran with a risky plan.<br/><br/>As it is based on a true incident that transpired in 1979, collecting old references, thorough research, and casting actors/actresses who closely resemble the real people that are involved in the event must be a challenging and time-consuming task. Surprisingly, it is by far the most nerve-wrecking and plausible film. <br/><br/>The reason would be the editing and composition. In order for us to easily and quickly grasp the story, it promptly begins with a narrative introduction of how and when the incident occurs by showing the actual clips from the past. Secondly, a shout-out to the herd of intimidating Iranian citizens who show an enthusiastic emotions that keep the entire theater petrified and quiet. Especially their skeptical and scornful glare towards the Americans in disguise was memorable. Last but not least, the realism. Do you want to feel an overwhelming atmosphere that pushes you to the brink of banishment?<br/><br/>Also, try to avoid presuming it is all about seriousness because Ben Affleck and the writers know how to make audiences laugh with a unique sense of humor. Try to pay close attention to the dialogues carefully. Because they aren't cliché or sarcasm."

","Ben Affleck has proved to be a successful actor-turned-director, what with ""The Town"" and ""Gone Baby Gone"" being well-liked, and ""Argo"" does not disappoint. Excellently cast, well-paced, and accurate, it's quite a masterpiece in a time when 'original' movies are few and far between. (Yeah, it's based on true events, but it's the first mainstream movie to do so for this event.) All the higher-ups and big players (John Goodman, Bryan Cranston, etc.) work wonderfully together, and there isn't a single kink in their roles or interactions. The opening infographics were especially cool (they are just like the ones in ""The Kingdom""). If you don't mind the swearing and want to learn a little bit about the past, I completely recommend this movie."
"ritera1","9","2","4","5 November 2012"," Even though it's not accurate....
","Affleck should win Best Director. I couldn't catch any flaws in the film making and there was a great deal of detail in the cinematography.<br/><br/>I might even nominate him for Best Actor. Would he win? No. But it was a nice, understated performance.<br/><br/>The manufactured parts of the story were obvious, though, even before I went home and checked the accuracy of the story. The previews give away the ending (which never happened). Apparently the trip through the airport was uneventful in real life. And the bus driver grinding the gears to ratchet up the tension? Come on! When Carter cancels the operation, I knew that didn't happen. It was dramatically valid and worked well, though.<br/><br/>Even though Affleck, like me, is a big ol' liberal, I've just about had enough of cliché portrayals of Middle Eastern people. The only redeeming Middle East character was the housekeeper. Enough already.<br/><br/>Thus, for me the Best Picture contenders are Argo, The Master, Damsels in Distress, and Moonrise Kingdom. A weak list this year. Moonrise Kingdom was the most enjoyable of all but had problems. Argo had no problems but wasn't quite there as an overwhelming experience. The Master was technically good but redundant. And Damsels in Distress was almost as good as Moonrise Kingdom."
"jaynekranc","9","2","4","5 November 2012"," Best film of it's type since ""Missing""
","This is a great movie with wonderful performances that is not getting nearly the buzz it deserves. Every actor is perfectly cast. I know there's been a lot of complaints about Affleck playing a Latino, but Tony's mother was Italian. I think people are just looking for something to nitpick.<br/><br/>The most important part of the film is the introduction, and having the narrator juxtapose the later Iranian woman denouncing the US was a nice touch. That back story was needed, desperately and it was well done.<br/><br/>John Goodman and Victor Garber are both delights. These actors never get credit for the range they have. Garber gives the Canadian ambassador the dignity he deserves and I thought it showed quite well the strain that he and his wife were under and the risks they took. Arkin is also wonderful and the play between him and John Goodman give the movie a few necessary lighter moments. The theater I was in cracked up when he said, ""Groucho said that?"" and it had been as tense as a tightly wound 70's style watch at that point.<br/><br/>Anyone who lived through this turbulent time will recognize what's going on. The costumes, the hair cuts, the big glasses, all are perfect for the time period. Yes, it's not exactly the way it was, but when someone says ""based on a true story"" they are not saying, ""This is a documentary!"" The movie ""Missing"" had the same complaints and it was amazing.<br/><br/>I do think the escape went a little over the top, with the police cars chasing the plane and all that, but the movie is worthwhile and more people should go see it. I understand why it got the rating it did based on the number of f-bombs, but I would take any teenager who has heard the word before and tell them this story is something they need to know."

","Due to travelling I'm a bit out of touch with what's going on in the movie world. I decided to pop down to the cinema and had little idea about any of the movies that were playing. I logged onto IMDb and of the movies that were playing Argo had the best reviews.<br/><br/>Argo is the story about a rescue mission to repatriate 6 USA citizens that escaped to the Canadian ambassadors private residence during the Iranian Hostage crisis in 1979. The us embassy was taken over by militants demanding the return of the shah from America. During the takeover the 6 escaped and were in more danger than the other hostages because the media were unaware about them. <br/><br/>The film focuses on the mission to get the 6 out of Iran. It is a very tense film that has you on the edge of your chair frequently. It is very well acted and directed and I can imagine Affleck having a chance of an Oscar nomination for direction. There's also a great supporting cast including John Goodman and Alan Arkin. Something tells me the ending was a little over dramatised for Hollywood, but that's only a small quibble in a very enjoyable film. Go and watch!"
"OneMovieLover","9","2","4","2 November 2012"," Ben Affleck, arguably becoming one of the finest modern action directors
","Director and lead actor Ben Affleck is likely to get even more ""cred"" for this one. That's saying a lot about someone who's already directed 'The Town'. Well, his new film is suspenseful, entertaining, and surprisingly funny.<br/><br/>You may think this film is about the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. The reason is because it starts off with the beginning of the US embassy break-in, etc. However, it really does more of following Ben Affleck's mission to try to get the six hostage-evading Americans out, and the CIA's excuse: them being crew members of a fake film named...you guessed it...""Argo"". I won't reveal any more after that, but that's not really a spoiler.<br/><br/>The acting was top-notch, especially by Ben Affleck. The casting was excellent except for a thing that some are already talking about: why does Affleck (a Caucasian guy) play Tony Mendez (a Hispanic guy)? Personally, I think it's not enough of a gaffe to bring the whole quality of the film down, but it's really something the crew should have considered a little more. The pacing is good; people should rarely, if ever, be bored by the combination of a fake sci-fi film and a CIA rescue mission in Iran anyway.<br/><br/>The suspense is amazing. You'll constantly be watching to see what happens with Mendez and the six Americans. There's also a good amount of humor packed in these two hours, and it's not just a bunch of forgettable one-liners, it's recurring jokes, lots of them delivered by just the right guy: Alan Arkin, who is the producer of the movie-within- the-movie.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Argo' is amazing. So many scenes are well-executed with good acting, pacing, camera angle choice, and obviously it handles the historic story well."

","Some stories are so incredible, they can only be true. Argo is one such story.<br/><br/>In the year 1979, the Iranian revolution erupted in an attempt to overthrow the ruling monarch of the Pahlavi dynasty and replace him with religious leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, for a US and UK backed coup that saw him rise to power, and for human rights violations during his years in power.<br/><br/>During the revolution, the American embassy in Iran was overthrown by revolutionaries, who then held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days in captivity.<br/><br/>But unknown to them, six American diplomats escaped, and found shelter in the Canadian Ambassador's house. They were in hiding for 79 days since rescuing them was considered too risky. This was the status quo, until a CIA exfiltration specialist, Tony Mendez, came up with an incredulous plan: He would create a fake Hollywood science fiction movie, pose as its producer on location scout to the exotic Middle East, fly in solo to Tehran and fly out with the six Americans pretending to be his crew. Mendez's movie, Argo, was fake, but his mission was real. And in the words of Ben Affleck's new film based on this astonishing true story, ""it was the best bad idea"" they had.<br/><br/>Affleck's third feature film as a director, Argo, presents this unbelievable hostage rescue mission on screen as a taut, well-paced suspense thriller with so much palpable tension throughout that along with you and the entire audience, even the seats, the popcorn, the soft drinks and other inanimate objects are on edge. You know the story but the drama of how it unfolds is of aiming-for-an-Oscar-nod quality, with powerful questions about morality, humanity and the wretched politics of it all intermingled with pulp Hollywood elements of 'Oh My God! What's going to happen next?' 'Kill the evil bas***ds, I say! Kill them all!' 'Nooo! Please don't let the good guys be caught!' and 'THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER *Orgasm*'<br/><br/>Yes, the thing that elevates Argo from gritty art cinema that people would watch only after finding out that it's been nominated for an Oscar is that apart from being a classy period film about one of the ""highest- rated"" hostage dramas in history, the movie is spectacularly entertaining too. Affleck pulls out all stops to add enough ""dramatic elements,"" as he referred to them in a press conference, to make the movie that gives you hope, inspiration and the feel-good aftereffect, one that also provides you with the kind of potboiler twists, turns and unexpected laugh-out-loud moments that would make James Cameron proud.<br/><br/>The entire cast is terrific, led by Affleck himself playing Mendez in the movie, but veteran acting legends, John Goodman and Alan Arkin steal the show with their delivery of some of the smartest lines on film this year. ""You want to come into Hollywood and act like a big shot without doing anything?"" rhetorically asks Goodman's character John Chambers, who was awarded CIA's highest civilian honour in real life, to Mendez in the movie. ""You'll fit right in!"" he answers with a punchline. Arkin's character of director Lester Siegel who takes it upon himself to not just make a fake movie, but a ""fake hit"" gives the movie it's most quotable phrase, ""Argo f**k yourself!""<br/><br/>Unarguably, the full credit of one of the movies of the year goes to director Affleck, who has transformed himself from the guy best-known for being Jennifer Lopez' ex-boyfriend (aka the Ben-part of 'Bennifer'), Matt Damon's Sudama-type best friend and managing to pull off what is known as ""one of the worst movies ever made"", Gigli, to possibly, the next Clint Eastwood of direction.<br/><br/>Affleck's embarrassing filmography as an actor has given way to an accomplished, assured and formidable filmography as a writer-director, one that only keeps getting better with every film. Watch Affleck's first two directorial ventures, the intelligent Gone Baby Gone and the gritty The Town to know why Affleck is one of the industry's brightest upcoming directors, who seems to have only gotten started. And of course, do *not* miss Argo this week because it is a stunning achievement in direction, screen writing, acting and filmmaking itself.<br/><br/>Some stories are so incredible, they can only be true.

","I was around 15 years old at the time of US embassy being taken and vaguely remember this being on the news. I certainly remember the images that were shown on TV. I LIKED THIS MOVIE. It was a small snippet of the bigger picture and i refused to let myself get bogged down with trivialities as creative input. the basics of the story are based on fact and thats good enough for me. It is not a documentary or anti-Iranian propaganda and i can't help but feel irritated when people complain that this is not what happened. according to Wikipedia - it is! I'ts just been ""jazzed"" up to fill up a couple of hours. It had an authentic feel about it, and I felt the characters portrayed what fear they must of been going through in such an unsettling and fearful time. Ben Affleck took the time to realize that this was not a film about him but let the supporting cast take the spotlight. Very mature for such an up and coming player in the movie world. I am looking forward to see what else he pulls out of his bag of tricks. I will certainly be adding Argo to my movie collection and rate it highly up there with other great ""true stories"" like Alive, Apollo 13, Munich, Schindlers List etc. I would of liked to see more of the actual hostage situation but that might be for another movie.<br/><br/>Quick footnote: here in New Zealand there was a small outrage with the particular line ""New Zealand said no"". In fact the NZ embassy was unable to help in this situation due to political restraints. However what was not shown in the film was the covert behind the scenes help the NZ and a few other embassies provided. As in food, clothing, transportation and relaying information to the US.<br/><br/>So remember folks ""its just a movie"" made to entertain and evoke emotion. Argo certainly did this for me."
"Andy-296","9","2","4","28 October 2012"," Entertaining and suspenseful
","Very entertaining, suspenseful movie about how in 1979 the CIA exfiltrated six American diplomats who have escaped the takeover of the American embassy by supporters of the Ayatullah Khomeini and taken refuge in the Canadian embassy, without the knowledge of the Iranian authorities (the historical and political background is shown in an attractive animated segment at the beginning of the film - and is the only part in the movie where the Americans set themselves for criticism for their previous support of the deposed Shah). For that endeavor, the CIA sent an exfiltration expert, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck, who is very good and who also directed). After conventional escape plans were explored and looked like they wouldn't work out, Mendez thought up a bizarre plan: go to Iran and leave with the six diplomats pretending that they belong to a Canadian film crew planning to film a B type Sci Fi film named Argo in Iran. To give credibility to the story, Mendez had two film producers (played by John Goodman and Alan Arkin) set up an office in Hollywood as if the planned movie was for real. Surprisingly, the ploy worked (since this story is public knowledge, I don't think saying this is much of a spoiler).<br/><br/>Great recreation of an era and a place (Istanbul and Los Angeles are a believable stand-in for Tehran, along with some digital graphics playing the mountains in the background). Interesting and gripping throughout, even if some details were obviously added for dramatic effect (almost certainly the Iranians didn't chase the leaving plane in the runway). About the only flaw of movie: the constant, irritating, self absorbed in-jokes of the two movie producers."

","I appreciated that I did learn from this movie a lot of background to what is probably better known - here in Canada - as the Canadian Caper. ""Argo"" is a depiction of the escape from Iran of 6 Americans who managed to avoid the hostage taking at the US Embassy in 1979 and made their way to shelter in the Canadian Embassy, later to be spirited out of the country posing as Canadians. Although I knew this event had happened, and I knew that there was substantial involvement by the CIA which went largely unacknowledged at the time, thus somewhat boosting Canada's role, I wasn't aware of the rather amusing backstory that was used by the CIA to pull off the operation - sending in an operative (Ben Affleck) posing as a Canadian movie maker looking for a shooting location, and setting up an entire movie production company to give credence to the story. I appreciated that background. And I give credit to the movie for being extremely suspenseful - especially in the last scenes at the Tehran Airport, as the Americans try to leave the country on a commercial flight while not blowing their cover as Canadians when being questioned by Iranian authorities. That was truly heart-pounding stuff. Unfortunately, it's also where the movie loses points with me: that was totally made up for dramatic purposes. The group actually sailed easily through the Tehran Airport without raising any suspicions, the plane was not chased down the airport runway by police. That was all made up. To me, that was an unfortunate way to end what had been a pretty good and accurate movie.<br/><br/>It's true that while the Canadian involvement in the plot was deliberately overplayed at the time, the movie underplays the Canadian involvement. Basically, ""Argo"" portrays the Canadian Embassy as little more than a motel for the 6 Americans, with Ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber) being a friendly innkeeper. There was more to Canada's involvement than that - the curious decision to have the US Government debating right up to the end whether to pay for the group's plane tickets being rather silly, for example, given that the tickets had already been purchased - by the Canadian government. (And, by the way, since the events happen in early 1980, the correct answer to the question ""who are the last three prime ministers of Canada?"" isn't ""Trudeau, Pearson and Diefenbaker,"" it's ""Clark, Trudeau and Pearson"" - Joe Clark was Prime Minister when this happened.)<br/><br/>So, for heart-pounding drama, this is a very fine movie and it's worth watching for the look at the details involved in setting up the movie cover story. It just loses a little bit for some of the dramatic licence taken. (7/10)"

","As an Iranian, I watched the movie with tremendous doubt about how accurate and unbiased it will depict Iran, and Islamic revolution of 1979. And I have to say, I was bewildered! The locations, events, and dialogs are so accurate. There are few guff here and there, specially with the Persian accent of some of the supporting characters. However, the movie manages to provide a very solid story line, prefect acting, appealing dialogs all based on a magnificent plot. The first scenes set the tone for the rest of the movie, and offers a very quick, yet accurate introduction about the event, and for the rest of the movie it succeeds to keep the audience both interested and entertained."
"g-chakar","9","2","4","26 October 2012"," Very good, informative and very well made movie.
","The movie excellently depicts the atmosphere in the 70-s in Teheran. The documentary component was making the story real. And the character of Tony was cool. While the storyline was focused on the actual event, it would be great to learn a bit more about some life details of the six diplomats. Perhaps the adrenaline would work stronger if some of the dangerous clips were lasting a bit longer. It was all recorded in a flash kind of pace. Not enough was 'told' about the other side to be absorbed as the enemy. After the attack on the American Embassy the Americans were under scrutiny in Iran. Everybody speaking fluent English was eventually a suspect of being an American. A couple of developed Iranian characters, searching for and hunting the Americans in Iran at that time would perhaps add more flavor to the movie. Still, it was a well spent time watching Argo. It is a movie not to be missed out."

","The Town was a movie that most certainly gave evidence of Ben Affleck's skills. Argo takes it a step farther. He has grown into, not only an excellent actor, but a smashing director as well. He is one of the best! Here he has created a film that has Oscar written all over it. Very likely for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor as well. From the first sight of the murderous mob of Iranians to the last frightening and infuriating moment, this picture moves you along with your interest totally intact. It is gripping! Many of us remember how this true story unfolded and ended, but never-the-less your attention will not flag. Not for a second. Alan Arkan has one of the best roles ever in this one, and John Goodman continues to get better all the time, too. As dramatic as this was, Affleck allowed Arkan and Goodman to interject a bit of humor to lighten things up now and then. Sheer perfection! This picture is the best I've seen in a while and I've seen some good ones lately. Affleck scores a winner with this movie!"

Thus, it merits a 10/10 in my book. It's so very well acted and constructed. I was captivated all the way through and Affleck made it suspenseful to the max.

"balyan-rahul","9","2","4","24 October 2012"," Probably the best edge-of-the-seat thriller of 2012
","This is one of the best edge-of-the-seat thriller of the year (Currently has an IMDb rating of 8.4, which will take it to the top 50 films of all times). Ben Affleck pulls off an outstanding performance as the actor and a director. It is a real life story of an attempt to rescue six US embassy staff caught up in Iran around the time Iranian revolution, while another 52 are being held hostage in the American embassy at the same time. The rescue plan hatched by CIA is totally outrageous, and there is almost no chance of it succeeding, but it is pitched as the ""best bad plan"" under the circumstances.<br/><br/>Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) lands in Iran in a hostile environment with most Iranians harbouring deep mistrust and hatred against the USA, and the revolutionary guards hunting down Americans and American sympathisers. And CIA is concerned that to have their operatives caught inside Iran would be a massive embarrassment for the USA. Also a failure of the mission would mean death for all the hostages, and even for the Canadian ambassador and his wife who have have helped harbour the Americans. Just as Mendez is all set to roll out the escape plan, CIA gets cold feet and the whole plan is ordered to be shut down. He alone has to take a decision if he should still take-on the responsibility for the hostages and to help them or not (this part is apparently stretching the actual story a bit, but what the heck, it is all beautifully done).<br/><br/>Every element of this movie has been crafted to perfection – reproduction of actual events, the casting, the makeups (must see the closing credits for the references), capturing the chaos of the revolution on-ground, and the whole feel of the 1970's. Even the film processing gives it a 70s feel. The dialogues are sparkling (""If we wanted applause, we would have joined the circus"" ) and keep you engaged. There aren't many films where the audience break into spontaneous applause as the story unfolds. By the end you are emotionally invested in the outcome and Ben Affleck doest let go of you off the hook till the end.<br/><br/>Go watch My rating – 9/10 (from www.Rahulbalyan.com)"
"Likes_Ninjas90","8","2","4","21 October 2012"," Argo is Ben Affleck's third film as an actor turned director and arguably his most important
","In 1979 protests in Iran break out over the countries leadership, forcing violent attacks on the US embassy. Six Americans in the embassy manage to flee and take refuge in a house of Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber). Yet it becomes increasingly likely that their faces are going to be recognised and they'll be tracked down. The CIA decides that they must come up with a plan to try and rescue these people. Enter Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), a burnt-out agent who is isolated from his family, including his young son. Offset by the CIA's incompetence, Mendez hatches his own rescue plan: to pitch a fake movie, pretend to shoot it in Iran and have the six hostages pose as a film crew to transport them secretly out of the country. He has the support of his fellow agent Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston) but needs proper film aid. This comes in the form of crabby film producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) and makeup artist John Chambers (John Goodman), who supply a script for a science fiction film called ""Argo"" as their cover. Travelling into the hostility of Iran, Mendez must convince the six embassy workers of their new roles and help them memorise their fake identities. <br/><br/>Argo is Ben Affleck's third film as an actor turned director and arguably his most important. The film is based on a true story, however unlikely, but contains uncanny modern day parallels. The recent attack on a US embassy in Libya, for example, is a frightening coincidence. But the movie is also founded in a deep political subtext about the way that global events are fictionalised and increasingly detached from the truth and the reality. That's what sparked the involvement of producers George Clooney and Grant Heslov, who worked together on Good Night and Good Luck (2005). Clooney is an outspoken liberal in Hollywood and has been deeply critical of both the War on Terror and the Bush administration. Prior to invading Iraq, he compared the Bush government to mobsters from The Sopranos. But wisely, Argo doesn't draw direct parallels to Iraq. How could it? Instead, it's conscious of the way that political events, especially through cinema, are distorted and fabricated. The film is surprisingly self-critical in that regard, but well-equipped to pose moral questions that subvert the formula of its subgenre and Hollywood's general aversion to authenticity. The film's characters are forced to ask whether a plan as silly as this is an appropriate solution and whether they should be playing make-believe when people are being publicly strung up and executed. ""This is the best bad idea we have"", O'Donnell announces. Structurally, the film does possess a conventional framework, with Acts 1, 2 and 3 unfolding as you remember them, but the scenes are deliberately infused with ongoing sparring session between fiction and reality. Look at the opening prologue that summarises the political context, leading to the riots. Affleck uses the format of a comic book panel to outline the tension. He then intercuts between real footage and his own reenactment. The effect is seamless and masterfully handled: the political back-story is recounted factually, but with visibly fabricated edges, only for the reality and the dramatisation to become deliberately opaque. Problematising their inseparability, Affleck affirms cinemas collision with non-fiction, revealing his own film to be a highly stylised account of the crisis. <br/><br/>The meta layers of Chris Terrio's excellent script also provide the most enjoyable and funny parts of the movie: the admission that Hollywood is a place of huge egos, and the bigger the lie, the bigger the profit. The humour in the movie scenes is set at the right pitch by experienced, charismatic actors, especially Arkin, who know how to control the deftness of the lines. The wit is dry and self-depreciating but not overly broad that it ever slips into self-parody or silliness. When Goodman's character is asked about a film and who the disappointed target audience will be this time he says: ""People with eyes"". And frankly, in a time where clever dialogue is being steadily replaced by boring exposition, like in video games, isn't it refreshing to hear dialogue so witty that it obtains almost a lyrical quality? Anticipating any jarring tonal shifts, Affleck juxtaposes the mood between two locations: we see the silly movie costumes of a robot and a space monster contrasted against the Iranian household: the framing is tighter, more intensified and the colour filters grainier as to express the increasing tension levels. Hollywood seems a lot more superficial from that angle. If there are any hiccups, they occur late in the second half where the pacing begins to dip slightly, when Arkin and Goodman disappear briefly, but only for the movie to hit top flight again with an unbearably tense climax. The editing in this final sequence, and the relationship between scenes, as characters rely sometimes unknowingly on each other and sheer luck, is handled with an astonishing level of confidence. If the film's structure does seem overly familiar, its rare quality is that the filmmakers understand that their work is a more sophisticated brand of fiction; compared to what really happened and how continually artificial movies are in relation to the real world. How often can you say that a Hollywood film and its director are this humble either?"

","""Ben Affleck continues his directing by making his best and most tense drama for the first time set out of Boston making it more international"" <br/><br/>Back in 2007 when Ben Affleck directed his first film I never would have thought that over five years he would have developed his skills to form a tense and personal drama about international conflicts. The story is set in 1979 when the American Ebassy in Iran was stormed by the locals and before they could be caught six Americans escaped through the back door to then take refuge in the Canadian ambassador's house. 69 days later Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) is called to help come up with some ideas to get these six people home. Tony calls in some Hollywood help in Oscar winner makeup artist John Chambers (John Goodman) and producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) to produce a science fiction movie called Argo using the six Americans as Canadian members of the crew.<br/><br/>The fact this story is true and that the world only found out about it when Bill Clinton released the story in 1997. The writer of the film Chris Terrio was asked to adapt it for the big screen and Ben took the job of directing it. This film is Ben's most technically perfect between the cast and the other smaller parts of the film he has made a film about the greatness that America can do when they put there mind to it. My favourite scenes in the film where based in the house with the six Americans as we see them start to loose it after spending so much time together and not being allowed to leave.<br/><br/>The cast is so strong it is hard to say which one of them is the best. Ben Affleck picked himself to play the character of Tony and his performance suffered for me because he was surrounded by much more interesting characters, he was fine but he really was there to set up the whole operation. Alan Arkin and John Goodman are the comedic relief of this drama as they play the Hollywood people who are trusted with the information to save these people, out of the two I thought Arkin was better but as with Goodman who is also great they disappear for a lot of the time as the story changes from Hollywood to the backdrop of Iran. Bryan Cranston plays Jack O'Donnell the man who brings Tony in on the plan, he is not given much to do until the end when his character becomes essential to finishing the plan. As I have said the cast is big with so many character actors including Tate Donovan, Chris Messina, Scott McNairy and Kyle Chandler all given little time but still being great.<br/><br/>The film was very strong and the editing was sharp. The music by Alexandre Desplat is just as strong as his other million films he does every year and it adds to the tension and time period the film is set in. The fact Ben has turned his career around with his directing achievements has made me have more confidence in him. If they had cast a different lead I'm sure this film would have worked better because it relies on the performance Affleck is supposed to give but he gets over shined by the supporting cast.<br/><br/>MOVIE GRADE: A- (MVP: Alan Arkin)"

The chronological sequence of events leading to the storming of the embassy is nicely explained in the beginning of the movie, the storming itself is well captured. The story focus on 6 US embassy staff who manage to escape the storming and hide in a Canadian Embassy household. A CIA operative works out a plan about a fake movie location scope out along with a Hollywood make-up man and producer, and convinces the US government to go along with it. The movie explains whether his attempt becomes a failure or success with an incredible amount of suspense. The acting itself is top notch starting with Ben Affleck. The incredible thing was the suspense they manage to create till the very end of the film. The film has a good dose of humor especially involving Ben Affleck, the camera man and the producer which helps move the story along. The gravity of the situation in Iran is never allowed to be forgotten with scenes involving executions of Iranians by the revolutionary guards. Thankfully the politics of the situation is never brought up as to who is right or wrong. The direction is handled extremely well by Affleck and I am sure he will get a nod during the awards season. I am looing forward to some more good work from him. 9 out of 10 for this."

","""Argo"" could have descended into the kind of explosions and car chase thriller one would expect from such a topic, namely the successful extraction of 6 US Embassy workers from Tehran at the beginning of the Islamic revolution in 1979. Based on a true account, Ben Affleck (who deserves all acting and directing kudos) maintains a tight leash throughout, using tension and what-if dread as the main adrenaline builders. It is a testament to his ability that even knowing the outcome does nothing to keep you from the edge of your seat. The CIA operative he plays, Tony Mendez who masterminded the plot, is no James Bond. He uses his brains, not his gun to achieve his goal, one that seems insane to his superiors.<br/><br/>The acting is precise and realistic. Comedy relief is provided by John Goodman as Hollywood special-effects guru who has all the good lines. He and Alan Arkin as producer Lester Siegel have a rollicking good R-rated banter together. This being a suspense thriller, there are some fabricated scenes of last-minute miracles (phones picked up at the last second, etc)but they can be forgiven considering the excellence of the whole.<br/><br/>Sharp viewers will be treated to modern Iranian history at the intro and it doesn't put the United States in a good light. When the freely elected Mohammad Mosaddegh nationalized the Iranian oil industry in 1953, he was overthrown by a CIA coup and replaced with the Shah of Iran. The Shah was a dictator as brutal and bloody as Saddam Hussein but as one of the CIA bureaucrats in ""Argo"" suggests, he was a tyrant, but he was OUR tyrant. In short, you can violate human rights all you want as long as you don't mess with our oil supply.<br/><br/>The only things that redeem the CIA in this film are that the Islamic revolutionaries were just as brutal and the bravery of Mendez and his team."

","'ARGO': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Ben Affleck's third outing as feature film director (following 2010's 'THE TOWN' and 2007's 'GONE BABY GONE'). This one is set during the Iran hostage crisis (that began in 1979) in which six U.S. diplomats fled the U.S. embassy in Tehran and hid out (for several months) at the Canadian ambassador's home there. It's loosely based on CIA specialist Tony Mendez's account of how he used a fake Sci-Fi film production called 'Argo' to get them out of the country. Affleck also stars in the film (as Mendez, despite the fact that Affleck is not a Latino) but he didn't write the script (like he co-wrote his two other directorial efforts). Chris Terrio wrote the screenplay and it's based on the 2007 Wired article 'How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick to Rescue Americans from Tehran' by Joshua Bearman. It co-stars Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, John Goodman, Victor Garber, Tate Donovan, Christopher Denham and Clea DuVall. The movie is funny, dramatic and extremely tense at times; like the other two films Affleck has helmed it's a grade A production all around!<br/><br/>The film begins in 1979 Tehran with the U.S. embassy being invaded by Iranian revolutionaries (in protest to the U.S. supporting the Shah they recently deposed). Most of the embassy staff is taken hostage except six who escape and flee to the home of the Canadian ambassador there, Ken Taylor (Garbor). Their escape is unknown to the revolutionaries and their whereabouts are kept secret while the U.S. tries to figure out the best way to get them home to safety. CIA specialist Tony Mendez (Affleck) is brought in to help with the planning of their exfiltration. He devises a plan to use the cover of a fake Sci-Fi film, called 'Argo', and pretend to scout locations for the film in Tehran in order to get the six diplomats out under the guise of his film crew. Despite skepticism from Government officials Mendez pursues his plan with the help of a Hollywood make-up artist (Goodman) and film producer (Arkin). Cranston plays Mendez's supervisor on the operation.<br/><br/>The movie is touching on some issues and politics that are very relevant to the times today (of course) and it's extremely dramatic and emotional because of it. It's also very funny (especially when it gets in to the fake film details of it's story) and, like I said, very tense and suspenseful at times as well (especially in the third act). You can tell events have been altered quite a bit from actual history for dramatic and cinematic effect and the film has been criticized for some of it's changes but Affleck has still mastered a beautiful film. Not taking factual accuracy in to account and just looking at it as a masterful suspense thriller it's a beautiful cinematic achievement and another success for Affleck, who has proved to be a much better director than he is an actor (although he's not a bad actor either and does fine in this film). The problem with Affleck's career a few years back was just the over hyped publicity of it (that and the fact that he did a lot of OK to bad films). He's actually a very talented actor as well as an excellent filmmaker (possibly one of the best working in film today). The rest of the cast is all exceptional in the film as well, especially Cranston and Arkin (who are scene stealers). 'ARGO' isn't quite as impressive a film as 'THE TOWN' but it does deserve all the critical recognition and Oscar hype it's getting and it's a must see for any true film fan.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7YhqgcaX3Q"

Many covert operations are ignored, and Argo gives the viewers a unique opportunity to see the inner workings of such an operation. As a movie, it was brilliant. The acting and visuals were unbelievable, and the straight building of suspense was out of control. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. There was just the right amount of humour, although, I wouldn't have minded a few more moments with our 'Hollywood' members.<br/><br/>The shocking moments and visuals were breathtaking, and amazingly, were copied directly from historical pictures (as shown) which I think was so creative and so striking.

","There's been a lot of big buzz surrounding this movie that it's hard not too be a little disappointed. Let's just say this Ben Affleck is a great director and he always makes solid, interesting films but he has yet to make another film that excels that region into masterpiece territory. Argo although ambitious in it's storytelling and premise is sadly not that film. The film based on a true story focuses on a CIA agent that concocts a plan to free 6 American Hostages from Iran by posing them as members of a film crew. The scenes in Iran are suspenseful and the ones in Hollywood are pretty funny. Performance wise in my opinion Alan Arkin seems to steal the show as a big time Hollywood mogul and Bryan Cranston fleshes out his supporting role nicely. As for the others although it's nice to see Clea Duvall, Rory Cochrane and John Goodman amongst others on screen they aren't really given a lot to do. The Hostages in general are a bit underdeveloped and the film could have even been more suspenseful had a been a bit more engaged by him. As for Ben Affleck doing double duty he's a great director but still not the best actor. Although his skills have improved he would do better to let someone else take the leads in his films with a little more presence. All in all it's a solid film with very interesting subject matter told well if a little bit expected. And another notch in the actor/directors belt after two solid films he adds a third, at this point I'd definitely see anything he directs."

","This film is highly recommended.<br/><br/>Does history ever really change or just re-invent itself? It's November 4, 1979. The American embassy has been under attack by extremist groups. Six Americans are in the midst of the Iranian hostage crisis. They have temporarily escaped their captors and are being hidden in the Canadian embassy nearby. Time is running out before they are found. The American government is trying to remedy this volatile situation as fast as it can. ( Sadly, the ordeal would last 444 days after a failed attempt to save the other 52 hostages. )<br/><br/>Tony Mendez, one of the many C.I.A. officers on duty, devises a hare-brained rescue plan to help them escape: create a bogus movie, go into Iran as one of the film's producers, and leave Iran with the missing hostages in tow, posing as his Canadian film crew. It sounds completely over-the-top, but the plan is set in motion, all under the guise of working on a sci-fi movie called Argo. The truth is usually stranger than fiction, and in the real action thriller called Argo, solidly directed by Ben Affleck ( and based on declassified information ), this event did actually happen ( with a bit of real Hollywood tweaking in both scenarios).<br/><br/>The film begins with a mini-lesson about the history of the weakening U.S.-Iran relations via storyboard form before going to live action footage of the typical but topical angry mob scene that one could readily find on the cover of today's Newsweek or other periodicals. ( The old adage that history repeats itself is quite evident throughout the film and one of Argo's strongest points. ) As the director, Affleck's meticulous research and attention to detail can be found in every frame of this film. The costumes with its late 70's vibe, the vivid art direction, and the casting of actors with similar physical traits as the hostages ( except for a more handsome Affleck himself in leading man mode substituting for the more average looking real counterpart ), all of these elements blend perfectly into that era. ( Make sure you stay for the end credits to compare for yourself. )<br/><br/>At times, Argo seems to be two very good movies in one: it's one part comedy, one part action film. The early portion film concentrates on the film's origins as Mendez tries to establish some background history and fake publicity to authenticate a genuine Hollywood production in the works before the mission begins. Affleck incorporates Hollywood's faux- hipness very well, giving the film a marvelous satirical tone and rhythm. He gets some nice comedic performances by John Goodman as real-life make-up expert, John Chambers , and especially Alan Arkin as a completely fictionalized cagey producer, Lester Siegel . These two actors deliver their funny zingers with impeccable timing which attests to their fine skills as consummate pros. <br/><br/>Later, when the actual mission evolves, the film becomes a tense political thriller, even if you already know the outcome of the rescue mission. Affleck is a bit bland and overly stoic in this section of the film. Granted his role is less showy and the actor downplays his action figure status, but it is still a fine portrayal of a man who takes his job and the lives of his fellow Americans all too seriously. The film builds suspense subtly in its airport scene and the impact never seems forced or remotely stilted.<br/><br/>Special mention must also go to the insightful script by Chris Terrio. The screenplay is concise, the dialog is extremely well written, and its characters never grandstand or become preachy archetypes of the American ideals. All seem totally relatable and human, everyday people caught in an international quagmire.<br/><br/>Argo is one of the best films in this lackluster year. ( It's mid-October already and only 2 films have earned highly recommended status from me so far. ) The film resists the urge to be a more profitable bloody shoot-em-up tale for a younger movie-going audience and instead chooses to be an adult political espionage thriller whose excitement is in its character development and complicated twists and turns. In Argo, Affleck takes his mission to make a compelling and intelligent film very seriously too. Mission accomplished. GRADE: B+<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

","Just saw this today after reading the reviews. It was a great movie from the beginning to the end. I really appreciated how they stuck to the facts and didn't let politics enter the picture, but watching the riots and protests makes you realize things haven't changed much in that country and probably never will. This movie actually has made me want to follow-up on that part of history. I thought Ben gave a subdued performance and was very serious, whereas some felt he was terrible. I appreciated that he didn't overact, which he sometimes does. All in all this is definitely worth the price of a ticket. There were mostly older adults in the theater, and I don't think the younger generation will go, which is too bad because they could learn something from this film compared to the other worthless movies that they are watching."

","Greetings again from the darkness. ""Based on a true story"" is always a bit unsettling to see at the beginning of a movie. There are so many degrees to truth, that we are never really sure how big the dosage might be. With this film, we get the inside track on the all-too-familiar Iranian hostage situation that began on November 4, 1979 and ended 444 days later with the release of 52 U.S. Embassy workers. The story within that story is the focus ... six escaped as the Embassy was being seized.<br/><br/>The film begins with a Cliff's Note history lesson on the fall of the U.S. backed Shah of Iran and the assumption of power by Ayatollah Khomeini. The six who escaped were welcomed into the home of the Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor (played with grace by Victor Garber). Of course, this had to be kept secret or a terrible situation could have taken a turn for the even-worse.<br/><br/>This story really takes off when the CIA gets involved and drums up a scheme to extricate the six in hiding. Ben Affleck stars as Tony Mendez, the real life CIA Agent, who uses the international fascination with movies to create a plan that involves making a fake Star Wars rip-off with the help of award winning make-up artist John Chambers (Planet of the Apes) and a long-time and old school Hollywood producer named Lester Spiegel. These two inject the film with humor and positive energy as played by John Goodman and Alan Arkin. Their levity is much appreciated given the unrelenting tension delivered by the rest of the story.<br/><br/>This is extraordinary filmmaking thanks to the script from Chris Terrio, realistic camera work from Rodrigo Prieto and top-notch directing by Ben Affleck ... yes, the same Ben Affleck who stars in the film. The team creates a period piece that has not just the look and feel of 1979-80, but some of the most gut-wrenching on screen tension since Three Days of the Condor or Munich. Many thrillers utilize car chases and gunfire. Here, we get personal tension thanks to politics and real life unknowns.<br/><br/>The film is perfectly cast and strong support work is provided by Bryan Cranston as the CIA chief, Kyle Chandler as Hamilton Jordan, Bob Gunton as Cyrus Vance, as well as Chris Messina, Zeljko Ivanek, Richard Kind, Clea DuVall and Tate Donovan. There are also brief appearances by Philip Baker Hall, Adrienne Barbeau and the great Michael Parks.<br/><br/>There are only two negatives to the film. First, Ben Affleck is miscast as Tony Mendez. The closing credits show what a perfect job they did in the rest of the cast, but to have a superhero looking American walking around Iran is certain to draw attention where it's not wanted. Plus, as director, Affleck suffers from Warren Beatty syndrome. He LOVES seeing his face on screen. The number of Alleck close-ups has to push 20. It's too much too often. Secondly, the final escape scene at the airport is just a bit too Hollywood and really stands out from the rest of the movie. There was no shortage of tension and the Armageddon style chase just looked cheesy.<br/><br/>Those two things noted, this is Oscar material for sure. If you remember this era, the yellow ribbons and news clips featuring Cronkite, Koppel and Brokaw will bring back a frustrating time in U.S. history. If you are too young to remember, this acts as a reminder of just how powerful and quiet the CIA can be when it is doing its job properly.<br/><br/>Don't miss the final credits as we hear Jimmy Carter narrate his memories as President, and we see real life photos of the six escapees.

"etane","Null","2","4","14 October 2012"," Argo, The film America needs to see!
","In today's cluttered movie industry, movie makers are required to dream up entirely new worlds, with complex endings, and a twist at every turn. But amidst all the clutter, and above all the complexity, a shining light of a movie named Argo breaks through, and director Ben Affleck delivers a flat out good movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps what Argo does for me above all else, is give me hope for the movie industry. The fact that someone can still take a story that everyone knows the ending to, make it exciting, engaging, with a bit of light comedy, and keep us on the edge of our seats till the very end, gives me hope for future films. This proves, we don't always need everyone to die at the end, or for the main character to wake up and it was all a dream, to make a good movie, sometimes, a happy ending isn't so bad. <br/><br/>I'll be honest, the only reason I even considered seeing Argo was because I saw the commercial during the final episode of the first half of season 5 for Breaking Bad. Me, being a huge Bryan Cranston fan, had to see if he could deliver in another role besides Breaking Bad. But what I got in return, was much greater.<br/><br/>But what makes Argo such a great movie? Well, to start, the pacing. Argo is a slow movie, but at no point, did I feel like they were trying to drag on the story, they spent a good amount of time making the movie, and rightfully so, it's not easy making a movie that doesn't exist. Next in line, the acting. While Ben Affleck delivers a solid role as Tony Mendez, it is truly the supporting actors that carry the load. Alan Arkin, provides most of the laughs, with his catch phrase, ""Ar-go f#*k yourself."" he helps ease the tension in the movie. John Goodman, comes off as a honest to god good guy, that just wants to help, which is rare in Hollywood. Last but not least, Bryan Cranston, who has a medium sized role in the movie, does a fine job telling off government officials. While Bryan's acting is fantastic, it's really the roles that hold him back, but one of these days, he is going to find a role in a movie that perfectly suits him, and it is going to be glorious. <br/><br/>Although Argo isn't a perfect film, (lack of subtitles anyone?). It delivers as an above average thriller, with a heart warming ending. It's not the movie America needs, but the one, it deserves."
"ajfolsom","9","2","4","13 October 2012"," Great Movie!!!
","Overall---->This is a great film, hands down ****. From the beginning to the end there is conflict and great tension. The story is awesome thanks to its great pacing and complex intertwining story lines. Easily one of the best films of the year, done by an actor/director who rightfully deserves more credit; i.e. Ben Affleck.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anybody over the age of 18. The characters evolutionary arcs are fantastic and the ability to use metaphors and imagery is very visual. This is a movie you go to see more than once. <br/><br/>Very well done is every regard."
"bucky_dude","8","2","4","12 October 2012"," Affleck's Latest is an Enticing Blend of Fiction, Fact, Tragedy and Farce
","Ben Affleck's Argo is a very good new movie about a very fake old movie, one ""made"" in Iran, during the volatile infant months of the Iranian Republic. Animated storyboard sketches at the beginning of the film offer a colourful crash course on Iran's revolutionary history up to late 1979 -the waning months of the Carter administration-, before Affleck jumps head first into his retelling of one thread in the Iranian Hostage Crisis, which saw 52 American embassy workers held captive for over a year. <br/><br/>The opening sequence is electric, showing hundreds of outraged students surrounding the embassy in Tehran, and the workers inside nervously appraising the situation. The only thing keeping them together is the knowledge that the embassy is American soil, guarded by marines, gates, and high walls. Then, the unthinkable happens: one of the protesters climbs over the wall. Then another. And another, leading to a full-on invasion of the embassy. Much like the barbwire over the walls, the soldiers are only there to be a discouraging presence, not an actual defence; any shots fired would risk starting a war, leaving the Americans scrambling to destroy documents moments before their capture.<br/><br/>An imagined sense of security is the first of many disguises, lies and imitations that constitute Argo's key fascination: falsehoods. When six of the Americans manage to flee to the home of an ambassador, the C.I.A. throws together a plan to exfiltrate the group by claiming they're a Canadian film crew, in Iran to scout locations for a new Star Wars rip-off, titled ""Argo"". The operation depends on creating a ruse so elaborate, and so intricate, that the mission's leader, Tony Mendez (Affleck), will be able to walk the fugitives -using assumed identities- through Tehran's heavily-guarded international airport, and onto a plane back home.<br/><br/>Fake people and fake organizations with real motives all collide, and the most impactful objects aren't guns, they're stamps giving a seal of authenticity. The constant subterfuge creates a tonal dichotomy of tension and farce, with all the characters spinning their own brand of bullshit in order to save lives. Argo welcomely embraces the bullshit though, particularly in its second act, when Mendez brings in a Hollywood makeup artist (John Goodman) and an influential producer (Alan Arkin) to make his phoney movie look like the real deal. While the situation in Iran only intensifies the longer the Americans stay in hiding, the L.A. crew preps the rescue as if it were a human-heist movie. Titles like Mendez's Six, or The Tehran Job come to mind. <br/><br/>Argo's mix of levity and suspense makes for a propulsive brio, but one that can create jarring contrast, such as a sequence that intercuts a convention-worthy table read of the fake movie's script, with hostages being lined up against a firing wall. While the Wag the Dog-style interplay between the entertainment business and covert government agencies is often very funny, it's sandwiched neatly between the dire opening, and the intense final third, which is mostly humourless, as it focuses on Mendez working with the hostages on their cover story. <br/><br/>Mendez is as much an anchor as can be expected from a story that's more about events and environments than people, but Affleck makes him a compelling master of deception. The biggest lie he has to tell the rattled hostages is that he knows they'll make it out alright. Of course, history has already spoiled the end of the operation for us, so Argo tries to compensate by layering onto the facts with some additional fiction, which can undercut your appreciation for seeing real events recreated when the script feels the need to embellish them. <br/><br/>But this is a crowed-pleaser, through and through, an Apollo 13 for the politically minded, and Affleck only ever feints at trying to deliver something more than a supremely well-executed thriller. In a recent interview, Paul Thomas Anderson claimed that having great actors was the key to his success, and if that's the bedrock for one of this generation's most celebrated directors, then it's no surprise that Affleck has managed such a strong career behind the camera, thanks to the kind of talent he can bring along with him. The actors are all excellent (Bryan Cranston in particular, as Tony's spitfire of a boss), the script is clean when doling out exposition, yet punchy when it needs to be, and Affleck directs everything with a sure hand.<br/><br/>And it's that slavish devotion to making a the highest possible quality out of a familiar formula that makes Argo exceptionally good, but never great. When its blend of cloak 'n' dagger and showbiz bravado is really crackling, the film is effortlessly enjoyable, but one might hope a story of such great risks would merit a few of its own in the adaptation. I don't want to sound like i'm slagging on Affleck, but if he were to try pretending that he really is America's next great director -not simply its most reliable-, than he might turn out to be just that. Sometimes, you gotta fake it before you can make it."
"mjz4043","10","2","4","13 October 2012"," Fabulous movie
","We lived in Iran during the 70's for four years and this movie took me right back. I rarely get that emotionally involved in a movie,but this one was different. The scene where they are in the VW driving slowly through a crowd and the crowd is beating on the car really scared me since I was caught out in a mob where they were bouncing my small car around and I think it would have been much worse, but I saw as one man looked into my car, saw the children and then told everyone there were children in the car and let me go. Please know that this behavior is not indicative of the average Iranian...they are really wonderful people and treated us beautifully while we lived there. Ben Affleck did a great job as an actor and a director. Too bad it couldn't have been filmed in Iran so you could see what it really looks like. This is one of those movies I want in my own DVD collection. Don't miss it."
"rgkarim","8","2","4","13 October 2012"," Argo See it!
","Another weekend arrives and so too comes another round of movies. To start things off I went with my friend to see Ben Affleck's newest film entitled Argo. Not only does Mr. Affleck star in this movie, but he was also the producer and director of the film as well, which has me worried he's following in Stallone's footsteps. Regardless, for those who haven't seen the trailers playing the last four months, Argo focuses on the Iranian crisis, in which 60 American hostages were held hostage by the Iranian public. Six of the hostages, played by numerous people, escape to the Canadian ambassador's house, where they hide from the radical soldiers. To help get these six out, the government sends in Tony Mendez (Affleck) a CIA specialist who has a crazy idea to get them out, produce a fake movie with the fugitives being the crew of the movie. <br/><br/>So what can I say about this movie that is based on a true story. The answer is a lot of things, starting with the visuals of the movie. Argo's setting is well put together, taking a combination of three worlds and blending them into an amazing blast into the past. The hectic streets of Iran, the busy high and mighty world of Hollywood, and the stern, secretive halls of the CIA building are captured in very minute details. What does this mean to the audience? Well for me it helped pull me into the movie, helping me feel that I was a part of 1970/1980 world. Complementing the detailed settings is the integration of news clips from this time, blending them smoothly into the modern day filming. Instead of overdoing the news clips though, Affleck sparingly used these clips at just the right moments, my favorites being the Jimmy Carter addresses to the public. However, the setting and edition can only do so much, but none of it is possible without good camera work, and Argo does indeed have that. The visual crew managed to choose just the right angle to capture the emotions of the scene helping to bring out the chaos, intensity, and torment that filled the crisis. As a finishing touch, the grainy filter helped add a little edge to the film, making the movie seem like a live documentary. <br/><br/>Although the camera-work was impressive, the acting was also another component that helped bring the movie alive. Affleck did a nice job playing the CIA agent role, using his lady pleasing scowl to mirror his intense nature. Bryan Cranston who played Mendez's boss was also well done, as Cranston's strong face and rough voice gave the character an edge that promoted challenge and driving force. As for the hostages, well they definitely looked the part with their 70's hairstyles and aviator glasses, but aside from some occasional spurts of dialog their facial expressions did most of the talking. My favorite actors had to be Alan Arkin and John Goodman, the two movie men who were the backbone of the Argo project. Both of these seasoned actors were hilarious, essentially a real life Statler and Waldorf who were happy to insult almost every aspect of the Hollywood world. My buddy and I couldn't help, but laugh as the two ridiculed the politics and laziness of the movie magic world, constantly working the system of corrupt agents and lawyers who were looking for a quick buck. The dynamic duo delivered there incredible dialog perfectly, adding another level to help the words strike home. These two may have made up a large percentage of why I enjoyed this movie. <br/><br/>Argo has a lot of other qualities that make this a movie worth watching. For the older generation who lived through this event, the adapted story will most likely be nostalgic, especially the riots and new clips of incidents. Drama lovers will get their fill as well, as just about every group in this movie has some type of issue or struggle they have to overcome. As for suspense, well that really doesn't come till about the final thirty minutes of the movie, but once it arrives you may find yourself at the edge of your seat, (unless you remember the reality of the situation). People who enjoy making fun of countless systems will also be entertained by this film. As stated earlier, Goodman and Arkin's characters basically throw Hollywood under the bus, from getting contracts to designing a fake story. Those who love seeing government agencies getting shot down and made fun of, are also going to enjoy this film as well. While it's not like a typical comedy where the actors say lines that are targeted at the government, Argo instead uses the setting to make fun of it. When Affleck demands action, the big wigs instead say they have a meeting scheduled or say that's not allowed. The writers also threw a couple of quick dialog jabs in there to help bring some diversity to the humor, which also brought on some laughs. Of course those that are easily offended by such humor, or greatly support our political system's endeavors are going to be less amused. I'll also take this time to say that those who don't like seeing humans painted as monsters/animals are going to be angry at this movie as well. The combination of camera work and acting show the darker side of humans, and I'm sure there will be news stories of people offended by the portrayal of both Americans and Iranians. The only big error I can mention on this movie is that some editing could have been done about halfway through to make the movie a little shorter. Needless to say I enjoyed Argo a lot, and encourage you to see this movie in theaters, or at least catch in on Netflix. My scores for this film are below Drama/Thriller: 8.5 Movie Overall: 8.0"
"tbmforclasstsar","8","2","4","12 October 2012"," a heart-pounding drama that engages emotionally and reminds us how great cinema can be
","When film is done right, it can be an all encompassing experience; appealing to the eyes, engaging to the ears, and getting your heart to race uncontrollably. We forget where we are, what time it is, who is sitting next to us. All we can focus on is the images that flash across the screen and the sounds that enter our ears.<br/><br/>Even more engaging is a story about true events. A story that is historical and based on facts that has us aware that what we are seeing is something that has actually happened. Even if dramatized to some or great degree, we are drawn to films about real people and real events.<br/><br/>And if you agree with what I am saying here, I'm sure you will also find that Argo is the complete movie-going experience.<br/><br/>Directed and starring Ben Affleck, Argo is the true story of a secret CIA mission to rescue six U.S. embassy members in hiding after an uprising in Iran in 1979. Starting off with the events of the uprising all the way through the heart-pounding moments of the rescue mission, Argo is a thrill ride of emotions that will have your eyes glued to the screen and your body begging you to take a breath.<br/><br/>Bringing together an incredible cast including Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, John Goodman, and many other talented performers, Argo contains some very powerful performances that act as the life blood of the film. This is not a simple bang through the door, grab the hostages, and escape film. It is a tactical and precise mission that involves real people that we come to care about. Real people that we feel for, care for, and pray for as the events of the film transpire. And without the brilliant acting by these performers, we would not nearly invest as deeply as we do.<br/><br/>With that powerful acting comes the direction and writing in Argo. Affleck is not only brilliant as Tony Mendez, he is a brilliant director that has shown his skills in the past (The Town) and truly comes into his own with Argo. If you would have told me Ben Affleck was directing films five years ago, I would have laughed at you. But it is absolutely no joke. His careful precision, building of tension, and experienced setups, placements, and execution is that of a veteran in the film world who absolutely knows what he is doing. You can easily start to rank Affleck as one of the directors we can most look forward to seeing in the future. Especially if he keeps getting material as good as Argo.<br/><br/>To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/argo/"

","Argo is not itself a science-fiction film. Really, it's not even about the making of a science- fiction film. Yet that's the cover story that Ben Affleck's character, CIA exfiltration specialist Antonio Mendez, comes up with as a ruse to smuggle 6 American embassy workers out of Iran during the 1978-79 hostage crisis. The 6 had been holed up incognito in the residence of the Canadian ambassador, but the Revolutionary Guard was closing in on them, and the CIA was just about out of options. Indeed, at one point they claim they are out of options and are going to let the hostages take their chances, but Mendez bulls on thru anyway.<br/><br/>It's axiomatic in undercover work that you may hear about the failures, but nobody ever talks about the successes. Indeed, it wasn't until a couple of decades later, in 1997, that President Clinton authorized the declassification of the Argo story (or ""The Hollywood Option"", as it's code-named in the movie).<br/><br/>Yes, the oft-abused phrase ""based on a true story"" seems to be much closer to accurate here. Period detail is spot-on, nowhere more evident than in the side-by-side shots under the closing credits of the actors alongside contemporary photos of the real-life State Department workers they portray. There is palpable tension among the sequestered comrades during the long confinement, even tho the Canadian ambassador is the model host. Mendez is dead calm and competent thruout the entire adventure, the essence of a professional who's very, very good at his job. Ample opportunities for histrionics are avoided.<br/><br/>A certain amount of comic relief arises naturally out of the insider banter of John Goodman and Alan Arkin, who play long-time Hollywood pros (respectively a make-up artist and a director) brought on board to form a production company for Argo and gain it some legitimacy in the trade press. They have scathingly hilarious takes on Hollywood's artificiality, film-flam, and corruption, and you just know Affleck (who also directed) had real people in mind in a lot of those scenes.<br/><br/>But most of the movie is dead serious. Like Apollo 13, there's no spoiler involved in saying they all get out alive. It's a measure of the quality of both movies that you're still thinking, right up to the very end, that they probably aren't going to be able to pull it off."

","During his career in the cinematographic field, Ben Affleck has characterized himself as an actor, even though in recent years he has made the leap to directing with three feature films, the last of them 'Argo'.
This film recounts the hostage crisis in Iran and the operation necessary to save them and bring them back to their nation. Through this story Affleck does not waste time adding depth to the facts or the characters, on the contrary, he dedicates himself to making this story functional and as direct as possible, directing it with a very classic look. But despite everything, this classicism that Affleck tries to print on his tape does not prevent the third act from generating a sequence of tension that ends up escaping a bit from his hands at a certain point, even though the sequence as a whole is quite well accomplished for the great assembly work behind it.
Ben Affleck, directing, producing, and starring in this film could have largely failed, but on the contrary, it ended up being a successful product. Proving in this way that Affleck has sufficient dexterity both in front of and behind the camera."

They do rehearsals, promote the film with fake posters, and mingle with the citizen's. They have to gain some trust with the local's to ease their nerves. As this goes on for awhile , they have to watch every move they make. It is a hostile area gun fire is active, people are getting executed in broad daylight, and check points are everywhere.<br/><br/>When it is time to escape it looks like they are going to have issues. The plan tickets of some of the hostages arrive late. They undergo constant screening, and they make Lee Schatz take his sunglasses off twice. It especially gets tense when they get ready to board. One guard/ Iranian police holds them at the gate forever. A security call is made to check on Tony Mendez. In the states the call comes in, but it rings forever. At the right time Chambers answers the phone, a check is made about the location of Mendez. Chambers tells them his on location, big break.It checks out and they are finally free to board. These Americans were held for 87 days in Tehran, Iran. Thanks to the help of the Canadian government these hostages got home, and the rest is history.<br/><br/>I have to admit the first time I watched this movie, I hated it. I recently re watched again and liked it. I do like Rory Cochrane and thought he was excellent as Lee Schatz to a T. I have never been a fan of Ben Afflack, but he was decent in this one. I do want to see his new movie THE WAY BACK, because it's about basketball. I want to see it because I played for yrs.<br/><br/>As for the film, I believe it was overrated, but what Oscar winning film isn't these days?"

","Hindsight always allows liberties to be taken with facts when making a film like this, so it is probably best not to try and scrutinise too closely the actual (train of) events in this really gripping tale of half a dozen US citizens caught up in the capture of their Embassy in revolution-fuelled Tehran in 1979. Offered refuge by the Canadian Ambassador they remain for months until the CIA (hmmm?!) hatch a cunning plan to get them the hell out of there before the new rulers manage to discover they are missing from their mission. The wheeze is to turn them into a crew of Canadian film-makers and with the aide of Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) who arrives in Iran to ostensibly advise the team, they plan their project - a film called ""Argo"" - to facilitate their freedom. The usually reliable Bryan Cranston (Jack O'Donnell) is on really good form, as is Tate Donovan and a cracking Alan Arkin (producer Lester Siegel) and the pace develops in a tense, edge-of-your-seat style right until the end. The dialogue is plausible reflecting, well, the mounting tension they feel after living day-to-day in fear not just of their own lives, but of those sheltering them.

","Title: Argo (2012)<br/><br/>With the recent tension between America and Iran, there has been renewed interest in this movie -- for a good reason. In a nutshell this is a real movie based off a fake movie that was used in a real life military operation to rescue American Hostages in 1979.<br/><br/>The first 15 minutes of this film is electrifying and the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat for the whole ride. With few options in an exceptionally trying situation, CIA agent Tony Mendez proposed a dangerous plan; create a fake Canadian film project and hope the confusion ultimately masks the identity of the 6 American hostages in an effort to bring them back to their homeland. The acting and flow of the movie is extraordinary as it shows how truly terrifying and bizzare of a situation it really was.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have about the entire movie is the airport scene. I have a hard time believing that Military/airport security officers would fall for such a measly plan; to distract them with fake storyboards from a fake movie. As much as I love movies, I'm not sure military officers in a hostile situation would feel the same way."

","If there is one film that gets your heart pounding, it is this one.<br/><br/>Since he started being in the motion picture industry, Ben Affleck has been known to be a good writer(Good Will Hunting) but a pretty bland actor(Daredevil, Gigli, Pearl Harbor, Reindeer Games). That's also saying he's in very good films(Chasing Amy, The Accountant). But what he's best at is directing, and Argo is his crowning achievement<br/><br/>Set during the late 70's, the story follows Tony Mendez, played by Affleck, a CIA agent who disguises himself as a producer to rescue six American Embassy workers in Iran and bring them back home, before the Iranian government finds them and takes them hostage.<br/><br/>Where do I even begin with this movie, just from the opening sequence, it puts you in the right frame of mood. It shows the audience what they're in for and what the world has become. Affleck does a great job making us feel for the characters and it shows how to use suspense in a film.<br/><br/>During the whole movie, you want them to escape so badly and it gets your heart pounding. It makes the audience feel claustrophobic with it's setting, especially during the van scene.<br/><br/>The reasons why this film works is that they're focusing on a story that got little attention during one of the most important moments of American history during the 70's. It makes the audience more engaged in the film<br/><br/>Even with people saying that the whole idea was orchestrated by the Canadian Embassy, that fact is very true and it's what actually happened, but if they kept that in the movie, it would have made Tony Mendez less heroic. But it still is a bad move to ignore the people that orchestrated the whole plan.<br/><br/>To me, this is one of the greatest films ever made and it really shows off Affleck's directing talents. I know calling it one of the greatest films ever made is quite a stretch, but I don't care, it's still an awesome film"

Basically they managed to escape marauding mobs of Iranians who invaded the U.S. embassy.<br/><br/>Their fate could quite easily mean death and public execution. Such is the environment at the time.<br/><br/>I didn't like how the British embassy involvement was airbrushed from the film.
Anyway a military rescue by special forces is at first ruled out leaving CIA agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) to explore other options for evacuation.<br/><br/>A series of bad ideas is mooted including setting up a fake Canadian science fiction film production using Iran as a location to cover the moon. (Why!)<br/><br/>Mendez actually travels to Iran to rendevous with the six escapees in the Canadian ambassadors house with cooperation from the Canadians and a set of fake Canadian passports to hand to set up the production, Argo as in the title.<br/><br/>Argo is some fake, rejected Flash Gordon like project.<br/><br/>The six eventually come round to the highly dangerous idea and evacuate the country on a commercial flight in a game of cat and mouse at the airport.<br/><br/>The film is true and entertaining and I had never heard of the operation, only being revealed under the President Clinton administration years later it is displayed on screen.<br/><br/>An average film, but nothing special.

","14 October 2012. The striking association between dramatization and reality comes at the beginning of the ending credits when side by side photographs of the real people and their actor counter-parts are shown along with a special message from one of the most important people of the time. What's fascinating about this ensemble effort is its lack of a standout character performance and instead the movie folds in the events and characters into one of the strongest dramatic scripts in recent memory. The editing, timing and recreation of the heightened dramatic elements (likely to have been exaggerated for theatrical audience impact) are tight and emotional riveting even as the real outcome is factually known.<br/><br/>What sets this movie apart from most is its careful and deliberate coverage of the aftermath of the events that helps to provide in totality a beginning and a ending of this Iran hostage saga. Another element of this movie is the individual heroics, the raw and graphic language which seem to be unforced and in under Affleck's direction pertinent and incisively appropriate. Comparisons to this movie are hard to come by, The Good Shepard (2006) with Matt Damon that is more drama than action, W (2008) about Oliver Stone's President Bush's dramatization or The King of Scotland (2006) a singular focus on Uganda's Ida Amin, The Queen (2006) again a contemporary focus on central characters surround the Queen of Britain, Fail Safe (1964) about a fictionalized drama about a B-52 bomber and a nuclear weapon's accident, Black Hawk Down (2001) and The Great Escape (1963) that focus on the physical events of war, The King's Speech (2010) which is primarily personality and relationship focused, United 93 (2006) a much more narrow and compressed time-limited event, Breach (2007) more of an intimate personal character performance involving espionage.<br/><br/>Perhaps the movies that come closest in style and portrayal might be event movies of Traffic (2001) or Bobby (2006) but their multiple story lines, Jar Head (2005) with its more expansive, visceral view of pre-Desert Storm, Munich (2005) about the murder of Olympic athletes and even so comes across more like an raw action dramatic thriller, Body of Lies (2008) a fictionalized hunt of a Middle Eastern terrorist, or perhaps the closest resemblance with All The President's Men (1976). But even so it is the very nature of the real unusual unfolding plot benchmarks that makes this movie so difficult to compare, the personal emotive human connections and conflicts and their observed stories make this production a unique creation in and of itself. A well dramatized script and direction and real life event are what made this movie resonate with its gripping power that allows the cliques and stereotypical resemblances to vanish into the background, leaving only the storytelling elements for the audience to enjoy in rapture."

I honestly do not remember any details of the events of this sad episode in Middle East history so I cannot really judge this. As far as I know the general plot is consistent with reality and in this movie it is good enough for me. I fear that, if they would have made it 100% historically accurate, the movie would have turned into a rather boring documentary instead of a fairly enjoyable drama movie.<br/><br/>Surprisingly enough the movie was quite funny at times. The dialogue between the movie-people when they were setting up the fake movie was sometimes quite hilarious. Some parts of the movie was rather tragic of course, like the Iranian mob taking over the embassy and the crazed idiots at the bazar.<br/><br/>Other parts where a bit silly. Why did the Iranian security have to break down their own doors at the airport instead of just calling the tower and stop the plane for instance? And the cars chasing the plane was just rubbish. The plane would have gone much faster than the cars could go long before they caught up with the plane. Also the fact that the cars basically had to panic-break in order not to hit the barrier at the end of the runway meant the plane almost ran into the barrier which, given that it made a normal take-off, is just nonsense.<br/><br/>In general it is a good movie although it is not really my type of movie and the movie's context, the take-over by the Iranian extremists, is a rather sad one."

","There are mixed feelings about this engaging flick. To start, this is a competent, well executed ( and I am not talking about historical accuracy)thriller, with an able cast of mostly good character actors. It does convey the explosive atmosphere of the early Islamic Revolution, perhaps little one-sided , but still... The real trouble starts with the Oscars, and the Hollywood money machine. Is this the best picture made last year? I sincerely hope not. If it is, lets just close the doors to lofty proclamations, and just be entertained. I did enjoy watching this movie, and found myself thinking that it is better than I expected. But, does this little confession of mine make it a masterpiece? Oh, no, not in thousand years. Money, as usual rules. Promotions, agencies, right connections, aggressive advertising, that's what is all about. A healthy dash of simpleton patriotism, twisting of the facts in favor of CIA, and nobody gets offended and too distressed. Almost nobody. There are few people left who do get offended with the predictable lack of bold creativity. But then who cares about few curmudgeons and killjoys."

Six embassy staffers make a hurried decision to make a break for it and manage to take asylum at the official residence of the Canadian Ambassador. The CIA with cooperation of the Canadian government put ex-filtration expert Tony Mendez(Affleck)to the task of devising a plan to rescue the six Americans. It is decided to smuggle the six staffers out Tehran by passing them off as part of a production crew making a sci-fi movie titled Argo. Mendez will have to get the Americans past the Iranian security posing as the movie's associate producer.

","Apparently it is historically inaccurate - typical Hollywood then. But it tries to pin blame on US interventions and subventions into other countries' affairs - George Clooney's agenda, which does not get a lot of airing in Hollywood! So give him some credit as Producer for getting it made. He has tried before, but not so commercially successful, thus he has upped the US ra-ra to get people to see it. Unfortunately this has dismissed the Canadians to mere bit players - and they were the ones in Teheran at risk!!!!!! As to the film itself, it works as a satire on Hollywood following trends for success rather than looking for new ideas - late 70s 'Star Wars' rip offs, 2013 Comic Book superheroes! And these sections are very funny. The scenes in Teheran are tense and do work - we do not need everyone doing Princess Di emotional hysterics to show they are feeling!!!!!! The actors trying to look under pressure but keeping the lid on things which seems pretty realistic to me. The direction is pacy, quick cuts etc which works most of the time, but is overdone at the end. The script and the fact that there is a lot of talking is what makes the film work - it is a 1970s style movie and why it succeeds with an older audience. Sit back and immerse yourself, but it will always suffer from historical inaccuracy and bias - we Brits have suffered this for decades from Hollywood! After all who usually plays the villain in US movies?!"

","A useful writer's lesson in how suspense is created. If you separate the true story from the invented fictional overlays you'll find in one hand a finely crafted collection of reversals, all is lost moments, narrow escapes and races against time that never actually happened (when you see Jimmy Carter in the DVD extras talking about how the unbelievable story is all true, he's not talking about the movie).<br/><br/>By the way, the movie within the movie wasn't some preposterously stupid Star Wars rip off like they made out here either. The Argo cover story was based on a failed adaptation of a Hugo award winning novel (Lord of Light) by one of the foremost science fantasy writers of the 60s and 70s (Roger Zelazny) and also had names like Jack Kirby, Ray Bradbury and even Buckminster Fuller attached.

","I used to work in a video store. My least favorite part of the job was when customers would ask for recommendations. ""I don't know you,"" I would think, ""How could I possibly tell you what you might like?"" Sometimes, though, a movie would come out and it would be very easy to recommend. Argo is one such movie. I could tell anyone who was able to watch an R rated movie to rent this one and be sure that they would like it. It's extremely entertaining. Funny and exciting, it does what all great suspense films should do. It makes us believe in and care for these characters, puts them in dire circumstances and carefully puts them on the brink of capture or death then pulls them out again. Affleck is brilliant at this, and thusly the film leaves a fine taste in your mouth. However, the jingoistic approach to the American involvement (and the utter and complete void of mentioning the Canadian government's involvement) makes the film hard to swallow. Every single account of the historical mission gives credit to Tony Mendes but shows that the real hero of the tale is Ken Taylor, the Canadian Ambassador. The fact that they gloss over Taylor's involvement is upsetting, until the closing credits when they show you the real people's pictures next to pictures of the cast. Then it's infuriating. What they're saying is, ""Look at the care we took in making the actors look just like they're real life characters, without worrying about portraying the events correctly."" The fact that this film won the Oscars that it did is insulting. Tony Kushner's ""Lincoln"" screenplay and ""Django"" run circles around it."

The editing of these opening scenes was well done, shifting back and forth from the angry mob outside the gates to the terrified U.S. embassy employees inside.<br/><br/>The tension lessens from those frantic opening scenes but never goes away. The twists and turns of the plans to rescue these Americans kept me on high alert for the duration.<br/><br/>This is not a political film. I appreciate the fact that Mr. Affleck does not editorialize one way or another about the seizure of the hostages. Indeed, the film provides the viewer with sufficient historical backdrop detailing the circumstances which precipitated the coup of Mohammad Rezā Shāh Pahlavī in February, 1979 as well as news footage of American reactions to the seizure of the hostages. Yet, the filmmakers leave it up to the viewer to formulate opinions or judgments.<br/><br/>The only goal here is to tell a good story and the film does just that. The script is excellent, the casting is spot on, and the editing is most effective. Some who know the true details of the ""Canadian Caper"" may quibble with how events are presented here but in my opinion, this is mere artistic license to make a better film.<br/><br/>By far, Argo is the most entertaining film of the year."

","The Pentagon and C.I.A have been inextricably linked to Hollywood since the 1920's, offering their ""advice"" and influence on many productions. According to a spokesperson for the intelligence agency, Todd Ebitz, the C.I.A. even post story ideas on their website. Usually their collusion with the film industry is a propaganda tool to promote ideologies, or to glamorise, and mystify clandestine organisations. In Ben Affleck's Argo, a declassified (in 1997) narrative develops in a secret collaboration between wily Hollywood producers, and the Central Intelligence Agency, in an effort to rescue six diplomats from Iran, during the 1979 to 1981 hostage crisis. Whilst the story used in the film is a footnote to the eventual complexity and over-long nature of the whole event (which lasted for 444 days, with 54 American hostages in total), it could be argued that this ""little moment"", is more enticing as a narrative about organisations (whether political, ideological or mass media), and the power of western (specifically Hollywood) popular culture around the world.<br/><br/>In 1979 the pro-American Shah of Iran (Mahammed Reza Pahlevi) was forced to flee into exile after a series of increasingly violent protest against his regime, by Islamic fundamentalists. The US embassy in Tehran was targeted by the revolutionaries after Jimmy Carter saluted the exiled Shah in a toast, stating that Pahlevi was a friend of the nation. Argo opens as the embassy is stormed, paper documents are frantically shredded, computer files hammered into fragments. Six diplomats exit and find refuge in the Canadian Ambassador's home. C.I.A. agent, Tony Mendez (Affleck), determined to extricate the escapees, is enlightened with an idea to create a fake Hollywood science fiction film, create false identities for the six, and act as a film production, scouting for locations in Iran. Mendez's connection to Hollywood, is special effects veteran, John Chambers (John Goodman), who is most famous for designing the simian prosthetics for Planet of the Apes (1968). Along with ageing, and out of work, director, Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), - who might or might not be Don Siegel, I'm not sure - they create a script and concept artwork for a ""cheap science fiction Star Wars rip-off"", with the title Argo (a reference to the ship in Greek mythology, sailed by Jason and his Argonauts).<br/><br/>I'm not a particular follower or fan of Affleck the actor, finding his abilities to be somewhat one-dimensional, but it is always an intriguing prospect when an actor makes the move to directing. This is my first experience of this with Affleck, having never seen Gone Baby Gone (2007) or The Town (2010), but I have heard encouraging things about his previous films, so I was looking forward to watching how he worked with other actors. Whilst not a great actor himself, he understands the acting process, and casts brilliantly, particularly the very undervalued Bryan Cranston. Chris Terrio's dialogue is sharp, effective and referential (with many nods to contemporary sci-fi, to salivate the generation that Affleck is a part of). Science fiction aside, Argo is a project that understandably fell into the hands of an actor/director (even George Clooney co-produces with Affleck), much of the mid-section of the film is about the acting process, the six escapees having to become the fictionalised characters that might get them back to America. When it's a life and death proposition, this process seems excruciatingly hard. To fully portray these people, they have to become every aspect of that person.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, systems of hierarchy and levels of bureaucracy are eluded to, from the offices of the C.I.A., through the dealings with Hollywood, to the levels of security and multitude of check points found when attempting to leave a fragile, destabilised country. The latter of these systems is used to great effect towards the end of the film, where the Mendez-led ""film crew"" pass through increasingly excruciating encounters with Iranian security at an airport. Argo juxtaposes the machinations of the openly narcissistic Hollywood industry, with the more secretively narcissistic C.I.A., whilst they are inextricably linked to the heightened processes of government, these intelligence agents almost appear comical at times, unstable, with a tendency towards incompetence. The audacity of Mendez to assume he could pull off a legitimate looking fake film, shows this innate narcissism, and Chambers even relates the concept when asking him, ""So you want to come to Hollywood and act like a big shot, without actually doing anything?"" When told yes, he says ""You'll fit right in.""<br/><br/>Of course Afflect's character is morally stable, but an ineffectual sub- plot involving an estranged wife and son, is like an unnecessary, staid, use of cheap emotional manipulation. Towards the end it becomes uncomfortably saccharine, the image, music and text utilising generic, over indulgent climactic rubbish, using the common signifiers of the worst kind of Hollywood drivel. However, this is a very small indiscretion in a smart and enjoyable political thriller. Frightening Argo also highlights the fact that the west's relationship with the middle-east has changed very little, with heightened hatred of the west from Islamic fundamentalists, and the nature of terrorism having not altered significantly with the current hostage crisis in Mali. <br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com - In the winter of 1979 Iranian revolutionaries storm and capture the US embassy in Tehran. 52 American diplomats are taken hostage within the embassy. Six Americans manage to evade capture and make it to the Canadian embassy, where they lay low. After 10 weeks the CIA is ordered to help with the exfiltration of these fugitives.<br/><br/>This is the set-up for Argo, the new thriller directed by – and starring – Ben Affleck. Based on the actual events of the Iran Hostage Crisis, Argo grabs hold of you immediately, and has you sitting at the edge of your seat for the entire length of the film.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a very succinct and clear recap of the events leading up to the Iranian revolution, for those not up to speed with the goings on of Iran in the '70s. Argo then immediately drops you into the action, with the gripping first ten minutes dedicated to establishing the severity and urgency of the situation by showing the brutal takeover of the US embassy in Tehran, and subsequent hostage situation. This sense of urgency remains palpable throughout the film until it finally discharges in the nail-biting final 30 minutes.<br/><br/>I must admit I was never a fan of Ben Affleck's acting. But his acting in this feature film is stellar. Aside from Ben Affleck you can also enjoy the wonderful work of John Goodman, Kyle Chandler, Alan Arkin, and the always amazing Victor Garber and Bryan Cranston.<br/><br/>Another aspect I really enjoyed was the fact that it is a period movie; Most of it takes place in early 1980 and Affleck makes sure you never forget that. From the clothes to the hair to the magnificent moustaches, everything screams '80s. Real news broadcast footage covering the crisis at the time is repeatedly shown on television sets throughout the film. Moreover the movie itself seems to be shot on film, rather than digitally. The added grain is a subtle way to keep you in the right era. Even the title-card for the Warner Bros. company is the '70s-era logo. All of this combines to add to the overall style and feel.<br/><br/>All in all I really enjoyed this movie. It's fast-paced, intelligent, and downright thrilling. I highly recommend you watch it. However, it is quite a wordy movie. Aside from the action sequences in the beginning and end of the movie, the majority of the film is setting up the thrilling pay-off at the finale. Although I can definitely appreciate this, not everyone is so inclined. This also makes it less of an addition to see the movie in the cinema, as opposed to your own living room. Therefore I suggest you put Argo on your list of movies to watch when the Blu-Ray is released (March 2013). - review originally posted on InspirationRation.com"

","Rediscovering himself in the guise of a brilliant director, Ben Affleck (""The Town"", ""Gone Baby Gone"") changes tune and returns with a political historical drama much in the mold of Steven Soderbergh's or fellow actor/director George Clooney. Obviously a future talent to be reckoned with, Affleck again comes up with a skillfully focused, well scripted and deceptively subversive movie about a true CIA operation placed somewhere on the verge of absurd and ingenious. When six American embassy workers escape being taken hostage by Iranian revolutionist forces during the 1979 upheaval, the find refuge in the home of the Canadian ambassador. With the situation quickly deteriorating and no hope of legally extracting them from Iran, special operative exfiltration expert Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) conceives an idea to create a fake Star Wars rip-off film production called ""Argo"" and thus smuggle them out of the country as part of the movie crew. In order to bring this to fruition he employs Oscar-winning make-up artist John Chambers (John Goodman) and Hollywood producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), who states with intent that ""If I'm going to make a fake movie, I'm going to make a fake hit."" Equally thrilling as it it absurd Ben Affleck shows an surprisingly mature capability to mix up humour with the dramatic backdrop, thus creating arguably one of the most entertaining political features in history. Despite strong thematic ties to Barry Levinson's ""Wag the Dog"", partly due to the fact that it is closely based on a real story and its pulsating authenticity, ""Argo"" is a vastly superior movie (but I still find ""The Town"" to be Affleck's best movie, ""Argo"" however proves that Affleck is not limited in talent to certain subject matters). Given the subject matter the urge to drop into a less serious tone for a satire on the entertainment industry was reigned in, nicely balancing the ""%^&* You Argo"" idiocy with the stark deadly reality of the situation at hand. Even scenes of utter dread, for instance during the final check just before allowed to board the plane, has its moments of gleeful subversive humour (as revolutionaries admire the storyboard of the sci-fi fantasy pseudo-movie). Conversely Affleck shows level-handed humility in portraying events, while somehow managing to bring a pulsating touch of reality to Iran - you can almost feel the dusts of revolution floating in the air.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck also shows some respectful awareness as to the bigger picture, basically starting the whole movie with a short introduction into history, including the fact that Iran and the revolution were self-made CIA-inspired events dating back to morally doubtful interventions into the young Iranian democracy and their direct impact on reinstating a bloody dictator. Some doubts can be raised towards the patriotic ending, where an overly gloating ending relishes in the fact, that an American special operative success will be claimed by the Canadians. Not to mention somewhat ""Lord of the Rings"" serial endings. Otherwise however a truly brilliant movie by the new prodigy of American cinema."

Albeit, Zero Dark Thirty's past is a tad bit – 20-30 years – sooner, both that and Argo recount U.S.A.'s ""barely achievable"" Middle-Eastern's undercover missions of glory.<br/><br/>Here, in Argo, after a series of unforgivable and bad decisions, a sextet of Americans are hiding out in the Canadian Embassy's home in 1980 Iran while their peers are captured and tortured. Argo shows a man's plight to bring them – JUST THE SIX, mind you – home via a fake movie.<br/><br/>The scheme, CIA operative Tony Mendez, constructs seems so implausible, so expensive and so elaborate, that it couldn't possibly work and without surprise, of course it would. Or they wouldn't have made this movie.<br/><br/>Mendez convinces his government peers to fund a lie of a Sci-Fi movie – that strongly reminded me of the awful film, Gentlemen Broncos, to get himself into war-torn Iran to rescue those mostly defiant six U.S. Embassy over-stayed Canadian ""houseguests"" and morons. Given what I saw recently in Zero Dark Thirty, too bad the technology wasn't with us back then to avoid just a grand concoction just to free these completely uninteresting, selfish and endlessly whining folkand never mind the other countless hostages not living under a great roof, not being well-fed and well stacked with cigarettes.<br/><br/>Now, this all said, I didn't dislike the film that much. I did care for the extreme details Director Affleck paid attention to. And when you already know how this is going to play out, even without knowing the background – like I didn't, it was rather suspenseful towards the end. It was definitely ""On-the-edge-of-your-seat"" finale.<br/><br/>One thing though: I lived through 1980, and of course, since I'm writing this today, the rest of the 1980s. I hated the style back then. Yuck. Even as realistic as they make these 1980s period piece films, it's so hard for me to like them. Even when I experienced these years, I couldn't wait to get out of that decade.<br/><br/>Neither here, nor there.

","Movies are entertainment. Normally, even the best ones can't change the world. But in 1980, a sci-fi B-movie -- one that didn't even get made -- actually saved some American lives. Argo is the true-life tale of how an un-produced Star Wars knock-off was used to rescue hostages in Iran.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck stars in and directs the story of an astonishing covert CIA operation that remained classified for decades. He plays Tony Mendez, the operative assigned to infiltrate Iran and sneak out with six U.S. diplomats who managed to escape from the American Embassy while it was being taken over by revolutionaries. He devises a cover story -- he'll pose as a Canadian film producer scouting locations for a space opera.<br/><br/>To convince the Iranian authorities – he has to set-up a real production company, and find a real script. But navigating the cutthroat world of Hollywood agents and studios proves almost as formidable as dealing with hostile Middle Eastern regimes.<br/><br/>The action later shifts to Iran, as Mendez carries out his mission. One false move along the way, and the operation fails. The result is a gripping and suspense-filled drama that won't let you breathe easy.<br/><br/>Affleck gives a nice, subtle performance as Mendez (he's also so lacking in vanity that he allows himself to be shown with a ridiculous shag haircut). The rest of the cast is terrific as well – especially Alan Arkin and John Goodman, who play the real filmmakers Mendez teams up with to help carry-out the plan. Production Designer Sharon Seymour does an outstanding job of recreating the look and feel of the late '70s and early 80s.<br/><br/>People in show business seem to love honoring movies about show business. So, I wouldn't be surprised if Argo scores big on Oscar night."

","Ben Affleck is developing a decent track record for himself as a director. Gone Baby Gone, The Town and now Argo are all very entertaining. More than just pretty face then! Argo is based on the true story of six American Embassy employees who escaped when the Embassy in Tehran was attacked in 1979 by protesters against the US giving the Shah sanctuary following his fall from power. They find refuge in the home of the Canadian ambassador and the US authorities have to find a way to get them out of Iran before the local authorities realise they are there.<br/><br/>Be warned though, from comments on the movie it seems clear the movie is a highly dramatized and not very accurate portrayal of what happened.<br/><br/>Affleck plays Tony Mendez, a CIA agent specialising in these operations. He has contacts in Hollywood and comes up with the idea of setting up a fake movie to arrange a trip to Tehran to scout locations and bringing the escapees home on the way back as part of the crew.<br/><br/>The movie is good in showing us the tension felt by the escapees in Tehran and by Mendez in the US as he tries to make his scheme workable.<br/><br/>The tension builds as Mendez goes to Tehran and tells the plan to the trapped Americans. Some of them are understandably sceptical. However they have little choice but to go along with it and the final Tehran airport sequence is well done, though perhaps more than a little far fetched.<br/><br/>In fairness to the makers at the start of the movie some time is given to explain the historical background to the unpopularity of the US in post revolution Iran.<br/><br/>Definitely a political thriller I'd recommend, though maybe not for factual accuracy."

Matt Damon and Ben Affleck have since stood firm ground only to move if it's for a step to advance. Affleck clearly got ahead of Damon after he took to the seat behind the camera for the second time with his production THE TOWN. This isn't about a nitty gritty story of who is ahead of whom? Instead this is all about Ben Affleck taking the director's chair once again to bring us a movie with thrilling proportions with plenty if verve.<br/><br/>ARGO unfolds to us a story that is based and inspired by true events that took place in the late 1970s. The story of Tony Mendez. The story of how Tony Mendez against all odds, pushed forward to rescue 6 Americans trapped in Tehran. A story that took place long ago during the Iranian - US relationship which was also a trying time in Tehran. It was amidst this time that a revolution raised much like what we have witnessed in certain nations in the recent past. Trapped in the middle of this revolution are 6 Americans that are working for the US embassy, who escaped the grounds of the embassy when it was stormed by the revolutionaries. Their only hope of safe passage back into the United States is if Tony Mendez; a CIA exfiltrator is able smuggle them out of Tehran legally and through airport security! Now how about that for a reason good enough to watch this movie?<br/><br/>As Ben Affleck goes on an entirely different path with ARGO, it feels as if he takes on him a challenge to conquer waters unknown to him. It's his own personal endeavor to prove to himself and the world that he can step out of his comfort zone and still muster the courage needed to direct such a historically noted incident. ARGO comprises of numerous different settings that simultaneously requires moving forward to a point where it climaxes to a glorious, intense and thrilling finish. Just as a conductor conducts his opera of varied instruments that reach a magnificent crescendo in the end in unison, Affleck battles his way through positively. His strongest support line is Alan Arkin, Bryan Cranston and Victor Gaber. The movie throttles forward in three different settings. One is the CIA story; one is the Hollywood story and lastly the Tehran Story. I would not be exaggerating if I say that the entire cast and crew tames a monster of a plot that could have gone completely wrong if they made one wrong move in the production. How did they do it? Its sheer talent and expertise would be a wise assumption.<br/><br/>This political thriller will be most enjoyed by those who have savored the likes of movies such as APPOLO 13, THE IDES OF MARCH, and J.EDGAR and not for fans of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.<br/><br/>With this production Ben Affleck gets a step closer to the A-List of Hollywood actors that turned directors and produced better movies that full time directors. Lastly is this Oscar worthy? It's highly entertaining and very well done. However movies like this always get sidelined for some reason or the other (With the exception of THE KINGS SPEECH). I am rooting for ARGO for at least a nomination and if a win comes its way, it is well deserved.<br/><br/>TITLE : ARGO DIRECTED BY : BEN AFFLECK STARRING : BEN AFFLECK, ALAN ARKIN, VICTOR GABER, TATE DONOVAN and BRYAN CRANSTON RATED : R RATING : 08/10 RUNTIME: 120 MINUTES"

","Never thought Ben Affleck could act, or direct. In his latest work ( I have not watched the acclaimed ""Gone Baby Gone"" or ""The Town"" ), he has shown me he can do both, quite well. Filmed with gritty realism like in ""Munich"", Argo is taut, tightly-scripted and made the 2 hr run time seems like 1 big take. There were genuine suspense and tension. Small misses - I would like to see how the six Americans got out of the ambassy. First you see the iranian thugs and zealots storm the ambassy, Americans were taken hostage and blind-folded, next six Americans were walking the streets free. But overall this is only minor fau paux. My only other complaint is a humorous one - why does everyone wear those huge,outsize, Hilary Clinton at Yale type glasses ? Definitely look for more good movies to come from Ben."
"markgorman","9","0","0","29 December 2012"," A truly outstanding contribution to cinema by Ben Affleck.
","Before today I honestly can't think of anything I would have had to say about Ben Affleck, good or particularly bad. He's one of those Hollywood A-Listers that just doesn't feature on my radar. Dunno why, he's been (starred) in enough half decent movies to make an impression. And a lot of turkeys. A journeyman pro I guess would be my description.<br/><br/>Not any more.<br/><br/>Because Ben Affleck can direct. Boy can he direct.<br/><br/>Argo is tight as a drum from start to finish, features one of the most suspenseful scenes ( more of a reel than a scene) that I've ever seen and he commands the screen as the movie's star i such a low key way that he's almost not there. And yet he is. Resoundingly.<br/><br/>Argo is almost immaculately conceived, scripted, edited, sound-tracked and acted. There are laugh out loud moments and moments of such supreme tension you just can't bear to watch. The resolution is extraordinarily moving for two reasons. It's majestically underplayed and the music is perfectly pitched.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast of six hostages, Affleck, John Goodman (back on form with some right good lines), Brian Cranston (making a bid to be America's oldest acting superstar), Alan Arkin (really? really is that Alan Arkin?) and a bunch of smaller parts play their parts universally well.<br/><br/>But this is all about Ben Affleck at the end of the day. His third director's role proper his nabbed a Golden Globe nomination for best Movie, director supporting actor (Arkin), and screenplay; of these surely Director is within range and maybe best movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, my advise is, go see it and make your own mind up because IMHO this is an outstanding movie only equalled by The Master and End of Watch in 2012 (that I've seen).<br/><br/>Everything that The Master lacks in plot terms Argo delivers in spades. Argo doesn't have the impact of a Seymour Hoffman or Joaquin Pheonix performance but it is none the worse for it.<br/><br/>9/10"
"dfle3","8","0","0","19 December 2012"," Argo think about watching this movie...
","Glad I watched this movie...it had gotten some good reviews but I can't say I was excited to watch it. It concerns the true* story of a C.I.A. backed attempt to rescue diplomatic staff in Iran, during the ""Iran hostage crisis"" of 1979. The diplomatic staff were not hostages, but their lives were in grave danger if they could not get out of Iran.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck plays Tony Mendez, the C.I.A. operative assigned the task of coming up with a less bad scheme to rescue the U.S. embassy's diplomatic staff, who managed to escape the Iranian mob invasion of the U.S. embassy.<br/><br/>Having missed most of the introductory narration to the movie, it felt as though the reasons for the Iranians anger towards the U.S.A. was too glib...easily dismissed as slogans/rhetoric by radicals. However, making a point of catching the next session of the movie to see the full introductory prelude to the movie, that impression was rectified. In an objective narratorial voice, the circumstances of the mob's invasion of the U.S. embassy are provided...at least the historical context is. This kind of information occasionally makes it in to Hollywood type movies nowadays...with films like ""Three kings"", for example. The historical circumstances are debatable, but at least they're provided. Taking a position on this, one could say that the movie is about what can happen when corporate rights, coupled with the rights to resources come into conflict with human rights...bad things happen.<br/><br/>Personally, not being that familiar with the Iran hostage crisis, I'd say that some more historical information would have interested me. For instance, I have seen reported that Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan played politics with the American hostages for his own political gain...i.e. he sought to have the release of the hostages delayed until after the presidential election in order to secure the presidency by making the Democrat president, Jimmy Carter, appear impotent in the face of intimidation. As president, Reagan also gave weapons to these 'terrorists' in exchange for the hostages (the ""arms-for-hostages"" story). None on this historically interesting stuff is mentioned in the movie, so it's more of a Hollywood style movie, in that sense.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck gives a highly unusual performance as the mastermind of the rescue. One cricket writer once said of the English captain David Gower that he ""was so relaxed as to be comatose"". I don't mean that as a criticism of Affleck. He does, however, make ""understated"" look like the height of ""camp melodrama"" by comparison. It's such an unusual performance that I would think it appropriate for him to be in the short list for Best Actor awards. Wouldn't think he would win it. His character seems to have anti-freeze running through his veins! Also oddly, in one scene Affleck looks quite buff...he had a Chuck Norris look about him before that, but that just solidified the impression...you almost expect him to whip out the nunchucks at some point!<br/><br/>The power of the mob is effectively conveyed in the opening scenes. Even though this is a good movie, it seems to me that as a viewer I merely understood the drama in the movie rather than felt it as viscerally as I did the mob scenes. The end part of the movie is more effective at creating real drama for the viewer...although sometimes it feels cliché and put-on, as in the scene with the embassy staff in a motor vehicle heading for freedom. In that scene I just thought ""You have got to be kidding me!"".<br/><br/>There does seem to be an element of ticking off dot points in the drama too. Some of these work well though, as in how someone who knows the embassy staff's whereabouts will respond to those Iranians who might seek to harm them. That was nicely handled.<br/><br/>Even though this is a serious drama, it does have quite a bit of humour in it too. Perhaps the humour can be too self-conscious at times too, e.g. referencing possible roles Ben Affleck may have been discussed for. Anyway, such in-jokes didn't really detract from the movie for me.<br/><br/>I did see ""Breaking bad"" star Bryan Cranston in the movie, but didn't immediately recognise him, as he seemed much older in this movie. Some of the embassy staff also reminded me of Tobias Fünke (Arrested development), Bargearse (Bluey, via The Late Show) and a 1970s porn star (well, what I'd imagine a 1970s porn star would look like!).<br/><br/>* Well, some Canadians have made a point of saying that the movie is more a work of fiction and that Canadians are the real stars of the real events the movie was based on."

","The phrase ""sometimes truth is stranger than fiction"" certainly applies here. The CIA planning to ex-filtrate six hostages from 1980's Iran under the cover story of a Science Fiction film scouting for locations.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, which follows CIA operative Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) as he attempts to brazenly snatch six hostages, from under the nose the Ayatollah Khomeini, during the 1980 Iranian hostage crisis.<br/><br/>A well summarized narration sets the scene, indicating that the crisis is at least in part, caused by American actions, providing sanctuary for the much despised last Shah of Iran.<br/><br/>The American embassy in Iran has been overrun and students now hold many hostages. Just before the Embassy was taken, six staff managed to escape, ultimately given sanctuary at the Canadian ambassadors own private residence.<br/><br/>Back in the US, President Carter, the State Department and eventually the CIA discuss the various bad options, ultimately choosing the least worst. Riding out on bicycles during winter is only dismissed at a late point, Mendez sarcastically suggesting that adding training wheels might help.<br/><br/>If the cover story is to hold up, the film is going to have to look real. Cue stage left, some Hollywood stereotypes John Chambers (John Goodman) and Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin). As Chambers summarizes, ""You want to come to Hollywood and make a fake movie and do nothing"", when Mendez confirms, Chambers replies ""You'll fit right in!"".<br/><br/>Chambers and Siegel are tasked with making it appear like they are creating and producing a movie by generating buzz and column inches in ""Variety"", the movie news bible. The whole charade even includes a read through in full costume and whilst somewhat amateurish, it clearly is the best option on offer.<br/><br/>When Mendez travels to Iran the situation becomes more serious for all concerned. Being caught with false documentation would label them spies, with a summary court appearance and execution. Understandably, the terrified hostages are not confident of their chances and doubt whether their trust in Mendez is well placed.<br/><br/>Affleck as both Director and lead actor has done a fine job. All characterizations are wholly believable, the period detail, costumes and obligatory beards and mustaches are all in place. The acting is first rate, natural and without any grandstanding, ordinary people very fearful their lives are about to come to a grisly, undignified end..<br/><br/>Back in the States, Jack O'Donnell (Brian Cranston) holds the operation together as best he can, as the political sands shift significantly beneath his feet. The stakes are very high, not only for those on the ground but Carter's administration as well. The possibility of a humiliating capture during a covert approved CIA operation, on a political level is unthinkable. There is a palpable feeling of tension which is ratcheted up to almost unbearable levels. If you have finger nails going in, they make be somewhat lower by the credit roll.<br/><br/>Affleck is not afraid to provide a measured dignified performance, always important when relaying real life events. There are several quiet scenes and he allows the story to flow organically rather than forcing it along with exploding cars and unnecessary violence.<br/><br/>Finally, as a director he manages to heed the golden movie rule ""politics do not sell"", neatly avoiding making any overtly political statement by providing a balanced view of the events. The how and why, without painting either side as complete saints or sinners.<br/><br/>With three solid well received films on his resume, Affleck has truly reinvented himself from ""Bennifer"" days and if he chooses, is likely to be helming very large film projects in the future.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>An excellent period set drama/thriller with a fair sprinkling of black humour. The events depicted are difficult to believe but based on truth.<br/><br/>What is not difficult to believe, is Afflecks emergence as a star director in the making.<br/><br/>Smart, intelligent and enjoyable, highly recommended<br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/"

","Gripping, Haunting and Extremely well presented, Argo is a very smartly presented suspense-thriller which is sure to keep you gripped throughout the movie and is backed up with a unique script, some good presentation of the characters and extremely smart and brilliant direction and acting by Ben Affleck to show this tensed-terror ride as well as one can present. <br/><br/>The Story which is based on true events, is set in the late 1970's where during political unrests between the U.S.A and Iran was happening, the US Embassy is robbed by Iranian terrorists and 6 of the workers there manage to escape to the Canadian Embassy of Iran, and they must be saved by the CIA agents and must be brought back to the U.S. So A CIA Agent Tony Mendez(Ben Affleck) is brought upon to make a plan on how to save the 6, and he comes up with a plan of making a movie where they were kept as hostages and then make those 6 Americans as film's crew and somehow bring them back to their country.<br/><br/>The Acting in this movie is'nt based on someone in particular, but the ''lead actor'' in this movie is Affleck himself, and he does a brilliant job as Tony Mendez who is on a mission to save the 6 hostages and Affleck portrays this character superbly. The whole rest of the acting crew did very well and everyone did their character justice, but i thought Alan Arkin and John Goodman did their jobs brilliantly as Lester Siegel and John Chambers who are the two movie-related people who help Mendez make the plan with this movie.<br/><br/>Well, Ben Affleck always makes sensible and smart movie which are very logical and very pleasing to watch and can be enjoyed by all movie lovers and critics, and he did the same in making Argo, which a unique movie in its own, Argo is a very smartly made thriller and Affleck keeps you glued to the edge of your seat from the very beginning to the finish and keeps you wondering how Mendez will get those 6 out of Iran. Affleck both directed AND Acted in this movie and thats a very difficult thing to do, and he both the jobs so brilliantly that he really deserves most of the credit for the movie. <br/><br/>The Story(which is based on true events which had occurred on the dates shown in the movie) is a smart topic to make a unique suspense-thriller out of, but Affleck did just that in making this one, and he never overdid any part of it, and just showed what had actually occurred brilliantly. Screenwriter Chris Terrio has done a good job with the writing the story for this movie. <br/><br/>The Cinematography of the movie is quite good and Rodrigo Prieto has done a great job in showing the dark streets of Iran during those political unrest times and some of the sequences were really well presented. The Costumes worn by the actors in this movie are exactly what it should have been in those times, and the costume design team deserves some credit for that. The Editing of the movie is also quite good as the movie is'nt over-shown at any point and its very to the point stuff.<br/><br/>The Background music which is given by Alexandre Desplat is quite brilliant stuff and although in some of the scenes there is sheer silence and people only talking, but in many scenes Desplat has shown his magical music as he has delivered so many different kinds of music in the film, and the background score really synchronises well with the scene's of the film.<br/><br/>Finally, Argo is really smart and brilliant stuff from Ben Affleck and it has to be one of the best movies of 2012 and deserves more than one watch and It can be really pleasing for all sets of movie lovers.<br/><br/>My Rating: 9/10"
"estebangonzalez10","9","0","0","8 December 2012"," Three for Three for Affleck
","¨If I'm going to make a fake movie, it's going to be a fake hit. ¨ This is Ben Affleck's third film as a director and he's made yet another brilliant film. Not everyone may agree that he's a good actor, but I think we can all agree that he's one of the top directors of this century. His first film Gone Baby Gone was a huge success, and he followed that with an even greater hit: The Town. Both these films were set in Boston (Affleck's home town), but now Ben went out of his comfort zone and directed a film set in Iran in the late 70's. The general look of the film felt so real and authentic; it was as if Affleck transported us into the past and we were really there. The film has an authentic 70's vibe that reminds us of other great films from that period. I had my doubts about Argo considering the subject matter. I didn't think it would keep my attention for long, but I was wrong because Affleck was able to create so much tension and suspense that I was at the edge of my seat during most of the film. He also mixed that tension with some humor and movie industry satire. Arkin played a movie producer and Goodman an Oscar winning makeup artist; the scenes between both these actors were hilarious and they were on top of their game. Those scenes were probably among my favorite of the movie, I don't know if I would've enjoyed the movie as much as I did if it weren't for those two supporting actors. I still think Gone Baby Gone and The Town were both better films than Argo, but this will surely have more success with the Academy voters. Argo will be nominated for Best Picture and could be one of the favorites to win the Oscar.<br/><br/>The film is based on true events that occurred during 1979 while tension arose between the United States and Iran when Iranian revolutionaries invaded the American embassy in Iran and took several American hostages. Six American employees managed to secretly escape during the turmoil and found refugee in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador. The CIA then plans a secret mission to try to take them out of the country before the Iranians realize that six of the employees from the Embassy are missing. Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), a CIA exfiltration expert, comes up with a risky plan to bring them back home safely. He creates a fake Canadian film project and travels to Iran with the excuse that he is looking for locations to shoot his sci-fi film titled Argo claiming that Iran is the perfect spot. In order to make his plan believable the CIA begins to collaborate with some trusted Hollywood people: Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), a film producer, and John Chambers (John Goodman), a make-up artist. Together they prepare to produce the best fake movie Hollywood has ever made and has everyone in the industry fall for the lie. Meanwhile at the residence of Canadian Ambassador, Ken Taylor (Victor Garber), tension is beginning to rise as the revolutionaries are beginning to suspect that there might be some Americans hiding there. These Americans are Bob (Tate Donovan), Cora (Clea DuVall), Joe (Scoot McNairy), Lee (Rory Cochrane), Mark (Christopher Denham), and Kathy (Kerry Bishe). Tony Mendez provides them with Canadian passports and a fake identity and has them each passing for crew members of the film he's producing. Bryan Cranston plays Affleck's supervisor in the CIA who gives him the green light for the highly risky mission.<br/><br/>Saying that Argo is based on a true story doesn't mean that everything that happened in this film was real. Of course you have several things that were made up in order to build up the tension. This isn't a documentary and if you want to read about the real story there is plenty of information about what happened in Iran. The film is based on the article written by Joshua Bearman and the screenplay adapted by Chris Terrio. People familiar with the story already know the outcome, but Affleck is able to maintain the suspense and tension nonetheless. His real success here was the way in which he was able to recreate several scenes in such a believable fashion. The amount of attention he put into small technical details can be seen during the end credits where we have pictures of the real events along with the scenes from the film. Affleck also took a huge risk by mixing movie industry satire with suspense and tension, but it paid off really well and was the highlight of the film in my opinion. Argo is a truly satisfying film and without a doubt one of the best films of the year thanks to the technical aspects of the film, a strong performance from the cast, and the thrilling storytelling all supported by the great direction of Ben Affleck.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"

The 1980s cold-war grainy indigo hue and Middle East settings are accurately revivified, from the intriguing opening sequences of the riot, the film has been sliding through a roller coaster adventures both in USA and in Iran, two paralleled story lines are in alliance with pitch-perfect tempo and tension, maybe for the admirers of the anti-terrorists series HOMELAND, the procedures are all too familiar and corny for political thrillers to spark off some evocative frisson, but the whole film holds up intact in its resilient poise to be entertaining and crowd-pleasing and it did it! <br/><br/>Affleck as an actor may not be a laudable player, but this time he chooses a safer bet in playing the taciturn, diligent secret agent whose self-possession is the main requisite for the severe mission's quirky premise. Alan Arkin and John Goodman pair assume the light- hearted amusement inside the Hollywood industry, Mr. Arkin has his eloquent show-time may secure him another Oscar-nomination. Meanwhile, a touchy but tenacious Bryan Cranston also leaves an indelible trace of calibre in an otherwise flat role as the senior head. <br/><br/>After three steadfast and advancing steps scaling up to a respectable position as an enterprising young director in Hollywood hierarchy, Mr. Affleck is confidently disposed to select more ambitious projects and hopes to achieve what Robert Redford had nabbed in the early 80s, an idol-breaking route to justify oneself he is much talented behind the camera other than possessing an ephemeral pretty face and sinewy physique.<br/><br/>ps: My Oscar entries: BEST PICTURE, BEST DIRECTOR and two slots in BEST S.

","Against the backdrop of extreme anti-Americanism in Iran due to its support for the Shah, six American citizens manage to escape the American embassy and take refuge in the home of the Canadian Ambassador. The problem is that they cannot remain there for very long as eventually their identities will be revealed and they will be captured and possibly killed. So a plan is devised to send in a C.I.A. operative named ""Tony Mendez"" (Ben Affleck) under the guise of a movie producer to attempt to take them out as part of the film crew. But before that can happen he has to get cooperation from some people in Hollywood to lay the groundwork for an actual movie in order to fool Iranian intelligence. At any rate, what I liked about this film is that it captures the intense anger the Iranian people had during this time without involving Islam as the main culprit. No doubt some used it as a conduit to gain political leverage and they are still doing it now. But it was the Shah--and our support for him--that was the catalyst. Even so, because of its strict religious leadership and the hatred they have for the West, I doubt that the current regime in Iran will allow its people to watch it. But that's another story entirely. Be that as it may, I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to those who also like political dramas of this type."
"dario_malic","8","0","0","2 December 2012"," The movie is fake. The mission is real.
","The line between fiction and reality is nowadays often blurred, with television and newspapers assaulting people with all kind of half-checked information, so it's refreshing to see a piece of work that makes clear distinction between the two. And it's even better that it does so by mixing them together.<br/><br/>""Argo"", Ben Affleck's latest effort as both, a director and an actor, is a fictional work about a real event which consisted of creating a fictional event about a work of fiction. Confused? If you've seen the movie you're not. It is all displayed so clearly that it's easy to overlook its complexity. In 1979 Iranians took hold of US embassy in Tehran as a retaliation for US sheltering their overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. They held people who were working there as captives, but 6 diplomats managed to hide in the house of the Canadian ambassador, and escaped two months later with the help of CIA exfiltration expert Tony Mendez, posing as a Canadian film crew making a (fake) sci-fi with an eastern vibe. It sounds like one of those things that could only happen in a movie, so it was a logical decision to put it there. And putting it there means crossing from reality to fiction. So a joint CIA and Canadian Government operation can become one man's quest to save his fellow countrymen, as it basically did. There are, of course, other involved, but the movie's main character is Tony Mendez. He came up with the idea, found all the people needed to do the job, and himself went to Tehran to help the diplomats escape.<br/><br/>Affleck the director does a very good job. Although we know how it's all going to end, there's an unbearable tension and a sense of fear for the characters we feel right till the last minute. What's even more fascinating is that we're at the same time aware of the silly and clichéd solutions utilized to create those feelings (everything happens in the nick of time) but we don't care about them. Affleck the actor isn't as good. He's mostly expressionless and makes the weakest link in the otherwise almost perfect cast. A shame considering he gets most of the screen time. Fortunately, the likes of Clea DuVall and Christopher Denham present us with some of the most intense performances we've seen in the last couple of years. Make-up, costume design and the overall production design make us go back in time as well as see and feel the differences between the east and the west, while Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography makes the fear and tension palpable with the help of great editing by William Goldenberg. There's a brilliant interchange of Iranian woman reading accusations against the US and the cast of the fake movie reading the screenplay, which displays all of it.<br/><br/>In spite of its serious subject matter the movie contains a lot of humour, presented mostly by the two Hollywood characters and directed towards the same movie industry. And while the Hollywood gets criticized for a lot of things, it's ultimately lauded for the hope and sense of magic it brings to people whether the movie is real or fake. But, as Affleck shows us by naming his movie after the one it tells about, all the movies are actually fake. It's only their meaning and the impact they have that matter.<br/><br/>More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/"

","Being consumed by film marketing in the 21st century western world is almost an unavoidable right of passage for any owner of modern technology or in fact anyone who has ever been outdoors. As I do, and have, I was given great expectations for Argo that were not quite fulfilled to the capacity I had hoped.<br/><br/>Despite my slight sense of disappointment, Argo is a splendid piece of work by director/producer/actor Ben Affleck. It is essentially a film about film, the latter not really being a film. Confused? Well you shouldn't be, the premise is rather straightforward and enlightens its younger audience (including myself) on the historical conflict between Iran and the United States of America in 1979. The non-fictional reality of the declassified event that occurred 32 years ago, while presumably slightly sensationalised for cinematic purposes, is rather inconceivable. While thoroughly engaged in the atmosphere the film creates, you continuously ask yourself if this genuinely happened. Knowing that it did is perplexing at a severe magnitude.<br/><br/>In all honesty, Argo fails to really grasp the undivided attention of the audience until the final 30 minutes of the picture, though you appreciate the reservation of the best until last. It is as if you have been presented with a plate of food; knowing you must eat it all, you start on the vegetables to get them out of the way, then consume the adequate yet necessary side dish, before being enriched by the most prominent presence on the plate; it has the ability to satisfy the taste buds in every way possible, or cause a look of disgust and sickness dependant on its quality. Argo consists of the former of the two, as everything nearing the climactic resolution leaves you involuntarily paralysed in your seat as you await the next revelation or obstacle for the characters to endure. The tension that the feature generates results in gasps being heard around the theatre as the unpredictable nature of the characters' actions are unveiled.<br/><br/>Whenever we relocate to scenes of lesser tension, we are more often than not gifted with tremendously suitable comic relief. Its situation in the narrative is not just present for entertainment purposes, it also facilitates in allowing us to feel as though we are experiencing the characters' endeavours. This is because the humour makes the best out of a bad situation for those that have been affected by the events at the start of the film. Everyone must keep their composure in order to get the job done, and the comedy is used to simply give the characters something to smile about and as a coping strategy, as when they feel this, it synchronises audience's emotions.<br/><br/>The first 90 minutes of Argo is albeit very slow, though quite necessary to give us enough fuel to make it to the phenomenal conclusion. This also provides the biographic thriller with a pleasant structure, as no sequences are prolonged or too short and it builds itself up to behave like an amalgamation of necessary processes in order to achieve the goal the CIA have set out to do. The Oscar 'buzz' surrounding Argo are not feelings that I personally reciprocate due to the fact I did not feel absolutely immersed in the cinema screen throughout the showing, yet more so at specific moments, and also because it really does take some time for the picture to gain momentum, which is really the precautionary point the film conveys, but it just is not that engaging. This is one of those films whereby you are very glad you watched it; though do not feel that it requires you to sit through it another time."

","Ben Affleck the actor has never impressed me much, a journeyman who has made some real stinkers (""Gigli"", ""Surviving Christmas""), but Ben Affleck the filmmaker has really come into his own. His third film as a director (""Gone Baby Gone"", ""The Town"") is a first-rate political thriller with a pulpish fervor and keen intelligence. The Iran hostage crisis of 1979-81 takes on revitalized life in this engrossing 2012 movie with great period detail and a well-turned screenplay by first- timer Chris Terrio. The recent Benghazi killings only makes this story resonate more with an event hidden from history prior to 1997 propulsively dramatized here as a turning point in the precarious state of U.S. relations with the entire Arab world. It's fascinating to consider the truth behind the ""best bad idea"" the CIA could concoct to rescue six U.S. embassy workers who managed to escape the compound. There's a blessedly brief prologue chronicling the events that led to the Shah's exile to the U.S. and the rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini and fundamentalist Islam in Iran leading to the tense hostage situation.<br/><br/>The six workers found refuge at the Canadian embassy. With the CIA at a loss to figure out how to sneak them out of Iran, exfiltration specialist Tony Mendez is inspired a bit of ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes"" to come up with an incredulous plot to have the six pose as a Canadian film crew who were flown to Teheran to scout locations for a phony sci-fi film that gives this movie its name. Mendez enlists prosthetics expert, real-life makeup artist John Chambers, to help convince veteran producer Lester Siegel to get studio backing for the fake epic. Siegel insists the picture look credible, so he buys an existing script, holds a reading with real actors at the Beverly Hilton, and starts an advertising campaign in the trade papers. All the gears are set in motion as Mendez's boss Jack O'Donnell miraculously gains approval for the far-fetched plan. Mendez flies to Teheran with doctored passports in hand and tries to convince the six to act out their roles with precise detail before they get recognized by Iranian officials as escapees from the embassy. <br/><br/>This race against the clock provides the tension in the film's final act, which comes down to a rather implausible albeit extremely thrilling chase scene at the airport. With Affleck in mostly stoic mode as Mendez, the cast is solidly effective with three unsurprising standouts – John Goodman as the avuncular Chambers, Bryan Cranston as the acerbic O'Donnell, and Alan Arkin who steals all his scenes with ease as Siegel. All the period detail is excellent from the tacky clothes to the Turkish locations standing in for Iran. The slightly washed-out documentary- style of Rodrigo Prieto's (""Brokeback Mountain"") cinematography perfectly captures the crowded, often squalid atmosphere. There's also an evocative use of vintage TV news clips featuring Mike Wallace's infamous interview with Khomeini. The final explanation of how the real story of the mission unfolded is provided in a voice-over by Jimmy Carter, who was President when it all took place up until the rest of the hostages were released. The film is a genre picture at heart but a historically evocative and emotionally powerful one thanks to Affleck's impressive work behind the camera."

","Ben Affleck's third film as a director, ""Argo"", about the 1980 Iranian hostage crisis and the fake film created as a ruse to facilitate the rescue of six Americans, is undoubtedly his finest and most sure-handed offering. It's smooth story-telling that's gripping and balanced, offering up thrills and laughs aplenty. That he has been once again blessed with a slew of extremely talented actors is just an elegant spice on top of this superb cinematic treat. It's a Hollywood winner that is stylistic and suspenseful in ways that so much of the boring box-office sure-bets grossly lack. Even if it lacks some of the intense bite of his ""Gone Baby Gone"", it's still Best Picture nom quality for sure, and a Best Director for Affleck, as well as a handful of other guaranteed nominations. And if I'm not mistaken, nothing seems destined to stop it from actually winning in all of these categories.<br/><br/>-Thomas Bond, TheFilmDiscussion"
"markdroulston","9","0","0","29 October 2012"," One of the year's best
","Could anyone have predicted ten years ago the path that Ben Affleck has taken? To go from being the butt of countless 'Bennifer' jokes, prancing around Hollywood in terrycloth jumpsuits, to being one of the most interesting, well-composed film-makers working today? Audiences love a comeback story, and that's precisely what Affleck has given us, with three excellent films under his belt, the best of which, Argo, is a genuine front-runner for best film of 2012.<br/><br/>It's possible that Ben Affleck's skill as a director and (as his fantastic work in Argo can attest) actor, owes a great deal to his time right in the centre of the public eye. Rebuilding his credibility as an artist to be taken seriously must have been no mean feat, given the ridiculous level of tabloid exposure he had, but by turning his attention to slow-burn thoughtful fare such as Argo he has all but removed himself from public life and simply lets the quality of the work speak for itself.<br/><br/>Argo is a fascinating story, so absurd that it can only be true. Concerning a covert mission to rescue six American citizens in hiding during the Iranian hostage crisis of the early 1980s, it's deeply serious material, but with an almost farcical edge. And while Affleck certainly takes many opportunities to inject humour into the film, the stakes are so high that when the extraction actually begins, the level of suspense stretches the limits of endurance.<br/><br/>Bizarrely, the film makes an interesting counterpoint to last year's suspense highlight Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol. Where that film relied on outlandish stunts and huge suspension of disbelief to perch us on the edge of our seats however,Affleck's languid pacing works perfectly for Argo. Creative license is assumed, but the realism permeates every frame. M:I's Ethan Hunt is for all intents and purposes a superhero, whereas Tony Mendez (Affleck) is simply a man, albeit an expert as his specific vocation. He appears to take everything in stride, right down to his troubled home life, and Affleck's enigmatic performance is easy to overlook, but absolutely grounds the film.<br/><br/>It's character work that gives nothing away yet says so much, and if he appears to take everything in stride, it's simply because he must. This is a man who prepares for the worst so he won't be caught unawares when it happens, and as such he seems a little distant, aloof as to whether the mission succeeds. Yet small moments give him away, betraying his intense investment in what he does. It's not flashy, but it's a very well pitched performance.<br/><br/>As good as Affleck is in his dual role as star and director, this is by no means a one man show. Alongside a mightily impressive cast including Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin and John Goodman, the film is beautifully shot with wonderful period detail, and Alexandre Desplat's clever, lively score adds the exciting spy film atmosphere that is absent from the script.<br/><br/>Argo is a triumph, an old-fashioned example of how to make tense, exciting adult drama, and it's not unreasonable to assume that Affleck's film will be a key player on the coming award circuit, and deservedly so.<br/><br/>tinribs27.wordpress.com"

","Dear Ben Affleck,<br/><br/>With ""Gone Baby Gone"", ""The Town"" and now ""Argo"" under your belt, I don't think anybody (mainly myself) can deny your prowess as a top tier filmmaker any longer. So, before I began with my actual review, I wanted to preface it with this short statement, which you should take as a letter of apology for every negative thing I've ever said about your filmmaking through the years, as well as a letter of forgiveness for ""Gigli"", ""Jersey Girl"" and ""Daredevil""...well, maybe not ""Daredevil"".<br/><br/>Synopsis: Directed by Ben Affleck, ""Argo"" is a film which dramatizes the declassified true story (set in the late 70's/early 80's) of CIA agent Tony Mendez (played by Affleck) who spearheaded the insane plan to secretly extract six fugitive American diplomatic personnel out of a revolutionary Iran, by posing as a fake Canadian film crew scouting a fake Canadian film (a ""Star Wars"" rip-off by the name of ""Argo""). And while this synopsis sadly may not sound like it would translate into a compelling Saturday night date movie (especially to those who didn't live through the actual event, or to those who think purchasing tickets to see the newest Silent Hill film is a good way to spend their money) what puts it over-the-top/makes this premise sing, is the undeniably engaging combination of Chris Terrio's screenplay, which perfectly balances comedic scenes with ones of gritty wartime events (maybe the toughest thing to do in scriptwriting) and Affleck's spot on portrayal of late 70's Iran and America (at times using actual footage) showcasing a devastatingly provocative parallel to that point in history and the post 9/11 atmosphere in the United States, as well as his startlingly brilliant ability to take a rather simplistic resolution (final 45 minutes) and mold it into one of the most suspenseful climaxes in recent years.<br/><br/>The only real flaw I could see in ""Argo"" is that with such a wealth of great actors, and the movie primarily surrounding Affleck's character, for long stretches of the film actors such as Bryan Cranston (who in my opinion, has overtaken Stanley Tucci as the best character actor working today) John Goodman and Alan Arkin (who are all excellent in their roles) aren't really given much to do. My only wish (if this movie weren't already 2 hours long) would've been to see more scenes showcasing this strong supporting cast.<br/><br/>Final Thought: Aside from the fact that ""Argo"" may garner him an Oscar nomination, what director Affleck has done with this film, is shown his incredible Spielberg-esque ability to take a historical event, that may have come off as dry or utterly uneventful in other hands, and make it so every second of what's on screen, no matter how seemingly mundane or complex, is impressively compelling. If you haven't figured it out by now, what I'm saying is that everyone should go see ""Agro"" (as it is one of the best movies of the year so far) even if movies described as ""historical dramas"" immediately make you reply with the phrase: ""so what else is playing?""<br/><br/>Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

","The only thing I liked about the film were only brief Middle Eastern, recreation of 80 style decade both technology and the looks of the characters. The film exudes the ""American Dream"" all the time, imposing the image of power ""civilizing"" of the U.S. over the rest of the world, exalted in opposition would be wild and extremist fanatics.<br/><br/>What I dislike about the film is that beyond being a propaganda itself is very poor performing and history. Recreated fairly unrealistic and boring, just getting a touch of suspense in the final scenes. It seems too lean budget that was, who won awards: Oscar for best picture, and the big news he had. I think in the film foreshadowed the joke of that: implicitly a good press can mount a fake movie. In this case seems to be an irony, in case of a movie Argo false recreated this time to rescue asylum seekers, if not whitewash the CIA.<br/><br/>Cast, all the time gave me the coldness sensation of all they wanted to convey emotions the actors, the script seems pedantic. It's ridiculous the mixture between the environment and the characters in Hollywood, wanting to contrast with Islamic fundamentalism, on that screen almost perfectly divided between the America of the '80s, and Iran of ""apes fundamentalists"".<br/><br/>For the protagonist, using very basic psychology, indirectly trying to forge the image of the CIA are good people with morals. Example with those scenes and shots where he misses his son Tony, is entirely to mark a marketing and humanization of the CIA. As these guys are obviously people mostly heartless and unscrupulous holders and the macabre minds who led the genocide in Latin America and the world."

","I travelled in Iran during the era of the Shah. I knew his was a puppet regime set up by the UK and USA to protect their access to Iranian oil.

The movie states all of this quite unequivocally at the start.<br/><br/>I also know that what followed him was every bit as oppressive and brutal, and the movie depicts the reality of this. It is not anti-Islamic to show the truth, the summary executions, gun-happy revolutionary guards and many people strung up in the street from mobile cranes, a barbaric practice that continues to this day.<br/><br/>I remember when the Ayatollah flew back in from France, and I really do remember the high hopes all around the world that a new dawn of freedom had arrived for Iran, but unfortunately it never happened. The movie is not inaccurate in its portrayal of those troubled times. The streets were indeed full of angry mobs day after day, usually chanting slogans demanding death to all Americans.<br/><br/>But this is a movie review, not a political analysis, nor a fine examination of the factual details.

","No matter what side of the political side your on you will enjoy this latest political thriller as ""Argo"" is an intense and raw suspense filled tale of the real life fake mission that helped free six of the American hostages that were held during Iran in 1979 and 1980. And wow the mission was for them to pose as a fake sci-fi film crew! Many just like me are just now learning of this actual CIA work, but it did happen as it was classified for many years and then declassified and brought to light. And actor and director Ben Affleck does wonderful work in bringing this real life tale to the screen. This is one film that after watching touches your political emotions.<br/><br/>Set in 1979 and 1980 during the early part of the Iran hostage crisis it focuses on six American officials who depart the torn embassy and take up secret living at the home of the Canadian ambassador. So just how are these hostages going to be freed well enter the raw and rugged shaggy looking CIA agent Tony Mendez(Ben Affleck) who's plan is that the six will pose as a fake Canadian film crew scouting for a filming location for a low budget B sci-fi look ""Star Wars"" ripoff film called ""Argo"". Everything starts to be put in place from the fake names, passports, and new looks to the escape travel routes.<br/><br/>Seeing Iran in 1979 and 1980 shows an extreme Muslim world of uncertain and tense feeling as Mendez sees this after he fixed everything up in Hollywood with the help and money backing from a legendary movie producer Lester Siegel(the always good Alan Arkin)and he gets monster movie make up artist the well respected John Chambers(the always folksy John Goodman)to help start up the fake campaign for ""Argo"". And believe it or not this all has approval from CIA boss Jack O' Donnell(Bryan Cranston). As they do it different sometimes the strangest plans work! Along the way from watching ""Argo"" you get intense feelings of suspense and political drama this film can relate a lot to the every day world and international political climate it's message shows the world is always involved in power and political struggles fueled by religion, greed and the need to stand alone at the top. I was only one year old in 1979 I still have small little memories by seeing clips of this time, and clearly this excellent historical political picture brought to light and revealed the story behind this troubling time in U.S. history because for me I was to caught up with Kenner's ""Star Wars"" action figures! ""Argo"" is one historical film that revealed a life changing mission that is now cherished and respected it clearly showed that courage and heart is often in the form of offbeat smarts and odd clever secret missions."

"Radu_A","6","2","5","1 December 2012"," Decent film, horrible timing (for anything but the Oscars)
","While this is indeed an interesting retelling of a 'truth-larger-than-fiction' event during the Iranian hostage crisis, and while it's OK that it focuses entirely on the American perspective of the task of liberating six escaped embassy staff members, I cannot help but feel uncomfortable about the timing of this film.<br/><br/>We're looking at the possibility of yet another war, after all, and the widespread hostility towards Iran as a nation is where the support for this film cunningly taps from. There is an introductory admission that the Iranian Revolution was the direct result of the US reinstatement of the absolutist Shah, who ruled via his suppressive secret police SAVAK. What's not mentioned, however, is that SAVAK was trained by CIA officers under the supervision of Herbert Norman Schwarzkopf, father of Norman Schwarzkopf who commanded Operation Desert Storm. So the rampant displays of Anti-Americanism are, as far as Iran is concerned, not without reason, and one would have wished that, in these sensitive times, the almost documentary style approach Affleck has chosen would consider this; after all, in the case of other countries (such as Chile) it is meanwhile generally accepted that such policies were crimes. SAVAK also has a special history with Germany (my country of residence), for their clashes with leftist protesters on the occasion of the Shah's state visit in 1967 was the starting point of the student revolution of '68, which eventually swept all across Western Europe. This event has been shockingly reconstructed in the first ten minutes of Uli Edel's 'Baader Meinhof Komplex' (2008).<br/><br/>To be sure, it's a fascinating story, its pace and perspective are logically focused on the planning of the rescue and the plight of the persons concerned. However, Iranians are reduced to a backdrop of a fanaticized mob, and that must make anyone who's actually been there feel rather queasy. The only sympathetic Iranian character throughout this film is the (briefly shown) crew's guide; when the 'film crew' tours a bazaar there is a hostile altercation with an angry mob over the taking of a photograph; the Canadian ambassador's maid is a traitor... a little more balance or just one scene with dialogue for one of the Iranian characters could have relieved the feeling of this being a propaganda effort, but instead we get a lot of patriotic 'no-one-gets-left-behind' talk, and an unnecessary chase scene which evidently didn't happen.<br/><br/>The way it plays, 'Argo' could well be interpreted as a rallying call for yet another war - AKA 'we've got every reason to bomb 'em for humiliating us 32 years ago'. And I was really hoping that Americans have grown tired of this, since it didn't work so well the last ten years. 'Charlie Wilson's War' (about financing Afghanistan's mujahedeen and then letting them slip out of control once the Russians were gone) was a lot more honest.<br/><br/>In short, Iran is not the country you might think it is after watching this film, as last year's foreign language Oscar-winning film 'A Separation' perfectly illustrates. What these times need is a documentary effort about the thousands of Iranians living in the US since the Islamic revolution, and what their hopes and fears for the state and future of their country are. Update: now there is one, it's called 'The Iranian Americans', was screened on PBS and is available for free online streaming."

","To those of us who remember going to bed each night serenaded by Ted Koppel's voice on ABC's ""Nightline,"" the latest film by Ben Affleck will bring back vivid memories. Yet remarkably, even though we remember how the Iranian Hostage Crisis turned out, the personal stories and occasional acts of heroism behind the daily headlines remain mostly untold and little known. <br/><br/>""Argo"" tells the griping story of a secret CIA-led mission to rescue six American hostages who managed to escape the doomed American Embassy on the day it was swarmed by an Iranian mob, which eventually led to a 444-day stalemate for those left behind, trapped in captivity. The six consular workers who managed to slip out a side door, just as the Embassy compound was being stormed, hid away for more than two months. They were housed at great risk inside the Canadian Ambassador's residence, in Tehran.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for the hostages, the time clock is ticking. The Canadian Ambassador receives word that his mission is to close, leaving the hidden Americans in a proverbial lifeboat, now suddenly taking on water. This sets into motion one of the oddest alliances ever for a clandestine operation, bringing together intelligence officials working alongside Hollywood insiders who must concoct a phony film as a cover story. The wacky idea is to pretend to make a movie in Iran, and smuggle out the American diplomats. This remarkable tale makes for pleasing caper, which draws in the audience due to being loosely based on actual events. <br/><br/>Maybe its having worked in Washington and having served in a couple of foreign embassies, but for me the part of the film that worked best was the dead-on portrayal of bureaucracy and communications to the overall process. This point cannot be overstated.<br/><br/>Most movies only focus on action and conflict. But the real challenges to would-be superheros are usually getting people to answer telephones and moving through the maze of lazy bureaucrats. Getting things done is simply not an easy thing, and this film does as good a job as any at showing the intricacies of the diplomatic and intelligence circles. Just as the 1976 classic ""All the President's Men"" showed the grind of digging up the truth within a news organization, in a similar sense, ""Argo"" perfectly captures the day-to-day back and forth tug of war between (sometimes contentious) forces within government. <br/><br/>I was also pleased the film did not attempt to gloss over the United States' appalling history of meddling in the internal affairs of Iran, the price for which we are still paying today. Not only did the U.S. assist in the overthrow of the Iranian prime minister back in 1953 (which happened, oddly enough just after he announced intent to nationalize Western oil companies). America also bolstered the Shah's brutal dictatorship with weapons and support for more than three decades, and then provided him sanctuary while Iranians demanded that he be returned to Iran in order to stand trial. One can probably make a case for these difficult diplomatic decisions which were made during the Cold War period. But the point is -- those decisions came at a heavy cost – and I credit the filmmakers for not casting the U.S.-Iran conflict in black and white as so many other films do, when the truth is often hued in shades of gray. <br/><br/>This is not to say ""Argo"" is without flaws. I'm not much of a fan of Ben Affleck's work. I saw little in this film that changes that opinion. He's directed a number of horrible movies. So,saying this is his ""best work"" isn't saying much. As an actor, I have even less regard for Affleck's spotty reel of rubbish. Every Affleck portrayal seems to be exactly the same, and his role here as a CIA operative is no different. <br/><br/>My final disappointment comes with one segment of the film which was a horribly missed opportunity. Although she appears in only a few scenes, the character portrayed by the Canadian Ambassador's housekeeper is absolutely pivotal to the overall success of the rescue mission. One peep from the housekeeper would have ended everything and probably resulted in executions. That a director with the experience-level of Affleck would not expound more on her role and the heart-wrenching dilemma she faces as a citizen of Iran without any means of escape is a terrible waste. <br/><br/>Without spoilers, the Iranian knows the six guests of the Canadian Ambassador are Americans. In one brief scene, she is questioned by a gun-totting investigator and she lies to protect them. Yet we are given absolutely no insight into her motives. That the hostages could (and will) escape and her lie will eventually be exposed puts her in serious danger. We later see a 20-second clip of this woman (which I will not give away) which shows what happens to her, which I found a poor attempt to neatly tie-up what must have been difficult decision for many Iranians who tended to be pro-Western and even friendly with Americans. Alas, this housekeeper was probably the most courageous person in the film, yet we fail to gain any insight into her character or motives. <br/><br/>Despite its flaws and some valid criticism about historical accuracy (the Canadians deserve more credit than they are given), this remains a film to see. This political thriller gives the audience a great ride and an emotionally-satisfying experience.<br/><br/>www.nolandalla.com"

","Ten out of ten <br/><br/>Ben Affleck. When I first saw Affleck in some film or other back in the '90s, I thought, ho-hum, some pretty boy who'll fade away. Then the early 2000s and Affleck's thing with JLo. Adios, amigo. <br/><br/>Didn't see him after that until I saw The Company Men. Hmm. I liked the movie, and Affleck seemed to be improving with age. Then The Town, which he co-wrote the script for, acted in, and directed. HMM. This guy's showing some real legit talent. Need to watch him more carefully.<br/><br/>Now Argo. If it doesn't win an Academy Award (Best Actor, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screen Writer, whatever), then the guys who vote on such things should be thrown to the crocodiles. In addition to Affleck, I thought all the actors, including the Iranian extras, were spot on. And the clever and adept blending of the Hollywood movie life (Arkin and Goodman were wonderful), the CIA versus Foggy Bottom, and Tehran in the grip of the Ayatollah Khomeini and the Revolutionary Guard was spot on too. <br/><br/>And pay close attention to the beginning, which traces in documentary fashion events in Iran from the fall of Mossaddegh in 1953 through the machinations of the British and American intelligence agencies segueing to the depredations of the Shah (Mohammad Reza Pahlavi) and his wife, who inhabited a cocoon where they and their cronies indulged themselves with luxuries and extravagances, abetted the use of torture, and allowed the shocking abrogation of the Iranian people's human rights. The Iranians were stir crazy-mad to make the Shah pay for his crimes--scenes well depicted in Argo--and wanted the US to return him to Iran to stand trial. This forms the crucial political background to the siege and storming of the US Embassy in Iran on 4 November 1979. <br/><br/>I was really surprised to learn the Tehran scenes were all shot in LA and environs (hey, not that I expected the film crew to have gone to Tehran). My only quibble were the occasional what were meant to be aerial shots of Tehran with the Alborz mountains in the backdrop showing their CGI origins. But that's a minor quibble. All in all, a really terrific movie that grips you from beginning to end even though we, the audience, know how it will end. And Affleck accomplished all this on a lean and mean budget. See. It can still be done.<br/><br/>I'm left wondering where Mr. Affleck's going next. If it's anywhere like Argo, I'll be there."
"The_Film_Cricket","10","2","5","24 October 2012"," A great thriller that respects our intelligence.
","The story of Argo might be hard to swallow if it weren't so wonderfully true. A lot of movies claim to be based on fact but few ever come off with the feeling that they are anything more than Hollywood hot air. Ben Affleck's ""Argo"" is different. Based on fact, it tells a story that would collapse into phony cliché in other hands, but under the direction of Ben Affleck, the movie is a nearly perfect thriller about how, in 1979, during the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, a group of Islamic terrorists were robbed of a handful of their potential victims. The movie opens with the recreation of the takeover. It says something of the craftsmanship of the film that despite the fact that we know how it ended, this scene develops a scary tension. We see the revolutionaries breaking the chains of the gates and storming the embassy as inside the Embassy workers rush to shred and burn all of their important papers. Fifty-two Americans are taken hostage, but six people walk out the back door. Frantic to find shelter, they find that the only person who will give them shelter is the Canadian Ambassador who hides the group in his crawl space.<br/><br/>Back home, the CIA is frantic. Tossing out all manner of goofball ideas, they are at a loss on how to rescue their people until one of their specialists Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) gets the goofiest idea of them all. He will fly alone into Tehran, retrieve the hostages, and fly back out posing as a Canadian film crew who are there scouting locations for a bad science fiction movie called ""Argo"". In the wake of the success of ""Star Wars,"" a rip-off seems perfectly logical, especially one that needs a desert location – hey if George Lucas can do it, why can't they?<br/><br/>The operation seems doomed from the start, but stranger things have happened. Mendez hires make-up man John Chambers (John Goodman) and a laconic producer named Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) to help secure financing, make sure that the production is air tight and to make sure that the production makes the news – the Iranians need to be made to think that the movie is the real deal.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Mendez flies into Tehran and lays out the plan to the trapped sextet who remind him that his crackpot scheme could mean their public execution. Arriving in town he is reminded of the gravity of the situation when he spots a dead man hanging from a construction rig. Time is of the essence, the movie repeatedly cuts back the Embassy where Iranian children and elderly carpet weavers are employed to stitch together shredded documents at the same time that the terrorists are becoming aware that six people who are on the Embassy ledgers are missing.<br/><br/>The final half hour of this movie is a masterwork of pure suspense. Most filmmakers are satisfied with chases and violence for their effect, but Affleck trusts our intelligence. He lets us in on a lot of information early on and establishes a well-plotted narrative so that we know what is happening all the way through. When we get to the final half hour, we know who the players are and what is at stake. We know the escape plot as the crew gets from one tense checkpoint to the next. There are small details established in these scenes – a ringing telephone; a stalled bus; a bad computer connection; a locked door; a Polaroid photograph – that build the suspense out of logic, not cliché. This film is so perfectly paced that you want to applaud it. We know the escape plot as the crew gets from one tense checkpoint to the next. There are small details established in these scenes – a ringing telephone; a stalled bus; a bad computer connection; a locked door; a Polaroid photograph – that build the suspense out of logic, not cliché. This film is so perfectly paced that you want to applaud it.<br/><br/>There are great supporting performances here, and that is key. Victor Garber is perfect as Ken Taylor, the Canadian Ambassador. As is Bryan Cranston as Tony's CIA contact who acts at a key moment when the mission looks like it will be recalled. But the best praise goes to Alan Arkin in a wonderful performance as the cynical, sleepy-eyed producer Lester Siegel who assures Mendez ""If I'm making a fake movie, it's gonna be a fake hit."" Arkin, now 78, has always been a treasure, an actor who seems to occupy a movie with such ease that he almost seems to live there.<br/><br/>All of these elements come together in a movie that is wonderfully entertaining, suspenseful and at times very funny. Affleck, with this film and his previous directing efforts on ""The Town"" and ""Gone Baby Gone"" has repeatedly shown a sure hand as a director. He loves the craft and respects us as viewers. Not only that, but he puts himself in the starring role and resists the temptation to make it flashy. He could reasonably have given himself a heroic posture here, but he lets us know that Mendez is only a key player, that so many people at home and abroad have a hand in this mission.<br/><br/>""Argo"" could have gone wrong is so many ways, but there are sly in-jokes here about the way Hollywood works that you almost feel like rewarding it just for that. There's a beautiful scene late in the film when the fake film crew show the airport security some storyboards for the science fiction film – they, of course, think the movie is real. For a moment the young Iranians get so caught up in the magic of movies that they forget their jobs. That this scene takes place at a moment teeming with suspense says something of the filmmaking and of the pure power of the movies."
"LOTRFreak993","10","2","5","21 October 2012"," Argo is the best movie I have seen all year and should not be missed.
","I first came knowledgeable of Argo when it won the Toronto film festival. the reason this stood out to me was because for the last several years the winner of Toronto has also won Best Picture at the Academy Awards. For me, this made seeing Argo a must.<br/><br/>In 1979 the US embassy in Iran was over run by Iranian revolutionaries. A majority of the staff were held hostage, but six employees escaped and were sheltered at the Canadian ambassador's unofficial residence. Argo is the about the operation taken to rescue these six.<br/><br/>Our protagonist is played by Director/Actor Ben Affleck. He does a wonderful job as the operations leader, Tony Mendez. Tony Medez constructs a plan to make a fake Canadian science fiction film in Iran by disguising the the Americans as his crew. By doing this he hopes he can smuggle the American's back to the states.<br/><br/>This film is non stop entertainment from start to finish. Tony Mendez must ask the help from two LA filmmakers to make a convincing fake film. This producer and makeup artist provide a majority of the comic relief in this film. Which surprised me because there was allot for such a serious film subject.<br/><br/>As I said, Argo is non stop thrills and entertainment, It is a great example of master story telling as well as film making. It is one of the finest examples of cinema I have seen in a long time. Argo is the best movie I have seen all year and should not be missed. If you decide to see anything over the next week or so, make it Argo."

","I don't know why, but every time I see most movies coming out so close to election days, I usually take great sport in mocking all those Hollywood-drones as left-wing suck-ups. I must admit that this is an expensive sport – I know – but it does give me a chance to voice my opinions during such stressful times. Anyways, I figured this would be another one of those mind-numbing lemmings of a movie – where it twaddles off the cliff-edge of lefty-ism, ending up at the bottom of the Chasm of Moronica. Oh boy was I ever tricked. This was an excellent movie – Ben - IS THE MAN!!! The cast was superb and the acting was outstanding. One thing that shocked me was how Mr. Affleck was not shy about pointed out how our politicians will go to any length to divert blame. To a politician, power trumps human life every time. It also amazes me how Ben was very open about how the powers-to-be in government insist on not learning lessons from past mistakes. One would expect these embarrassing results of ignored embassy calls for added security – would have rendered more proactive future responses. Additionally, I did not realize that the Canadian Government were left holding the international bag on this rescue and were tossed under all wheels of the diplomatic bus. I remember these times somewhat clearly, but vaguely remember this particular incident. I appreciate this movie because it does give this horrible historical event an objective view – I previously thought – impossible of Hollywood. Good Job Mr. Ben Affleck! Congrats to Mr. Afflect for winning a well deserved Oscar - I am totally gob smacked that the Academy would award something the slightest bit critical of the administration of that time. BRAVO"
"joker-4","10","2","5","19 October 2012"," The ""Fake Picture"" becomes a real hit
","In the film ARGO, producer Lester Siegel, played by Academy Award winner Alan Arkin, puts forth real effort into making a fake film a success as a perfect ruse to rescue six wanted Americans hiding at the Canadian Ambassador's residence during the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis. The triple-threat of Ben Affleck (ARGO's Producer-Director-Star) must have channeled the spirit of Siegel (the character for the film was the amalgamation of real-life f/x coordinator Bob Sidell and producer Barry Gellar) as he, along with fellow producers and Hollywood heavies George Clooney and Grant Heslov, created a very real, very memorable film crafted with the utmost of professionalism in detailing the story's plight and rescue.<br/><br/>Affleck ups his game with his third directorial stint and moves away not only from his usual Boston locales but also from the present day. In doing so, he completely immerses the viewer into the period of the film. Alongside the requisite horror show that was the 70s fashion style as well as carefully-placed Star Wars memorabilia – that no doubt brought a tear to the eyes of fanboy friend Kevin Smith – Affleck restaged the storming of the US embassy with the all-too real documentary feel and cast lesser-known actors into the roles of the Americans allowing their performance, not their celebrity status, to carry the show.<br/><br/>Interchanged with this, is the flawless, and at times welcoming, editing of the situation in LA as Affleck's character, CIA operative Tony Mendez, wheels and deals with Hollywood to create a tight cover story, the kind that only Tinseltown can. Affleck portrays LA as an open, bright and aloof place, contrasting the tight, grainy and oppressive situation in Tehran. Modern-day Hollywood itself makes the most subtle of appearances during the film's climax through some of the drama during the airport escape including an almost-forced chase scene. <br/><br/>Backed with John Goodman's smile and Bryan Cranston barking orders like he's on the set of a Glen Larson TV show, Affleck delicately builds the tension leading up to the escape. Much like Cameron's TITANTIC, the ending of the film is known, but the wielding of the personal dynamics, which is just one of reasons that made THE TOWN so incredibly good, proves Affleck's acumen. Affleck provides a fast-paced, suspenseful and, at times, humorous film that makes for great storytelling. Even more importantly, ARGO furthers solidifies Affleck's talent as writer/director and distancing himself from his roles in a host of truly-poor rom-coms and actioneers from the early 2000's."

","I'm always eager to watch a movie based on a true story or history of events. Argo did not disappoint me in depicting a great piece of recent American history that I had absolutely no knowledge of. I was born in 1979 so I was not really familiar with the Iran hostage situation although I had heard a little bit about it in passing. I thought the topic was very relatable and appropriate considering the current events in the world today. Ben Affleck did a remarkable job playing a CIA agent. Ben Affleck also deserves kudos for directing this piece of work. He really paid attention to detail in this film from the style in which the movie was shot to the set and costume design. This is the type of movie I can see high school history teachers playing to their students. I hope this movie gets an Oscar nomination."

","As someone who was only in grade school at the time period when this events of the movie happened I don't remember anything about the rescue but do remember the rest of the hostages and hearing their story every night on the news. I also remembered the girl the Iranians used as their spokes person during that period among other things that showed up in the film. I found it to be an overall brilliant portrayal of the time and events. <br/><br/>*******Spoiler********<br/><br/>Though as Hollywood will they changed the ending up a bit and added some flare that I as understood it didn't actually happen according to and interview I heard on TV with someone who actually lived out the events the movie is about. In any case I found it to be one of the the best movies of the year. Thrilling and edge of your seat stuff as well as drama, humor and an interesting plot and story. Very well written and directed.

So as not to spoil one iota of information, I can only say, what an excellent job of driving you to the edge of your seat as you watch an unfolding of remarkable and yet extremely subtle heroism. Ben Affleck and his crew did an amazing job expressing this story in a fantastic way. I love Alan Arkin and John Goodman with a new fervor and my love of really great, worth-watching-more-than-once movies has been revived.

Other than that the movie was amazing and Ben Affleck did a great job and so did the cast and I would gladly see this movie again!!

","An absolutely amazing film. After watching The Town, I often wondered how Ben Affleck could top that. Well, ARGO did that, and more.

Even though you knew the hostages got out, the film was so well done, that it kept you on the edge of your seat till the very end. <br/><br/>I went into the movie thinking that it would be about the hostages and how they escaped, but Ben was brilliant with his direction of explaining what went into planning and executing the escape. The cast of characters were perfect, with Alan Arkin and John Goodman delivering a performance that you won't soon forget. An all around amazing film. <br/><br/>On a serious note, we always hear when the CIA fails a mission or otherwise screws the pooch. What we don't hear about are the incredible success stories, which are often classified. Bryan Cranston summed it up very simply by saying if they wanted attention, they would have joined the circus. Much like many of our soldiers and agents in arms, their sacrifices for this country will never be known. This is one of the rare instances we get to see what really happened, and Ben Affleck did a fantastic job telling this story. Tony Mendez, I salute you and others like you."

","When I first heard about it, I didn't even give it a second thought,largely because of the title. But then awards season came around and the hype surrounding it made me curious enough.

A big standing O for Mr Affleck<br/><br/>The events the film is based on happened nearly two decades before i was born but the film places you right in the middle of the chaos. Yes I knew I was watching a dramatisation but I felt all the emotions these people went through. And I credit Affleck's seamless direction and the brilliant cast which I have to say was spot on. <br/><br/>Im guessing the sensitivity of the subject drove many to give it negative reviews but I don't think Argo deserves any at all. Its not only Affleck's finest work but one of the finest films I've seen in a long time. Obviously I can not judge what was accurate and what was not but I love when a film not only entertains but also teaches you something in the process. <br/><br/>10 out of 10 and two thumbs up.

"DanRem1221","5","2","6","27 February 2013"," Best Picture Award? Really?
","Okay, before I start this review, I understand that this film was ""based off of a true story"", even though the writer and filmmakers took certain liberties. So maybe some of my complaints are because of those specific reasons in ""being true to the actual events"". But regardless, I was very disappointed with this film.<br/><br/>PROS: Beautifully shot, edited, and directed. Casting was great. The set design and time period was great as well. That's where all of my 5 stars go to.<br/><br/>CONS: Story. Here's why:<br/><br/>I loved how this film started. It was intense. It got me into the story and the build up was great. But as soon as Ben Affleck goes to rescue these people, it immediately became terrible. Maybe since it was a rescue mission, I was expecting action sequences and just pure intensity the entire time as Affleck shepherds these 6 people back home.<br/><br/>But instead, I was treated with a snooze fest. First off, these Irani's are hell bent on finding these 6 missing people. So you mean to tell me that when they go to the airport, Security isn't going to put 2 and 2 together and say, ""Hey, 6 white people just went missing from the Embassy and we have 6 white people here whom we are very suspicious of since their documents don't really add up."" But instead, they let them go! Come on now. They couldn't be that dumb.<br/><br/>So then we get to them getting on the plane. While you have Security finally finding out the truth. So they go and try to stop them. So while Ben and everyone are safe in the plane, Security are in their trucks and police cars following the plane on the runway. One of them pulls out an AK-47 and aims at the wheel. He had the perfect chance to shoot the plane down and stop them. I was anxiously waiting for that. I wanted some struggle to happen. But instead, he decided not to fire and the plane took off.<br/><br/>So then I'm left thinking, ""Okay. Maybe something will happen on the plane. Maybe somehow, someway, there will be some kind of struggle since all of this build up before was for nothing."" Nope. Nothing happens. They all lived happily ever after.<br/><br/>What's even worse is there's absolutely no character development from Affleck's character at all. Sure, he's a phenomenal actor and his acting is superb. But there's no growth. There's no change. He's just standard the entire time.<br/><br/>In all honesty, and this may sound mean, but I think Argo won Best Picture because the Academy wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt since it got snagged at The Golden Globes and people were complaining. Plus, since ""Life of Pi"" won most of the Oscars, people would have been in uproar if it won Best Picture (which it deserved).<br/><br/>In conclusion, I love Affleck and his directing, but this definitely wasn't his best film. I don't even blame him. I blame whoever wrote this."
"bubbabubbalicious","6","2","6","21 February 2013"," The Emperor Has No Clothes
","After hearing all the good reviews, I was very much looking forward to seeing this film. However, after watching it I was confounded as to why this is being considered for best picture. <br/><br/>From the opening scene to nearly the end, this film walks along at a pace that resembles the flat line on a heart monitor. I don't mind films that develop slowly, but they must have brilliant cinematography, compelling characters and some sort of rising tension to keep the audience interested.<br/><br/>The cinematography was routine. The only bright spot were the interesting retro details and the 70's look of the actors. Meanwhile, the characters were in every way the definition of two dimensional. I defy the audience to remember the full names of any of them. And while the movie opens with tension, it then proceeds to just go downhill like a sedative. It's not until the final car ride to the airport does the sleeping movie-goer wake up. <br/><br/>Many have gone on about the lack of historical accuracy, but Hollywood has never cared about that or has the illiterate audience. So that's beside the point because this is fiction. But I do smell a CIA public opinion operation going on. As noted by others here, the CIA coup in 1953 was a joint CIA/MI6 venture that overthrew a democratically elected government and we're still suffering the consequences. How has the CIa become heroic in this movie? You'd think the truth would be a much more interesting story, but I suppose it would require writers and directors with more skill than I saw here. It would also require reexamining other things America doesn't bother with, facts and nonexistent WMDs. However, a movie that really honestly revealed that insidious plot might also go a long way to warming relations, but I digress.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that this film is just not great. I gave it a 6 because it's better than average and mildly entertaining when Arkin or Goodman are talking. Affleck's character, however, was particularly insipid, nearly monotonal and had the effect of lulling me to sleep.<br/><br/>I honestly don't think this movie would have sold more than a couple of thousand tickets if the Canadians had made it. Somehow it's going the Oscar route of that masterpiece called ""Jerry McGuire"". I don't know why anyone bothers with ""Lawrence of Arabia"" when we have these jewels of perfection to watch over and over."

","When I was a child I remember playing out in my garden, on my own because the best fantasies are when we are solitary, I would imagine I was in a shootout or crawling through a blizzard something out of a western or Star Wars.<br/><br/>Argo is an excellent film. What about the politics? The message here is that America should get out of Iran in a hurry, this applies to the current political climate although it is set safely enough in the past. Otherwise the opening explanatory sequence which denounces American interference for the sake of oil is balanced by a condescending(racist) approach to Iranian fanaticism, the politics are half-baked and balanced to please as many people as possible but ultimately glorify America, a child's fantasy to please the paternal nation and the President and those good-at-heart fellows at the CIA. What's wrong with this? Nothing really, the intentions seem good enough and Argo is an excellent film...<br/><br/>Argo brings to mind Super 8 by J.J. Abrams. Both films are about movie-making that acts as a vehicle to bravery and heroic actions in the real world to save people (Americans).<br/><br/>If a patriot makes a work of art which is an expression of their beliefs and prejudices is that propaganda? Is Argo as innocent and childlike as it appears to be? Americans love playing dumb, it allows them to keep their cards to their chest and remain under-estimated, a secret to their success because if your enemies regard you with contempt they are liable to slip up on their own superiority complex. Get out of Iran is a good message though, leave other nations and their oil alone is a good idea, not invading people is an honorable proposition.<br/><br/>In Dog Day Afternoon Al Pacino is trapped in the bank he has robbed for a sex change operation for his lover, the audience is breathlessly dragged through his ordeal and its oppressive atmosphere of suspense and tragedy, in Midnight Express Brad Davis is caught in Turkey trying to smuggle hashish back home, his nightmarish imprisonment is a harrowing succession of miseries that make Romero's zombie films seem like a day at Disneyland. The seventies and early eighties were a time for movies which threw us into nightmare situations with an alarming intensity. The danger infused in these films was rooted in the cold-war era, where the instability of the political world was keenly felt by the post-war generation of filmmakers who had seen the horrors of Vietnam rise up in front of their eyes and create a cultural revolution.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck takes the central role in his well-made, involving and highly suspenseful drama. He gives himself a very good part and acts extremely well in it. This is a vanity project of the kind that Warren Beatty and Robert Redford have made in the seventies; low-key acting and serious dramatic subjects. Despite his skill and poise I felt that Chris Messina in a smaller role threatened to steal the show, maybe all this false modesty has a limit and if you keep underplaying for long enough the audience will want something more substantial. An ego trip is a personal affair in the end it pleases you more than anyone else.<br/><br/>The film-making here is excellent - although, however accurately copied, at the beginning the 'seventies' visual tics (framing the actor way off to one side and then the other way round) are a little distracting - the acting is wonderful, the script full of energy and good lines, the music sensitively composed, the editing is particularly good; especially the montage sequence cutting between the preparation of the fake movie and the real events taking place in Iran.<br/><br/>At heart the theme of popular art being a vehicle to saving lives is both the subject of the film and its purpose. Through the drama played out the audience is sensitized to the dangers of profiteering foreign policy and warned against the arrogance of the colonial spirit by spending two hours in virtual house-arrest. Above all at the end we all just want to get home safely and stay home if we can.<br/><br/>Have you ever dreamed that you were trying to catch a plane and that you couldn't manage and the whole thing turned into a nightmare of suspense and tension? Welcome to Argo Airlines!<br/><br/>Compared to Dog Day Afternoon or Midnight Express Argo is a sort of regressive child-like fantasy where we can escape the worst if we put our faith in the good hands of benign Hollywood producers, make-up men and earnest CIA guys who love their sons and country in equal measure."
"futuremovie-530-428548","10","2","6","18 November 2012"," Three For Three and Improving Along the Way
","It is no secret to the majority of everyone that since my viewing of Ben Affleck's previous directorial efforts, Gone Baby Gone and The Town, I have been anxiously awaiting the release of his latest, Argo. The film is based on the rescue of six American hostages from Iran during the Iranian Hostage Crisis of 1979-1980 by a government sanctioned fake sci- fi film crew. Doesn't that sound like a convoluted, ridiculous, falsified story? Well...it is an outrageously true, declassified mission of the CIA, and best of all it completely surpasses any gripes over inaccuracy, dullness, or preposterousness.<br/><br/>Argo is a demonstration of two strengths that few directors hold these days, the ability to make you feel concerned for its characters and the talent of keeping you on the edge of your seat once the action begins. There is nary a dull moment in the movie aside from early exposition delivered by Insert Any Synonym for Intelligent, Clever, and Lovable Character Here. No opportunity for witty dialogue about how silly this situation is is missed and there is no shortage of memorable lines, especially from Alan Arkin and John Goodman as two Hollywood bureaucrats. <br/><br/>From these memorable lines of witty dialogue, we come to know every character in a positive and negative light. Iran, especially, is revealed as not only as a hive of dangerous revolutionaries and mass manipulators, but also as a home to hundreds of innocent children, men, and women who are just swept up in the ruckus. There are even grown, military men, who upon seeing the storyboards for the fake science fiction film, begin acting out what they imagine the film would sound like. That small amount of clarity for Iran and the probable emotions that laden the film's deceptively deep trenches, are what forced the packed crowd in my theater –elderly women, elderly men, young women, young men, little girls, and little boys—to give at least one conclusive clap at the film's emotive conclusion. <br/><br/>By combining the style of an intelligent thriller, the somber reality of a declassified CIA mission, and the scintillating wit that all films should possess, director Ben Affleck has created a constructive deconstruction of American and Iranian sensibilities toward one another and simultaneously made it provocatively interesting to the general public. For fellow connoisseurs of Affleck's two previous works, this film, at least in my opinion, is superior to both of those fine films. Argo will assuredly, knock on wood, be his ticket to an Oscar nomination in at least a few categories. <br/><br/>NOW GO SEE IT!"

Afflack really knows how to do just that.<br/><br/>The other actors did a superb job with their roles. You actually felt for them, and you could feel the tension that they were feeling. I really loved how they never overreacted to the situation they were in; they didn't scream the whole time, but were silently and impatiently waiting for someone or something to come and try to rescue them. <br/><br/>All the things that were happening around the main cast were well put throughout the movie( like the people who hung from different places.) It all felt very real! ( I would give other examples but then I would give stuff away) most movies can not make the situation feel real, and when that happens it is usually for one scene. This movie ,though, makes it feel real throughout most of the movie! This should be a nominee for best picture at the Oscars!!!"
"meeza","10","2","6","3 November 2012"," Argo! Go Find Yourself an Oscar! Brilliant movie!
","I promise I will not hold you hostage with a myriad of corny puns in my film review of the exhilarating ""Argo"", but then again I am free from pun censorship so just please bear with me. Director Ben Affleck has just catapulted to exemplary filmmaker status with his masterful direction of ""Argo"". The movie is based on a true story during the Iran Hostage Crisis when CIA Agent Tony Mendez masterminded a plan to free six American Hostages held in a Canadian Embassy in Iran by pretending to make a sci-fi movie called ""Argo"" in Iran in order to return them to the states. Hollywood came calling in support of Mendez' Argo cinematic plan of action in the form of assistance from Oscar-Winning Makeup Artist Tony Chambers and Hollywood Producer Lester Siegel. Hollywood Awards will also come calling to Affleck for his utopian direction of ""Argo"". How he was able to incorporate an infamous international crisis and the satire of Hollywood movie-making was phenomenal. Affleck was also solid in his starring performance as Mendez. It will not be justifiable if I don't give Chris Terrio some props for his captivating screenplay of the picture. The supporting acting of ""Argo"" was also spectacular. I am not making this up when I say that John Goodman deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his charismatic performance as Makeup Artist Chambers. And Alan Arkin's comical scene-stealing work as Producer Siegel should produce yet another Best Supporting Actor nomination to A.A.'s resume. And you can never go wrong with having Bryan Cranston in a movie; Cranston plays Mendez' CIA Boss. The steady Bryan has still not broken in a bad acting performance. Many will argue that ""Argo"" played around a bit with the facts of what really happened during that crisis, but one cannot argue that ""Argo"" is one of the best movies of the year and is probably headed for Oscar royalty. So that is the end of my review, which means you have been officially rescued from my Argoistic puns! ***** Excellent"

I'm not going to write anything that might be construed as a spoiler and to actually discuss the plot is, so all I can say is that if you're old enough to remember that fateful day of 11/4/79 when our Embassy was taken over by Iranian thugs,Islamic fanatics and it lasted under Jimmy Carter's watch for 444 days, you will go ape over ""Argo."" Word has it they held 52 Americans as hostages. Think again.<br/><br/>What a great title for this movie. What does ""Argo"" bring to mind? Somethng planetary? How about the name of a spaceship? How about the leader of aliens? And what in heaven's name does all this have to do with Iran under the Ayatollah Khomeini? It's bewildering, isn't it? It certainly bewildered the Iranians.<br/><br/>See this movie. It's absolutely sensational."
"TheSquiss","10","2","6","31 October 2012"," A skin-tingling, nerve-wracking five-star experience, politics aside
","There are some who have shouted very loudly that Argo is nothing more than a well-timed slice of propaganda intended to influence the presidential election. Firstly, I'm sure Barrack Obama is hoping that something more tangible than a mere movie will allow him to keep his home on Pennsylvania Avenue. Secondly, that's a terribly scathing view of the American voters. Okay, we'll ignore the embracing of pseudo-patriotic claptrap Act of Valor and the attacks on Kevin Smith for Dogma but you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Lay your political bias aside for 120 minutes, regardless of whether you're red or blue. Argo serves up the kind of tension that modern day horror meisters dream of. Such a film faces an immediate challenge in that most of the audience already knows the outcome, although that didn't dampen the fervor for Titanic or the tension created in Bryan Singer's Valkyrie.<br/><br/>But like Valkyrie, it doesn't matter that you know the result of the audacious plan in Argo although, if your USA/Iran historical knowledge is patchy and this episode passed you by, perhaps it's better to maintain your ignorance and watch as it unfolds. Let me know how it hits you and we can compare experiences from each other's perspective.<br/><br/>In 1979, in the aftermath of the Shah's exile and the rise of Ayatollah Khomeini, the American embassy in Tehran was overthrown and fifty-two hostages were taken. Six, however, escaped and were given refuge by the Canadian ambassador. With the situation volatile to say the least, the CIA floundered looking for an escape route for the six before being presented with the 'best bad idea': smuggle them out as the production crew of a fictitious movie called Argo.<br/><br/>The story is remarkable. If we didn't know it was true, who would believe such a ridiculous, life-threatening escapade could be undertaken? This film of that story is absolutely riveting. At times it is genuinely very funny, both for the dialogue and the absurdity of what unfolds in Hollywood and Iran. More often it is terrifying. My skin prickled with the fear and tension in a way I haven't experienced since, oh, probably The Exorcist. The danger most of the participants are in and the likelihood of a brutal death is palpable even from the safety of a cinema seat and I found myself desperately hoping, wishing and willing them on, incapable of stepping back and viewing Argo as simply a film to which I knew the conclusion. Argo is not a film one can sit back and watch, it is an experience that sucks you into its midst.<br/><br/>This is Ben Affleck's third feature as director after the superb Gone Baby Gone and equally impressive The Town and yet again he proves to be a far finer director than he is an actor. That said, as Tony Mendez, the man behind the madcap idea of Argo, he proves he is more than capable of holding a film and commanding our attention on both sides of the camera. Affleck is this generation's Clint Eastwood or Sean Penn and his work is proving to be of an extremely high calibre.<br/><br/>The cast is superb and greatly varied, in some instances the likenesses to their real-life counterparts is almost uncanny. There isn't a standout performance amongst the hostages but neither is there a character that takes the limelight. They form a desperate ensemble careering towards mortality while supporting, laughing and bickering like children who are being forced into actions they have no say over. It is impossible to judge their petulance or negativity when the reality of their predicament is so obvious.<br/><br/>Alan Arkin as Lester Siegel is the light but cutting relief in a film filled with characters starring into an horrific abyss and John Goodman completes the double act in his most enjoyable performance since The Big Lebowski, proving he's worthy of more than the light pap he so often finds himself in. Bryan Cranston is a revelation for those who know him only as Hal from Malcolm in the Middle. The strain is evident in his face and the emotional turmoil he is enduring is barely masked by his occasional smiles and blatantly obvious when he momentarily allows the dam to burst.<br/><br/>The greatest delight with Argo is the sense that it is real, that we are part of the dangerous fiasco and not merely observers from the future. For those who stay, there is a lovely touch at the end with photos of the 'reality' paired with stills from the film as the credits roll. These, like the actors playing the parts, are strikingly similar and the horror of the situation is subtly emphasized.<br/><br/>Who needs schlock fantasy horror when you can enjoy a genuinely chilling horror of the reality?<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk<br/><br/>Like the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG"
"filmcritickevin","10","2","6","28 October 2012"," Better than ""The Town""
","Ben Affleck has made some excellent dramas and thrillers over the course of his career, and Argo is no exception. This true story of the joint American-Canadian operation to extract six American diplomats from revolutionary Iran is one of the best historical dramas of the 21st Century.<br/><br/>The film opens with a narrative description of the events which led to the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979, and then displays a gritty and realistic depiction of the occupation of the U.S. Embassy. In spite of the 52 that spent 444 days in captivity, six escaped and were taken in by the Canadian Ambassador to Iran. When the C.I.A. finds out about this, exfiltration expert Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) proposes an idea to get them out of the country. His plan is to make the Iranian government think the hostages are Canadian filmmakers there to scout locations for a movie. Once he manages to get approval, he contacts producers Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) and John Chambers (John Goodman), friends of his who work for a Hollywood studio. The fake film they schedule to make is Argo, a science-fiction picture set in the Middle East. With the help of this crew and his partner Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston), Mendez embarks on the most daring mission of his life to save these men and women.<br/><br/>This is one of several films Affleck has both directed and starred in; but what makes it even more gripping than ones like 2010's The Town is how it delivers the story with an incredibly emotional appeal, and a tone that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats throughout.<br/><br/>Chris Terrio's script provides the basis for Affleck's artistic direction. In spite of this being a Hollywood thriller, Terrio puts such emphasis on his characters that the action itself proves to be a less significant component of the film's success. While the main story is centered around the mission, there are some great subplots involving the hostages, as well as Mendez's relationship with his wife and son. From the opening sequence to the climactic finale, audiences are immersed in both the characters and the distorted world which they find themselves in.<br/><br/>From a cinematic standpoint, it's quite remarkable how Affleck makes you feel a part of the story. By implementing actual footage from the events depicted into the film, and at appropriate times, history is brought alive. Using primarily low-key lighting and a good number of close-up shots, the dramatic plot-line is made all the more intense. This is a dismal atmosphere in a time of fear and confusion, and Affleck utilizes a wide range of elements to make viewers connect with these characters' lives on an emotional level.<br/><br/>Acting wise, it couldn't have been better casted. Cranston and Affleck embrace their roles with a spirit of fierce determination. There's a scene at the end after the hostages have made it out, where Cranston's display of joy and relief is very reminiscent of Ed Harris' performance in Ron Howard's Apollo 13. Goodman and Arkin also give great performances, as their characters provide the film with a humorous element, while still maintaining serious objectives and motivations. Other noteworthy actors include Victor Garber as Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor, and Kyle Chandler as C.I.A. operative Hamilton Jordan.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is nothing short of breathtaking, presenting itself as a unique and brilliantly constructed thriller, after a series of flashy and unoriginal action movies over the last few years. Two thumbs way up. <br/><br/>Note: This review can be found on my blog: www.kevinschaefercinema.blogspot.com"
"StevePulaski","10","2","6","21 October 2012"," Affleck continues to rebuild his career with another home-run
","Now here is a thriller I'm willing to catch in theaters. I weary so quickly of action films employing stiff quick cuts, minimal character development, and macro events taken with micro focus, and am constantly tiring of seeing characters return in a sequel to a film that shouldn't really need one. Ben Affleck's third directorial effort, Argo, is a cinematic triumph; a film so grand, so impacting, and so implausible that it's undoubtedly one of the tensest pictures of the year.<br/><br/>It's 1979, in the dawn of the Iranian Revolution. We open with archival footage of news clips and attack footage of the time, and are quickly presented with anarchic unrest outside the gates of the U.S. embassy in Tehran. Iranian revolutionaries are disgusted at the United States' support of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah at the time, and begin to break into the concourse of the embassy and take most of the workers as hostages.<br/><br/>Lucky enough to escape are six employees, who hide out in the home of Ken Taylor (Victor Garber), the Canadian ambassador, while the State Department devises a plan to return the hostages safely to America. Brought in on a whim, CIA specialist Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) is called to evaluate multiple plans to return the hostages, and after watching Battle for the Planet of the Apes with his son on TV, he believes he has it.<br/><br/>He proposes the preposterous idea that if they can convince the Iranian public that the six escapees are a Canadian film crew scouting for ""exotic locations"" in the country, that they could potentially meet up with the six, and return them safely. Tony quickly gets in touch with Hollywood make-up artist, John Chambers (John Goodman) and film producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), who hop on board with the idea of creating a fake film, even though you can see they find the idea to be highly questionable and, above all, dangerous.<br/><br/>After paging through screenplays, they settle on a film called ""Argo"" as their fake film, a science-fiction film about God-knows-what. When asked by an executive what ""Argo"" actually means and how it is relevant to the film, Lester replies, with much frustration, ""I don't know, Argo f*** yourself,"" a line that will be continuously used in the film. That's right, as surprising as it is, Argo loosens its belt and concocts a witty, sometimes uproariously funny screenplay, not afraid to dive into cheeky humor or sometimes come close to tugging at the heart-strings.<br/><br/>Affleck becomes fully immersed in this story, from a directing standpoint and an acting standpoint. He is barely recognizable in his role, with shaggy hair and a scruffy beard, a look that fits the macho figure himself, yet surrounded by a group of mainly unknown actors portraying the hostages, he becomes one with them, and his presence doesn't feel forced or abruptly out of place. It is simply fitting. His supporting cast, also serving as his film crew, Arkin and Goodman, show audiences why they should be credited highly, with serious performances when need be and comedy pleasantly punctuated throughout.<br/><br/>The story's darkest points come in the latter-half of the film, and I dare not spoil them, but I'll propose this question in the meantime that I hope some will seriously contemplate; what if you had to completely change your identity and memorize precise details that rewrote your life? What if you forgot just one detail or did not recite it fast enough, your life would be ended or in far greater jeopardy than you could imagine? Behind the camera, this is easily Affleck's most uncompromising, incredibly entertaining piece of work; flawlessly directed, craftily edited, acted to near-perfection, written with wit and heart, and keenly glossed with the look and feel of an intoxicating and fulfilling espionage from the 1970's. The film-grain adds to the dated-effect this movie wants to achieve, and with precise detailing in the cinematography and aesthetics (right down to the original Warner Bros. logo at the beginning), it is clear that Argo is a meticulously crafted, remarkable picture filled to the brim with everything a traditional moviegoer and a full-fledged cinephile could ask for. It's one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>NOTE: I strongly advise viewers to stay well into the credits. We see pictures of the real six escapees alongside their screen-counterparts, and we also see scenes alongside the real-life images to prove that director Affleck, writer Chris Terrio, and the rest of the crew went to mold the film into a truly accurate piece of art.<br/><br/>Starring: Ben Affleck, John Goodman, Alan Arkin, and Victor Garber. Directed by: Ben Affleck."
"cultfilmfan","6","2","6","18 October 2012"," Argo
","Argo is being hailed as one of the best films of the year and has a very good chance of being nominated for many Academy Awards next year and maybe even winning Best Picture. When the film had ended in the theatre in which I saw it, most of the audience applauded, but I did not and to be completely honest, I do not get all the hype and praise that this film is getting. Yes, technically it is a well made film, but to say anything else other than that and then I would be lying. Critics have called it riveting from start to finish, but I actually found the film dragged quite a bit and to me was quite dull. I also didn't think the mix of the scenes of the characters in Hollywood and then jumping to the hostages in Iran worked. It did not work because in these Hollywood scenes they are mostly played for laughs and supposed to be humorous with Alan Arkin's character and his foul mouth and John Goodman's character who is kind of oblivious to the Hollywood scene. This all was supposed to be funny and whether I laughed, or not was not the issue, but I found having a good part of the film being like that and then going over and trying to be all serious and tense with the hostage situation in Iran did not feel suitable. I didn't find the film could find the right balance between the humour in the Hollywood scenes and the more melodramatic and political scenes taking place in Iran. It all felt quite out of place and I didn't feel it complimented, or followed up each scene well because of it. It just felt awkward and like poor screen writing. Another problem I had was that I found a lot of the characters, especially the hostages to be quite smug and arrogant. I really have no idea whether this was intentional on the film's behalf, or not, but I found that they got on my nerves after awhile and because of that I could not relate, or feel any empathy, or compassion towards them which is a big flaw for a film like this because I think the film wanted you to be very concerned about these hostages and by giving them more personality and allowing us to care for them, I think the tension and our relationship and attitudes about them would be a lot different and I think if they had done that, the film would have impacted me more. I know it was my own choice to go see Argo, and pay the almost ten dollars I spent to see it, but I have to admit that these type of stories are just getting tiresome to me. Almost everyday on the news I see terror in the world and different regions against each other and a lot of hatred and violence going around. I watch it on the news to see what is happening in the world and to keep up on current events, but at the same time it does get to me from time to time and sometimes I am flat out tired of seeing all this negativity and hatred towards one another. Because of that, Argo felt to me like a news story I had seen one too many times this, or any other week recently and I just was not in the mood to see a two hour movie about it. That may have been my fault walking into a movie like this, but I have to be honest and say my opinions about it. There were also parts of the film that felt overly glamorous to appeal to a wide audience and a lot of it seemed to be made in such a way that it would cater to people and especially Oscar voters. Oscar voters love films like this and going by the way the audience I was with reacted, they did too. However to me it just felt forced and like it was trying to glamorize everything a little too much for those miniature bald statues. I do commend Ben Affleck for trying to make a serious film and I think he has come a long way in his career and he showed great promise with his last directorial effort The Town, but Argo simply did not work for me."
"Molly2903","9","2","6","12 October 2012"," A chilling dramatization with funny moments
","Ben Affleck did an amazing job directing this movie and telling the story of the 6 hostages who escaped the US Embassy during the 1979 Iranian Revolution and US hostage crisis and the CIA agent who rescued them. The imagery of the protesters is chilling, as one thinks about current affairs in Libya and Syria. Even more remarkable is thinking about the Iranian revolution and its impact on the US long before the advent of the internet and social media. The ensemble cast is strong and the performances elicit the gamut of emotions that all parties must have felt during the crisis and the Argo project. There is lots of foul language, so be prepared for those moments. In his performance as Tony Menendez, Affleck illustrates what the life of a CIA agent leading covert operations must be like. Alan Arkin and John Goodman are wonderful and funny as the ""Hollywood men"". Victor Garbor delivers a poignant performance as the Canadian Prime Minister showing the emotional balance between empathy and fear."

I'm not going to whine about it like other reviews on here, as I do understand it's the decision of the writer and director, but it would have not been a huge effort to add a few scenes to show some appreciation.

"baranturkmen","6","1","2","25 March 2017"," Very American, very Hollywoodish, full of stereotypes and clichés, it gets worse when you read the real story, otherwise a watchable film BUT best picture award??
","I had refused to watch Argo thinking that it would be a typical American film but after five years, I thought why not, let's see some action. I suppose the first thing non-Americans would notice is that it's immersed in stereotypes and clichés, making you say ""oh come on!"" many times. The depiction of Iranians, the CIA, Americans kicking ass as usual... When you read about the real story, a big ""come on!!"" comes out of your mouth. Either Ben Affleck really wanted to reflect things that way or simply applied the procedure for success by US standards. Now, if you just ignore all of these, you might watch Argo as a pastime BUT best picture award? Honestly, before watching the film, I vaguely remembered about Oscars but had no idea that it won the best picture award. How is that possible? Life of Pi was among the nominees that year and Argo won?? Affleck's formula seems to have worked out."
"areatw","7","1","2","8 January 2017"," Well-made, if not totally accurate
","I see a lot of people are unhappy about the historical accuracy of 'Argo'. As someone who knows little about the story behind this film, I feel unable to comment on if or just how inaccurate it is. What I can say though is that, as a piece of entertainment, 'Argo' is well-made and interesting.<br/><br/>I liked the informative start to the film - I assume that bit was accurate at least? It makes for a refreshing change to the many biographical films that give little or no background to the events that occur and instead rely on the existing knowledge of the audience.<br/><br/>'Argo' is a well-made and, at times, unexpectedly funny film. Historical inaccuracies aside, 'Argo' is solid is every department, with some especially impressive acting performances."
"filipemanuelneto","3","1","2","20 December 2016"," The cinema bleaching history.
","When Hollywood decides to make a movie based on true historical facts I personally am immediately afraid of the result. This fear is based on the overwhelming ability of writers and directors to manipulate facts and subvert them in the name of art, dramatic effect and box office. Thus, there are many films allegedly based on ""true historical facts"" that have little relation to them, however profitable or spectacular they may be. Unfortunately, ""Argo"" is one more that will join this long list of infamy.<br/><br/>To begin, the deposed Shah of Iran is portrayed as an eccentric and bloodthirsty dictator. Its not entirely true: he certainly had his faults and mistakes, but he was a modern leader with a pro-Western vision of his country, who sought to reform Iranian politics and society, redistribute land, grant political rights to women (he even abolished the compulsory use of the Islamic veil) and solidify its rising democracy. It was these king of changes that led to his deposition, by conservative factions based on a strongly old-fashioned clergy that controls the country until our days. I also discovered that the rescue operation pictured was actually a joint effort of countries led by Canadian agents, not just an American operation made with the consent of Canada. The CIA only helped. Given these data, its easy to see that, under the traditional excuse ""hey, we're changing some things for dramatic purposes"", the film actually rewrites history, totally distorting the facts on which it is based. Cinema can adapt, change things or add others, but it must respect true. Going to the point of distorting the truth is always wrong.<br/><br/>From an exclusively technical point of view, putting aside the story and the script, it's a very good movie, well done and enjoyable. Ben Affleck plays the lead role and gives the audience a restrained, serious and consistent performance. The re-creation of the old siege scenes at the American embassy was also very well done, though it only serves to accentuate the wrong idea that the film tells a true story. The costumes and scenery are excellent and the soundtrack fulfills its role satisfactorily."
"nvanvalleygirl","8","1","2","20 April 2015"," Entertaining, but not riveting
","Great film. Disappointed though by historical inaccuracies at the expense of others reputations. The Brits did not turn away the Americans and the Kiwis even helped drive the Americans to the Airport. The Canadian role was far more involved in reality. The real life participants of this adventure, have clarified story variance from truth - even the Americans were disappointed on how some story points didn't honor those that saved their lives. I get how the climax had to hold Hollywood excitement and thriller pace. Just disappointed that real heroes not only not honored, but in some cases maligned and lesser heroic involvement was exalted falsely! Not The Last King of Scotland..."
"pennyelenabooks","3","1","2","13 February 2015"," I expected more
","The movie is based on true events, on how America and Canada worked together to rescue six hostages in Iraq. So, I heard many things about this movie, plus the Oscar nominations were very impressive. And so I expected a great deal from it, which was a terrible mistake from my part. The story is good and strong as it is, but it was presented by the CIA agent's view and not as much from the six people hiding in the Canadian embassy. I loved the last part of the movie, which was thrilling, making you fear of what is going to happen and if everybody is going to synchronize. However, the music at some points it was irrelevant, the scenes were not following one another smoothly, but the chronological train was completely off and the non stop switching of the location was confusing. In addition, some scenes that looked like comic books or documentary were okay for one maybe two times to be used, but not for all the movie. Other than that, the story line was okay and it was exaggerating, and so I am giving Argo a 3 out of 10."
"JaydoDre","7","1","2","31 December 2014"," Good.
","Argo is a good movie, but it is a question whether or not Argo harbors anything special.<br/><br/>This is a movie about a Canado-American mission to exfiltrate 6 US embassy workers during the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979. It is a somewhat original subject matter, but there has already been a direct-to-TV movie about it.<br/><br/>The performances are good but none stand out, except perhaps for John Goodman who appears in the movie only for a short time. The dialogue is solid too and has a few humorous phrases, but not brilliant in any particular way.<br/><br/>Cinematography is also good. The makers nail the late 70s aesthetic, like haircuts and glasses and cars.<br/><br/>The camera work is solid and it seems designed to increase the feeling that the viewer is there, with a lot of close ups and slight shaking caused by camera being held in the hands a lot. Shots of things quickly passing by make you feel anxious like one of the hiding embassy workers. It successfully creates the tension, which is what this movie is all about.<br/><br/>The same tension is unfortunately damaged for anyone who knows the history of the Iranian hostage crisis and therefore knows how the movie ends. There is a part of the movie when the whole operation is called off. Oh no! How will they ever?..Oh, right...<br/><br/>It is like the movies invites viewers who are politically interested enough to watch a political thriller like this one but not interested enough to have checked the history of the event. It would be better if these story was completely fictional so that the tension could have remained undisturbed by reality.<br/><br/>This is ironic because the movie takes a number of freedoms with the actual story, like giving most of the credit to the Americans for the mission, which actually makes the movie part fiction. Should have gone all the way...<br/><br/>Having said that, it is a testament to this movie's quality that the movie still manages to make the story interesting and tense enough.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise of this film is perhaps that such a good movie could be directed and acted by Ben Affleck, who had left a bad impression in some people's minds with some of his previous acting jobs, but this surprise alone does not merit a great movie.<br/><br/>Argo is then a fairly tense, well paced and well directed film. That is all."
"braddugg","6","1","2","8 September 2014"," A well made film that thrives on strategy, and luck and a bit of calmness and composure.
","A well made film that thrives on strategy, and luck and a bit of calmness and composure.<br/><br/>Sure, Ben Affleck has come a long way from a Good Will Hunting Script to this film named ARGO. Don't ask me why was it named ARGO, and why the caption reads, the movie is fake, the mission is real. If you want to know better see the film. There are a few things I liked and a few things I disliked about this. <br/><br/>The things I liked are the production design of setting up a 1970's troubled Iran and making us believe how real the whole film was, it showed a great depiction of the Iran Hostage crisis. The sound was great too. The performances by almost everyone were great and I loved John Goodman and above all Ben Affleck as Tony Mendez. Now, this is a real story so we are bound and handcuffed not to disagree with a few things, like how come a sudden idea sprung up to Tony and how is it approved by CIA. It happened and so we see. All, in all, I liked the sound, production, casting and acting.<br/><br/>Now the things I disliked was creation of a forced drama in the climax where they are caught then relieved again a fact comes to the rebels notice and they rush to stop the plane. I did not think that cinematically, it was so very needed we do not have to make a climax out of nothing. In reality, a call would have stopped the plane from take off. So this is where the director Ben Affleck needs to improve, yes undoubtedly he made a good film but if he wants to be more real and less cinematic, he needs to take out a few formulaic things. The direction has indeed faltered in few places like factually, 1950's depiction of the speeches, but I did give in to all the factual faults just that it was a bit more simpler and bit more restrained. Even the rushing up of getting an idea of making a film and getting an approval was not to my complete liking, had that been more restraint and more thought of, I would have loved that. <br/><br/>By far, this comes as one of the better movies of the year and what it got is an Oscar, not sure if that actually deserved coz I like Amour more than any other film of last year as I saw till now. But surely, barring Amour, this may have been the best bet with what it had, it had a realistic appeal like that of Hurt Locker, an entertaining element like that of a King's Speech, where our hero is relieved from what he has achieved. So it's good good and good but I am not sure if it's a great film, I have so many questions in my own tiny mind that keep getting back and asking me, is this the movie of the year and the answer I got after watching this not once, but twice is that ""I don't think so, there are better movies than this for sure"" But who needs my likes and dislikes, the majority rules this world and since the majority feels that this is the best movie for them, this won the accolades all over. Mind you, this a thrilling documentary nevertheless and if you see it as a documentary film, then this is as fine as it gets, but as a dramatic film, it falls shirt a bit only.<br/><br/>Ben, sure boy you did a great job, but I wanna see you in a better director's hat than this one. I am going with 3/5 for a sure good film but I better hope for a better film next time from this director."

","I was expecting to like this Oscar winning film but sadly felt more than a little disappointed by it. It started well enough with some tense scenes as the US embassy was stormed. However it quickly went downhill after that and turned into a bit of a bore. <br/><br/>I usually like Ben Affleck but I wasn't convinced by him in this at all. The rest of the cast are merely adequate. I wish they had concentrated on the hostages in the embassy rather than the 6 holed up in the Canadian embassy. <br/><br/>There are a few tense scenes nearing the end however these are nowhere near enough and I just didn't find the story riveting at all. <br/><br/>As on Oscar winner I expected much much more than this mundane film.

At this point since believability had gone out of the window I thought it was going to go Die Hard with Affleck fighting an Iranian military man on the wing of the plane <br/><br/>To make up for it, at the end of the movie as a cherry on top Affleck gets back with his wife with American flag waving in the background<br/><br/>All of these extra dramatisations were unnecessary and spoilt what would have otherwise been a very good movie"
"waitvoidoid","2","1","2","24 January 2014"," Ignorance Bliss For Hollywood
","This film is not only inaccurate, but implicitly racist. I was hoping, while watching, that the supposed 'liberal' Hollywood filmmakers would shed some historical light as to why tensions between Iran and the USA are so poisonous. Apart from mentioning some context at the beginning of the film, the Iranians depicted throughout appear as 2 dimensional characters with an irrational hatred of 'the west'.<br/><br/>I spoke to an Iranian friend to hear his take on the film. He told me that Iranians in the film do not even speak with the correct grammar. So Affleck and co. not only depicted the Iranians as aggressive and irrational but couldn't even accurately portray the way in which they speak. My friend also told me that this film is just a modern application of Said's 'orientalism'. It was hard to disagree.<br/><br/>Technically the film is above average. The performances, editing, camera work and script all achieve a thrilling movie experience. But although it is entertaining it is far more harmful in a cultural context. It propagates myopic bigoted views about Iran and does not once (bar a fleeting opening statement) scrutinize the United States' criminal behaviour towards that country.<br/><br/>'Argo' once again reinforces the view that Hollywood, particularly 'liberal Hollywood' figures/activists like George Clooney, have no historical understanding about places like Iran. It is not surprising Hollywood makes these movies; the only surprise is how many seemingly sensible people applauded the film, without questioning the dangerous stereotypes or inaccurate historical context."

","The big problem with Hollywood 'story telling' in the 21st century, is that in the present age, we can easily check the truth of a historical incident online, without wandering home ignorant to the facts! When I saw this film I was sceptical, just because of Ben Affleck's participation (I mean, Spielberg, he ain't!) But my fears were confirmed within the first 20 minutes, yes it must have been scary at the time, but hello, even the crazy Ayatollah was not going to do more than try to humiliate the Yanks a little...his followers were not ever going to massacre any Europeans or Americans, he would have known it would have spelt disaster for his country! But more than this, I was aware of the true story of this time, and I was treated to a shameless work of fiction which dismissed The Canadian assistance and totally ignored the British help even to the point of saying 'The Brits and Kiwi's won't help us'! Erm...not true!, As for the escape scene, the reality is the fugitives were brought tickets and got on a plane..simple, there was no band of US hungry assassins out to capture anyone!"
"jackasstrange","6","1","2","1 December 2013"," Slightly better than Zero Dark Thirty... but still a weak film
","Argo is alongside Zero Dark Thirty the most undeserving and weakest films in the Oscars, and is not hard to understand why. As i already made a review about the horrible Zero Dark, i will make a review about this one now, explaining how it also was a fail film.<br/><br/>Argo is a generic film when it comes to the cinematography subject, subject that i highly appreciate and definitely adds a lot of meanings and expands the limits of any film. If well utilized, of course. So, -1 point. The soundtrack is barely noticeable, but i guess that this kind of film has no business in that aspect anyways.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty average. The dialogs are ridiculous sometimes, no offenses. A quick and effective example would be the analogy made by Affleck's character in the reunion table, near the beginning of the film, comparing his mission with an abortion. That was proud of universal sorriness. Definitely ridiculous_ again, no offenses_. <br/><br/>Some events are ridiculously dramatized as well. In that aspect, it is very similar to his fellow film about CIA in the year, because both of them depicts the agents doing seriously anti- professionalism actions which threatened lives of people. That is something that wont happen in real life. No way a so carefully managed corporation as CIA would allow his employees to act in such a passionate way. A example would be Brian Cranston and Affleck's characters, who contributed to the rescue of the refugees simply by doing stupid emotional decisions. That is ridiculous. <br/><br/>Also, the constant TV news popping out and fading almost every time were super annoying. It looked like the film was trying constantly to remind us how it was based in true Informations and how it has historical receipts. That was pretty stupid, and prejudiced the film.<br/><br/>I do not recommend this film, it don't adds nothing that you can't found out for yourself in a fast research in wikipedia. 6.0/ 10"

As USA is having deep conflict with Iran, it was a good time to release a movie, which could damage the image of Iran further. We have seen this trend in Past , Rambo doing action in Vietnam.<br/><br/>The Argo is based on a True Story. Honestly, i believe, the story moves slow with no thriller, no suspense and the quality of Acting is poor. Ben is a nice actor, but in this movie the element of true entertainment and quality work is missing by keeping in Mind that this Movie has won Oscar.<br/><br/>It's a average movie with great hype."
"faterson","6","1","2","6 July 2013"," Furthest-Fetched Close-Escape Movie Ever? Made Implausible & Lacking Depth, But Exciting to Watch
","OK, I get it: this was supposed to be a ""close escape"" movie. Still, there is only so far you can stretch this to remain plausible; and because the creators of _Argo_ overstepped that boundary, they have taken pains to point out repeatedly, both at the beginning and at the end of the movie (see the comparative photographs), that the movie was based on ""real events"". Yes, it is; but the sheer amount of ""last-second"" coincidences and a hair's breadth escape routes, heaped one upon another as the action of _Argo_ unfolds, is finally too much to take. Does anyone *really* believe that President Carter telegraphed his OK for the rescue operation at the very moment (minutes, if not seconds) when the 6 escapees awaited the confirmation of their flight reservations at the Swissair counter? An overabundance of such scenes makes watching _Argo_ feel like watching a fairy-tale, rather than a reconstruction of what actually happened.<br/><br/>Still, this is a Hollywood movie, and so, on a technical level, the recreation of the period detail of Iran (and the US government premises) of the late 1970s and 1980 -- the awful fashion, hair-styles, ridiculously large eye-glasses, car makes, and whatnot -- is pitch-perfect, wonderfully faithful. You really feel as if attending the frightening scenes of the post-anti-Shah-revolution Iran in person; you feel as if present in the chaotic streets of Teheran, or in the ""8 thousand years old"" Teheran bazaar (dubbed by the Istanbul bazaar during the shooting of _Argo_).<br/><br/>The movie is also laudably ambivalent about the role of American policies in Iran and the Middle East. Yes, American diplomats and CIA agents are the heroes of _Argo_ -- but US policies as such are not. If anything, they are shown as immoral, in supporting a ruthless leader in a foreign country without regard for the consequences on ordinary citizens. That that ruthless leader may have been replaced by a possibly even worse regime, does not really excuse the US conduct. Such policies may have been ""the best bad solution"" (to quote a piece of _Argo_ dialogue), but that is hardly exonerating.<br/><br/>Watching _Argo_ feels like watching an enacted documentary, with lots of implausibility thrown in for dramatic effects. Also, _Argo_ is one-dimensional: if you're looking for a ""pure suspense"" movie, _Argo_ gets pretty close to that ideal. The personal-life, or family-related scenes in _Argo_ are minimalistic and cliché-ridden; virtually no inner life of the characters is displayed or believably examined; how many times have we seen a hero return to his/her estranged partner at the end of a movie, only to be lovingly embraced in a happy ending? <br/><br/>The actors' performances are adequate and workman-like, enhancing the movie's realistic side and helping us overlook all the implausible plot twists. The one actor outshining everyone in _Argo_ is Alan Arkin: a constant delight to watch as a goofy Hollywood producer setting up a fake movie.<br/><br/>Finally, is this truly the best movie made on planet Earth in 2012? By no stretch of imagination. Even if we were to restrict this deliberation to (predominantly) English-speaking movies (which the Academy -- infuriatingly -- seems to be doing by default, anyway), it would be difficult to claim that _Argo_ was the best thing the year 2012 came up with. Rather, in awarding the ""Best Movie"" Oscar to _Argo_, Hollywood has shown its bias again. In crowning _Argo_, Hollywood is basically congratulating *itself*; Hollywood is *not* free from bias in judging _Argo_, because Hollywood itself is (partly) _Argo_'s subject matter. Whereas Hollywoood congratulating Hollywood may have been justified in earlier similar instances (_Singin' in the Rain_ readily comes to mind), heaping accolades on _Argo_ seems as far-fetched as many of _Argo_'s plot elements. It's as if Hollywood wished to proclaim, loud and clear: ""See? Hollywood is not just about empty, brainless, fake entertainment {see the wonderful fake fighting rehearsal scene disrupted by the Alan Arkin character}. Our movie-making skills can be truly useful in the real world, too!"" Yes, that's true -- but that alone does not make a movie the best of the year, and proclaiming _Argo_ to be that can be seen as Hollywood trying to ""ease its conscience"".<br/><br/>Bottom line: _Argo_ is an excellent suspense movie made on the highest professional level, but woefully overrated -- no landmark in the art of movie-making; although every movie receiving a ""Best Movie"" Oscar should be just that."
"jjgooner","6","1","2","1 July 2013"," Average Thriller
","Argo<br/><br/>**1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>120 mins/ 15<br/><br/>Cast: Ben Affleck, Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, John Goodman, Victor Garber, Tate Donavon<br/><br/>Director: Ben Affleck<br/><br/>Plot: CIA agent, Tony Mendez, begins production on a fake movie, so that he can enter Iran and rescue six American fugitives who are wanted by Iranian terrorists.<br/><br/>JJ's Verdict: For some reason, I was expecting Argo to be incredible and one of the best films I've ever seen. It is a good thriller but I was disappointed, considering the Oscar win and hugely positive reception surrounding it. If it were my choice, I probably wouldn't have even nominated Argo. <br/><br/>Argo starts off well with a prologue into Iran's history and then depiction of the attacks on the U.S Embassy. These opening scenes are very intense and gritty, and this tone continues throughout. The film's design is also very good and definitely knows it is in the 80's with slick suits and cool moustaches. The script is also witty and full of some great industry in-jokes and a very funny cameo from Jack Nicholson. However, my real disappointment with Argo is the characters. There are far too many characters in the film, played by not very well-known actors so become hard to follow throughout. Another stumbling block is that many of these characters look too similar to each other, which makes them even harder to follow. This isn't so say the acting is bad, just decent. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck, who I usually like in films, is incredibly one-dimensional in this film and the only time he ever steps out of this, is when the script forces him to, not by his own accord. His character, Tony Mendez, is so dull and throughout the film, Affleck puts on this highly unlikeable miserable stare for no apparent reason. The only bright sparks in Argo's acting, are John Goodman and Alan Arkin who play members of the film industry. They definitely have some of the films funnier lines but you can't really eel they are putting much effort in as all they are doing is playing themselves with little emotion. And once Mendez departs for Iran, you don't even see their characters until the final few minutes. <br/><br/>Although his acting isn't up to scratch, Affleck directs this one really well. Maybe he was just too busy worrying about the film to notice his wooden acting. Affleck keeps the tension going extremely high and rarely lets the film stop for a breath. I does come in for a great Americana triumphant finish but you can't help thinking; because the writer mixed fact with fiction, was there any way they weren't going to escape from Iran?"
"Sergeant_Tibbs","7","1","2","26 June 2013"," Although it blends its humour and tension very well, it ends up compromising to the point where it's just average. True or not, the ending doesn't satisfy what it builds up.
","Ben Affleck has been slowly redeeming himself the past 5 years with his turn behind the camera with Gone Baby Gone, The Town and now Argo, one of the most hyped up films of the year to the point where it's a serious Best Picture contender. The only thing I think it potentially deserves is the screenplay which is excellent. But in execution, it's a really rough around the edges film, with (deliberately) sloppy cinematography and editing for the 70s feel, but it sacrifices tension and clarity too often. While it does a good job of delivering its exposition, sometimes it's at such quick pace that it's difficult to follow every piece. However, it does a great job of feeling both intimate and cinematic, feeling like a human story and a politically important story. I was very excited for this film earlier this year from the promo pictures and the promise of Bryan Cranston in second billing, but the trailer had me very worried that the thriller aspects and the comedy romp aspects would not gel together.<br/><br/>Fortunately, in the film, it's utterly seamless and they blend together very appropriately but it's the little parts that don't feel like they add up which hold the film back. Many times I was thinking ""this could be even more tense."" It is a very good film, but it does feel too middle of the road and playing it safe when it could've been bold. The climax was something in particular I found unsatisfying as they built it up a lot and never paid it off adequately. It does seem that Ben Affleck has been enjoying a lot of TV lately as it was fun to TV celebrity spot. Scoot McNairy is a particularly great performance and was completely invisible as I didn't recognise him from when I loved him in Killing Them Softly. Argo does have its merits and ties together very well, even if it never feels like it touches its potential. Lets not give Affleck too big a confidence boost just yet or he'll continue not fulfilling his potential.<br/><br/>7/10"
"hall895","7","1","2","22 June 2013"," Thriller which should be more thrilling
","Argo is based on a true story. Somewhat loosely based it will turn out. Director Ben Affleck bends some historical truths in an attempt to make his film more exciting. The story of the rescue of six American diplomats from Iran during the 1979 hostage crisis is certainly compelling. But it turns out the real-life story, ironically involving a fake Hollywood movie, was not dramatic enough for a real Hollywood movie. Affleck had to jazz things up, create tension in places where there really was none. That effort fails largely because some of the fake incidents Affleck throws in are such obvious Hollywood creations. No way it happened like that you're thinking as you watch the movie. All the contrived razor-tight close calls fall flat and actually come across as a little silly. Silly is not what you're looking for as you ramp up to the big finish of a thriller. Seeing as it is more or less a true story, meaning you know the ending, it is admittedly hard to create that great dramatic tension. Some films which tell true stories overcome this problem better than others. Apollo 13 comes to mind, that was real edge of the seat stuff. Argo is not. It's not nearly as gripping and exciting as you would hope. Affleck seemed to realize this and tried desperately hard to make it more exciting but those efforts end up hurting the film more than helping it.<br/><br/>So this is a bad movie then? No, not at all. It's a good movie, maybe not as good as you would hope, maybe not Oscar-worthy but good nonetheless. Yes it has its flaws but the overall package is more than acceptable. It is a great story, the CIA working with Hollywood to create a fake movie to get Americans out of Iran. It's in the putting together of that fake film that Argo really shines. The inside Hollywood stuff, helped immensely by great performances from Alan Arkin and John Goodman, works really well. Bryan Cranston also does fine work, bringing good energy to his role as a CIA supervisor involved in putting the plan together. The one real flat performance unfortunately comes from the star, Affleck himself. He plays CIA operative Tony Mendez, the man who will ultimately go to Iran to get the Americans out. And Affleck doesn't bring much to the role. Everyone around him is more interesting than he is. It's an oddly bland character, the guy is supposed to be some kind of CIA super-spy but there's very little personality there. The gang of six who are to be rescued don't infuse the film with much life either. We don't really get to know those characters very well which maybe doesn't make us as invested in their fate as the film needs us to be to really succeed.<br/><br/>There is a lot to quibble with but there is a lot to recommend the film as well. The opening scene of the Iranian takeover of the American embassy is brilliantly done. The film may lack some needed tension later on but this opening gives the film a thoroughly gripping start. The real-life plan to extricate the six Americans was brilliant and this film does an excellent job as it puts that plan together. It's a story which has to be seen to be believed. The story draws you in and you expect the big, dramatic payoff to come with the ultimate rescue. But that rescue is not as exciting as you would hope. Affleck tries really hard to make it more thrilling. But he tried too hard, forced it too much. Much of the film's final act comes off as much too fake. You know it didn't happen like that so you don't really buy in. Couple that with the sense of inevitability that lingers with any true-life story in which you know the outcome and these final scenes can't help but be a little disappointing. It's a good effort from director Affleck but there is the nagging sense this film got much more acclaim than it deserved. A good film but greatness definitely eludes it. And movie star Affleck didn't help director Affleck very much."
"tendobear","8","1","2","7 June 2013"," Quit the Hatin'
","At first I was a little pensive about this movie because of all the hoopla and fuss surrounding the real historical facts of the story (or lack thereof), especially with the Canadians, and I now live in Canada. Every second person I encountered would mention how it was actually the Canadians that pulled off the rescue etc. Get over it people! The same thing happened with Braveheart (I'm from Scotland) and U-571. I used to feel strongly against movies that are supposedly based on true stories or fact, but now I just don't care; it's an American movie, so the heroes are going to be American! It's an American movie so the heroes are whoever they bloody well choose! The day Canada makes a similar movie, that's the day they can correct the historical inaccuracies! Let's just enjoy Argo for it is; a phenomenal effort from Ben Affeck, a taut and intense thriller with moments of sly humour, especially from John Goodman and Alan Arkin, and solid acting from the rest of the players. For what it's worth, the story-line does actually acknowledge Canada for its efforts when it could easily just overlook it."

Overall quality of the movie is flawless with no immersion breakers.<br/><br/>Music OK, nothing spectacular. Some nice famous oldies there. There is one very short music theme from another movie near the end - Spy Game. But characters in Spy Game are deeper and emotions more real. I liked Spy Game more.<br/><br/>Argo is based on a true story but the plot lacked some depth. It's a story yeah, but actually it's a bit boring. Maybe it is the way the story is told. The suspension stuff is captivating, but the actual storytelling needs something more.<br/><br/>Movies are about entertainment and sure, the mysterious and always subjective truth is an interesting thing, but some extra spice would've been a nice addition to this film.

"kluseba","6","1","2","29 March 2013"," Wasted potential because of a one-sided attitude with many lengths and a lack of depth
","Argo won three Academy Awards, including one for the best movie of the year 2012 and this award was even presented by honourable First Lady Michelle Obama due to the patriotic and political content of the film. On my list, this movie though didn't even make it into my personal top twenty of that year. Let me explain you why.<br/><br/>Let's start with the positive things first. The costumes, decorations and locations of the movie are authentic and seem to be quite close to the actual events that inspired this film. The tension filled scenes in the very beginning of the movie at the embassy and at the very end at the airport are well done as well.<br/><br/>Now, let's talk about the negative facts. The movie includes too many overlong dialogues that go straight nowhere. Instead of showing the raising pressure inside the Canadian embassy and conflicts between all involved persons, one sees a terribly faceless main actor going around to make publicity for his fake movie and talk to more or less important people of Hollywood nobody cares about. After twenty first great minutes, this movie falls flat and bores until the final fifteen minutes or so. Add to this that the movie has no depth whatsoever. It only explains in a quite short opening sequence what led to the revolutionary events in Iran. The movie never explains further how all of this could happen and what that country would become afterwards. The emotions, fate and suffering of the people aren't portrayed at all by this film. One only sees a bunch of angry citizens that play the bad guys while the American diplomats portray the good guys. This one-sided view is quite shallow and filled with the usual stereotypes but one starts to get used to it by Hollywood by now. Add to this a sometimes more or less audible sound quality and some annoying shaky camera positions even though the overall production is quite decent.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie is rather disappointing for me. I was really looking forward to discover this flick as the historical events are really intriguing. The idea behind the script had in fact a lot of potential in my opinion. In the end, you won't learn anything new from this movie and it only superficially portrays the events that happened. Half of the movie or so shows us scenes in Hollywood or Washington instead of showing us what happens in the streets of Teheran and the true soul of that revolution. The entire middle part of the movie has important lengths, unnecessary dialogues and lacks of consistency. The actors are exchangeable and fail to touch me. This film is only saved by its promising beginning and its gripping ending."

","I like Ben Affleck's works. The movie itself is not an outstanding work but it still good. But there is one thing that spoils the whole picture. This movie was made keeping in mind the actual political streams. Just in right place and at right time. That's why it gets awards, that's why I'm sure all awards are politically biased and why, actually, they has no real artistic value. The recipe to get awards is to make movies which are will be approved by the political elite, for example about bad guys in Iran, Iraq, about homosexuality, etc. Are these movies artistically good to be in the lists for awards: The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty ... ?"

I think most people are loving it because its an original idea, funny when your not expecting it to be, and has a total edge off your seat finale. They're surprised by how good it is.<br/><br/>As a whole though I found it pretty straight forward. There aren't nearly enough funny moments to describe it as a comedy thriller (If such a thing even exists) and your only truly invested in the last half hour or so.

","Good movie in general. Ben Affleck did a good job. Quite tight plot with good cinematography and great performances. When at the end, they showed the actors, beside the photos of real people they have portrayed, I was quite amazed by the similarity. Goodman and Arkin provided the light and humorous side of the movie.<br/><br/>My criticism here is pointed towards the ""artificial suspense"" that the movie creates in several occasions. My point here is that if you have a bomb countdown, the usual Hollywood trick to create suspense is to stop the bomb at the deadline. Argo had several such moments. sometimes it felt fit and sometimes artificial, dragging time just to make suspense. Which on the other hand ""stole"" time from the rescue operation and put some of its elements to the background."

Maybe the Good will hunting actor made a hit, and yes he did.<br/><br/>Argo is an entertaining movie. It is very exciting and surprising. The most important reason why this movie works, is because the story is very realistic. Most people go to the airport and is afraid to go through customs, even when you haven't done a thing. So you can relate to the people in this movie.<br/><br/>Acting is good, story is good. Good cast! Of the people who have to be taken out of Iran, you don't get to see much, but that does not matter.

"Soliduscell","7","1","2","18 March 2013"," Enjoyable film, despite it's overt political aspects
","*SPOILERS* (Just in Case) The Iranian hostage crisis of 1979-1980 is still present, albeit distant, in the minds of Americans. Ben Affleck's ""Argo"" tells the tale of an event that stirred much patriotism and emotion in America. This is where my problem with the film begins. On the whole, the story is compelling and draws from its audience a base humanistic response. We do feel for the characters who are stuck in a situation which really has nothing to do with them. My discontent with the film arises in the fact that it proliferates a feeling of animosity, which many Americans are already feeling, toward the Middle East. The problem, I feel, is that we are given a sense of elation and joy in seeing America pull one over on Iran. As one born and raised in America I, politically speaking, already have negative feelings towards certain cultural aspects of the Middle East. Yes it is alien to us. As one who has traveled quite a bit, foreign cultures usually intrigue me, but here I find myself cursing at the screen for the irrational mob mentality of the Iranian people we see in the film. I was born well after this situation panned out and I still take a biased stand against the seemingly insane actions of the rioters. I knew the history going into the film and tried to remain non-biased; but I couldn't help but get angry towards the mob. This being said the film did draw an excellent job creating tension. I was still at the edge of my seat in moments even though I knew the outcome. There is one Iranian woman who we see some development for and that is the housemaid of the Canadian ambassador. We don't know if we can trust her but do feel sympathy towards her character. Still, ""Argo"" draws a fine line between humanity and patriotism.<br/><br/>The introduction and development of the protagonist is done very well. Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) is a CIA agent hired to propose and/or execute a plan of extraction for the refugees. The first part of the film sets up his character and the idea of using a fake movie to help smuggle the escaped hostages out of the country. The idea is put in Mendez's mind through his son. We see him talking on the phone with him and we get the picture, through the dialogue, that there is a certain strain in their relationship (at least on Mendez's side). This is an effective technique because we get to see this unknown CIA agent as a relatable person. Later this serves to help gain the trust of the six refuges he seeks to help. I felt this was effective and served the movie well. Where it loses me is the drawn out aspect of it. I care about his son because it paints this agent not as a superhero but as a normal guy. The film ending on this note, and the resolving hug between him and a wife we know nothing about, is a bit of a corny ending in my opinion. It is not wrong to me- just weak.<br/><br/>""Argo"" had many good moments in it. The film keeps its viewer involved and, for those who wish to be, moves them. Go into this film with an open mind and try to take it out of its historical context. Alan Arkin has many a great one-liners as usual and Affleck's acting is on par in this role. Overall I wouldn't say it deserved best picture, but it was nonetheless a good watch."

He acts like a hard, CIA man but really he's feeling every emotion as he goes through the nail biting journey into and out of Iran. <br/><br/>I can't even begin to imagine how those people felt but they show us how to be brave and we should take inspiration from these people.Tony is an unspoken hero, until now that Argo has been produced and released. It was an incredible film and a fantastic portrayal of what happened and why. Don't miss this film, it's worth a watch!"

","Why you shouldn't see it:<br/><br/>The strength of Argo also happens to be its weakness. More so than a lot of modern Hollywood fare, this is a film about its story, and that story is about people in a not envious situation. It has been branded as a ""thriller,"" but despite a riot at the beginning and some brief ""action"" at the end, the majority of this movie's ""thrills"" and plot advancement are presented in the form of dialog and tense expressions. Accordingly, if you aren't one to care about the story of a hostage crisis in the early 80's, you probably won't care about this movie, since there isn't much in the way of real exciting set pieces or even off-color moments to take your mind off of the tension of it all.<br/><br/>As I'm sure you're aware, Argo is based on true events. I can't speak for everyone, but movies that are supposed to have any relation to true events can make me uncomfortable. Did you know that Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Silence of the Lambs were both ""inspired by"" the same events? I'm a big fan of getting things right if you're going to try to tackle actual history, or you may as well just make up your own story and let it succeed (Silence of the Lambs) or fail (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) on its own merits. I can't speak for the veracity of any of these true events, since they're based on a top secret operation that no one even knew about until 20 years after it happened. Even now most people just remember the events surrounding this movie and not the events of the movie itself. That can be a smart move by a filmmaker, as it means you can tell the story how you think it needs to be told. On the other hand, it can be a risk, because you're telling a story about which no one necessarily cares.<br/><br/>Why you should see it:<br/><br/>Ben Affleck. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, ""Blake, I've seen Ben Affleck, and I've seen enough Ben Affleck."" Well you're kind of missing the point. Honestly, he does a fine job acting in Argo, though I wouldn't say his work is anything special. But did you know that Affleck also directs movies? He has only directed two movies (Gone Baby Gone and The Town) previous to this one, but I wouldn't rate either of them below ""very good,"" and this one follows in their quality footsteps.<br/><br/>I just finished saying that Argo is about very little other than its story about people talking about a stressful situation. To further complicate the task for the filmmaker, everyone already knows how the story ends. And yet, despite these handicaps, Affleck somehow makes a suspenseful movie! There was a woman next to me in the theater, saying things aloud to the screen, along the lines of, ""No, don't go through that door!"" It's hard to explain how exactly this suspense is pulled off, but I think it has mostly to do with skilled actors playing identifiable characters in intimate settings. When the embassy gets stormed, you feel like you're about to get blindfolded and gagged by the mob yourself. When Affleck's Mendes is talking to Cranston's O'Donnell about how six Americans are about to get lynched for no good reason (depending on your viewpoint, I guess), you feel like you're standing right there next to them.<br/><br/>Speaking of Affleck and Cranston, it's possible I didn't give enough credit to the former earlier. The role of Mendes as a character is to be the steadying force for the rest of the characters and story, and he performs that role admirably. Because Affleck is able to pull this off, the character actors like Cranston, Goodman, and Arkin are able to present their own characters as the film's much needed engaging changes of pace. That being said, the highlights of the movie as far as entertainment factor goes are definitely those very same character actors. Their interplay with each other and Affleck is always worthy of screen time, and I spent a good deal of the movie waiting for the next time one of them would pop up.<br/><br/>In Short:<br/><br/>As you may remember me saying before, this movie isn't about anything more than a fairly straightforward story, so you're left at the end of it wondering in part what the point was. But I will say that the ability of the filmmakers to take a story that everyone knows the ending to and turn it into a suspense thriller is, well, impressive. Honestly, Ben Affleck as a capable storyteller doesn't come as a surprise, as he has a - admittedly limited - pedigree of making quality films. To make this particular quality film, he successfully turns an otherwise straightforward story into one of entertaining and empathetic characters in a surprisingly suspenseful situation. As far as talking movies go, I rate this one as an 8 out of 10, and I recommend it for anyone who can appreciate a good historical suspense/thriller/drama.<br/><br/>Exceptions to the recommendation: if you have had too much Ben Affleck; if you positively identify with revolutionary Iran; if you have incredibly sensitive ears; anyone for whom suspenseful situations lead to nothing more than stress and high blood pressure; individuals who would like to go on thinking that the ""Canadian Caper"" was, in fact, Canadian; if you prefer to keep Hollywood as far as possible away from your understanding of historical events; people who would like to remain blissfully unaware that Ben Affleck is a worthwhile Hollywood type when placed safely behind the camera."

","The phony movie they were supposed to be making would have been better than this. Everything was so contrived with last minute drama. Affleck should be embarrassed. It was so far from the actual events that there was no reason to consider this being based on a true story. It is another example of how Hollywood takes something that is interesting and exciting in itself and runs it through the meat grinder to make it a standard 'Murica #1 piece of crap. It reminds me of U-571 where a stalwart crew of US submariners steel an Enigma machine. America had nothing to do with the Enigma machine. It actually started out with Poles cracking the code and then Great Britain following up. Do we have such low self esteem that we have to distort everything to make it look like America is the sole savior of the world. Russia bore that largest burden of WWII. Not a fan of theirs but boy, if we ever get to the point where we can make movies about the Russian exploits, we will have some amazing tales to tell. But we don't have the balls."

","I really enjoyed Argo. But the story didn't exactly jump out at me at first glance. I've seen dozens of films based around a hostage taking, and dozens of films set in the Middle East. This one combines both, which again is nothing special (I'm sure I've seen those too). What makes Argo special is that it doesn't rely on big action sequences, shocking violence or contrived plot elements to generate tension. Ben Affleck instead relies on solid performances by his actors (and himself), and a dramatic interpretation of what actually happened that feels so authentic that it seems like we're watching the real event unfold before our eyes."

","i saw this movie last week and what can i tell you. it's really great. really not much to say about it, off-cures you need to be an American or someone who knows history or a Ben Aflec fan to love this movie, but most of the people are. this movie really revolves around the events of the ""Canadian Caper"", in which a CIA Agent rescued and extracted 6 Americans from the 80 or so who stayed 2 years in captivity. really to be short it's just a Ben Aflec action movie, it's about an historical events and it is a really sensitive subjects especially for Americans, so off-cures it got nominated for the Oscars, but if your not a Ben Aflec fan nothing really is going to help you love this movie, the Suspense is not really felt as in other movies this year that came out, the acting is .. well it's good it's really good, probably the best thing about this movie, it's not amazing but it is good. and then there is clinging to the History which they are doing that, i just, didn't know the real story, so there was allot more action missing from this movie, and it did felt a bit like an average thriller movie with tiny bits of action put into it, what can i say it simply didn't racked my bubble.. i just couldn't get into this movie so much, there was nothing amazing in it, the soundtrack is average at best, Ben aflec is well.. Ben aflec ... all hies charchters look the same for me, the other hostage's where true to the source but really not interesting enough to keep me watching more of this... i watched it until the end and although it's the best thriller i saw in months it's certainly not one i would remember for the apparent future.<br/><br/>i know allot of people get super excited about the amazing acting in this movie and on how touching it is, i simply didn't saw it like that..."

","Alright, so 'Argo' may arguably be a bit propagandist. It's not easy making a politically themed film without taking sides. However, 'Argo' does attempt to stay true to the facts and historically accurate (even though a little dramatized). That aside, it's a highly entertaining film. Of course we know what will happen in the end but Affleck and his actors/co-stars succeed in creating tension and maintain an element of suspense. <br/><br/>However, what I liked most about 'Argo' is the humour. The timing is superb as it never feels out of place. Alan Arkin and John Goodman are terrific. Their scenes, including those with Affleck, are among the highlights of this film. Together, they deliver some of the best lines. Other actors, Bryan Cranston, Kyle Chandler, Clea DuVall, Scoot McNairy, Chris Messina, Victor Garber and Kerry Bishé are very effective.<br/><br/>It's quite a decently shot film. Sound designing is pretty good. The 'Iranian landscape' is exotic enough. Editing is first rate.<br/><br/>Affleck has come a long way. After being written off as an actor once he reached the peak of his stardom, he's maintained a low profile, allowing his work to do the speaking and it's spoken well for him so far. He's grown as an actor (as is evident in 'Hollywoodland', 'State of Play', 'Extract', 'The Town') and 'Argo' shows that he continues to grow as a director."
"Bruce722","8","1","2","2 March 2013"," Not Picture of the Year but still really good.
","Argo was a very good film but Picture of the Year it was not. Sorry Academy but you got it wrong once again. Don't mistake this for bashing. Like I said, Argo was a very good film. Ben Affleck has proved once again that he's not only a fantastic and underrated actor but that he's becoming one of the better directors in Hollywood. Argo had great pacing for the type of movie it is, the plot developed perfectly, the characters all felt real and authentic, etc. The only negative I would really have is that some of the suspense felt cheap and forced. Sure, they truly did escape Iran. That part is a true story. However, how close they were to getting caught is not necessarily known. So the fact that the final 30 minutes of the movie was close call after close call and that these scrapes didn't develop authentically but felt manufactured was not ideal. Nonetheless, I'd say this is a really good movie that, while it's a little overrated and over-hyped (it won Picture of the Year when I'm not even sure it's the best true story CIA film of the year - that would probably be Zero Dark Thirty), most people would still enjoy. ""Argo f*** yourself!"""

","First of all, I enjoyed the movie tremendously, as I was in my early 20s when this all went down. Argo is a great telling of a small piece of a much larger mosaic. I'm grateful for the Canadian government's decisive actions at a time when these kinds of decisions could have horrific consequences for those making them. The scenes and period touches were so well done the effect was like a mental time-capsule for myself and others of similar age who've seen the movie. Well done Mr Affleck.<br/><br/>On a personal note, I'm saddened that the sacrifices of my friends and co-workers on the ill- fated rescue mission authorized by President Carter didn't rate a mention. Hollywood doesn't deal well with facts that conflict with their simplistic view of the world. Someday I hope their story will be told."
"Al_The_Strange","9","1","2","2 March 2013"," ""This is the best bad plan we have...by far, sir.""
","November 4th 1979, Iranians violently stormed the American Embassy and seized hostages for 444 days. It was an intense and frightening era in modern history; this film chronicles the daring operation to rescue six of the hostages after they fled the besieged embassy.<br/><br/>I'm not at all familiar with the Iranian Hostage Crisis, so I have no idea how much of Argo is fiction and how much of it is fact (reading up on it, I see that the film is criticized for over-emphasizing the role of the CIA, and for presenting more peril than what really happened). Regardless, the film made the events feel very real. The film does it best to replicate the era, the settings, and the danger to immerse the viewers into the situation and make them feel the suspense. I certainly felt the suspense, as the characters ran up against all manner of political, diplomatic, and cultural barriers in a frantic race to escape a treacherous and unstable country. The film definitely kept my attention and had me at the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>The story is well-told, presenting its ideas and sequence of events on a manner that's both logical and sensical. Even though there is a lot of political intrigue involved, the film never loses its audience with jargon or politics. It also looks and feels very realistic; despite some thrilling scenes, the events appear plausible and the various interactions between people and governments appear authentic. Characters have just enough depth and emotion to make audiences care for them, and once again, come off as seeming authentic.<br/><br/>Even the film itself feels authentic, featuring some rough and gritty-looking camera work and editing. The camera is steady and solid, as is the editing, but it looks like a film that could have been made in the 70s, due to the way it's composed and put together. Same goes for its production design, which goes to great lengths to replicate genuine-looking sets, props, and costumes. Acting is decent: Ben Affleck is surprisingly strong in his role, Bryan Cranston is a fun to watch as ever, and everybody else fulfills their parts admirably. Writing is great. Music isn't bad either.<br/><br/>Argo might just stand as a new favorite among political thriller movies; it's certainly one of the most real-looking and historically interesting films I've seen in the genre. Above all, it's intense enough to maintain interest. Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)"
"gradyharp","8","1","2","20 February 2013"," 'We did suicide missions in the army that had better odds than this.'
","There is so much hype regarding the Oscars now that viewing any of the contenders is met with confusion. That is unfair to each of the films because it automatically places each in a police lineup for who is going to win. ARGO is a solid film based on a true incident and the significance of that very important mission to free hostages is one equally share with our good friends the Canadians. That is what makes this film important - the courage and fortitude shared in freeing 6 American citizens form a near hopeless situation. But on to the film itself.<br/><br/>In 1979, the American embassy in Iran was invaded by Iranian revolutionaries and several Americans were taken hostage. However, six managed to escape to the official residence of the Canadian Ambassador and the CIA was eventually ordered to get them out of the country. With few options, exfiltration expert Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck) devised a daring plan: to create a phony Canadian film project looking to shoot in Iran and smuggle the Americans out as its production crew. With the help of some trusted Hollywood contacts (John Goodman and Alan Arkin, both brilliant in their comedic roles), Mendez created the ruse and proceed to Iran as its associate producer. However, time was running out with the Iranian security forces closing in on the truth while both his charges and the White House had grave doubts about the operation themselves.<br/><br/>The film opens with a brief but well edited history of the fall of the Shah of Iran and the rise of the Khomeini, actual footage that lends a sense of credibility form the start. For the first hour of the film the plans are set into motion - plans that seem absurdly Hollywood but the options are non-existent. Once the actual exfil mission is begun the film become tense and suspenseful and the cast of characters selected to show both the resistance of the home front and the terrifying situation happening to the hostages in the shelter of the home of the Canadian ambassador makes this a finely tuned thriller.<br/><br/>The cast of actors includes, in addition to Affleck, Arkin and Goodman, strong work from Victor Garber who plays the Canadian ambassador, and Bryan Cranston, Tate Donovan, Clea DuVall, Scoot McNairy, Rory Cochrane, Christopher Denham, Kerry Bishé, Kyle Chandler, and Chris Messina. Though the film was basically shot here in the US (with a bit of footage in Istanbul, Turkey) the action appears authentic. The film was written by Chris Terrio but based on the book ""The Master of Disguise by Antonio J. Mendez and Escape for Tehran by Joshuah Bearman. Affleck directs, produces and stars. ARGO is an important film to see, a slid movie on its own rights, but is it the best film of the year? Check the competition. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

Well, it really is not supposed to be and quite honestly who cares. Most movies are not dead on accurate but I would say having grown up during this time this movie does a pretty good job of telling the story. Affleck deserves a Best Director nod for this and it appears there was much research done to try and be accurate in the way the events unfolded. Again, this is a movie and not real life so I am sure there were things that were not as accurate as well. This is a very good movie and I recommend it highly to anyone."
"Robert_duder","7","1","2","19 February 2013"," The ins and outs of Argo and why I'm scratching my head yet again
","I actually had high expectations for Argo. I mean how could you not when we've been inundated with trailers for this film for months now. My expectations were also kept in check by the fact that I knew chances are you basically saw the entire film in the half dozen trailers that existed. That turned out to be exactly correct. However, the trailers still looked good and I love a good political thriller especially based on true events so I was excited. I enjoyed Argo. I thought it was good. But that's the furthest you'll get me to go. Academy Award material? Absolutely not, not in my opinion. I am literally scratching my head trying to figure out why critics chose this movie to latch on to and rave about. Its a good story, its decently directed, the late seventies, early eighties setting is especially well done but the action is really just okay, characters are underused in favour of focusing on the event itself and the film only really gets interesting and riveting in the last half hour when they are finally escaping Iran. Ironically, the last half hour is what critics of the film and real life people involved didn't like because it was a ""dramatization"" and Hollywood-ized to make the film interesting. Yah and? It should be about entertainment and still tell a good story. The last half hour is thrilling and edge of your seat although opens some element of plot holes because how is it Iranian Government can't just stop a plane from taking off from their airport but rather have to chase it down the runway with guns? <br/><br/>Ben Affleck directs and stars in the film and has gotten endless critical acclaim for it. The direction is very well done. His performance felt monotone to me. He was a one note hero that they try to humanize and give a background to but this film solely rests on the laurels of its story and not the characters themselves. Alan Arkin is Oscar nominated for his role and for what?!? I love Alan Arkin...he has given some incredible performances but they're nominating him for angrily stomping through a studio and swearing at people like an angry old man? Because that was the extent of his character. I realize he played a vital role in the entire plan but that felt lost in this story. The exact same could be said for John Goodman's character. Again, I love John Goodman and the person he portrayed was clearly of the utmost importance to this real life mission but his character felt like he was just there in this. He had no depth and at the end of the film we get this little blurb about John Chambers as though he was a HUGE part of the film and instead Goodman felt like nothing more than a cameo. Bryan Cranston was definitely not much more than a passing cameo with a few decent lines that you see every single one of in the trailer. Victor Garber was decent as the Canadian Ambassador but again there was no depth to the character. The six hostages were all good in their roles and they all certainly looked very much like their real life counterparts but I couldn't even name them or tell you who was who.<br/><br/>The film wasn't bad, please don't get me wrong. I think you could sit down and enjoy the story it tells as it was a very important moment in history. Is it a Yay, Go America story...well yes a little bit but not as much as some would say. It certainly pays proper respects to the Canadians' role in it as well. Perhaps Affleck and the writers didn't want to cloud up the true story with too much focus on the individual characters, I can accept that. But then to give any of these actors acclaim for their roles just seem silly because they weren't given any sort of depth to sink their teeth into. I just don't understand why critics grab hold of something and rave about it when I don't see anything truly outstanding about a movie like this at all. It was good, but far from great. I don't believe it'll be a classic film in twenty or thirty years and firmly sits in the vein of being mediocre all around. I guess that's why to each their own. See for yourself because I am almost certain it will win Best Picture this coming Sunday but so far from what I have seen the only Best Picture nominees deserving of it are Les Miserables and Life of Pi but then I still have three more to see. 7/10"

","After a poor Gone Baby Gone and a much better The Town, Ben Affleck returns with his third movie, becoming more and more of a sure bet behind the camera.<br/><br/>Argo is incredibly dynamic from end to end, no slow passages weighing down a surgical script, combining drama and action, sometimes even sprinkled with a dose of humour. The plot unfolds ultra smoothly and the connections between the scenes are perfect. Still, a certain distance is always necessary when dealing with true facts, especially historico-political ones, and a research on the subject is needed to understand all the whys and wherefores of this episode.<br/><br/>As for the characters, none is really emphasized apart from Tony Mendez but each has his share, and all the actors are convincing except Affleck who is, as often happens, too apathetic and monotonous in his acting.<br/><br/>He seems also uninspired regarding the cinematography, favouring a rather classic and a bit too academic style, which is where he needs improvement in the future.

It doesn't tell much about the remaining hostages, nor does it tell about the plight of the Iranians. Iranians are shown just as bunch of violent hooligans; it's quite vague and inaccurate.

","Argo (2012)<br/><br/>The preview for ""Argo"" made me think of a dozen recent political thrillers, and the clichés lined up in my mind to the point I didn't want to see it. Then it won the Golden Globe, and I'm thinking there must be more to this than meets the eye. I wrote this review at first with the rush of having seen a really well made political thriller, but the blush has faded and I'm revising down a hair. It's good, but it really is formula movie making in some ways. And yet, in other ways, it's fast and fresh and funny.<br/><br/>The first minute, the first ten minutes, are so riveting you can forget any doubts about the previews. In some ways this sets an unmatchable pace for the rest, outlining the history leading to the hostage crisis in Iran that is the crux of the plot later on. Mixing found footage (or what looks like real period stuff) with new shots, and editing in a whirlwind that will, even when it calms down, make your head spin, the pace and the energy is great. Gradually it becomes clear what particular focus the movie will take--the six embassy workers who avoided being taken hostage in the crisis (this is late 1979).<br/><br/>When the plot broadens to include not only the Canadian Ambassador's house but a bunch of small time Hollywood professionals (played by big time Hollywood professionals named Alan Arkin and John Goodman), the fun begins. And as much as the movie is painful and gut-wrenching, it's actually fun, and in Goodman's case, downright hilarious. It's that famously classic mix of tragic and comic that makes the movie click. It's a bit glib and maybe even dumbed down, at times, but it still gets some sincere laughs.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck directed and stars as the leading operative who tries to get the six out of Iran using a crazy concoction of chutzpah and genius. Whether it works you'll see. But the movie is filmed, and edited, with unusual clarity and intelligence. It's not just fast, it's kinetic and logical and irresistible. It's an artistic job of putting several plot lines together into one dynamic energized whole. It creates a really stupidly Hollywood fantasy of an ending (the airport stuff) that isn't true, and the personal life of Affleck's character is further sentimentalizing (also not true--check wikipedia). <br/><br/>The only downside to the movie is that it is what it is--it's history, it has no surprises if you know the history, and it's laden slightly with the feeling the ""we"" are the good guys and ""they"" are not. And it's a conventional--though highly effective--action adventure political thriller beat the clock movie. I mean, there are ways these movies are put together and this follows the rules. I don't know if the Iranians are presented fairly, overall, but an Iranian student of mine (born and raised in Tehran) said it looked really authentic to him. It is, however, an very pro-American view of things, for better or worse.<br/><br/>In the end ""Argo"" is just so smartly made and paced, you'll get sucked in. Guaranteed."

When I returned from the trip my generous employer reimbursed me for the tab.<br/><br/>At the time we received the TV news the bar patrons, including myself, thought the rescue was arranged by Ken Taylor, where in the film, Mendez receives most of the credit.

Just like ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" is a fun movie, even if it is about ninety percent inaccurate. This is because the producers would like you to believe all of the near misses, the interventions, and so on were truly what happened. There are enough people on the internet who will happily discount them, using good evidence to do so. Now, this leads us to an interesting pass. Can we accept any historical movie as being well done when those making it didn't have the wherewithal to see the events. LIke historical fiction, as soon as we quote dialogue, we are on untrustworthy waters. However, this would dismiss many great movies. I'm afraid this one is still too fresh in our consciousness. I'm wondering if someone in 2045 will see this and comfortably absorb the ""facts"" as presented. Divorcing myself from reality, I can see this as a great yarn. Like ""The Killing Fields"" or other historical dramas where people face their mortality at every juncture, can we enjoy the very intense situations that our people have been thrown into. This is a very individual thing. I enjoyed this movie for the most part because I found the characters engaging, the ""enemy"" human and righteous (considering our connection to the Shah), and the situation terrifying. I expect this will get a lot of attention at awards time. I saw Jimmy Carter at Obama's second inauguration the other day. This movie must not be a pleasant experience for him because he was vilified because of his performance. Reagan was able to pick up the pieces because the Iranians had already humiliated Carter, which was part of their agenda. Watch with a grain of salt and realize this is not a documentary."

The second half is a real roller coaster ride, especially the critical scenes where there is only a fine line between life and death.

Affleck's camera is practical mostly, but shows little truly interesting techniques.<br/><br/>The best thing about this film was the editing of so many cameras, inter-cutting news items, historical footage, and fly-on-the-wall cameras in a steady rhythm to build an unsteady paranoia.<br/><br/>The actors turn in mostly dead performances. John Goodman and Alan Arkin play off each other for buffoonish comic relief, serving to undermine the tenseness of the drama. Ben Affleck is rather drab, and Bryan Cranston has little to work with, other than to be seen walking furiously from scene to scene and barking cursory dialogue.<br/><br/>The screenplay was rather obvious, and I grew tired of the coincidental plot points. The formulaic clashing of stories stuck out like a sore thumb. But Affleck has managed to juggle these pieces well to create an easy-flowing, if lifeless, work."
"muons","9","1","2","28 December 2012"," A solid movie
","Argo is the best Affleck movie that I have seen so far. To start with, the story is so solid that the production doesn't need any embellishment for further dramatization. The script is very well written and acting is good. The scenes are very realistic although the shots seem to be taken in Turkey rather than Iran. This becomes especially obvious with women on streets without a headcover and more so with female airport agents in knee high skirts. In 80's Iran after revolution, it was impossible for women to dress like that, regardless of their nationality. It's amazing Affleck missed this important detail during the shots. Besides that, the editing and directing are in general above average keeping the tension up throughout the movie. Although the movie was criticized for slighting Canada's role in the operation the historical references are generally accurate and realistic. Recommended."

","Okay movie, but I didn't get a thrill... Ben Affleck and George Clooney apparently put up the money for this, Ben put on a disguise beard and fixed facial expression to fill in for Brad Pitt who (luckily for him) pulled out of this movie. There was plenty of tension but I found the characters rather flat. The look of a 1980's thriller might have been deliberate but it went too far and the movie would have been better if the character development was of a more modern standard. Ben reminded me of one of those 'martial artist-turned actor' types like Chuck Norris or Steven Seagal with his odd appearance and wooden manner, but I was still going along okay with the movie until the last 10 minutes (Spoilers follow!) from where the guards struggle to get in touch with the control tower, (presumably they could have just phoned the air traffic controllers,) then a bunch of police cars chase the jet at a highly unlikely 150+ mph with not a peep from air traffic control or a single problem with jetwash in one of the most agonisingly contrived 'suspenseful endings' of all time. That was irritating enough but then we spend the next ten minutes watching clumsy bandaid resolution of the misrepresentation of the Canadians' contribution. For a movie apparently 'based on a true story' it looked rather implausible at this point and wanted us to suspend disbelief which is fine if you are watching Chitty Chitty Bang Bang but not when a movie purports to be 'based on true events'. I guess you could state that Chitty Chitty was based on true events, I am sure someone who invented a sweet also restored a car, but the term 'true events' carries a great deal more responsibility. All in all a decent movie but not worth more than 6 out of 10 in my mind."

","Rarely can a film title have been so unilluminating about its subject matter - in this case, the astonishing true life story of how six Americans stationed in the US Embassy in Teheran when it was stormed in 1979 managed to walk out and take refuge with the Canadian Ambassador before being spirited out of the country by a bizarre CIA operation, the details of which were only declassified in 1997. ""Argo"" was the title of a science fiction film which was actually scripted but never made and provided the cover for the six who amazingly pretended to be a scouting crew for the planned movie.<br/><br/>The work opens with a rapid-fire post-Secomd World War history of Iran which makes plain why many Iranians are suspicious of the West (the Americans and British arranged a coup in 1953 against the democratically elected Prime Minister). It then shows the 1979 storming of the embassy by fundamentalist forces in a style that is so real it is almost documentary (the credits show contemporary photographs which underline the verisimilitude of the movie). Most of the film, though, focuses on the planning and execution of the exfiltration (as the CIA termed it) by the Agency's top 'exfil' guy Tony Mendez. The final segment, a bit of post-escape bonhomie, should have been excised.<br/><br/>in some ways, this cannot have been an easy film to make because we all know the outcome from the beginning and for this incredible tale to be credible on the screen it could not depart too much from the facts (it is unfair to Britain's role), so Ben Affleck as director has done a terrific job in sustaining the tension without adding too much fiction and his portrayal of Mendez is convincingly understated (this is an agent who never fires gun or even wields a fist but relies solely on guile and sheer guts). Among a fine cast of support actors, the stand out is Alan Arkin as a veteran Hollywood producer."

","This reviewer still owns an original copy of Jim Steranko's Mediascene Prevue Magazine, which states in a 3-page advance story on the upcoming movie version of Roger Zelazny's novel 'Lord of Light' in mid-1980 that famed comic artist Jack Kirby would be the film's visual concept artist. Amidst some large sized blowups of Kirby's sketches, the artist (known to have been a stereotypically jovial and saucy personality in the tough, deadline-demanding comics industry trade of the time) is quoted in a strangely awed and subdued manner this time. (""This film is going to have tremendous impact on the world. It will allow Eastern and Western Man to relate to each other...I believe the way we're conceiving this film could contribute to saving the world."", {Issue 41, Vol. 2, No. 1, pg. 26}. Mr. Kirby (portrayed by Michael Parks) is practically non-existent in Ben Affleck's dramatization of the events surrounding the use of the unmade film's material by the CIA during the Iran hostage crisis of 1979-80. But the resulting film--titled ARGO in tribute to agent Tony Mendez' (Affleck) retitling of ""Lord of Light"" to create a bogus film company team that would be a cover for 6 State Dept. employees that he would try to sneak out of Iran before they could be captured by the military and possibly killed--is a concise, decently-staged, well paced caper film that recalls quieter, purposeful, politically informed works that were quite common during the intense days of the US/Russian Cold War by directors like Martin Ritt, Alan Pakula or John Frankenheimer. Mr. Affleck as director is not quite there yet in high-technical expertise of the medium as those three but the film's low-keyed photographic color tones, good contrasts in his art direction and props as the hostages see their world of mechanics and expensive travel replaced with ancient stone, wood, and handspun fabrics and circular containment, and his crosscutting between three separate story lines begins placing his craft toward their related achievements (the bogus film production in Hollywood includes the real-life makeup artist John Chambers {John Goodman, an uncannily accurate portrayal} calling in some old friends in the industry to help out including a rough-hewn film producer {Alan Arkin} who slowly sees the mission as a way of regaining some ethical ideals he appears to have lost in himself over many years. The third storyline at the CIA with Mendez' boss {Bryan Cranston, who provides a superb moment in his performance during a bureaucratic snag during the climax} is the most directly wordy and not entirely epic of the three (Affleck laudably has several real-life personalities from Pres. Jimmy Carter's top administration as characters riding herd or clearing the increasingly difficult details of the mission yet they don't quite come across as powerful or accurate as they should {Where was Chief of Staff's Hamilton Jordan's native North Carolina accent?}). Yet the film's central narrative trajectory--with Affleck being able to keep his very numerous locations and group motions distinct and geometrically designed to bring the small group of seven people finally--to the Swiss Air boarding gate at Tehran Airport and the edge of escape and freedom. Ultimately a thriller/suspense film merely dusted by politics (answering or correcting the supposed inaccuracies and dramatic liberties would probably have required an additional hour's length minimum), Ben Affleck's ARGO does at least very respectfully illuminate in both a Hollywood-nostalgic and Washington-heroic manner a frustrating and downbeat era regarding the Middle East for many Americans where (until between the release of the remaining Iranian hostages and the death of Osama bin Laden) the good guys actually scored a victory."

The movie is based on the story of six American diplomats who escaped the American embassy in Tehran at the time of the hostage crisis in 1979/1980 and hid out in (among other places) the home of the Canadian ambassador to Iran. Affleck is cast as the CIA agent who is tasked with getting the six diplomats out of Iran. <br/><br/>The movie breathes the 70's in clothes, facial hair, settings, etc. If you had come across it on the television, you would believe you were watching a rerun of Airport.

(Look for a lot of familiar faces in support roles.)<br/><br/>Still, Argo didn't blow me away like the other movies that Affleck wrote and/or directed did.

","If you enjoy gripping historical dramas, you'll enjoy this film. This movie is intelligent and edge-of-your-seat riveting.<br/><br/>It tells the story of the ""Canadian Caper"", the joint covert rescue by Canada and the CIA of six American diplomats who evaded capture during the Islamist seizure of the United States embassy in Tehran, Iran, in November 1979. Most of the other hostages had to endure 444 days of captivity, but three months into this ordeal America was delighted when it was discovered that six had managed to hide in the Canadian embassy and to make their way out of the country.<br/><br/>Yes, there are a few liberties, changes, omissions and embellishments in the movie, but this was mostly for dramatic purposes, and the result is a movie that manages to combine historical accuracy with drama. Only once did the drama lapse into unrealistic melodrama: the take-off scene. It's clear that the director went to great lengths to try to replicate things as realistically as possible. It was a messy complicated event, so some details had to be smoothed over.<br/><br/>For an American movie with a political theme, I found it to be relatively neutral, balanced and not overtly anti-Iranian; however, you may wish to pass if you're an Islamist or an Iranian nationalist. Some of the police/immigration scenes reminded me of Midnight Express. We all know that Iran is a great country that has only temporarily lost its way.<br/><br/>I also am quite certain that if this movie had been made by Canadians, it would have shown more of the pivotal roles played by Ken Taylor and the other Canadians who risked their lives. Perhaps we'll see a movie some day about Ken Taylor's spectacular evacuation of 850 Canadians from Tehran in January 1979. (But would Americans go see it...?)<br/><br/>This is surely the movie that will confirm in everyone's mind that Ben Affleck is not only an accomplished actor, but also a good and perhaps even great director. Perhaps we already knew that from ""The Town"".<br/><br/>I would rate this movie as 8.5, but this is a movie for which the score deserves to be rounded up."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>In 1979, after a deposed leader is refused to be returned home to Iran to face trial for human rights abuses, an army of militants storm the Canadian Embassy in that country and take everyone inside hostage, save for a few who escape and hide out at the Canadian ambassador's residence. They desperately need to be rescued, and so the CIA turns to specialist Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) to hatch a plan to get them out. Naturally, he comes up with the most insane idea imaginable- to disguise them as a film crew scouting for locations for a new science fiction fantasy called Argo. It was so crazy-it worked.<br/><br/>It seems some of the best stories are real life ones that are so outlandish and far fetched they could be believed to be fiction. Clint Eastwood showed us as such with Changeling and now another former actor who proved to be a much better director, in the shape of Ben Affleck, showcases this dramatization of the real life rescue of a few escapees in a hostile climate. <br/><br/>The big ask here is: can you make a story you already know the outcome of genuinely thrilling? And the simple answer is: yes. As the film draws to a close and the group are racing against the clock to make it through the airport and onto the plane, it is genuinely a nail biting, seat edge experience, that can only be down to impressive writing and a smooth, even pace. His third film at the helm, this certainly feels like the most dynamic and ambitious of Affleck's projects, and while it's historical accuracy and attention to detail could be called in to question, it undeniably brings a colourful and vibrant chapter in American history in to the light.<br/><br/>The most notable thing, actually, is the smooth, balanced transition between the tense drama and the more light hearted, easy going feel, where the character's turn the film's title into a rude but imaginative play on words over and over, which, along with the general zaniness of the idea, makes the whole thing that little bit more of an involving, enthralling ride. ****"

","Kind of a big disappointment for me, though it's certainly a pretty good movie. Affleck's direction is excellent, it's beautifully shot and it feels like a really good film, but, honestly, I think the story is kind of thin and never very interesting. You can tell that the screenwriter had to add dozens of moments of fake tension to the real story to make it filmable. None of the characters really pop out as interesting people, and it'd be a shame if someone like Alan Arkin was nominated for an Oscar just for getting a couple of chuckles. Affleck himself probably gives the best performance in the film, but it's of a blank kind of person, a CIA spy who is meant to be that way. The movie's perfectly entertaining to watch, but it evaporates immediately. It'll certainly be the kind of movie the Oscars go for, but, I'm calling it right now, no way it wins Best Picture (it might very well, however, win the Best Adapted Screenplay award, though it's totally undeserving of even that)."

If these handful of workers from the states are worthy of empathizing for, then what about all the people of Iran who had their freedom stolen by American foreign policy? A film with good actors and good production completely lost the message by turning it into posturing against Iran. Coincidentially, the film also really comes across as a we don't want the Canadians getting the credit ploy. Rather than congratulating themselves, maybe the makers of this film, the real people involved and the American people can reflect on another story in which their country has left a legacy of blood, murder and torture in another foreign nation.<br/><br/>I'll give it a 5 as its shot well and it did have the guts to outline the bad ways in which the west behaved. If you have a conscience you will not come out of this film with the sense of triumph it attempts to install with all the cheesy American back slapping. You will reflect on the plight of the Iranian people and that poor Iranian girl (the actual hero) escaping across the border into Iraq (the irony).

","'Argo' was the title of a fake sci-fi film used by the CIA as a subterfuge to rescue six US embassy workers during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. Ben Affleck's accomplished third feature as director (in which he also stars) avoids being a dull reconstruction by being rather incredibly among the funniest films I've seen all year. <br/><br/>Affleck plays the lead role of Tony Mendez, the CIA op who led the audacious rescue and whose book prompted the film. He portrays Mendez as I imagine he really was – as a quiet American. Less the flag-waving brand of patriotism than an innate and unquestioning loyalty to the stars and stripes.<br/><br/>Although the taut hostage narrative is the epicentre, it is mercifully overshadowed by the comedy arising from the film production difficulties. John Goodman stars as John Chambers, the legendary Hollywood make-up artist and Mendez's adviser. But it is Alan Arkin's wickedly funny and cantankerous Hollywood producer (the only one depraved enough to go along with the caper) who steals the show. It's his grandpa character from 'Little Miss Sunshine', only about a million times funnier. <br/><br/>The film was criticised for its portrayal of Iranians, but I didn't think it was overly harsh. Militants can hardly be sanitised, can they? Affleck has the courage to admit to his country's (and the UK's) culpability in draining Iran of its oil in the chilling opening sequence, and he gives one of his characters the line, 'We did it to them first'. <br/><br/>'Argo' is a deliriously energetic and compelling 'declassified true story', even if it shows a patent disregard for historical facts. I can hear Arkin say 'Argo **** yourself!' if we don't like it."

The first half focuses on the planning, and the more riveting half focuses on the execution.<br/><br/>This movie has 70s political thriller written all over it, from the substance to the style. Ben Affleck gives his best directing performance here as he shoots the film with a 70s look and feel to add realism to the conflict while at the same time paying homage to classic dialogue-heavy thrillers like All the President's Men and Dog Day Afternoon.<br/><br/>His old-school, close-up style of filmmaking helped his first two features, and it definitely enhances the anxiety of the moments when the characters can be seen in the hostile environment of Iran. You will hear your heart as the cast drives through the heart of the rebellion.<br/><br/>The best of movies can successfully combine drama with humor, and the dark humor of Argo helps the viewer relax and breathe a little as the stakes get raised higher and higher. This movie is actually surprisingly funny, with the best lines being delivered by the veteran actors John Goodman (where's his Oscar?) and Alan Arkin. The rest of the cast does a wonderful job being likable and being people you want to root for during their highs and their low points.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: 120 minutes of heart-pounding drama and heavy content is what makes Argo one of the best films of the year, and pretty much certifies Ben Affleck as a successful and good director that manages to erase his ugly streak of bad movies. There isn't a dull moment here as you will remain glued to the screen up until the very end.

Affleck plays the CIA operative tasked with rescuing 6 Americans in Iran during the hostage crisis of the 70s. His understated performance is pitch perfect. John Goodman and Alan Arkin are great as the Hollywood counterparts that help Affleck pull off his cover story, and surprisingly the movie has some really funny one-liners. Byran Cranston is also phenomenal, as is the rest of the top-notch cast. While pacing slowed in a few places, it didn't take long to pick back up in each case. A nice touch at the end was seeing the photos of the real life hostages and players juxtaposed against the actors who played them. <br/><br/>The movie was a little different than what I was expecting, however. I expected a ""nail biting, action thriller"" that I assumed -- knowing how the story ends -- would leave me feeling triumphant or at least feeling good. Instead, (and in a way this is to the movie's credit), the atmosphere it created was so oppressive that I was left in a negative mood, even though the film has a positive ending (since it is based on a true story I don't think that's giving anything away). If you equate oppression and pressure with ""a thriller"" and ""action"" then I guess you might see it different. In any case there are worse ways to spend ten bucks plus. <br/><br/>It's a solid 7.5 stars for me, but not a movie I would watch twice."

Take all of the curse words out of this movie and I say the movie would be a 10. But because of the foul language I knock it down to a 6. There are a lot of great movies out there with no foul language and they make a lot of money. Remember the Titans is a classic example.

For whatever reason, I always saw him as the ""second fiddle"" to Matt Damon after ""Good Will Hunting"" and didn't give him much respect as either an actor or a filmmaker. With ""Argo"", however, I got a nice helping of crow, as Affleck proves to be more than a capable director, and in fact turns in an incredible effort.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Argo"" deals the the Iran Hostage Crisis of the President Jimmy Carter administration. When all other ideas to extract the U.S. hostages being harbored by the Canadian Embassy in Iran fail, CIA agent Tony Mendez (Affleck) concocts the craziest idea yet: posing as a fake Hollywood production in order to get inside Iran and smuggle out the Americans.<br/><br/>The main reason this film works so well is because the direction from Affleck is superb. The movie contains action, tension, drama, and even some humor, all the while staying focused and ""tight"" (never losing track of the overall narrative). From the opening scene until the closing credits, the viewer is sucked into this story and never feels bored or let down.<br/><br/>The film also works as a bit of a history lesson regarding the United States and its relations with other Middle Eastern countries (Iran especially, obviously). Since those hostilities still exist to this day, the story of ""Argo"" does not feel old or outdated in any sense.<br/><br/>Also, Affleck is given a fine supporting cast to work with, including such talent as Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and John Goodman, to name a few. Each of the cast members add a little bit of their distinctive talents to the overall production.<br/><br/>Thus, ""Argo"" is an extraordinary film for its ability to re-create the tension of the Iran Hostage Crisis. I never thought I would ever say this, but if I were voting in the 2013 Academy Awards, I would give the ""Best Director"" nod to Affleck over Steven Spielberg."

","Ben Affleck's track record as a director was short and brilliant, so after The Town and Gone Baby Gone i'd been looking forward to his next feature film.

To realize this, you don't have to do any research or even read Argo's entry on Wikipedia.<br/><br/>We're left with an average Hollywood thriller involving some known names and a lot of suspense just where the writers and the director needed them.

","The often-ridiculed future The Batman Ben Affleck deservedly picked up an Academy Award for Best Film for a suspenseful retelling of a complex rescue operation during the Iranian Revolution. Much like Ron Howard's ""Apollo 13"" the movie builds far more audience anxiety about how the story ends than any event that actual happened and can be pulled up on Wikipedia has a right to. Between these films, Argo stands as the superior accomplishment given the degree of difficulty. The complexity of the times portrayed and the number of conflicting constituencies involved in the story could have easily turned this into a morass of indecipherable political intrigue. Yet Affleck keeps the parties and their motivations straight in the minds of the audience. Casting choices add strongly to the entertainment value particularly the always fascinating Bryan Cranston, John Goodman and Allan Arkin. The proceedings go a little long but this adds to the eventually drama around whether all the pieces would come together to get the six hostages out of the country rather than being hung from construction equipment. In short, the most deserved Best Picture winner since ""Michael Clayton"" in '08 (I didn't say Michael Clayton won, I said it deserved to)."

Affleck did take some liberties with the real story. About midway onwards, there are a few too many liberties taken to Hollywood it up. They even gin up a car chase.

","""This is the best bad idea, sir, we have by far.""<br/><br/>Slick Hollywood entertainment from director Ben Affleck (with ""Gone Baby Gone"" and now this, Affleck has now cemented his status as a filmmaker to take serious; the guy knows what he's doing) takes a past event (of course, being a Hollywood joint, there's creative license taken for optimum effect) and provides edge-of-your-seat, gulp-in-the-throat suspense. The event was Iranians rising up against the US Embassy after a ruthless Shah received political asylum in the US. Some are kidnapped while six others in the Embassy escaped to the home of the Canadian Ambassador Taylor (Victor Garber), pretending to be guests but not going outside as to give Iranians in the area a sight of them. CIA 'exfiltrationist', Tony Mendez (Affleck) concocts an unusual escape strategy where he hooks up with a Hollywood make-up artist and producer (John Goodman and Alan Arkin) to fool the city of Tehran with this bogus movie project (a science-fiction B-movie called Argo) supposedly to be shot in Iran at popular spots of certain significance. This will be a ruse to provide fake disguises for the six hiding out at Taylor's: members of the movie project, complete with backgrounds and false identities. It seemed highly unlikely that this would work, but it could be the six Americans only hope. I realize this might offend Canadians and Iranians, but ""Argo"" felt like a suspensor using events from the Iranian Revolution to craft a nail-biting experience. The CIA gets a ton of support for how this all plays out, but Taylor deserves a great deal of credit because of his help to those six who got out. I think what I believe works so well is how the film takes us into Iran of that time ('79 & '80), with all that unrest and activism, the people taking to the streets with signs and aggression (they were sick and tired and showed it), cars on fire, certain ones being shot in the street, a body hanging from a crane for all to see, and marching crowds protesting about the shah that got away and America's role in that; this is where I think Affleck excels. That and his evocation of the period in Hollywood (love the effort put forth to spotlight the science fiction so popular of the time and the humor towards Hollywood politics) and the dramatics of the inner workings of the CIA are also a treat to see unfold on screen. Cranston (of Breaking Bad fame) has a nice, sizable role as Mendez' superior; he becomes at odds with Tony over ""calling off"" the operation, by order of their superiors. Affleck superbly alternates between his activities, the six Embassy Americans in Taylor's home, and the Iranian situation.<br/><br/>The final twenty minutes rings every amount of nerve-racking anxiety such a ""get the hell out of this place"" situation can providewhat makes this movie such a success is that even though we know the results, the direction still keeps us glued to the events as they transpire (this is a masterful piece of damned good direction by Affleck; kudos to his work here). The trip through a crowd of protesters in a van to get to the bazaar, the walk through the bazaar, the juxtaposition of Cranston trying to get the tickets confirmed while the seven are inside in the airport hoping the reservations are set, the permission to board the plane and the detainment, one of the six speaking to one of the detainee militants in the airport in the native tongue about the movie project, the call to the Production Office in Hollywood, and the boarding of the plane as the military rush to stop it; this is all expertly choreographed by Affleck. One of the best films of 2012 easily. Perhaps its major misfortune is the treatment of Canada as not having as significant a part as the CIA; it has the CIA opting to give Canada a token credit while they remain anonymous for its efforts."
"cherold","8","1","3","22 August 2013"," tremendously entertaining Hollywood nonsense
","While based on a true story, perusing wikipedia revealed that pretty much every time you see something in this movie and think, ""that can't be true,"" it's not. And you will constantly be thinking, ""that can't be true."" But while it's not much of a historical document, often, in Hollywood fashion, altering the truth even when the truth was interesting, on its own terms as a movie loosely based on a historic event, this is a whole lot of fun.<br/><br/>The basic premise is terrific, combining spies and Hollywood. The script is witty and the ending layers one suspenseful last-minute crisis after another (none of them remotely true). <br/><br/>I know there's an article in Wired that tells the real story, and I need to read that.

","Before I get into it winning Best Picture, I'll actually review the movie. One word... boring. You could argue the opening was exciting, but it wasn't at all and the characters that were taken hostage at the U.S. embassy were beyond bland. The only positive thing I have to say for this movie is the acting of Alan Arkin and John Goodman, and the rest is negative. Ben Affleck was one of the most boring leading actors I've seen in a movie, and I felt the screenplay would've been adapted into a much better movie with a better director and cast. This movie is also, purely lazy considering we ONLY get to see the ""safer"" hostages while we hear nothing of the other hundred or so that were being tortured. If the Academy would've went with another Best Picture with this genre, Zero Dark Thirty could've won, I would've been happy with any other nominee winning Best Picture winning, and I was in for a devastating blow when this crap won. The fact people could really like this movie is beyond me. My personal pick was between Silver Linings Playbook and Life of Pi for Best Picture... Oh well, maybe next year will be better."
"thewillt08","9","1","3","24 July 2013"," I Wonder if the Original Argo Would Have Been Good...
","Way back when, I was not a huge fan of Ben Affleck. I didn't think his movies were that good. I called him a wannabe Matt Damon and The Town was a wannabe The Departed. I still stand by the statement about The Town but after Good Will Hunting Affleck started to grow on me. He is a very talented actor no doubt but he isn't as good as the other actors that are very similar to him, meaning Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg. Then I saw Argo. I hate admitting when I'm wrong but Ben Affleck may as well change his name to perfect.<br/><br/>It's no secret that Argo won the academy award for Best Picture, and I think it deserved it but after seeing the movie a second time I wouldn't say it is flawless. It 100% deserves the Oscar but there were a thing or two wrong with the movie itself. I will start with the hate before I praise for 80% of this review. The basic plot is to rescue six Americans trapped in Iran during a mass protest and death to America ordeal in the late 70s. Affleck comes up with the idea to get them out using the idea of Canadian film crew. That is a great idea but I wish they spent more time in Iran. The idea of Argo is a cover up and they have that one intense scene and then the climax and the movie is over. There was so much time emphasizing the point of Argo and little work on the actual plan. The second problem is a nitpick and that is the movie only has a real impact the first time you watch it. The close encounters become less intense knowing the ending. I think that is important for a movie but it isn't the downfall of any movie at all.<br/><br/>OK, that is out of the way let's move onto the brilliance, I mean Ben Affleck. This guy has been around the film industry all his life and he directed and starred in this movie. He was absolutely flawless. The writing was near perfect. Each scene flowed into the next so well and there was a lot of emotional attachment to many of the characters. The opening scene into this movie is crazy and sets the movie off in the right direction. The beginning is always important and it does a great job of hooking the audience to the story. That then led into the John Goodman character and the other guy bringing laughs and entertainment which led into the intense and thrilling ending. The ending to this movie the first time is so special. Little words are spoken but there is so much tension and a race against the clock. <br/><br/>I never heard of this story before and I say this because it is historically accurate. These are real people and the fake Argo movie was really thought up. I'm surprised kids don't learn about this in school because the character Affleck plays is a hero and yes, the CIA kept it secret but when the story became public by Bill Clinton I thought schools would have taught it. In the credits of the movie they show real pictures of the events and people compared to the movie and they were spot on. Affleck and the producers did their research and down to the slightest detail made this historical moment come to life. From the shredding to the flag burning to the lady on the mic on TV. <br/><br/>Like I said, the characters are fantastic in the movie. John Goodman plays the funny man in a lot of movie but the fact that he pulls this off in such a serious movie like this is commendable. The six Americans each brought their own likes and dislikes into the movie and they portray the stress of the situation so well. Some of them don't like the Argo plan and how can you expect them to? It was easy to put myself in their situation which made it easy for me to sympathize for them which allowed me to love this movie. <br/><br/>The race against time and tension of almost getting caught is exciting. Audiences love covering their eyes, praying the Iranian police don't figure out they are American. It is that excitement that was probably exaggerated for Hollywood, especially the end, but this is necessary. This movie didn't have to be 100% historically accurate to be good. I can see people complaining about that but not me. It's a movie, sometimes you have to accept that the reality of the real life situation is not good for the big screen or business. I know the first time I saw this I was on the edge of my seat, holding my breath, waiting for the situation to unfold. <br/><br/>Overall, Argo is an Academy Award winner for best picture and of all the movies nominated it was the right choice. Do I love this movie? No, but it was very good and very deserving of the honor of best picture. This movie is a roller-coaster the first time but gets less exciting after that. It is still a great movie and it completely changed my view on Ben Affleck. So, for that I say touché to Argo and give it the WillyT Seal of Approval."

","Awesome movie. I always appreciate movies based on historical events. For a civil services aspirant, a movie on historical event showing state of international relations between Iran and USA is even more enticing. Picturization of movie adequately matches itself with timing of event (1970). The movie keeps the viewer absorbed and in a state of suspense regarding what will happen next.<br/><br/>The teamwork shown by the fake movie company is excellent. An idea can change life, movie shows how an idea can save lives. The events in the movie occur very fast and its very hard to predict what would happen next (except for the end of the movie :)).

","Have been hearing awfully a lot about this Oscar winning title, Most of them uttering that the movie was over-hyped and did not deserve the apparent glory. For all you critics out there, please refer to the subject of the following review.<br/><br/>Having said that, lets move on to reviewing this collectors item by Big Ben. Personally, I have been an admirer of the directing skills Mr. Affleck since his work in The Town. The guy is such a virtuoso, from his flawless acting in Good Will Hunting to his nonpareil of a performance in ""The Company Men"". His cold, strong and vindicating will was the only reason that helped Argo cruise its way from an average movie to an Oscar winning extravaganza."
"jtindahouse","8","1","3","13 February 2013"," Affleck continues his good form
","The television show 'Family Guy' once made a joke inferring Matt Damon did all the work towards 'Good Will Hunting' and Ben Affleck did none of it. With Argo, Affleck proves (if he hadn't already with the likes of 'The Town' and 'Gone Baby Gone') that he's actually very switched on indeed as to what makes for a good film. He has received seven very well deserved Academy Award nominations for Argo, and only time will tell how many of those it wins, but at this stage it is odds on to win Best Picture.<br/><br/>Argo is set in revolutionary Iran, 1980. It follows a secret operation to extract six fugitive American diplomatic personnel out of Iran led by Affleck's character Tony Mendez. It is based on a true story. Affleck gets the feel of the 80s and the location just right. The story flows exceptionally well and has the audience captivated throughout. The final 20 minutes or so are incredibly tense and brilliantly filmed. The editing is as sharp as you could ever hope for.<br/><br/>The amazing story always takes precedence and the actors are allowed to thrive amongst that. Affleck is commensurable with his usual performances and his laid back style fits in well here. But the star for me was Oscar nominated Alan Arkin. The man has an unbelievable amount of charm about him. It doesn't matter whether the joke he's telling is hysterical or a complete dud, he'll make it work. But he's not limited to telling jokes. You want him on your side, that much is for sure. Bryan Cranston is Hollywood's go to man at the moment. He can do no wrong, and Argo is no exception. Long may it continue because the man is an acting phenomenon and an Oscar nomination can't be far away for him. The rest of the cast support brilliantly and their Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture win at the Screen Actors Guild Awards was as deserved as you'll ever see.<br/><br/>Hollywood and The Academy love a film about a film, as seen last year with both 'Hugo' and 'The Artist'. And while Argo doesn't do this anywhere near the extent those two films did, I still think it'll be enough to win the Best Picture award. Naming the film 'Argo' (the title of film within a film in the movie) is rubbing this in everyone's faces a little for my liking, because it doesn't actually have that much to do with the story, but this is forgivable because it could be said this was a centerpiece for the events in the story. Don't get me wrong, it'll win it for a lot more reasons than this (most are mentioned above), but this will be the clincher. Argo is what I would call a solid film. It tells its story in a very neat and polished way, which is a good thing. Affleck can feel robbed of a Best Director nomination in my opinion, but I'm sure he'll be satisfied with the success it has had throughout award season."
"justinault45","9","1","3","12 February 2013"," Another Directorial Home Run for Affleck
","Argo is the story of six Americans who escaped the captured embassy in Tehran, Iran while under siege by the Iranians during the Iranian Revolution and the man whom took on the task of their rescue. This is Ben Affleck's third directing effort after having great response to both Gone Baby Gone and The Town. Affleck also stars in Argo as CIA evacuation specialist Tony Mendez. The film also stars Alan Arkin as film producer Lester Siegal and John Goodman as Hollywood make-up artist John Chambers. <br/><br/>Mendez is tasked with the daunting assignment of getting these six Americans out of Iran and imminent death. Mendez and the CIA have a long list of possibilities but none of them are plausible and each has a high expectancy of failure. Mendez comes up with the idea of him flying to Tehran and bringing the escapees out under the guise of being a film crew scouting a location for a Hollywood Science fiction film. It is here where I believe the theme of the film lies. I believe Affleck is trying to portray the sheer power of Hollywood and the emotions that a movie can evoke while also telling a gripping tale of international intrigue. It is evident that the American film industry carries great weight with the Iranian diplomats and officers as, even in this time of uncertainty; Mendez is able to take the six escapees to the center of Tehran in the middle of the day with the Iranian Ministry of Culture. The films basis is in that of international intrigue and on more than one occasion reminds me of Munich, Steven Spielberg's 2005 film about the Israeli government's secret operations after the Munich massacre at the 1972 Olympics.<br/><br/>Affleck uses lighting in a way that adds a great deal of detail to the feel of the story. Being a period piece set in 1980, the film is in widescreen high definition but has a grainy and dark feel throughout. I believe this captures the essence of the time and takes the viewer to that period. Everything about the film screams early 80s from the lighting to the text used in the subtitling. If Affleck wanted to give the film an authentic feel, he succeeded greatly. Additionally, there is the reoccurring motif of Mendez's desire to reconnect with his wife and son. This is brought up on several occasions throughout the film, with none being more memorable than when Mendez and Siegal are discussing family at Siegal's pool.<br/><br/>In the end, Argo is exactly what Affleck set out for it to be. It is a Hollywood hit and film-making at its finest. He draws on every aspect of the true story as well as earlier experiences behind the camera to create a well done, however historically flawed, film that captures the audience from the beginning and doesn't let go until the end."
"FlixChatter","8","1","3","6 February 2013"," A solid film that has the 'complete package' of being well-written, well-directed, and well-acted piece
","This is the second time I participate in an Oscar Best Picture write-up, and the first film I championed did end up getting the trophy in 2011. It's interesting to point out that both are based on a true story, and as I said in the final thoughts of 'The King's Speech' review, a film doesn't have to be dark, brain-twisting or nightmarish to be engaging. Certainly the subject matter of ARGO is dark and that first scene where a bunch of Iranian protesters stormed the US embassy in Tehran is down right tense, terrifying even. Yet the film itself is not bleak nor depressing, in fact the story is quite uplifting as ordinary people became unlikely heroes in extraordinary circumstance.<br/><br/>For those who haven't seen the film, ARGO is a dramatization of the ""Canadian Caper"" based on an article published in 2007, in which Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), a CIA operative, led the rescue of six U.S. diplomats from Tehran, Iran, during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. I talked to a few people at work who were old enough to watch that event unfold through television or newspaper, and they still remembered it. It's one of those events that left a mark in our memory, much like how 9/11 was to the younger generations. As for me, I had just started reading about it prior to seeing the film, yet even though I already knew the ending, it didn't lessen the experience of watching the film.<br/><br/>I love stories about regular folks rising above difficult circumstances and surviving against all odds, and Argo delivers such a story brilliantly. Kudos to Chris Terrio for his taut script and of course Affleck for his astute direction, and the film also benefits from such a strong cast, both the not-so-well-known actors playing the six diplomats, as well as great character actors such as Bryan Cranston as Mendez's supervisor, plus John Goodman and Alan Arkin as the makeup artist and Hollywood producer, respectively. Goodman and Arkin stole scenes as they brought the much-needed comic relief as the main players who created the fake movie. Certainly it was a big risk for both of them, there was nobody in this whole ordeal who did not make a personal sacrifice in order to develop this plan so the diplomats can go under the disguise of the film's cast and crew.<br/><br/>(SPOILER ALERT!) One of the most gripping moments of the film happened when the group, led by Mendez, scout for filming locations at a bazaar. When the crowd turned hostile, I truly feared for the group's safety. The entire scene at the airport was also incredibly tense, it kept on mounting during the runway chase when their cover was blown, up until the 747 leaves Iranian airspace. Now, I read that the two incidents did not happen, and Affleck has been criticized for having such an exaggerated Hollywood ending. Be that as it may, to me that's part of the creative license of a filmmaker in bringing a true story to light. I'm even willing to forgive Affleck who perhaps is the weakest link in terms of his performance in this ensemble, and the fact that Mendez is Mexican, I think his role should have been played by a Hispanic actor. Despite that minor quibble though, overall the film certainly holds up as a solid historical drama.<br/><br/>I'm glad the Directors Guild of America (DGA) awarded Ben Affleck with Outstanding Directorial Achievement Award for his third directorial effort, defying the academy for not even nominating him for Best Director! To me that's a huge snub as I think this is perhaps Affleck's best work yet. Affleck was pretty humble on his DGA speech, ""I don't think that this makes me a real director, but I think it means I'm on my way,"" (per Deadline). I already thought that Affleck is one solid director even after 'Gone Baby Gone,' but now that he's done three more-than-decent films, he's certainly not a one-hit-wonder. The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) also honored the cast members with an award for Best Ensemble in a Motion Picture. Both kudos are well-deserved and holds the key in what makes ARGO such a solid film that has the 'complete package' of being well-written, well-directed, and well-acted piece. Props also to Alexandre Desplat, who was nominated for 'The King's Speech' in 2010, did a great job in creating a stirring score that's atmospheric and culturally-relevant. The 'Mission' track is by far my favorite.<br/><br/>The Blu-ray/DVD release date is February 19. I certainly don't mind watching this one again. Hopefully The Academy would rectify the snafu of not nominating Affleck in the directing category by giving him the trophy for Best Picture."

","An ingenious plan like in ""The Sting"", a hostile environment like in ""Midnight Express"", a gripping cat-and-mouse chase like in ""The French Connection"" and a life-and-death crisis like ""Dog Day Afternoon"", ""Argo"" borrows so many elements plot and style-wise from 70's classics, that for one second, I wondered if it wasn't from the same era it was grippingly depicting.<br/><br/>""Argo"" is based on the 1979 Iran hostage crisis that hooked the American audience for more than a year and sealed the political fate of President Jimmy Carter, but while it takes places during the crisis, the plot focuses on the close escape of six American diplomats from the Iranian ""devil's claw"", thanks to a cover plan, meticulously crafted by Mendez (Ben Affleck), a CIA agent and expert in ex-filtration with the help of his best friend and colleague O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston). Ben Affleck stars as both the lead actor and the director of ""Argo"", which makes the mention of Warren Beatty in one of the film's funniest line, quite fitting. Indeed, with his black dark beard and eyes constantly full of angst and concentration, he reminded me of Warren Beatty in ""Reds"", the epic he both starred in and directed. Affleck, never too demonstrative or showy, displays the same level of maturity and technical realism that places him among the most actor-directors of his generation (or has he still something to prove?)<br/><br/>The main accomplishment of ""Argo"" is to be one of the most suspenseful thrillers of the last years, without exploiting the ordinary archetypes. No gun fights, no car chases, no explosions, the film is structured like a cat-and-mouse chase where each step is a life-and-death situation, and no mistake can be allowed. But let's get back to the 'plot'. The hostages' escape remained Top Secret until the case was finally declassified in 1997, and it's unbelievable that no director thought of adapting the story, if one thing, the material begs for a film. I don't want to reveal much of ""Argo""'s plot » because I suspect it would spoil a significant part of the enjoyment, which is the elaboration and the application of a clever plan: simulating the making of a film like ""Battle of the Planet of the Apes"" set in an exotic location.<br/><br/>With the help of John Chambers, an award-winning make-up artist, played by John Goodman and Lester Siegel, a producer, played by a scene-stealing Alan Arkin, Mendez understands the necessity of not omitting any single detail, everything must sound plausible. The film must have a script, a producer, and publicity, like an article in ""Variety"", all precautions that would reveal to be determinant. This is where the real delights of ""Argo"" are: once you get deeper in the plan, the film takes off to a series of disguises and manipulations punctuated by the project's catchphrase: « Argo F-yourself ».<br/><br/>The film blends many elements of drama and comedy but never distracting from the spellbinding suspense. The tension remains intact because at any moment, the plan can either fail or be canceled. One IMDb user complained about the predictability of the ending that ruined all the suspense, but we know the film wouldn't have been made if the plan had failed, so, it's all in the how that our hearts are hanging. On that level, suspense, action, the film has nothing to envy to today's overly spectacular and noisy actions films. ""Argo"" is a captivating thriller, absorbing you at each step of the escape, from the Canadian embassy to a local bazaar and pinnacling in an airport where you could feel the same tension than Billy Hayes in ""Midnight Express"".<br/><br/>And the reason I mentioned Parker's film is to tunnel the review toward the only seemingly flaw or invitation for criticism, which is the relatively unflattering portrayal of most Iranian people, as a cruel and angry-driven mob or easily fooled people in the best case. Granted the timing of the film isn't the most inspired with the whole accusations pointed against the Persian state, and the way it kind of damages the positive effect, last year's Oscar-winning ""A Separation"" had on the perception of Iran. <br/><br/>But I'm inclined to give ""Argo"" the benefit of doubt, for simple reasons. The film doesn't make big heroes out of the main protagonists, they are only trapped people trying to save their skins. The religious fervor and violence displayed can be associated with the troubled times induced by the Iranian revolution and the hostility toward the United States. Besides, the film is obviously told from the US perspective, so we can't deny that there were facing some hostility because of the US political choices, but this hostility is handled with the same realism than Gavras' ""Missing"", a whole country can have a nightmarish feel, but it trusts the viewer's intelligence, to put the film in its context.<br/><br/>And like in ""Missing"", in the same degree of partiality, America isn't spared from criticism, since some political involvements are discussed, and subtly denouncement like the opening monologue that established the role of the United States in the coup d'état that installed the Shah as a puppet leader. ""Argo"" is intelligent enough to make us close our eyes on some negative portrayals, quite insignificant. On the whole, it's a plot-driven film rather than a character study, which should be watched for the thrills, the suspense, and a sort of educational value, to know how to deal in time of crisis, and realize that sometimes, the craziest plans are the most successful. As O'Donnell says ""this is the best bad plan we have"".<br/><br/>What else to say? Well, ""Argo"" is a splendid achievement on the field of film-making, definitely one of the year's best if only for the scene when an agent talks Sci-Fi film with an Iranian civil servant, you wouldn't believe it happened? Hell, since Ben Affleck was spared a Best Director Oscar nomination, anything can happen."

"classicsoncall","10","1","3","28 January 2013"," ""This is the best bad idea we have Sir, by far.""
","Say what you will about the movie, but the story itself is outrageous. How the CIA conspired to rescue six American hostages by concocting a phony movie and film crew to extract them from the Canadian ambassador's residence in Iran is about as out there as it gets. I have to wonder what the principals in the real life drama must think to themselves seeing their ordeal reenacted for a modern day audience. Up till now I haven't been that keen on Ben Affleck as either an actor or director, but he's made a name for himself here. I'm catching this film after it's garnering top honors at the Golden Globes and last night's SAG Awards, so heading into Oscar season this film has to be giving fits to the ""Lincoln"" folks. Which is OK because that's what competition is all about. Historically, the picture takes it's share of liberties with the facts, and only deals with one facet of the hostage crisis. But it will have you on the edge of your seat for the most part, and going white knuckle every second the getaway plane is still on the tarmac. What we need now is another film that gets the rest of the hostages home after their four hundred forty four day ordeal."
"andreasschultz","8","1","3","16 January 2013"," Ben Affleck is a director, not an actor!
","When I first watched ""Argo"" I have do admit I had my doubts. Mainly because I have an ambiguous relationship with Ben Affleck, I was very nervous in terms of what to expect from him. As an actor he has always confused me, mainly because he's managed to cement himself as one of the top A-listers despite some horrible performances and choice of roles. Daredevil, Reindeer Games, Bounce, Jersey Girl were all titles that made us doubt the handsome brown- eyed actor. It seemed that he played the same role over and over again. For whatever reason we tolerated it for a while. Probably because we still remembered the glory days of Good Will Hunting and Armageddon. I remember seeing a spoof on Family Guy with Ben Affleck sitting on a dirty couch drinking beer. He suddenly exclaims ""Whoah! I gotta be Henry the 8th in twenty minutes!"" He practices saying ""Hello"" with a terrible English accent, snaps his fingers, says, ""Got it"", and leaves through the door. This 8-second clip pretty much summed up how I felt about him for many years and in 2003 he finally dropped the ball completely with Gigli, a movie often credited as one of the worst ever made. I for one, lost all respect. <br/><br/>We forget about him until 2007 where his little brother steps into the light with a strong performance in Gone Baby Gone directed by Ben himself. A well crafted fast-paced thriller that showed a new side of the forgotten star. 3 years later, it's clear. Ben Affleck is back with yet another brilliant movie. The Town. We realize that this man is a director, not an actor. His way of telling his stories is absolutely unparalleled and he manages to pull the viewer into the plot with wonderful character developments. The Town garnered Jeremy Renner an Oscar-nomination, and this is as much a compliment to Affleck as it is to Renner, since the viewers' involvement with the character and empathy is one of Affleck's main traits as a director. <br/><br/>Argo is no exception to Ben Affleck's brilliance as a director. It is so very easy to make a fast paced action movie with gunfights and car chases, and so extremely hard to make one with the finesse and fine-tuned timing that makes you sit on the edge of your seat. It simply goes to show you don't need all the violence, and fast paced hardcore action that currently dominates Hollywood. It is a revolutionary and brave attempt at bringing the thriller genre into a new era.<br/><br/>The movie sets off at the escalation of the Iranian hostage crisis. With no prior knowledge to this event, the viewer has no doubts about what is happening, and the conflict is as clear as daylight. 6 American diplomats working on the American embassy in Iran flees when Iranian rebels attack the Embassy. They seek refuge at the Canadian Ambassador's estate, who has to keep it a secret in order to maintain his peaceful and diplomatic relationship with the Iranians. When the CIA learns of the attack they hire their very best ""extractor"", Tony Mendez to extract the six refugees out of Iran. He comes up with an ingenious plan to make a ""fake"" movie, and use it as a cover to extract the Americans. He teams up with two Hollywood experts, director Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) and special effects man John Chambers (John Goodman) to fake the movie and travels to Iran to extract the refugees.<br/><br/>The tone of the movie is set from scene 1, and the tension is build up exponentially from here. The before mentioned finesse shines through so brightly, since you never know what will happen next. It's an extremely exciting and intense storyline, and Affleck manages to keep you interested without your typical big, visually spectacular action sequences. Alan Arkin and John Goodman manages to breathe some fresh, lighthearted and witty life into the otherwise serious movie. Through their amusing dialogues, they give the movie a charming twist and elevate it to a whole new level. Goodman and Arkin seem to be very comfortable in their roles and Arkins' Oscar nomination is indeed deserved. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck's choices of actors for the roles always amuse me. In The Town he chose actors like Blake Lively, John Hamm and Titus Welliver who are all strong and well-known actors, but mainly in TV-series. The same goes for Argo. Bryan Cranston, Tate Donovan, Clea DuVall and Rory Cochrane dominate most of the main cast. Whether or not this is intentional, it is worth mentioning since it says a lot about Affleck as a director that he doesn't necessarily choose the most famous actors, but the ones that are best suited for the role.<br/><br/>It pains me to have to write this last section of my review, but someone has to do it. Ben Affleck's role is not particularly good. It's not particularly bad either, but he just seems incredibly unnecessary in the sense that his performance is a bit spineless. I know a lot of people will disagree with me on this one, but his character just didn't speak to me at all. I read that Affleck originally wanted Brad Pitt to play Tony Mendez, but he had to back out of the project because of scheduling problems. Maybe that's why he decided to take over the role himself, and maybe that's why it seemed a little ""rushed"".<br/><br/>In conclusion Argo is literally the point where art meets action, and the result is a redefining piece of film history, that has cemented Affleck as one of the top directors of our time."

","There is little not to like about Argo - it is made with a real sense of care, pace, direction, and purpose. From superb production values - the 70s really look right, (not just the clothes and hair, but also a wonderful lack of self-conceit), as does the Iranian Revolution - to great solid acting, a superbly sparse script, and above all, excellent directing this is a film to simply watch and be carried along.<br/><br/>The true story of the rescue of six Americans who escape the Storming of the US Embassy in central Tehran is told with verve and great attention to detail.<br/><br/>It is not often we see a film that scores so highly in all categories and still remains simply tenterhooks watchable - this is suspenseful, watchable, and exciting stuff - and to balance that are nice low-key performances - one of Argo's key qualities is its ability to avoid melodrama while still piling on the tension - it's a very smart balancing act.<br/><br/>For this reviewer it certainly does stand as one of the better films of this or any year."
"Joxerlives","9","1","3","18 November 2012"," Proof you don't need explosions and gunfights to make an edge of your seat thriller!
","Gotta say, loved it, loved it, loved it! Brilliantly done, very unusual that the extremely liberal Hollywood (and famous leftie Ben Affleck) makes a movie with the CIA as the good guys. Some have said that it unfairly depicts the Iranian revolution but frankly when you watch the end credits you see how exactly true to life the films depiction of events is (the man being hanged from a crane in the Tehran street is especially disconcerting). If anything the film tones things down a bit to be painstakingly even handed, the scene where Iranians in the US are attacked by angry crowds as a mirror image of what is going on to the diplomats in Iran. The storming of the embassy scene and the part where their van drives through the crowd is probably the closest thing you'll ever get to a real life zombie movie. The panic and yet practicality of the diplomats is great, destroying all the sensitive materials before they end up in Moscow by the end of the week, knowing that they're helpless and can only delay the inevitable. The scenes where the kids reassemble the shredded material is very creepy and some great acting by the Iranian actors in the bazaar scene, just exploding into frenzied rage over nothing. In real life the British Embassy does take the Americans in before passing them to the Canucks and the Kiwis also help with the escape. Love all the Hollywood stuff, terrific performances all round, especially the scene where they buy the script. I think the 'Argo F*&k yourself!' line may be one of my favourite ever. The Iranian guide in the bazaar scene is also great, his idea for a movie very believable, you'd almost want to see it. It is amazingly good, the details they took to recreate the late 70s are fantastic, the 70s government offices are so realistic I keep expecting to see Diana Prince walk across the background. Especially loved all the science fiction refs, most of all the extras hanging around the studio lot in their Cylon outfits from Battlestar Galactica. The bureaucratic wrangling and inter-department infighting back in Washington are exactly what you'd expect in real life. And what a coup to get Jimmy Carter to do his voice-over at the end! One problem, why don't the Iranians just call their air force to intercept the Swissair flight? But maybe they didn't want to annoy the Swiss as they were going after the Shah's money. The sequence where they celebrate on the plane is brilliant, you share their overwhelming sense of relief. A little unfair on the Shah and the Western intelligence agencies, they installed the Shah to prevent Iran falling under the Soviets and he did a great deal to advance his people, saying he tried to 'Westernise' his country is too simplistic a way to put it. Still, small points, it's an amazing film and deserves multiple Oscars."
"DKosty123","8","1","3","3 November 2012"," Surprised But Not Shocked
","This film is an old fashioned drama in many ways. There are charges it is not accurate. I doubt if anyone who makes those charges knows anything about what really happened. There are references from real people to make one suspect these back yard critics know nothing about what really happened.<br/><br/>For example, during the closing credits Jimmy Carters voice is there saying the the guy who pulled this off did the greatest thing ever in history of cooperation between 2 countries. That lends some reality to the fact that some of this did happen.<br/><br/>The film almost addresses the issue of the problems the Carter Administration was having in foreign policy late in the movie. When they try to stop the operation, they mention the administration wanted to change how they were doing it because they were ""rethinking strategy"". This is a reference to the failed rescue military mission Carter ordered which killed a group of US Military folks and destroyed a couple of choppers in the desert.<br/><br/>The reminder of the problems the Carter Administration (Democrats) had is at a bad time for the Democratic Party after their recent blunder in Bengazi. While Obama killed Bin Laden, and pulled US Military troops out of Iraq while leaving thousands of US Security Personnel in their place, it does not appear the present Administration is much better than Carter was.<br/><br/>The Carter Administration is made to look foolish here in several parts of the film. None of the film was filmed in Iran though parts of it were filmed in Istanbul, Turkey.<br/><br/>Does this film anger Iran? It should not as the present leader of Iran is not the guy in this movie and is not any relation to the shah.<br/><br/>John Goodman and Alan Arkin are well cast as the Hollywood types. The lack of much real action makes you think this is a true story simply because no real Hollywood folks would make any movie without taking advantage of CGI. The main weakness here is trying to get the viewer to make the CIA into something it is not- a giving and forgiving organization that is helpful when their orders are not followed. That does not ring true.<br/><br/>It is refreshing to see well done drama with a realistic touch behind the camera. The story grabs the viewer."

","First of all, it must be said that Ben Afflect has re-created (and added a bit of fantasy) a situation that gripped the world.

To add to this , his acting performance as Mendez in first-rate. When doing a review it is usually fashionable to find fault (even to the extent of childish nit-picking), but that is not possible with this truly exciting story of an attempt to rescue American Embassy officials from Iran.

I kept thinking when those leaders in the Middle East where it took place see this movie they will be kicking themselves.<br/><br/>For me, this was one of those movies that kept up a good pace that didn't rely on car chases and shoot 'em ups (both of which I enjoy!). It was smartly written and acted. The gray tones of the movie kept it in character with the subject matter.<br/><br/>Not knowing the true story before now and seeing how incredible it was, just made it all the sweeter.

","And, no, I don't mean he's dead in the water. To the contrary. ""Argo"" is the film that will establish Ben Affleck as a film director and creative talent with real chops. He's not just a pretty-boy actor. Boy can direct, too. I was impressed with this film, and I fully expect Affleck and his cast and crew to receive lots of awards. I was living in Los Angeles in 1979, and I remember what the times were like. I was impressed with Affleck's eye for detail when it came to casting his actors, and setting the tone for his locations. The entire cast is amazing. Bryan Cranston, my new favorite actor, is at the top of his game in Argo, and I just loved John Goodman and Alan Arkin. I'm Latina, so Affleck did not come off as authentically Latino as the man he portrayed (CIA agent Tony Méndez), but it really doesn't matter. I think Affleck captured the important details of the Méndez character, and made him approachable to general audiences. All in all this was an outstanding film. I left Los Angeles in 1979 and moved to South America for a decade, so I missed this story when it happened in real life. (Back then we had no Internet, mobile phones, or social media to stay in touch. When you were lost in the world somewhere, you were really incommunicado). It was refreshing to see this real-life story come to life on the big screen in such a compelling way, and to know that it was recreated by a young director. It gives me hope for the future of filmmaking. Kudos to Affleck!"

","It's a solid film, with good acting, good directing and good camera work, but i didn't leave the theater with that feeling of ""wow, what a movie"". It didn't leave me thinking about it afterwards, and it didn't really leave me caring. That's not to take away from Ben Affleck. He's a very good director and I'll absolutely go see his next flick but i've got to say that TheTtown was much more enjoyable than Argo. It deserves praise as a decent movie and another solid directorial effort by Affleck. But it should not be nominated for any Oscars. Affleck will keep making his own films and eventually he's going to hit us with a film that is going to make him known as one of the great directors of our time. When will it happen? Only time will tell?"
"Ryan_MYeah","9","1","3","23 October 2012"," With the funny, exciting, and highly entertaining Argo, Ben Affleck has given us a truly great movie.
","After an unfortunate string of critical and commercial failures in front of the camera, Ben Affleck made a complete career turnaround behind the camera, wowing everyone (myself included) with his thrilling directorial debut Gone, Baby, Gone. He would direct something even better three years later with The Town, a fabulous movie. His latest effort is Argo, where he pulls triple duty as director, producer, and actor. I will admit that I thought all the hype and buzz surrounding this movie might be all for naught, as there are certain kinds of movies with hype I just can't buy into (just ask Prometheus), but this is one of those cases where I was happy to be wrong. The tense and highly entertaining Argo is seriously a great movie.<br/><br/>The film takes place between 1979 and 1980 during the Iranian Revolution, where angered citizens storm the US Embassy in Tehran, taking all but six people – who take refuge with the Canadian ambassador – as hostages. With time growing short, CIA agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck, himself) concocts a plan to pass the six people off as Canadian filmmakers on location scouting. This requires him to seek help from makeup designer John Chambers (John Goodman), and Hollywood producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), settling on a Star Wars rip-off called ""Argo"". With the plan in motion, and time growing shorter, the hard part is for Tony to convince the frightened refugees to go along with it, knowing the consequences should their cover fail.<br/><br/>Considering the fact that the movie is based on true events, you may already know how it plays out in the end. Even with that in mind, I don't care. Ben Affleck knows that the journey to that point is what really matters. Evoking the very best out of Chris Terrio's layered screenplay, he does an excellent job at emphasizing the tension of the situation, even amongst the more satirical moments of the film. His balance between the dramatic and comedic aspects is a highlight, as these two things manage to flow smoothly from one to the next without feeling disconnected from each other. With his creative sets, costumes, and photography, he also does a great job at immersing us in this believable late 70's setting.<br/><br/>I especially appreciate how he and Editor William Goldenberg handle the pacing of Argo, making sure that not a single scene in this movie is boring. You tell me this is two hours? The way it moves, I wouldn't have believed you. The movie uses a simple, but effective race against the clock structure that places an emphasis on intensity, and if you're heart isn't racing during the climax... Well, then you may want to check to see if you have a heart.<br/><br/>Of course, it's not all Affleck's direction, the script, or the detailed technical design that makes this movie. The Ensemble cast and the chemistry they share is just as vital. Ben Affleck is just as good in front of the camera as he is behind it, and the supporting cast he surrounds himself with is excellent. Bryan Cranston of Breaking Bad fame heats up the scene as Tony's CIA supervisor Jack O'Donnell. John Goodman is warm and funny as John Chambers. The six refugees are all also quite good, particularly Scoot McNairy as the hesitant Joe Stafford. The hilarious and satirical Alan Arkin wins standout notice, getting most of the film's best lines and jokes.<br/><br/>After all my apprehension to buy into Argo's hype, it's not hard to see why this is such a well liked movie. In fact, it's considered to be one of the front runners for this year's Oscar race. Could it end up winning big there? I sure hope so, because it's earned it.<br/><br/>****1/2 / *****"

","In the film Argo, Ben Affleck plays real-life CIA agent, Tony Mendez, during the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979, when Iranians took over the United States embassy in Iran. It was during the chaos, that six Americans escaped from the embassy, taking refuge in the home of the Canadian ambassador. That is where Mendez comes in, trying to get the six Americans out of Iran before they are found and killed, by using the cover that they are members of a Canadian film crew, making a Star Wars rip-off, called ""Argo.""<br/><br/>In so many ways, where the film works best is in dealing with the historical aspects of the hostage crisis and utilizing what was happening in the world at that time to create a history lesson for people, who like me, were not alive then. From a production standpoint, the film is meticulously crafted, often using 8mm photography mixed with the 35mm cinematography to create the look and feel of 1970's films like Dog Day Afternoon or All the President's Men. The cinematography definitely mimics such films, with its emphasis on natural light and hand-held camera work, making the scenes often feel like they were shot by a news cameraman in the real-life field. As well, the production design is staggering. Very often you see films that are set in the past that look as if they haven't been lived in and were built yesterday, but Argo actually shows these environments in a more real, lived in fashion. Of course, when Argo starts to deal more so with the film cover story, it often falters.<br/><br/>While this is all part of the true story, when Mendez is dealing with Hollywood producers trying to create this fake movie as a cover, the film loses some of its propulsive intensity, languishing in humor, rather than the suspense of the other nine-tenths of the film. However, these Hollywood scenes work on their own, thanks in large part to John Goodman as makeup legend, John Chambers, and Alan Arkin as an aging movie producer, both in top form, essentially portraying their charming selves. However, when Argo returns to the matter of the hostage crisis at hand, it excels with many scenes of white knuckle suspense. These are in fact, the finest moments of the film, when director Ben Affleck works to create a news-like feel in the hostage situations -- such as the embassy takeover or the escape from the Iranians at the climax -- by using minimal music and no Hollywood thrills to create a truly authentic, and terrifying glimpse at this event. For these reasons, Argo works brilliantly as a suspense thriller and as a time capsule, and that is why it must be seen, especially if you were not alive during the event and have limited knowledge of its history.<br/><br/>I give Argo an 8 out of 10!"

He takes a serious international conflict and twists it in American favour and profits from it claiming it as based on a true story. Truly self indulgent. I have to say that the film, as a piece of fiction, is gripping and would be very watchable (at a simplistic level), but if you are going to base it on a true story, you have to do that. Not twist the facts, glorify the Americans, and throw the usual Hollywood script cliches in. Okay, maybe all this is Ben Affleck's choice and fair enough if that's what his ego demands of his fame.

It opens in 1979 with chaos at the American Embassy. Six Americans escaped and are sheltered by the Canadian Ambassador. Ben Affleck plays a CIA specialist who constructs an escape plan that involves making a fake science fiction film. The idea is to promote a film through the media in hopes of faking location scout but in reality it is an escape plan. Affleck gets in touch with a makeup artist and from there he touches face with a producer who is about to receive an achievement award. While the fake film is beginning filming, Affleck travels to Iran and meets the Canadian Ambassador and the six Americans. Affleck instructs them to act as a film crew and they memorize their roles with regards to the fake film. Very powerful and an even bigger achievement for Affleck as director than his previous film The Town. Affleck is on a roll and also pulls off an effective performance as a CIA specialist who is good at his job but putting it together is problematic. After several career embarrassments about ten years prior, it is great to see him demonstrate his true talent. Bryan Cranston is superb as Affleck's CIA contact. In other roles there is John Goodman as a film makeup artist, and Alan Arkin as a film producer who provides some of the best comic lines.

I have seen several movies about terrorist attacks and all which are one sided,only a few have shown the two sides(Green zone,Flags of our fathers,JFK etc). If the reason for hate was also revealed it would have added more content and given us a chance to understand why these people did all this. And this led me to google for the answer and I got it in (http://thomasswan.hubpages.com/hub/Why-Does-Iran-Hate-America). But for me the best scene is where Ben's character sees car chasing the plane."

"gstepup","Null","1","4","12 February 2013"," Affleck will have staying power, a la Eastwood
","ARGO, from Warner Bros. Pictures, is a well-padded film that tackles the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis (52 American hostages were held hostage inside the US embassy, during Carter's presidency, for a gruelling 444 days!) but with a fanciful twist that, in the hands of a lesser star-director, would have come up shorthanded or even mundane and trashy. But Ben Affleck has come a long way from goofy performances (1997's CHASING AMY, 1999's FORCES OF NATURE) and ever since his marvelous team-up with Matt Damon for 1997's GOOD WILL HUNTING (for which they won the screen writing Oscar), Affleck has shown he IS a force of nature to be reckoned with. Take THE TOWN (2010), a heist movie that was an uncanny character study as well, which Affleck starred in and directed (culling an Oscar-nominated performance out of costar Jeremy Renner), with 23 nominations from various bodies and academies. Even earlier, take GONE BABY GONE (2007), an abducted-child thriller, with Affleck also directing an Oscar-nominated performance out of Amy Ryan, the film replete with 12 nominations from various fronts. The 42-year-old Affleck has, as of press time, the distinction of sheperding a CIA-thriller into an astounding 63 nominations! For the 2013 Oscars alone, wit: Film Editing, William Goldenberg; Original Musical Score, Alexandre Desplat; Sound Editing, Erik Aadahl and Ethan Van der Ryn; Sound Mixing, John T. Reitz; Gregg Rudloff; José Antonio Garcia; Best Motion Picture of the Year (Affleck, Clooney, Grant Heslov) Supporting Actor, Alan Arkin; Best Screenplay, Chris Terrio. If you've loved films like STATE AND MAIN (2000) and THE LAST SHOT (2004), ARGO will stun you, despite its taking ""poetic"" liberties (part of the actual events are glossed over, some parts in the film are fictitious, etc.) -- as it straddles the fine line between movie-making tract and CIA thriller. Affleck scores well by underplaying CIA agent Tony Mendez, who helped rescue 5 State Department agents to safety. How did Mendez do it? By pretending to be part of a filmmaking crew shooting in Tehran! Affleck disappears into the role, sporting a goatee and appearing meek yet hardworking, bedraggled and contradicted by superiors, yet his mind devising a million ways to lead both his team and the hostages to safety. Alan Arkin (Oscar-nominated), John Goodman, Bryan Cranston, Victor Garber and Kyle Chandler lend solid support, while the 6 important hostages (Tate Donovan, Clea Duvall, Scoot McNairy, Rory Cochrane, Christopher Denham, Kerry Bishé) convey terror, anxiety and (later) collective relief grittily. Much like his earlier project THE TOWN, Affleck directs with an eye for detail, creating nerve-wracking situations and interspersing it with comic relief from the faux film crew (Goodman is especially luminous, Garber hilariously spot-on). Affleck's technical crew is splendid as well (aside from the Oscar nominees, cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto telegraphs the terror of the hostages, the nastiness and utter evil of the hostage-takers, and the grace-under-duress whimsicality of the faux film crew, beautifully; Oscar-nominated Alexandre Desplat has also created evocative music to convey all those mixed emotions. I wasn't impressed much with Affleck from titles I've viewed like Armageddon, PEARL HARBOR and even REINDEER GAMES (dismissing his popularity as just a fluke, more so with the laughable DAREDEVIL), but his involvement with PAYCHECK (from my favorite sci-fi author, Philip K. Dick) and his articulate helming of THE TOWN has changed my mind about his just being ""an ex of J-Lo and Gwyneth."" Here is an intelligent actor-director that will have staying power for years to come. His good looks are a bonus! ("",)"

","Argo was one of those films that I wanted to watch before the Academy Awards, since it's been nominated and won so many awards so far (especially after Critics' Choice Award for Best Picture) it was on the top of my list. I honestly have no idea what took me so long. It was impressive and I think it really is the best film that's been made last year.<br/><br/>The film just sucks you in from the very beginning and doesn't want to let you go before it's done. It is very authentic, super realistic and every single detail in this films is so well-made, Affleck put a lot of effort to make the best out of it. Even the film itself was colored as an old one. I loved how they re-created places and clothes, even hairstyles. I really felt like I lived in the 80's, while I watched it. Apart from the visual part of the film, the story line was super tense and rather interesting. You wouldn't let yourself to miss one second of this masterpiece and at some places, you don't even want to blink and the closer the end, the faster your heart beats. The acting ensemble was brilliant and Ben Affleck, himself gave a performance to remember, I honestly think that this one is the tip of his career, he never did so great, before this I admired him as a director more, now he's equally good as an actor, too.<br/><br/>All in all, I highly recommend watching ARGO, not only to sneak a peek at the real historical events, but also to see a well-made and intelligent motion picture, which allows you to take a look at the cinema industry - Hollywood from the inside, a little bit. http://citizencinephile.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/argo.html"

","A story that, for many Americans, will forever be a distant memory. For others, a fresh memory that is taught to us and brought to life on the big screen. I am too young to remember when the six disappeared in Iran, but ""Argo"" puts the story on the big screen and gives a cinematic view point to the story. Is it 100% accurate? Maybe, who knows. No matter what, this movie is based on history.<br/><br/>In 1979, the United States had an embassy in Iran, during a period of Iran's history consisting of much change and great turmoil. At the center of that turmoil was the United States, blamed for providing refuge for a leader which most Iranians wanted executed on their soil. They were furious that the United States was allowing this man to live out his days, dying of cancer, comfortably and without fear in the States. All this anger and hostility towards Americans had to be channeled somewhere. And channeled it was. The Iranian people attacked and stormed the American embassy in 1979, taking dozens of American hostages. It was their hope to trade the hostages for the leader in refuge on American soil. What the Iranians did not know was that six Americans escaped the embassy as it was being stormed and sought a hiding place with the Canadian consulate. The CIA sent in their best man to rescue the six escapees, a man by the name of Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck). In order to get himself into Iran, Tony devised, with his boss Jack O'Donnell (played by Bryan Cranston), a plan to fake a movie which would be filmed in Iran, with himself acting as one of the producers of the film, and the six escapees being part of the film crew. In order to make the cover story legit, Tony gets the help of famous film executives Lester Siegel (played by Alan Arkin) and John Chambers (played by John Goodman). These four men work their hardest to rescue the six escapees, but the question on everyone's mind until the of the movie is: Will is work?<br/><br/>Ben Affleck has had some real duds over the last decade or so, Daredevil, Paycheck, and Gigli, being a few. But his role in ""Argo"" is by far the best of his career. He, along with cast members John Goodman, Alan Arkin, and Bryan Cranston, does a great job of really portraying serious danger and drama, while at the same time using perfectly timed humor to lighten the overall mood of the film, without cheapening the story or the movie. This movie is by far a drama, but the comedy that is thrown into the mix makes it an incredibly enjoyable movie to watch. This is not a movie for the kids, but a great date night movie if you're tired of chick flicks. In the words of Tony Mendez, ""Argo f*** yourself!"" A+"
"break-1000","10","1","4","27 October 2012"," Target audience of the movie
","I just watched the first two minutes of this movie where it tries to explain Iran history, most probably for the audience who does not have knowledge in that area. Unfortunately, when it came to the contemporary history of Iran and telling stories such as milk bath of the last queen or poor people of Iran etc. I recognized that it'd be a waste of time to watch the rest of such a biased story and I'm wondering what this movie tries to promote ... specially as nowadays everybody can refer to the records and see the economic growth of Iran in 70's, the life style of the Iranian middle class and the credibility of the government ... Actually, I'm wondering what kind of audience is targeted by the producers, at least in Europe, people with a little interest on the contemporary Iranian history know that the last queen of Iran is and has been a social right activist. I didn't see the whole movie but are they trying to pretend that the revolution of Iran is rooted in the poverty of the nation or the non democrat inefficient governance of the shah ... what would happen if people knew the truth behind the Iranian revolution and the real beneficiaries..."

If you don't catch this in theatres consider yourself missing out! I will be recommending this to everyone I know. Best picture is definitely in the cards for this fantastic movie.

"orangeisthenewawesome","9","1","4","22 October 2012"," WOW - exceeded my expectations
","My husband and I saw this to kill some time on a recent vacation. I did not know what it was about beforehand (yes, I live under a rock).<br/><br/>The premise of the movie comes together quite quickly thanks to an informative prologue and an excellent screenplay. Basically, during the Iran hostage crisis of the late 70s 6 members of the American embassy in Iran escape and take refuge in the Canadian embassy. To get them out of Iran a crafty CIA agent devises a plan so absurd it may actually have a chance of working. To succeed in his plan the CIA agent (played by Affleck) needs the cooperation of a Hollywood makeup artist and producer. <br/><br/>The movie is based on actual historical events. It has the grainy look of a 70s movie. You feel like you are transported back in time while watching this movie. The acting is superb with the exception (and I really hate to say this!!) of Affleck. Sorry, Ben Affleck is not a good actor! His directing is incredible, and I loved Argo. I just wish he had cast someone else in the lead.<br/><br/>Argo is a taut thriller. Even when you know what the outcome will be you will be thrilled by the events along the way. The tension in palpable. This is a tremendous movie that you must see at least once. I do hope Affleck gets an Oscar for best director. It would be very well deserved."
"michaelasheridanrd","7","1","4","21 October 2012"," Excellent dramatization of history that just misses its full potential
","This is Ben's finest moment in Cinema!<br/><br/>The movie flows very well, and keeps you at the edge of your seat. Even though this is a historical tale, the suspense leaves you with the feeling of the unknown as if you do not know the outcome. Ben's cool and confident approach brings life to his CIA role that goes against the Bond-style spy that is usually portrayed on the big screen. The movie will tell you an you-can't-make-this-stuff-up story that centers on audacity and courage of the CIA and the American staff that is rescued, but it misses its full potential by not fully developing the six Americans who the story centers around.<br/><br/>The story starts off in the Tehran Embassy and flashes between news footage and the acts the staff took, such as burning and shredding documents. Six members of the staff decide to escape out the back door with Iranians who happened to be applying for their visas. They make it to the Canadian ambassador's house, where they stay until they are rescued. <br/><br/>The movie then turns stateside, where the CIA plan goes into motion. This is a pivotal change in the film's focus, and I believe the film missed a golden opportunity to connect the six Americans with the viewers. Instead of building up the characters that are to be rescued, the film focuses its character development of the CIA agent and the Hollywood partners that help pull off the rescue. While this does not destroy the movie, since Ben Affleck, Alan Arkin, and John Goodman pull off their roles flawlessly, the Americans the movie centers around are left somewhat empty and hollow. By the time the rescue goes into motion, you are only connected with the married couple who received the most character development out of the entire lot of victims. This leaves a huge gap during the suspense scenes, as it is hard to connect empathically with the victims. For example, one of the most suspenseful scenes occurred when Ben drove the Americans to the airport. They had to pass through a mob of Iranian protesters. This was an extremely tense situation, but the focus was mostly on Ben's character rather than the Americans who were literally scared to death. For Ben, however, this is just his job and you can feel his confidence and sense that he is in control of the situation. His command lets the viewer glide through the suspenseful scenes with a feeling of overconfidence, rather than seeing the scenes through the victim's perspective which undoubtedly would have left the viewer with a much more personal connection to the struggles the Americans endured.<br/><br/>Does this ruin the movie? No! This movie is a must see for anyone who loves American history, Spy Movies, or anything in the Suspense genre. Argo will take you for a nail-biting-fasten-your-seatbelt ride that will leave you in awe of the audacity and bravery of everyone involved. Be prepared to see this movie from the perspective of the Spy and his Hollywood Partners rather than through the perspective of the people being rescued."
"dazfiddy","8","1","4","21 October 2012"," Fascinating story about a little known rescue mission
","Ben Affleck proves yet again,that he is a gifted director and that his previous offerings (Gone Baby Gone and The Town)were not flukes. Both films were set in Affleck's native city of Boston. <br/><br/>His latest film, Argo, tells the story of the rescue by the CIA of American diplomats in Iran during the Hostage Crisis.We are give a crash course in Iranian History taking us up to the events in 1979 when the US Embassy was stormed in November of that year.<br/><br/>The diplomats, six of them, hid in the Canadian Ambassador's residence, while the main hostages were held in the American Embassy. Affleck, plays CIA agent, Tony Menendez,who is tasked with getting them out of Iran. His plan is so outrageous that it could have come from an episode of Mission Impossible. Why not have the diplomats pose as a film crew making a sci-fi movie called....Argo? For this, Menendez travels to Hollywood where he creates a fake production with media notices, a producer and a script.The previous ideas for a rescue floated by the CIA were even more far fetched.<br/><br/>Comic relief is provided by Alan Arkin as the movie producer who realises what is at stake, and yet treats the whole thing with a world weary movie mogul air. Arkin gets the bulk of the film's funny lines. There are lots of visual gags about Hollywood especially about the poor Star Wars knock offs that Hollywood produced in the late 1970s.We are also given snippets of the tension between the CIA , the State Department and Jimmy Carter's White House.<br/><br/>Affleck assembles a huge cast of talented actors including Tate Donovan,Clea Duvall,Bryan Cranston and John Goodman and gets great performances. He also shoots his film with a grainy stock to give it that 1970s feel. The crowd scenes depicting the stormy of the Embassy compound are well done. You can smell the panic inside the building as the staff decide to burn all the classified papers.<br/><br/>Well done,Mr Affleck. Oscars nominations ahoy???"

","Ben Affleck is stoic, that is polite for devoid of emotion, in the lead role of this almost edge of your seat thriller.<br/><br/>If you are old enough to remember or to recall the history of US relations with Iran you'll know in 1979 the US Embassy was seized by what was described at the time as a group of Iranian students. Six Americans make it out and are given sanctuary by the Canadian Ambassador. Based on true events you know the six Americans get out of the country. But until now you don't know the almost real story of their escape. So what if the writers take liberties to heighten the suspense and danger. It's a movie.<br/><br/>The Hollywood back story with John Goodman and Alan Arkin is classic. The humor breaks up the tension. Affleck keeps it moving.

","Ben Affleck's latest movie has been getting a lot of buzz. And while it is not nearly as triumphant as his previous directing jobs (Gone Baby Gone, The Town), The finished product is both fun and smart entertainment that makes for an intense experience.<br/><br/>The story of Argo is based on the rescue of 6 hostages from Iran during the 1979 hostage crisis. Affleck's character works for the CIA, and comes up with the idea to pretend to be a Canadian film crew going to Iran to scout out locations. Since the other ideas are absolutely awful, this is the one they go with. Affleck flies out to Hollywood to meet with people that are on board to make a fake movie. John Chambers, a makeup artist, and Lester Siegal, a producer, decide to try and make it work. Affleck then flies over to Iran to try and get the 6 escapees out of the Canadian ambassador's house and on an airplane.<br/><br/>Since the story is historical, it takes away from the movie at times. The scene where Affleck finally finds the right script is tedious, and the suspense of them trying to sneak around and eventually trying to escape also at times is a bit annoying. However, as Affleck has proved in his previous films, he is a genius at creating suspense. The scene in the airport is entertaining and impressively original in its execution. Affleck also gets the feel of the late 70's down exquisitely well, and the Hollywood aspect allows for a multitude of self referential humor that is very well done.<br/><br/>The acting is all great, especially by Affleck, and John Goodman as the makeup artist. The six hostages are all interesting characters and finely portrayed. The real problem with the movie comes from the script, written by Chris Terrio. His depiction of historical events is almost absurdly derivative and predictable, which limits the movie quite a lot. The characters, too, seem to be a little too basic, but perhaps that is the fact that this is a Hollywood movie about a high concept Hollywood movie that actually happened in real life.<br/><br/>For all of its shortcomings, Argo is a thrilling suspense movie. Affleck is certainly no Hitchcock, but he gets the job done nicely. The movie is American all around, and that gives it both its greatest strengths and biggest weaknesses.<br/><br/>http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com/"

","Ben Affleck brings a stunning political thriller based on a true story this time dealing with the US hostage crisis of Iran in 1979. The film deals with an important issue on political history and shows the national diplomatic steps taken to release 6 US hostages from Iran. The story the film carries is much harrowing and just hits hard and makes you think twice. The screenplay, direction, acting all makes the film compulsively watchable and deserves much of applause due to the important issue of international interest the film raises which many filmmakers don't dare to. The film has a grisly feel like that of a thriller with a rusty look of 70s which grips you throughout and shows you some of the grisly truths from the history which haven't much appeared on the screen except in the newspaper articles.<br/><br/>With ""Argo"" Ben Affleck comes as a next iconic filmmaker. I have watched all his major directorial ventures and with each of the films he has directed, ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""The Town"", he has improved a lot and sets a notable achievement through ""Argo."" <br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars out of 4"

","Argo is a thriller film that chronicles the life-or-death covert operation to rescue six Americans, which unfolded behind the scenes of the Iran hostage crisis-the truth of which was unknown by the public for decades. As the Iranian revolution reaches its boiling point, militants storm the U.S. embassy in Tehran, taking 52 Americans hostage. But, in the midst of the chaos, six Americans manage to slip away and find refuge in the home of the Canadian ambassador. Knowing it is only a matter of time before the six are found out and likely killed, a CIA ""exfiltration"" specialist named Tony Mendez, portrayed by Ben Affleck, comes up with a risky plan to get them safely out of the country. The film stars also Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and John Goodman in supporting roles.<br/><br/>Militants storm the United States embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979, in retaliation for CIA involvements in Iran. More than 50 of the embassy staff are taken as hostages, but six escape and hide in the home of the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor. With the escapees' situation kept secret, the US State Department begins to explore options for ex-filtrating them from Iran.Mendez was brought in for consultation, criticizes the proposals, but is at a loss for an alternative. While on the phone with his son, he is inspired by watching Battle for the Planet of the Apes and begins plans for creating a cover story for the escapees being Canadian filmmakers scouting for exotic locations in Iran for a similar science-fiction film.<br/><br/>Mendez and his supervisor Jack O'Donnell contact John Chambers, a Hollywood make-up artist who has previously crafted disguises for the CIA. Chambers puts them in touch with film producer Lester Siegel. Together they set up a phony film studio, publicize their plans, and successfully establish the pretense of developing Argo, a ""science fantasy"" in the style of Star Wars, to lend credibility to the cover story. Posing as a producer for Argo, Mendez enters Iran and links up with the six escapees. He provides them with Canadian passports and fake identities to prepare them to get through security at the airport. Although afraid to trust Mendez's scheme, they reluctantly go along with it, knowing that he is risking his own life too. A scouting visit to the bazaar to maintain their cover story takes a bad turn, but their Iranian culture contact gets them away from the hostile crowd.Mendez is told that the operation has been canceled to avoid conflicting with a planned military rescue of the hostages. He pushes ahead, forcing O'Donnell to hastily re-obtain authorization for the mission to get tickets on a Swissair flight. Tension rises at the airport, where the escapees' flight reservations are confirmed at the last minute, and a guard's call to the supposed studio in Hollywood is answered at the last second. The group boards the plane just as the Revolutionary Guards at the airport uncover the ruse and try to stop their plane from getting off the runway, but they are too late, as Mendez and the six successfully leave Iran.<br/><br/>Argo has that solid, kick-the-tires feel of those studio films from the 70s that were about something but also entertained. Only it's as laugh outright amusing, as it is sobering. The top-notch packaging reveals for what it really is: less a nail-biting chamber-piece character drama and more a coolly realized, wildly reckless, action film. As for Ben Affleck effort as a director, it is easily the most cohesive and technically accomplished of his three films so far after The Town and Gone Baby Gone. His Oscar snub undeserved for this truly presents him as generation's best director. As for the acting, Goodwin and Arkin are simply amazing that makes the story wildly entertaining thriller that proves of the old Hollywood adage that fiction is stranger than truth after all. As for Affleck, he gives an average portrayal of Mendez - a kind of anti-Bourne, comfortable with his anonymity, living off his wits, not his fists. It is definitely one of the best movies of the year – a close second to Zero Dark Thirty."

","Argo is one of those movies where it is based on true events that have happened in history. You get the drama, thriller, and action all in one film. The script and dialogs are so intense that it will get you thinking about how hard it would have been if a U.S. embassy gets overrun. If you are into movies that deal with U.S. history or anything history related, this is the movie you will love to enjoy. Many will view it as a very controversial movie of its time but all it is trying to portray is what happened in real life with reenactments that tell the story of Americans stuck in a foreign country.<br/><br/>The movie is worth watching because of the cast and crew who developed the making of this film. This film has won 3 Oscar awards which should make you believe this movie great. The actors and actresses stayed in character so much that you would think it was close to the real back story. You can feel each characters emotion and action and how they were going through in the movie. The more interesting part is that it is a part of U.S. history. Portraying this actual scenario from our U.S. history makes it all the reason to watch. We all know history may be boring to most but watching this will make you think twice.<br/><br/>Argo is one of the greatest movies to release in late 2012. This film can teach many people about the history of our nation and how the U.S. deals with situations like this. Rescuing our own men and women from a hostile environment is taking a lot of risk and sacrifice for one's life. This movie proves that turning your back on your fellow citizens is not the way to go, at least during its time period of when this took place. This film is suited more to adults because understanding the film will probably take some time because of how complex the story-line is. If you love thrillers and drama movies, this film will go great for your collection."

","This movie seemed more of a documentary for me, as it portrays mostly accurate events which happened in the escape of these 6 Americans. The beginning was quite slow, but got interesting as the movie developed. What I disliked about the movie was how inaccurate they portrayed the country of Iran, and the Iranian people.<br/><br/>For example playing Arabic shaheeds a numerous amount of times in the city of Iran which is a PERSIAN city filled with Persian people, not Arabic - even the prayer that comes on in Iran is mostly in Farsi, not Arabic.<br/><br/>I also disliked the image and portrayal it gave to the Iranian people, it made it seem as if every single Iranian in the country of Iran wanted to mutilate the 6 Americans that were disguised as Canadians.<br/><br/>So as I was saying, i'm giving it a 6 for the accurate events."

This is the kind of movie people will pay to go see for a wonderful escape from campaign politics. I remember the time of these events well, but never knew how all it happened. The Canadian government played a big role in seeing these six people escape for Iran. Everyone risked their lives to see that they were all brought back home. Sometimes two governments can accomplish a great deal when the work together towards a common purpose. This movie captures all that and more. Everyone should go to see it. I have seen very few movies in my lifetime that I enjoyed as much as I enjoyed this one."
"jdkraus","10","1","5","14 October 2012"," A bit of history that most of us don't know about makes a great feat of movie-making
","In 1979, the Iranian people overthrew their government and stormed the U.S. embassy, taking hostages. For 444 days, these people were held in captivity. During this time, the news headlines filled our TV sets with on-location coverage as well as speculations on how this terrifying event could resolve itself. As our eyes were drawn to the fate of these 52 men and women, 6 Americans had managed to escape from the embassy and found shelter in the Canadian Ambassador's house. It was only a matter of time in which they could be caught, killed, or even remotely rescued.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck's new film focuses on both the persons and the covert operation that the CIA undertook to rescue these 6 people. Affleck plays Tony Mendez, a CIA ""extractor,"" who concocts the plan to pose as a Hollywood producer of a science-fiction film called ""Argo."" The idea is to land in Terhan and then convince the 6 Americans to assume the identities of a Canadian film crew for the movie, and thus fly out of the country. He is assisted by his CIA boss (Bryan Cranston), and relies on award-winning make up designer John Chambers (John Goodman), and producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) to green light both the script and the publicity of the film—as a means to make it credible.<br/><br/>In part what makes ""Argo"" a great film is its nostalgic feeling of the 1970s, such as the clothing, the glasses, the vehicles, and even the graininess in the film. The inter-cuts of real footage and photographs of the 1979 Iranian rebellion is a real bonus in selling the story's authenticity. ""Argo"" also does well in regards to holding the audience's attention. The story is well thought out and there is room for humor, drama, and suspense. While I found myself laughing a lot of the film, I was also put on the edge of my seat in the last 30 minutes. The use of hand-held cinematography and crisp editing adds to the intensity of the film. But what really makes ""Argo"" a great film is the cast. Each actor adds diligence and personality to their characters. This is particularly noteworthy with Alan Arkin and John Goodman—both practically steal the show with their clever delivery of lines and levels of sentimentality towards their shared goal of saving the 6 Americans. Affleck seems a little indifferent in his performance, but as seen in the movie, that is part of the character he plays.<br/><br/>As shown with ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""The Town,"" Ben Affleck knows how to direct good movies that engage us with good characters and story. ""Argo"" is another film to add to this list. In this year's coming Oscars, I hope ""Argo"" gets nominated for Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Editing, and supporting actor for both Goodman and Arkin."

","Against films like Amour, Django Unchained, Les Misérables and Life of Pi this was the film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture, I was definitely up for seeing it, and I was intrigued by it being directed by the lead actor, Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Ben Affleck. Basically in Tehran there is concern by diplomats at the United States embassy when increasing protester rallies are outside the gate, angry with the CIA involvement in Iran, and with militants climbing over the gate all documentation is ordered to be destroyed, American soldiers stationed outside hold off the crowd with tear gas and smoke grenades. The incinerator faults and the remaining documents get shredded, hostages are taken by the militants who barge in, apart from six diplomats, Robert 'Bob' Anders (Tate Donovan), Cora Amburn-Lijek (Clea DuVall), Mark Lijek (Christopher Denham), Joseph 'Joe' Stafford (Scoot McNairy), Kathleen 'Kathy' Stafford (Kerry Bishé), and Lee Schatz (Rory Cochrane), who escape. Sneaking through Tehran they go to both the British Embassy and the New Zealand Embassy searching for a hiding place, before Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor (Titanic's Victor Garber) accepts them, their situation is kept secret, but the US State Department has to smuggle them out. CIA exfiltration specialist Tony Mendez (BAFTA nominated Ben Affleck) is consulted on the situation, there are no logical proposals, but his son on the phone gets him watching Battle for the Planet of the Apes on television, and he gets the idea to create a cover story, where the escapees will pose as a Canadian film crew scouting for tropical locations in Iran for a science-fiction film. Hollywood makeup artist John Chambers (John Goodman), who has worked for the CIA previously, is contacted by Mendez and his supervisor Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston), they meet film producer Lester Siegel (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Alan Arkin), and together they work on the fake film. Everything that would be set up for an authentic film is put in place, such as a phony film studio, a script for a film that they title ""Argo"", i.e. the spaceship, and they design it like a Star Wars style adventure to lend the film realistic credibility, and while this is going on the escapees are becoming frantic inside the residence of the ambassador. Iranian maid Sahar (Sheila Vand) discovers the escapees and their time hiding is running out, and at the invaded American Embassy the revolutionaries have discovered shredded photographs of six diplomats, so Mendez makes preparations for himself and them with Canadian passports and fake identifications. Mendez gets told that, even with all the publicity for the fake film convincing people it is real, the operation is being cancelled so conflict is avoided due to the planned rescue of hostages by the military, and against this decision he goes ahead with the plan, which forces O'Donnell rushes to get the mission authorised so that Mendez and the six escapees can get tickets for a Swissair flight. They all arrive at Mehrabad International Airport and start through the security checkpoints and gates with enough ease, but a group of guards create tension start asking them questions in a back room, they want confirmation that they are a real film crew, with one of the guards calling the supposed studio in Hollywood, and Chambers answers the phone at the last second. Also seeing the fake film sketches and storyboards the guards are convinced to let them all pass through the final gates and board the plane, and meanwhile the photos of the six secretly taken on hidden cameras are being passed to the military still in the American Embassy, they realise that the six missing diplomats in the shredded photographs are at the airport. The guards rush to stop the plane as the seven fake film crew members are on the taxi on the runway and then boarding the plane, the police cars do chase after the plane as it starts moving, but they fail to stop it taking off, and with the pilot announcement the escapees know they have made it out of Iran safely, and the remaining hostages in Tehran will be protected with suppressed US rescue involvement, full credit goes to the Canadian government and the ambassador. The Intelligence Star is awarded to Mendez, but he would not be able to keep the medal until 1997 when the classified mission details were finally released to the public, the rest of the hostages were freed on January 20th 1980, and a speech by former President Jimmy Carter concluded the crisis. Also starring Chris Messina as Malinov, Kyle Chandler as Hamilton Jordan, Adrienne Barbeau as Nina, Zeljko Ivanek as Robert Pender, Titus Welliver as Bates, Bob Gunton as Cyrus Vance, Michael Parks as Jack Kirby, Richard Kind as Max Klein and Philip Baker Hall as CIA Director Stansfield Turner. Affleck is both fantastic in the leading role and as director for this true adapted story, the supporting cast members, especially Goodman and Arkin are great as well, the story I thought may be complicated or too political, but actually there are some great ideas put in, many to make you laugh and lots to keep you gripped, the pacing is terrific, the script is witty but also funny, and the ""best bad idea"" storyline is fantastic, it really is an award worthy, fun and thought provoking comedy drama. It won the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Editing and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, and it was nominated for Best Music for Alexandre Desplat, Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing, it won the BAFTA for Best Film and Editing, and it was nominated for Adapted Screenplay and Original Music, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture – Drama, and it was nominated for Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. Very good!"

","While the film is great, I wish it didn't downplay the involvement of the Canadians in the rescue. The film makes it seem like they mostly ran point for the CIA and basically just provided passports and safe housing. In fact, Canada did a lot of the logistics and the mission was primarily of their design. Likewise, the Hollywood aspects of the story were beefed up and fictionalized. Lester is at best a composite character; at worst he is entirely the screenwriter's invention. These flights of fancy make the film less serious.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the broad outlines of the story are true and the script's slanting of the material into the darkly comedic really works as a thriller. The laughs makes the scares more intense and vice versa. Lester might be an invention but in Arkin's hands he is an endearing lovable curmudgeon. The script contains several brilliant moments of exposition to keep the plot moving. A lantern at the end of the film is one of the best uses of the technique I have seen and Cranston delivers the line hysterically.<br/><br/>The period aspects aren't overdone and the blending of archival footage is quite neat.

","Literary critic Stanley Fish says that the film is a standard caper film in which ""some improbable task has to be pulled off by a combination of ingenuity, training, deception and luck."" He goes on to describe the film's structure: ""(1) the presentation of the scheme to reluctant and unimaginative superiors, (2) the transformation of a ragtag bunch of ne'er-do-wells and wackos into a coherent, coordinated unit and (3) the carrying out of the task.""
Although he thinks the film is good at building and sustaining suspense, he concludes,
This is one of those movies that depend on your not thinking much about it; for as soon as you reflect on what's happening rather than being swept up in the narrative flow, there doesn't seem much to it aside from the skill with which suspense is maintained despite the fact that you know in advance how it's going to turn out. ... Once the deed is successfully done, there's really nothing much to say, and anything that is said seems contrived. That is the virtue of an entertainment like this; it doesn't linger in the memory and provoke afterthoughts.<br/><br/>What can be added to this? Not much. What we got is a very very typical cliched edge-of-the-seat rescue mission movie with all the very predictable traits such as cliffhanger, last minute salvation, smart guys talk, and above all, very angelic good country prevaling over very demonic bad one.

"chausman","7","0","1","9 April 2018"," Historical Accuracy of Argo
","The movie takes place in late 1979, and Iranian revolutionaries took over Iran from the dictatorship of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who came to power with help of the United States. Following that, Iranian revolutionaries invaded the United States' embassy in Tehran. Six officials from the embassy escaped, and found sanctuary at the Canadian ambassador's residence in Tehran. To save the hostages the CIA hires agent Tony Mendez to create a plan to rescue the six escaped officials. His plan, to have the six escaped officials pose with canadian passports, in a hollywood film crew in iran to scout locations. <br/><br/>The setting of the movie is completely true. The United States did help the Shah to take power in 1953. Many reasons led to the hatred of Shah and then to the Iranian revolution. Issues included the Shah's Autocratic rule, corrupt government, and use of a brutal secret police force. Hatred of the Shah was widespread t among the lower class, Shiite Muslims, and other groups that joined together to move the country towards a revolution.<br/><br/>Many pieces of historical inaccuracy take place in several scenes where the scenes added or dramatised in order to make the movie more entertaining. One way we learned this is that the CIA gave briefings on fact vs. fiction in the movie via Twitter. For instance, the movie shows CIA agent Tony Mendez, played by Ben Affleck, going into Iran and extract the six officials as part of his ""film crew."" Mendez set up a cover story that they were working on a film called ""Argo"". Affleck, seen as a extremely diligent, and dedicated CIA agent, was sent into Iran by himself, working without any other assistance in the country. But in reality there were two CIA agents sent into Iran to pull off the plan. The movie showed only one agent, apparently to simplify the plot line, but in reality, the thought of lone agent Tony Mendez bringing off the escape of the six officials is false. <br/><br/>Also, another historical accuracy of the movie, as tweeted by the CIA, is the scene where the officials and Mendez go scouting locations. It is a very intense scene at a marketplace in Tehran, where suspense builds up, and where there's a potential for the escape plan to be foiled. However, this scene never happened. According to the CIA, the six officials and the CIA agent never went to the marketplace. The CIA says they all stayed in the residence of the Canadian official for 79 days, and never left to pretend to scout locations. <br/><br/>One more obviously inaccurate scene is the final escape on the plane, which is being chased by police cars, and iranian armed forces. This invention is obvious, as any vehicle attempting to drive side by side to a Swissair DC 8-62 wouldn't stand a chance. As the power behind its four Pratt & Whitney engines would easily blow the vehicles away, if they were even close to keeping up with the plane. Commercial airliners are traveling upward of 150 miles per hour when they take off. <br/><br/>In addition, one of the most intense, sit up in your seats, nail biting, and eyes-on-the-screen scenes, arguably the climax of the movie, where the plane tickets are not at the counter, furthering the rechecking of tickets and the authorization, never happened. In reality, according to the CIA, there were no issues at the checkpoints or the ticketing counter. And the intense scene when Iranian security calls the movie studio, to verify that there actually was a movie being made, is also fabricated. The flight, an early morning flight, was so early that the workers would be tired and the guards would be sleeping. There were no complications. <br/><br/>The film also doesn't show Canada's involvement. Canada was much more involved as the movie depicted. David Haglund, in an article on Slate.com, said the film was ""downplaying the actual extent of Canadian involvement, which was considerable."" As seen in the movie the only real credit given to Canada was the housing of the six officials.<br/><br/>To conclude, the movie was very effective in stimulating the viewers' emotions and creating heart racing scenes. I don't view that as deception, because this is a work of entertainment. While the film can be criticized for its accuracy, it's much harder to criticize the film's ability to get our hearts racing, and keep us engaged"

With 2007's 'Gone Baby Gone' and 2010's 'The Town' stamped on his resume, Affleck proves himself as a filmmaker fueled with astonishing directorial virtuosity It is little to no wonder he was the perfect choice of this political thriller, a briskly-paced, suspense-driven rendition of the stranger-than-fiction real-life event that marked an unlikely collaboration with Hollywood and the U.S government in effort to execute one of the most daring rescue missions performed in history. The central role of the film is the Iran Hostage Crisis of 1979-1981, a world-rocking event that not only marked the beginning of the blood-drenched tensions between the United States and the Middle East but shattered with distressing effects that still linger today. Of course, like most cinematic interpretation of historical events, the film is not empty of wielding creative liberties at the expense of significant historical accuracy. Affleck's depiction of the event has been held in the crossfire of controversary, with many deeming it as either exaggerated or fabricated from what really took place. However, that is nothing to take away from how grippingly entertaining it is. Set during the final decade of the Cold War, Affleck takes the lead role of Tony Mendez, a CIA agent who was approached by the agency to rescue six Americans who were hostage in the U.S Embassy in Tehran, Iran in 1979 in the heat of a political uprising before taking refuge at the home of the Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor (played by Victor Garber). Knowing that they would eventually be found and captured to be taken in public execution if they stayed there any longer, Mendez collaborated with Hollywood producer Lester Siegal (played by Alan Arkin) and make-up artist John Chambers (played by John Goodman) came up with a plan that was far out of the ordinary: pose as a Hollywood producer under a fake name and disguise the hostages as his film crew in search for location to shoot a fake science-fiction movie titled ""Argo"" in an effort to sneak them through an airport ran by angry-faced, gun-wielding guards. Intertwining the story is his supervisor Jack O'Connell (played by Bryan Cranston) who along with his colleagues keep contact with Mendez during his dangerous mission. <br/><br/>Curious to what the Iranian revolution was about? It was about rebelling against the Pahlavi dynasty under the ruling of Mohammed Reza Shah Pahlavi who was upheld by President Jimmy Carter. Swiping from the pages of the Tony Mendez's memoir 'The Master of Disguise' and Joshuah Bearman's memoir 'The Great Escape', this film, written by Chris Terrio, paints an authentic picture of the real-life events while appropriately masquerading as a tension-fueled race-against-the-clock thriller defies against the typical tropes of an espionage thriller. Ben Affleck shows he has an ambitious eye for detail and a heart for a palpable atmosphere that plays a major role in delivering the emotional touch for each scene taking place within the violent, dirty, socially unrest environment of Iran. He effectively lands the look of a period set in 70s and early 80s, and the intertwining of archive footage of President Jimmy Carter and news footage help set both the political and emotional tone. He also bravely exhibits with talent in front of the camera with a performance that, while proficient, doesn't quite mark one of his most memorable roles. It is his directorial efforts that takes the crown. He proves himself capable of staging each scene with a vivid eye for detail, and his effort pay off especially well for the final thirty minutes when Tony Mendez must lead the hostages through an airport where Iranian guards are watching with bold eyes, locked and loaded. The entire scene, crafted with captivating, you-are-there hand-held cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto, scorches with suspense as the atmosphere boils with arresting fear of what will happen if they get caught. On the other hand, there are moments of levity offered by John Goodman and Alan Arkin in scenes showing their time at the Hollywood studios as well as moments of their collaboration with Ben Affleck with their running gag line ""Argo f**k yourself"". <br/><br/>Argo is an electrifying, tautly crafted political thriller that bears powerful evidence that Ben Affleck holsters plenty of talent behind the camera as much as in front of the camera, perhaps even more so. The film is entertaining, smart, and rarely bears a dull moment. If the fictional liberties of the event don't bother you, you are in for a gripping, if not remarkable cinematic ride. In conclusion, it stands tall as one of 2012's best motion pictures."

","Argo (2012) Reviewed by Martin Davis. Retrospect Film on Facebook. In November 1979, Iranian activists storm the United States embassy in retaliation for President Jimmy Carter giving the Shah asylum during the Iranian revolution. More than 50 Americans are taken hostage but six evade capture and hide in the home of the Canadian ambassador. The events that unfold to secure their rescue if presented as a work of fiction would be absurd and stretching credibility to it's limit but 'Argo' is a true story. Ben Afflecks' terrific Oscar winning thriller begins with chaos and panic as the embassy is taken over and ends with the tension of the escape through the streets of Tehran and its airport. In-between is the incredible plan to get the six hideaways out of the country before certain execution if they are discovered. With the clock ticking and all avenues exhausted, C.I.A. operative Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) begins a plan, with the reluctant agreement of his superiors, to go in as a Canadian film producer scouting for locations for a science fiction film. The film is called 'Argo' and the six hidden diplomats will leave the country as his crew. If the mission is to be successful the cover has to be as realistic as possible. Enter Hollywood producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) and make-up artist John Chambers (John Goodman) who in the era of 'Star Wars' help promote the film as the next big science fiction blockbuster. A taut and gripping thriller, 'Argo' went on to win several awards including the Oscar for Best Picture. Highly recommended. Martin Davis. Retrospect Film on Facebook"
"cdjh-81125","9","0","2","15 October 2016"," Argo and Watch It Now
","Ben Affleck has proved himself to be both a brilliant actor and an amazing director and both of these are very clearly on display with Argo, one of my favourite films to win The Academy Award for Best Picture. One of the greatest reasons for this is the fact that it brilliantly mixes both entertainment value and nail baiting intensity. The first half of this movie is just incredibly entertaining and really interesting its reminiscent of a heist a heist film and it paints an interesting look at the Hollywood film industry and slowly builds the anticipation for the overall rescue without every seeming likes its just killing time until then. Once we get to the actual operation the film just completely switches tone but not in a bad way or an out of place way it helps to point out the real dander of what Afflecks character is trying to accomplish while showing the overwhelming odds against him and the hostages. There's not a single second where you are bored or invested or on edge every time a character looks over their shoulder or checks their watch you feel the exact same way they do. That's all because of the characters you learn just enough about them to make them feel like real life human beings. The performances in this movie are all top notch Affleck is just right he never overacts but is never bland and just comes across as genuine. But they real scene stealers in this film where Alan Arkin and John Goodman they were both absolutely hilarious in the film their lines and catchy and quick even when they say something that would seem to be stupid or false you believe them because of the way they come across and it's not all laughs and giggles with them when they are desperately waiting for any news on the operation you get a real feeling of concern from them and makes them all the more likable. The only real flaw I have with this film is the fact that it could've put more effort into telling the story of the other hostages that didn't get away and we're spending everyday with a gun to their head, we get a few quick scenes of them being threatened but it wasn't really enough and other than a little credit at the end theirs not real conclusion to their story.<br/><br/>Overall, I love Argo its entertaining, hilarious and riveting at all right times and I just don't understand the controversy for this movie, I will keep saying it you can't judge a film by the story or characters it based on you have to judge it as a film and this is a damn good one.<br/><br/>A/95%"

","Based on true events, ""Argo"" chronicles the life-or-death covert operation to rescue six Americans, which unfolded behind the scenes of the Iran hostage crisis—the truth of which was unknown by the public for decades.<br/><br/>The film is based on the ubiquitous and apt directed by Affleck, who with his third work, after the loaded Gone Baby Gone and unequal The Town, collect and process mastery a wealth of material, the introduction of hot situation in Iran and some original images from television broadcasts to the plausibility of the season and the actors, and gives a voice and a role in more than 20 main characters, without losing the tempo and the target."
"CinePendejo","8","0","1","6 August 2016"," A whole different type of spy thriller!
","Remembering the first time I have heard about this story in my Junior-year American History class - about a team of CIA spies pretending to be movie makers in order to save American hostages from Iran - I could only imagine how grueling and desperate this might have been, so much so that I could see why Carter had a hard time with this ordeal. No one can solve this ordeal as best as they could, even when we wane into the Reagan years. <br/><br/>I also couldn't imagine making a movie out of one of the CIA courses of actions, i.e. staging a movie production of a Star Wars knockoff called ARGO, without turning it into a bad macho-enhanced action movie. And yet, here I stand to say that I am OVERLY glad that the movie ARGO takes the more serious, fairly logical, but extremely gripping route with this premise. The result: easily the best movie of Ben Affleck's career and one of those rare movies that won Best Picture that easily deserves it. <br/><br/>POSITIVES: The performances are the selling point, with both Ben Affleck and Bryan Cranston selling their roles as the heavily cautious but emotionally determined catalysts of this endeavor, while Alan Arkin delivers some pretty funny lines. The movie also boasts some surprisingly impressive directing sensibilities by Ben Affleck; not only does he have an eye for shot composition and movement, but he also replicates the old-fashioned news takes quite well. My favorite shot is when they both promote the fake movie and parallels this with the torturing of the hostages, as they both show the desperation of the situation perfectly. But what really sells this movie is the third act when they try to get into the plane to get rescued. Jeeeeeez, talk about a heart race!!<br/><br/>NEGATIVES: Now I am sure this movie is being vexed by those with huge ""white-washing"" issues, being that the main character being cast as a white man, but this isn't really that much of a pressing issue for me, as it doesn't really specify any ethnicities of him in the first place other than his name. Not too much of a deal-breaker, but I understand why all the backlash came from. The movie also doesn't seem over saturated with more cinematic sensibilities, but I believe this movie isn't all that interested in doing so. Plus, it stands as gripping all on its own, but again I see why most of these people would say that this movie is ""unimpressive"". And yeah, to address the other critics out there who point this out, it sucks to see Jack Kirby (a Marvel Comic designer) getting a small role here, but again, that isn't too much of a deal breaker. <br/><br/>VERDICT: With great suspense and surprising turn from Ben Affleck's career, ARGO is certainly the best spy action thriller disguised as Oscar baits in years. Definitely, believe the hype on this one! RATING: 8.5/10 (GREAT)<br/><br/>For more reviews, check out my blog! http://itachisan125.blogspot.com/2016/08/review-suicide-squad.html"

","The movie is wonderful. It is exceeded all my expectations. By far is the best movie I've seen lately. Ben Affleck was exceeded himself again. His evolution as a director is a clearly an ascending one. The suspense reached maximum levels especially in the last half hour of the movie. It's a film in which Ben Affleck makes a remarkable role of a unadulterated agent in the period of a full political crisis. I can say that during the movie I felt like I am in the times of those years. It's easy to make a thriller with running or shooting activities, but it is damn difficult to convey suspense and keep the audience stuck to the seats. A must see movie!"
"sam_smithreview","9","0","1","8 June 2016"," What a film from a great director Ben Affleck
","Director Ben Affleck started out his amateur career after his directional debut Gone Baby Gone became critically acclaimed, three years later The Town came out with an Oscar nomination. Now 2 years on we have Argo, Affleck's best film by far.<br/><br/>Argo is the political thriller based on the 1979 Iranian hostage situation in which 6 Americans were left to fend for themselves in the center of Tehran. CIA Operative Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck) is sent into Iran to evacuate the Americans out safely under the cover of being a film production crew working on a picture called 'Argo'.<br/><br/>The film is absolutely amazing and definitely one of the best films I've seen in a long time, throughout 2012 and 2013 so far we have been treated with some great films such as Skyfall, Django Unchained, Life of Pi, Les Miserables, Zero Dark Thirty and more, but in my own personal opinion Argo takes the bait as the best of them all. Proof is present as it won 3 BAFTA's for best picture, best director and best editing, also nominated for a further 8 Oscars in 85th Academy Awards.<br/><br/>The film is packed with a sense of threat, peril and intensity all portrayed exceptionally well through the ensemble cast including Ben Affleck (The Town), John Goodman (Big Lebowski), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), Alan Arkin (Edward Scissor-hands) and Victor Garber (Titanic). The ending is by far the most intense ending I have seen in a long time, visually presented in such an astounding way."

","I really enjoyed this movie, it had me on the edge of my seat more than once, especially at the end. OK I know it is not 100% accurate but I don't mind when a film grips me like this one did. The tension and anxiety of those involved can be felt through the screen which illustrates just how well acted and directed this film is. Ben Afleck is perfect for the part, although he is one of the few who looks nothing like the character he is playing, but Alan Arkin steals every scene he is in, he is just brilliant in this. After watching this film I had a great sense of 'thank goodness that wasn't me', it was terrifying to think that these people were actually in this situation. Sadly if the same happened today, I doubt leaving would have been as easy as it eventually was. The direction and cinematography were superb and really reflected the feel of 1970s and the political climate."

","This movie teaches a lot. How we have to proceed with courage when you are in deadly crisis, Teamwork, Patriotism, sacrifice etc. This movie is very inspirational. After a long search for a good movie to watch on weekend, I found Argo. This movie is based on real event of Iran & America. It is the best Hollywood movie I have ever seen till date. History is very well portrayed and the direction is fabulous. It gives you goosebumps till the last second. Middle east is very dangerous when conflict and crisis occurs. It has very well pictured the situation where the people of Iran were hunting down Americans like hell. If you are an American , you can not miss this as it shows how the Nation cares about its citizen stranded in hell."
"Mobithailand","7","0","1","18 April 2016"," A good film - pity about the factual inaccuracies.
","This is the film about the rescue of 6 American diplomatic personnel out of revolutionary Iran in 1980. It is directed by and stars Ben Affleck.<br/><br/>The movie has won almost every award going and Affleck picked up countless best director awards, and even though he was not nominated for a best Director Oscar, he did pick up the Oscar for best film. This type of movie has never particularly appealed to me, but I have been a huge fan of Affleck ever since his excellent film The Town in 2010, and given the universal acclamation, I decided to give it a go. I wasn't disappointed. It is a very good film. As I heard someone say the other day, it was so good that you got totally caught up in the drama and excitement of the rescue, even though you already knew the outcome. A good movie has the ability to do this, as is evident in such blockbusters as 'The Titanic', where everyone knew exactly what was going to happen.<br/><br/>There is little I can find to say in criticism of this movie - but I will try... The cast provided a great ensemble performance, with no single actor being particularly outstanding, and the story romps along at a good pace to prevent our interest and excitement from flagging. All in all a highly enjoyable, and expertly made film, but whether it deserves the superlative accolades that have been showered upon it – I remain unconvinced. Personally, I think that 'The Town' is a much better movie. <br/><br/>It's probably just me; I'm sorry but I just cannot find John Goodman believable in any role he has played since he was Roseanne Barr's husband in the long-running American sitcom. To my mind, he always has been and always will be that slob of a working-class father with dysfunctional kids and a nutcase for a wife. Everything else he has tried to do, in my opinion, simply doesn't come off. He certainly doesn't ruin Argo, and does his best to deliver as good a performance, but for me, he is always the slob from 'Roseanne'.<br/><br/>There are also a number of totally unnecessary and silly factual inaccuracies. These deliberate errors glorify the America's involvement while disparaging or ignoring the contributions of other countries. This is quite sad, and it took a number of protests before Affleck conceded he had indeed misrepresented the truth. It leaves a bad taste in the mouth - a pity, because in all other respects, Argo is a pretty good film."
"luke-a-mcgowan","10","0","2","16 April 2016"," Ben Affleck's snubbing for Best Director is the single greatest Oscar travesty in history
","1. This movie is completely irresistible. In time this will rightfully become known as one of the best Best Picture winners of the 21st century.<br/><br/>2. Start with the premise. What a premise! You couldn't write a fictional movie half as entertaining as this one. In less competent hands, this film would have been a complete disaster of tone, but Affleck manages to walk the line with the deftness of Philippe Petit. Whenever the film threatens to become too fun or light, there's a stoic reminder of the stakes we are in, and that Affleck, Goodman and Arkin are doing their job for serious purpose. <br/><br/>3. The best example of this is a beautifully shot and edited sequence where the Argo team begin a table read for the film. Goodman and team sit down to read, Affleck seizes a wine glass, and then there's a tracking shot that follows the waiter into the kitchen, away from all the light and noise. In that quiet, the somber TV reporter relays updates on the hostage situation. Then William Goldenberg splices Iran scenes in with the preposterous table read. At the end, we feel exactly how we should - this is ludicrous, but we have to make it work.<br/><br/>4. My God the screenplay of this movie is delightful. There's the biting cynicism of Hollywood (""you're worried about the Ayatollah? Try the WGA"", ""you want to come to Hollywood and act like a big shot without doing anything? You'll fit right in). There's the wildly hilarious quips, such as a hysterical monologue that Alan Arkin delivers to the screenwriter of Argo. But most of all there's the tension-packed, terse dialogue that takes place in CIA headquarters or the Canadian ambassador's house. For whatever occasion, Chris Terrio is the guy.<br/><br/>5. This movie runs two hours but feels like five minutes. There is not a single wasted second in the entire film.<br/><br/>6. Affleck's direction is perfect with a capital P. He directs tension like no other director working today. The confrontation in the bazaar, the protest outside the bus, the delays in boarding their flight - Affleck's film leaps nimbly from one tension-packed set piece to another. His decision not to have the payoff until the quiet and innocuous announcement after takeoff makes the release of that tension all the better and more realistic. It is the single biggest Oscar travesty in history that Ben Affleck was not nominated (and did not win) Best Director for Argo.<br/><br/>7. Andre Desplat's score, especially the main theme that plays over the celebrations on the plane, is so soaring and beautiful it could have been placed over the celebrations of The Return of the King. It is such an emotional triumph that it plays so perfectly once the tension is gone. His minimalist work throughout the film makes that music swell all the better.<br/><br/>8. In addition to the main story, there are two critically important but tiny subplots. They amount to little more than two scenes to set up and then one scene pay off. The first relates to Joe Stafford (Scoot McNairy) and his doubt of Mendez's plan, but then saves the whole group by going along with the story and using his Farsi fluency to smooth things over with the guards. The other relates to the Taylor's housekeeper Sahar, who quickly deduces the hostage's identities. When confronted to confirm that information, Sahar makes a decision that many would make in that same position. It does much to show the resistance of the people of Iran to the violent Revolutionary Guard, and that not everyone is the same. <br/><br/>9. The acting in this film is wonderful. Bryan Cranston adds gravitas to every film not called Trumbo, with his slightly desperate but veteran persona. John Goodman is superb as the CIA- linked Hollywood makeup artist. Ben Affleck himself is fantastic in a guarded and subtle performance, every bit believable as an intelligence officer. Alan Arkin steals the show as the cantankerous producer Lester Siegel, who blusters along and drops curse words whenever he gets impatient with having to explain things to people.<br/><br/>10. The final frame of the movie is all the proof you need that this movie is something really special - absorb what is actually on the storyboard that Mendez brings home for his son and it's the perfect way to fade out."
"mylikallen","7","0","1","6 April 2016"," arGO Watch it, Its pretty good.
","First before I start, Once you watch the movie you will come back to this pun and maybe think its a little funny. Honestly, I had heard about this movie for some time. I saw the actors playing in it (John Goodman, Bryan Cranston, Ben Affleck.) and thought it has to be a pretty well acted movie. Whhat drew me away from watching it was the trailer that didn't really do the movie any justice. Evenutally I said ""Hey lets give it a shot"". I came to this movie with very low expectation. (I mean at best I was hoping maybe a 4/10). I am gladly saying now that this movie is very well deserving of a 7 star. It has a calm build, But what keeps you in it is the fact that you have a feeling throughout the whole movie that at ANY moment something is about to go down. That feeling takes you all the way to the near end of the movie where I found myself on the edge of my seat and wondering what is going to happen. Not only this, but this movie has superb acting(as I expected). All the actors/actresses do a very good job a selling the intensity in the parts they play. The only couple of flaws I see in the movie is that there are parts in the first 30 minutes that are slow paced. Which kind of mess with the movie. Also think they could of had a better opening in the very beginning. Overall. Even though is not an over the top awesome movie. Its worth the watch because of how it blew my expectations out of the water."

","I saw many reviews that bashed the film for ignoring Canada's role. However, anyone with half a brain can easily see what Canada did - what a huge risk was taken by the ambassador and his family and staff. Before seeing the film, I had never heard of this incident, so I went into the film without any bias. While the movie certainly focused on Tony (Ben Affleck) and his role, it doesn't dismiss Canada's role. I could clearly see how important Canada's role was and how Tony just came in to put the cherry on top of the sundae, so to speak. The film left it up to the viewer to assess the situation and assign credit where it was due. The focus was certainly on Tony and his part in the situation, but I am intelligent enough to realize how much Canada deserves credit. They just weren't the focus of this movie.<br/><br/>That all being said, the actors did a great job and the feel of the movie was dark and tense, just as the situation was. The introduction to the film clearly portrayed why the Iranian people would hate the US government and why they felt justified invading the embassy and taking the hostages. That doesn't mean I think the hostages deserved any of what happened to them, but it did provide a foundation for this time of extreme aggression. The close call at the bazaar and the airport added a good amount of suspense, even knowing they would make it. The scene with the cars chasing the jet was somewhat ridiculous, but the movie was really interesting and totally worth watching."
"trevorj-67694","8","0","1","25 March 2016"," A Solid Film
","From reading what many others have said, it appears that there is some controversy surrounding many aspects of this film. I would like to address those first. I personally knew very little about the story upon which Argo is based going into this movie. I didn't really care to know because I felt that there was no way it was a better film than Django, Lincoln, or Silver Linings Playbook. All of which it beat out for Best Picture. However, I caved and decided to watch it. Many say that it diminishes the role that the Canadian government played in the actual operation and greatly exaggerated the CIA's role. I can imagine this to be true. It portrayed the American intelligence as the strongest proponent of the operation certainly. Which, after research, I understand to be false. However, while the roles of the two nations may be reversed, I felt that Canada was not totally snubbed. After the film ended, I felt grateful for the Canadian help, particularly that of Ken Taylor. I don't think the falseness is a complete crime. In reality, the true heroes are not either government but the individuals. Regardless of who did or didn't do what, the dramatic liberty taken does not take away from the films quality.<br/><br/>From a technical aspect, this film is very solid. The camera work, the cinematography, the score and soundtrack, the directing, the script, and the acting are all spot on. Really, nothing about this film is going to blow you away. Alan Arkin and John Goodman give very strong and convincing performances. Neither of which I feel are Oscar worthy. Cranston, Affleck, and the rest of the ensemble give solid performances. The script is good. It is coherent, riveting, and easy to follow. Affleck has once again proved himself to be a great director. The reality is that this won't be very many people's favorite movie, but it does everything it sets out to do and does it well. It is just a good piece of filmmaking."

","Truth really is stranger than fiction. Really, if the remarkable events depicted in this film hadn't been declassified by President Bill Clinton and instead pitched as a movie itself, it would surely never have gotten off the ground. Sometimes though, a story is so good that it doesn't need the Hollywood treatment and while I admit I was completely caught up in the drama of the six Iranian hostages that got away (in more senses than one), I felt at times manipulated by the what seemed at times artificial ratcheting up of the pressure as the group, led by sole CIA man played by director Ben Affleck edged ever closer to freedom. For a film that tries so hard for the authentic documentary feel, I just doubted if their escape was just so last-minute with their would-be fundamentalist captors learning if their true identities just as they were actually boarding the plane and then were chased down the runway by pursuing police cars and trucks.<br/><br/>This grandstanding detracted from my enjoyment as for me there was more tension in the scenes where up-till-then reluctant unbeliever in Affleck's plan, Bryan Cranston has to improvise storyboardjng the imaginary movie under the scrutiny of gun-toting revolutionary soldiers smelling a rat, or the interminable wait before John Goodman's back-home movie producer picks up a call which again is make or break for the would-be escapees.<br/><br/>With its mix of original news-clips of the day and edgy hand-held shots staged today, I was certainly taken back to the dark days of the long-lasting original crisis. Affleck, behind a nostalgically thick beard last seen on Al Pacino in ""Serpico"", also didn't quite convince me as the cool pragmatic agent who imperils his own life to attempt to get the six out. On the plus side though Alan Arkin and John Goodman are both fine as the behind-the-scenes Hollywood schemers trying to make the back story look real.<br/><br/>Although I found the direction a little too busy at times, I fully understand the likely attempt to recreate the chaos in Tehran and the desperation in Washington to provide a solution, any solution to the situation. I was amazed at the way the Iranian revolutionaries put young children to work to establish the existence of the six refugees (the moral of the story, always use a criss-cross shredder) and likewise shocked at the sight of a suited businessman hanging by a noose from a construction crane in the middle of what otherwise looks like any other city centre in the world.<br/><br/>Images like those stay long in the memory as does much of this revelatory film which in my opinion just overdid the climax to what is a compelling and blood-thumping story."

","Or, to give the late CJ Haughey's legendary acronym its full name: Grotesque, Unbelievable, Bizarre, Unprecedented. <br/><br/>although, in Argo's case - Ben Affleck's film, and its original - it worked just fine, even if some of the finer details have been changed - for artistic licence, even plausibility stakes, as in... ...With anti-American feelings at fever-pitch following the overthrow of the Shah of Iran, A CIA operative (Ben Affleck) devises a daring and original plan to rescue six American Embassy officials who'd found refuge in the country's Canadian Embassy.<br/><br/>The paradox of Ben Affleck's first Oscar-winner is that it's less bloated, more focused, and more tightly-scripted than his two previous lower-budgeted films; it's also a comparative rarity in Best Film Oscar-winners of recent years in that it's hugely-entertaining, to boot - even if, of necessity, it sacrifices a smidgin of quality for mass-market appeal. But yet, although I was expecting to find fault with it - mostly because of the glaring faults of its too-ambitious predecessors - the faults,more minor quibbles, were largely in the early too-breakneck pacing, which sacrificed dialogue clarity, far too often, and the over-stretching of the tension in the climactic airport scene.<br/><br/>Initially, I was looking for comparisons with Costa Gavras' 'Missing' - which is perhaps the benchmark combination Hollywood entertainment-political thriller - and judging it somewhat unfairly, in comparison; but that was largely due to the surfeit of Hollywood-set comic elements; once the Affleck character left home, things started to get serious, most notably in a tense scene in a claustrophobic bazaar, where the six officials suffered a testing dry run. But, anyway, ranking it equal with 'Missing' would be impossible, because it's an altogether different beast, with different aims, although proclaiming it equally-successful in achieving those aims might be the best comparison I could make.<br/><br/>Perhaps its closest 'Missing' comparison might be Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Affleck's middle-aged, conservative middle-American, superior, who at times resembles Jack Lemmon's 'Missing' character's,when he begins to lose faith in everything he'd held dear, but even in a film which features notorious scene-stealers like John Goodman or Alan Arkin, performances - apart from the officials' real-live ones - were always going to play second-fiddle to plot.<br/><br/>Of course, there'll be the usual quibbles from the usual suspects about the usual Muslim caricatures, but, as Bob Marley once said 'an angry mob is an angry mob', and providing balance and fair play is best left to the history and civics classes.<br/><br/>A most pleasant surprise, and an absolute cracker of a movie."
"sandnair87","9","0","2","23 December 2015"," Ben Affleck's 'Argo' is A Crackerjack Political Thriller!
","The old adage 'Truth is stranger than fiction' has its teeth properly sharpened in Ben Affleck's brilliant thriller Argo, a blend of political history and Hollywood hijinks that goes right for the jugular. <br/><br/>The film begins by spiriting us back to the American hostage crisis in Iran. It's November 1979, and a mob is howling outside the gates of the American Embassy in Tehran. When they break through and storm the building, 52 Americans are taken hostage, but amid the chaos six manage to escape and find refuge in the house of the Canadian ambassador. Ten weeks later, with the Iranian intelligence services closing in on the fugitives, the CIA are still floating desperate schemes to rescue them. Enter 'exfiltration' specialist Tony Mendez (a fabulously understated Affleck), who concocts a desperate, yet ingenious scheme of his own while watching a Planet of the Apes on TV. The six stowaways will get out of Iran posing as a Canadian film crew on a location scout. All they need is a film to pretend to be scouting for. They know it's a bad idea but ""it is the best bad idea"" they have got. <br/><br/>This is where Mendez's inventive genius comes in. To keep the numbers in his favor, Mendez sets up a phony production company and enlists two showbiz old-timers (a delightfully crotchety producer Alan Arkin and a charming make-up artist John Goodman) to get the fake movie (a terrible Star Wars knock-off called Argo) noticed by the media. If Mendez doesn't already have enough on his plate, there are multiple passports to be forged, and a lot of fast talking to be done. One minor slip-up, and everyone dies - including himself. <br/><br/>The many whirring pieces of the plot click into gorgeous synchronicity as the escape begins, with the CIA keeping the operation running back home, the house-guests swallowing their fear, and Mendez at the center of it all keeping a cool head and an implacable stare. Ben Affleck does such a spectacular job of establishing the many dangers in Tehran, from hot-headed guards at the airport to the maid at the ambassador's house under pressure to sell out the house-guests that every step of the escape feels like a minefield, the tension ratcheted up deliciously. The acting of the ensemble cast - led strongly by Affleck, - is faultless.<br/><br/>It is no small compliment to hail Argo as one heck of an efficient movie machine. The product it churns out - packed not only with gripping drama, but surprising bursts of humor amidst the tension and the danger - just cannot fail to impress. It leaves the daring to the plot itself and allows the crackerjack precision of the story to be what blows you away.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck's dynamite film Argo isn't just a tense, impeccably acted thriller, but is the kind of serious drama that leaves you smiling because of how marvelously well it pulls everything off."

Acting is solid by all involved, but it is a craftsmanship of the movie that are true stars of ""Argo"". The only thing that i didn't get (and that is not issue with movie) is that Alan Arkin got Oscar nomination - as good as he is in here, this isn't Oscar worthy role.<br/><br/>Overall, if you like realistic nail biting thrillers based on a true story - ""Argo"" is the first candidate that comes to my mind.

Argo is a perfectly solid movie, filled with A-list actors and flawlessly delivered. What really blew me away was the attention paid in vivid detail to recreating 1979/80, it was like stepping into a time machine and a fun flashback for me.<br/><br/>Based on a declassified true story we follow CIA exfiltration expert Tony Mendez who uses the production of a fake science fiction movie called ""Argo"" as a cover for a rescue operation in the middle east during the Iranian hostage crisis. Mendez creates a phony Canadian film project, scouting locations with Iran as a possible shoot and then smuggles the Americans out under fake passports as its production crew.<br/><br/>Directed by Ben Affleck, my guess is that he was distracted as his portrayal of Mendez was pretty flat, his mood never changed, he was just tense, miserable seeming and kinda grumpy throughout. Was this his character? It is filled with A-list actors though such as Alan Arkin, John Goodman, Victor Garber, and Bryan Cranston who contribute in a big way to making this a great movie. 9/20/15"

This is in other words a Hollywood interpretation, of what happened in 1979, when a Hollywood film production (or almost) helped Americans to escape.<br/><br/>I think Ben Affleck is very good at making these films that either have a political agenda as this one, or shows a story about ordinary people that endures specific events, witch the people in this film also does.<br/><br/>I like the characters and the scenery, it is all very late seventies to me and works very well.

","Argo is one of those extremely well scripted movies that doesn't have much surprise or creativity. This true story easily translates to the screen and was done so without any faults. This film didn't take any risks and was a shoe in for Best Picture at the Oscars because of the size of the story and efficiency of the final product. <br/><br/>The film tells the story of the U.S. hostage crisis in Iran, during 1980, from the point of view of a CIA agent, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), who is tasked to come up with an rescue operation for six Americans. The idea for the operation is for Mendez to go to Iran under the guise of a Hollywood Producer scouting an area for a futuristic Sci-Fi flick. He would then make contact with the six Americans and bring them back under the guise of his crew.<br/><br/>This film received a lot of praise and certainly deserved it. Ben Affleck has shown yet again he can direct a superb film. He also proves that given the right story he can still show his acting chops. Along side him in this territory are Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and John Goodman who portray their roles expertly and with gusto. <br/><br/>Argo while being a simple story, is one that will reach a wide audience. When you watch this film you will have a smile on your face at the end. It gives you that feel good vibe that Hollywood loves to instill in its movies.

In so far as much, every other American alive at the time, lived through the hostage situation. So, imagine my surprise at finding this film so historically accurate and well casted. And, since I'm being totally honest, I'm not a big Ben Affleck fan either. Had this been my introduction to his ability and talent, I might have had a totally different opinion...might have even gone as far as to overlook Gili...Oooookkkk, maybe not that far. But still, his portrayal of Tony Mendez was spot on. The fact that I was able to forgo the Affleck appearance and give in to the character speaks volumes of his performance. The supporting cast is equally as diligent and well thought out. John Goodman, Alan Arkin, Tate Donavan, and Bryan Cranston offer up brilliantly faceted, integral pieces of the story.

"lucasversantvoort","8","0","2","5 May 2015"," Great thriller, enough said
","Argo is about the too good to be true, but nevertheless true, story about a CIA ""extractor"" who got six Americans out of revolutionary Iran by pretending to shoot a movie there. Yes, you read that right. An American (with the help of Hollywood) got six other Americans out of Iran during the Iran Hostage Crisis while pretending to make a movie. So naturally, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood made a film out of it.<br/><br/>This daring rescue, dubbed the ""Canadian Caper"", was carried out by CIA extractor Tony Mendez (played here by Ben Affleck). After being informed of the six Americans who evaded capture by seeking refuge in the Canadian Ambassador's home, he devices an idea (whether he devised it alone or not, I don't know). He will, with the help of a famous Hollywood producer (Alan Arkin) and Planet of the Apes's make-up artist John Chambers (John Goodman), create the illusion of a film called Argo being made. This will allow him to enter Iran pretending to scout locations for this film without causing too much fuss, find the six Americans, provide them with fake identities and cover stories and fly them out of Iran.<br/><br/>This, combined with credible performances, cinematography and editing, results in a very tense film which doesn't rely as much on typical action scenes filled with ten thousand round per second guns and bursting arteries as it does on the constant fear that the slightest mistake will inevitably result in death. This is seen when Mendez, in the Canadian Ambassador's home, bombards the Americans with questions regarding their cover stories: ""What's your middle name? What's your middle name? What's your middle name? Shoot him, he's an American spy."" The slightest doubt or mistake when answering Iranian authorities could very well cost them their lives and it is this realization that creates the tension within the viewer. In a time filled with cookie-cutter action scenes, it's pleasing to see Argo raising the tension of the story through merely the power of the story alone.<br/><br/>Because of the fact that Argo is based on real life events, it automatically raises the question: Hmm, yes, but is it historically accurate? These questions (for better or worse) have haunted movies based on historical events since forever. Though Argo stays true to the spirit of the actual 'caper' itself, there are many inaccuracies. Many of these revolve around the action sequences. Two major sources of tension are when Mendez and the six are pulled aside at the airport for questioning and an eventual runway chase where Iranian guards try to catch up and stop the moving plane with Mendez and the six on board. These are both fictitious and were added to, according to the producers, ""set up conflict"". In the end, the aforementioned questions are a bit irrelevant in the case of Argo. It's not a documentary, but a movie which by definition has different requirements to be successful. In the end, these changes don't matter much, because they don't change the nature of the story.<br/><br/>Two aspects of the film I personally find irksome: one, the attention given to Iran itself and two, the subplot regarding Mendez's home situation. With regards to Iran, there's a prologue providing the viewer with background information regarding the Iranian Revolution. This is good, but there's one problem: it doesn't matter for the rest of the movie. The movie is about Mendez getting the six Americans out of Iran and this automatically makes Iran and its many revolutionary citizens the antagonists of the story. When scouring a bazaar for locations for the fake movie, Mendez and the six are given countless, suspicious glances by Iranians and towards the end, they are detained at the airport and furiously questioned by angry Iranian guards. I couldn't help but think of old action movies like True Lies (1994) which are filled with stereotypes regarding the Middle East (although I'm not saying Argo's ethnic sensitivities are as underdeveloped as those of True Lies). One could make a counterclaim by saying that not all Iranians are portrayed as bad. For example, the Canadian ambassador's housekeeper, Sahar, discovers that the ambassador's 'guests' are actually Americans, but when pressured by Iranian authorities, she protects them.<br/><br/>Then there's the subplot of Mendez and his wife and son whom Mendez realizes might never see again, but (of course) eventually does. This obviously has the intention of making the viewer sympathize with Mendez, with Affleck's portrayal probably too restrained to generate a lot of sympathy. But since the bulk of the movie is about the six Americans escaping Iran, this part felt too underdeveloped to tug at my rusty heartstrings.<br/><br/>In the end, Argo does many more things right than wrong. When you get right down to it, the film is a thriller which by its very definition has to thrill audiences and Argo does this and then some. After watching this film, I realized that I had been completely engrossed and immersed in the film, pretty much unaware that I was watching a movie. Usually, I 'pull myself away from the film' whilst watching it to analyze certain aspects of what I'm seeing (cinematography, music, etc.)Not so much with Argo during which I was pretty much glued to the screen from beginning to end. True, one might complain about the many historical inaccuracies; apparently, Iran's movie industry is working on their own version of Argo, most likely to correct mistakes and present their own version of 'what really happened'. In the end, these inaccuracies don't stop Argo from being one of the best thrillers of the year."

But unfortunately, on a number of occasions this formula of giving importance on title review before watching a movie, goes terribly wrong. In case of Argo (2012), it took place again. Merely two of first ten title reviews of this movie, reviewed in a positive fashion, the balance of the seven were haters. But how come? Specially, for such a great movie, like ""Argo"", I don't understand. I've gone through some of the bad reviews and point out main reason which they identify as negative aspects of the movie. Let me cast my opinion on that alleged issue, which I acknowledge.<br/><br/>Most of the haters questions about factual accuracy of the event. Their allegations mostly like; this and that did not occur in real event or politically biased story telling etc, etc. Remember the objective of a movie is to entertain people by telling a gripping story on a 70mm film, not educating people about history, unless it is an educational documentary or video. A director could add or deduct anything in his story in order to complete a good movie according to his own satisfaction, irrespectively in case of a true story or in a fictional story.

","""Argo"" is a great thriller and heist film. It also happens to be a great period piece, with everything down to the smallest details perfectly recreated. With some films based on a true story, the bits that are added for dramatic cinematic purposes feel artificial and stand out but not in this case. While there are some parts that are fictional, they fit right into the story and add to a climax that is already so tense you'll only think to yourself that it may not have happened exactly that way long after the credits are over. The story the film is based on is so bizarre you will have trouble pin pointing fact from fiction, which also helps making the experience immersive. I'm no history buff and know little of the actual events that actually happened, but I found the movie so entertaining I didn't even mind that the script takes a significant amount of glory away from the foreign embassies that were involved in the real-life events and give it to others. A particularly strong point for me was the casting. Its spot on, some of the best ""people being cast as real-life people from news stories"" that I've ever seen. During the end credits there are comparisons between the actors and the real people and I was blown away to see that the casting director not only found great lookalikes, but also people that could carry the material they were given. The film is funny at times and it's incredibly suspenseful when it isn't. The beginning starts a little slow, but this is to build up the story and really immerse the audience into the time period. It's hard to describe how genuine and realistic the movie feels, with so many little pieces falling perfectly into place and this makes the movie very easy to recommend. I found ""Argo"" to be surprising, very enjoyable and concrete proof that Ben Affleck is a force to be reckoned with. (Theatrical version on the big screen, October 23, 2012)"

The CIA-agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) plans a dangerous operation in which the hostages get rescued by pretending to shoot a movie. I had high expectations before watching the movie and I was definitely not disappointed. The writing and the dialogs are gorgeous. The movie contains some emotional moments, just as funny side jokes (""Argo-fuck-yourself""). Furthermore, the whole cast was incredibly good. I especially liked the performance of Ben Affleck, Heisenbe- I mean, Bryan Cranston, Lester Siegel and the hostages. The acting was really convincing for me. Also the storyline is innovative and catchy (I know that it's based on a real happening). The inclusion of real-life footage at the beginning of the movie is an interesting idea as well. Honestly, I'm not even sure if the footage was real, but I don't care, because the director convinced me that it WAS. Good job on creating atmosphere. On the other hand, I have a few negative aspects I'd like to mention. Firstly, the ""dramatic turning point"" everyone was waiting for, was a bit too obvious. The mission nearly fails but with a little bit of luck the hostages still get rescued. I think there was way more potential to create a better ending. Secondly, I mentioned that I liked the performance of Ben, and I still do, but in my opinion his character was too flat. We, as the audience, barely knew anything about him. HIM, the MAIN CHARACTER. There has been a lot of time left to add some information about ""Tony Mendez"", to highlight his relation to his family and give him more depth. Lastly, I did not like that the Iranians were ALL represented as assholes who are violent. All in all, the movie was a success. Great cast, lovely plot, good creation of atmosphere and also the costume/make-up (whatever) team made a nice job. 8/10 stars from me."

","'Argo' is one of those films 'based on real events,' which basically means that Hollywood has beefed up various aspects to put bums on seats.<br/><br/>It's set at the end of the seventies when six Americans are left stranded in Iran, leaving Ben Affleck and his beard to hatch an ingenious plan to make them pose as science-fiction film makers and fly them out of there.<br/><br/>If you want to know how it ended, Google the true story. What you have here is Hollywood's interpretation of it. And, looking at it from an entertainment point of view, it does do the job. It's pretty intense in places, which, if you're after an edgy thriller, should leave you satisfied.<br/><br/>However, if you're looking for something a little more true to life, then you may find it hard to get over some of the major Hollywood views. As usual, the Americans are ultra-heroic, whereas the Iranians are presented as bungling incompetents who are too busy burning US flags to be any more terrifying that your average Scooby Doo villain. Of course there are the little alterations, too. In real life, the escaping Americans were temporarily sheltered by the British. In the film they take great care to point out how the British turned them away - grumble, grumble, grumble.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if you look at it as entertainment with some terrible seventies haircuts and a fantastic beard co-starring on Ben Affleck's face (which definitely should have won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, in my opinion) then it works.

","Argo is based on the declassified true story about a CIA agent who went into Iran and rescued 6 Americans under the cover of a movie producer. It won best picture 2012. I'm not too fond of the academy's decisions normally, but for once they made the right choice. Argo does deviate from the facts a bit, but that makes the film even more enjoyable. Unlike most other best picture winners, which are mainly either about history or an important issue, this is both a work of exceptionally high quality and an entertaining blockbuster that did great work at the box office. Acting wise, everyone does fine but Alan Arkin completely steals the film as a film producer and what is most surprising about the film is that it's actually very funny. The script is absolutely electric and consistently made me laugh, which I wasn't expecting at all. The film is also nail bitingly tense and that brilliantly made escape sequence is more stressful than rush hour on the tube.<br/><br/>Argo is consistently exciting and witty throughout, and doesn't really dip much. The settings and characters are recreated with brilliant attention to detail as well, and despite the historical inaccuracies they do not detract from the film. Some backlash appears to have hit Argo but what else was meant to win? Life Of Pi was good and visually amazing but it was too long and had too many dips, Lincoln was excellent but far too slow, Zero Dark Thirty is awful and Silver Linings Playbook is too slight for the academy. It's both Oscar worthy and fun, and made 2 hours vanish. It automatically makes up for Pearl Harbour and it shows Ben Affleck is one of the best actor turned directors out there and long may he continue to get directing gigs. Overall, Argo is a fantastic mix of suspense, humour and historical detail and anyone with even the slightest interest in history should go and see it.

","Argo is the Academy Award Winner for Best Picture of 2012, and while it was an amazing film, the actual story was far less interesting. In 1980, the tensions between Iran and The United States began, and the U.S. embassy in Tehran was overrun. Hundreds were held hostage for over a year, but six did manage to escape and went into hiding. Knowing that their lives were even more in danger than those of the hostages, the C.I.A. developed a unique plan to get them out of Iran. They sent in one of their top agents, with credentials claiming that he was part of a Canadian film crew. Armed with fake documents, he would smuggled the six out of the country. The film was intense and featured one close call after another, but in reality, getting them out was almost too easy. They were never stopped or questioned, and slipped out under the cover of early morning, without a hitch, but what kind of a movie would that be? Once these classified files were released by the U.S. Government, Hollywood saw the chance to tell this story in an extreme manor, and did so much to the delight of audiences and much to the chagrin of the other countries involved. Ben Affleck both stars and directs this film, and while everyone raves about his performance, I thought it was typically cold and flat. Ben Affleck wasn't interesting, the character he played was. Affleck wasn't any more likable or skillful here than he was in any other role and that's why he didn't win best actor. I've said it before and I'll say it again, the man is a fantastic Director, but a very mediocre actor. That being said, the extreme locations and huge cast, were his biggest challenge to date as a Director, and I was very impressed by the way he managed to pull it off. Argo is based on a true story, it's fast paced, and even though we all know what happened before seeing the film, it's still an edge of your seat thriller that really shouldn't be missed."

","This is a feel good movie because of course the hostages are freed but the remaining hostages were held for considerably longer. However, with swipes at the artificiality of Hollywood - the iconic sign has been restored despite being pictured as it was in the eighties, this is a film which celebrates the will to survive. Ben Affleck makes good films and is really not a bad actor - his heart is in the right place and maybe this is the way that the American public needs to be served up information on a very complex issue. The film tries to be balanced but only gives a short mention to the reasons why one of the most civilised countries in the world descended into religious bigotry and revolution. Surely the message is keep out of what you do not understand and even if you think you understand because you have learned the language and studied the culture - you don't. Perhaps someone should have thought about giving support to a despot such as the Shah might have placed its citizens at risk. I have met exiled Iranians who had suffered greatly at the hands of the revolution but I also met Iranians who hoped for great things after the fall of the Shah. When I was a student, we had the Shah's secret service tracking students on our campus with Iranian students afraid to speak freely. We can only celebrate that these people were rescued and well done Canada."

Likewise, Argo a movie based on Iranian Revolution in the year 1980 when a CIA operatives went on to save 6 Americans who's hiding in Canadian Ambassador building after the US embassy was captured by the rebel. Actor/Director Ben Affleck seem to have portrayed the real characters and the real events very well. Events like burning the flags, climbing the fence are well depicted and the characters also did the great job trying to get into the real characters.<br/><br/>But then not everything shown is true and really happened. As a movie, it has sketched some of it's own story, also taking most of the credits for the event when the actual credits should be to Canada and Britain. Few plots like chasing an airplane by rebel cars, fail of plan at the last minute and daring to continue on their own adds the emotion and sentiments to the movie for the viewers. The movie also portraits Iran only in a violent manners. The movie should have been able to confess that not always CIA alone could accomplish the impossible and carry on with the glory.<br/><br/>As a movie is based on history, the movie should have portrayed the real events giving credits to the real owners.

","*Spoiler/plot- Argo, 2012. It's 1979, the Iranian US Embassy is taken over by Muslim extremists and protesters. All Americans are taken to be used as hostages. Six members manage to get out and are taken in by the Canadian embassy. After a few months, the 6 need to be rescued by a ""Moses"". And it's only a matter of time before the Iranians discover that 6 members of the embassy staff are missing. So the CIA must get them out with a plan. Tony Mendez, an ex-infiltration expert comes up with a plan involving a Hollywood film production looking for film locations in Iran. He will go in as a producer scouting for shooting locations for a movie and that the captive 6 Americans are part of the Canadian production crew. Mendez goes to Hollywood and with help from a Hollywood insider friend makes the Hollywood connection and public relations in the media. And the sci-fi movie they're producing is called 'Argo'. Eventually he goes to Iran and gets the people out.<br/><br/>*Special Stars- Ben Affleck, Alan Arkin, John Goodman. DIR: Ben Affleck *Theme- Creative people in the government can help in some dire matters.<br/><br/>*Trivia/location/goofs- The script used for the fake film project was based on the 1967 science fiction novel ""Lord of Light"" by Roger Zelazny. In real life, makeup artist John Chambers (played by John Goodman) came up with the title ""Argo"" because he loved knock-knock jokes. In the film, the title becomes an off-color joke. In the movie, it was stated that both the British and New Zealand embassies in Tehran turned away the six American diplomats, leaving the Canadians as their only refuge. In fact the British embassy did shelter the six for a few days but it was agreed by everyone that the Canadian embassy would be more secure and suitable, so they moved. A New Zealand official transported them and the British also helped other Americans trapped in the country at the time. The director Ben Affleck acknowledged that he intentionally deviated from the real events in order to quicken the pace and build up the tension. With John Goodman's performance as John Chambers, this is the only time that a real-life Oscar winner is portrayed in a film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Ben Affleck was criticized by some viewers for casting himself (a European-American) as Tony Mendez and not a Latino/Hispanic actor. Mendez (who is half-Mexican, half-European) however said he had ""no problem"" with being portrayed by Affleck, and approved of his performance.<br/><br/>*Emotion- A well acted, produced and good paced suspense film with many twists and turns. Good tension by the viewer. The fact that this plot was loosely a true story only helps it's credibility and enjoyment. The end of the film is somewhat spoiled by the narration of X-president Jimmy Carter trying to positively cash-in on the international incident and the possible deaths of the 6 hostages. That's a shameful action from a America's shameful president of his era.<br/><br/>*Based on- The Iranian American embassy take over and hostage crisis."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","0","2","16 June 2014"," 'Argo' is a historical film done wonderfully and truthfully.
","In 1979 many Iranians stormed the U.S. embassy due to the United Sates taking the shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi into their country to treat him. The Iranian revolution was intended to take the shah out of power due to corruption and poor leadership. As a result of Iranians overthrowing the U.S. embassy, six Americans were taken hostage causing the U.S. to respond with a plan. C.I.A. agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) lead an operation in which he would fly to Tehran,Iran to pose as a Hollywood film producer filming a science-fiction film called Argo in Iran. The plan was to meet up with the six hostages and make them pose as filmmakers such as a director, editor, costume designer etc. Mendez took many preparations for this mission which includes making a fake production company, creating a film story, and making tough travel arrangements. Screenwriter Chris Terrio covers almost every part of this incredible true story beautifully. He shows the other agents and diplomats responsible for coming up with the plan and how ti was taken into action. He shows Tony Mendez's travel, work, and family life superbly that make it more than just a true story that is all about ""this happened first, then that, then this, then that, the end."" The scenes where Mendez gets the hostages and has to leave Iran is so intense you'll freak, even knowing how the film mends due to being a true story. One thing director/producer Ben Affleck does that is daring is fantasizing a little detail towards the end for dramatic play. The scene doesn't ruin the truth of the story in the slightest, instead makes the film intense and extra special. The film making aspects and acting are great, and the production design takes you deep into the story like it were real.'Argo' is a true story film with fascinating history that is stylized to make it intense and interesting so it isn't like your reading a dang history book."

","Argo was another great for director, producer, and star Ben Affleck but this time he is playing a real life person of which that is Tony Mendez the CIA operative who wanted to make a fake science fiction movie just so he can get the American hostages out of Iran of which Jimmy Carter did nothing about and what Ronald Reagan took care of on his first day in office as president of the united states. The movie also has other great performances throughout the film not only form Ben Affleck but from, Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, John Goodman, and Philip Baker Hall.

"burlesonjesse5","8","0","1","13 June 2014"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Argo
","Argo is Ben Affleck's third feature film next to The Town (2010) and Gone Baby Gone (2007). Based on the true story of the rescuing of six hostages from Iran in 1979 (by way of fabricating a fictitious story of a movie being filmed), this is by the book, meat and potatoes filmmaking at its finest. Argo is very well done, has an extremely focused way of storytelling, and provides an accurate look of the late 70's culture. The only misstep in this exercise may very well be Affleck giving the lead role to himself. He plays a C.I.A. infiltration specialist (Tony Mendez) who goes in enemy territory to aid the hostages and get them back to the states. Affleck is not a bad actor by any means. However, when he tries to do two things at once (starring in his movies and directing of course), his performances suffer (this is also evident in The Town). During the two hour running time, his screen presence is somewhat effective but he mugs to the camera quite frequently and delivers his lines in a sort of wooden fashion.<br/><br/>In the end though, Argo is a safe film. It doesn't take any risks, it's not entirely compelling, and it doesn't grip you like it should. However, the Academy disagreed and gave it 2012's Best Picture award. Again, this I feel, was the Academy being safe just like the movie. There's no doubt that Argo is a solid vehicle. However, it's more of a movie to admire, not embrace."

"kerr16","9","0","1","2 May 2014"," Argo is all about precision and following the rules to stay alive.
","Ben Affleck is the director and the star in the movie Argo, about an undercover rescue of six Americans who escaped a militant raid into the U.S. embassy in Iran. The Americans secretly stayed hidden in a Canadian Ambassadors home until a plan is revised to help them escape the country. The theme is all about following the rules to stay alive.<br/><br/>Argo is based on events that actually happened in Iran beginning in November of 1979. Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), works for the CIA and is their top candidate for coming up with a plan to help the six Americans escape Iran safely. Mendez recommends going undercover as film executives searching for a filming location for a sci-fi movie. Once he meets up with the Americans, he has the Iranians believe that they are part of his crew for the film. The film casts John Goodman as John Chambers who provides credentials for the ""production crew"". Victor Garber plays Ken Taylor as the Canadian Diplomat and Alan Arkin plays Lester Siegel, the Hollywood producer with all of the insights into the ""fake"" production of the movie cover up to help the Americans escape.<br/><br/>From the beginning of the movie to the very end, I was reeled in. I was in the 6th grade when I had first heard about the Iranian Hostage Crisis on the news. At that age, I remember feeling sorry for the Americans and yet a bit scared about what was happening and to hear that lives were lost during it all. Argo is a must see for anyone who remembers the whole Iran Crisis during this time.<br/><br/>This is a very moving and nail-biting movie pertaining to politics, foreign affairs and the misunderstood. The film gives some insight from the militant's point of view such as the Iran militants not wanting the Americans supporting the Shah of Iran, as this infuriated them even more. The militants would do anything to keep the current government in power. Argo exemplifies how far the American government will go to keep the American people out of harm's way. Argo may not be suitable for younger children, but definitely High School aged and up could relate it. Argo reminds me of Lincoln (2012). One man, Mendez (Affleck) has the responsibility to keep 6 Americans safe and bring them back to the U.S. during turmoil in Iran while being scrutinized by the government. Lincoln had the responsibility of keeping the nation safe from war while promoting the abolishment of slavery. <br/><br/>Argo is full of suspense, action and excitement. Don't even think of getting up to get some popcorn or you will miss detailed information that is throughout this film. The actors/actresses portraying the 6 Americans were right on target with their scripts and their apparel. The lighting was always a reddish hue behind the smoke filled rooms, as many of the characters smoked. Many up close shots of the characters faces showed the real emotions playing out in each scene, making the mood very believable. If they were scared, I felt scared, if they felt intimidated, I felt intimidated. This is how well this film drew the audience in. Tony Mendez (Affleck) played out every detail to keep everyone on their toes, and not blow their cover. The precision of the acting within the acting brought this film to a whole new level."

From start to finish I was gripping my chair with white knuckles which I haven't experienced since watching the Bourne films. This is truly a masterpiece by Ben Affleck who truly delivers above and behind the expectations you would have of him. <br/><br/>If there was to be any criticisms of the film it is that maybe in the case of heightening the drama and suspense of the film they have quite clearly made up some of the film. however I would argue that the way this is done is justified and that in the end it makes for a much greater movie experience. Some how with minimal background of each of the Americans you still find yourself extremely emotionally invested in the characters. <br/><br/>If only Ben Affleck too his movie making credentials to the shambolic Munich what a great film that could be!"

What makes Argo good is its depiction of the time (including styles of dress and hairstyles that will hopefully never come back), the confusion, and what a mess the whole relationship between the United States and Iran was.

","Here is a movie that is in deserving of it's Best Picture trophy and this movie is of course, Argo. This is not entirely historically accurate, but this film made me want to learn more about the Iran Hostage Crisis. Cinematically, this thriller is about as perfect you're going to get. The acting and the directing are very good and Affleck is maturing as a director. As technical things go, the editing is great and it features a beautiful score by Alexandre Desplat.<br/><br/>Affleck's third directorial effort may as well be his best one. He directs a story based on the real events in Iran. The American embassy in Iran has been taken over by Iranians and hostages have been taken except for six of those who escaped. The CIA has assigned Tony Mendez to head to Iran under the guise of a filmmaker who is on a location scout for his new film, Argo.<br/><br/>This film only have four big names and they all do well. Ben Affleck is strong as Mendez and this is one of his better acting roles. Bryan Cranston seems to be in everything these days and does well as Mendez's superior. Alan Arkin is excellent and he has the film's best quote. John Goodman also does a solid job.<br/><br/>Overall, Argo is the best movie of 2012 and that's saying something. All the ingredients come together to serve a tense, emotional thriller that keeps you on your toes. The film does a great job building up tense and telling the story for the first half before the second half unleashes the tension and action. Ben Affleck has proved himself as one of the best directors out there with ""Gone Baby Gone,"" ""The Town,"" and now this film. Not a historically accurate movie, but it doesn't need to be. I rate this film 10/10."

It's a mix of different things, you never know if the plan is going to succeed or not. Notable performances by Ben Affleck and Bryan Cranston.<br/><br/>The main positives I thought was the performance by Affleck, he really made me feel like he was hiding pain of his divorced marriage, but also made me feel he was dedicated to his job. Affleck also gives a great job as director and i reckon he should have received an Oscar Nod for it. I enjoyed the last hour of the film however, as we really don't know what's gonna happen if there gonna get caught, if there gonna get out, a really good atmosphere. I think the opening scene at the Embassy however was extremely well done feeling very believable.<br/><br/>The things i disliked were I think they failed to convince us it was the 80s, The 80s hairstyles were too fake, and really didn't seem believable.

"Buddy-51","8","0","2","27 February 2014"," If this were not a true story, no one would believe it
","From the truth-is-stranger-than-fiction file comes ""Argo,"" a movie based on a true-life story so unlikely and improbable that it could never have sprung full-blown from the mind of a screenwriter. And if it did, it would certainly never have been green-lit by any self-respecting studio. That it WAS based on a true story made it possible for director Ben Affleck to bring it to the screen and to win a Best Picture Oscar for his efforts.<br/><br/>The saga of ""Argo"" begins in the fall of 1979, when, in response to President Carter's providing sanctuary for the deposed Shah, anti-Western demonstrators stormed the American embassy in Tehran, capturing and holding sixty-some-odd foreign service workers there as hostages for 444 days. However, unbeknownst to the Iranians - and virtually everyone else in the world - six of the people working in the compound managed to escape to the Canadian embassy, where they spent the next several months in hiding. When the state department finally learned of their presence there, a plot was hatched to get them out and to safety. And this is where things really got weird. It was CIA operative Tony Mendez (played by Affleck) who came up with the bizarre, longest-of-long-shots plan to pose as a Hollywood filmmaker scouting locations for a sci-fi epic he hoped to shoot in that country, passing off the six embassy staff as his crew. In order to pull off the ruse - one fraught with untold risk and peril for all concerned - Mendez enlisted members of the movie industry as co-conspirators and allies, some cognizant of the truth but most not. ""Argo"" was the actual script that Mendez found lying in a pile of discards and around which he wove an elaborate hoax, even going so far as to take out ads in the trade papers in case the Iranians needed a little convincing that everything was indeed on the up-and-up. Like a modern-day Henry Higgins with the lives of six innocent people at stake, Mendez had to train these bureaucrats to act, speak and behave like a movie crew or face possible execution if their true identities were discovered. It was truly a special op to end all special ops, though the full truth of it remained hidden until the mission was finally declassified in 1997.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Chris Terrio mines a rich vein of dark humor as it juxtaposes the kitschiness and cheesiness of early '80's movie-making against the backdrop of a life-and-death real-world event. John Goodman plays makeup artist John Chambers and Alan Arkin portrays film producer Lester Siegel, two of the Hollywood bigwigs whose professional expertise was instrumental in securing freedom for the group. Bryan Cranston (with a full head of hair) and the seemingly ubiquitous Kyle Chandler (having also appeared in the similar ""Zero Dark Thirty"") provide some of the more familiar faces in a large and impressive cast.<br/><br/>There's breath-bating suspense as Mendez shepherds his ""crew"" past one security checkpoint after another with the Iranian authorities in hot pursuit. Will they make it to the plane on time, and, once aboard, will they be able to reach freedom or will they be somehow thwarted in their effort? <br/><br/>As with most movies based on true events, ""Argo"" faced its share of criticism from a predictable chorus of nitpicking naysayers for fudging some of the facts and for overdramatizing the beat-the-clock nature of the narrative. Well, get over it, folks; this is a movie, and, as such, a certain amount of dramatic license must be afforded the storytellers in pursuit of their art. And art it turns out to be, a canny combination of social drama and pulse-pounding thriller than never fails to astonish and entertain."

","The incredible achievement of being presented nearly 50 awards has not done the film Argo justice. These past few decades, it has been rare to see a person successfully direct and act in the thriller genre of film, but Ben Affleck has proved that it is still possible. Ben Affleck directs, produces, and stars in this historical thriller, which captures its viewers in a whirlwind of suspense with its daring directing and brilliant acting. <br/><br/>Argo is the (almost) true story of Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), a CIA operative who successfully leads six Americans out of the 1979 Iran hostage crisis and into safety by fabricating a movie and posing as a film crew. <br/><br/>Although this story is based on true events, know not everything in the film is entirely accurate. Affleck took a praiseworthy risk as the director and changed some of the true events to create an even stronger film. For example, during the actual Iran hostage crisis, flying out of Iran back to America went without a hitch. In the movie, however, the airport scene is the most suspenseful ten minutes of the film, keeping the audience's heart rates at full speed anticipating whether or not Mendez's unusual plan will succeed and bring them to safety. Affleck's choice to change the true events at the Iranian airport into the thrilling fictional scene made the film all the more successful. <br/><br/>The airport scene was only one of the many moments that gripped the audience with its riveting, suspenseful emotions. Despite the film being 130 minutes, it kept the audience's full attention the entire lengthy duration with its frequent plot twists keeping the viewers adrenaline raised even after the credits finish rolling. <br/><br/>The incredible acting in the film was also a huge contributor to the films effectiveness. Argo pulled in a star-worthy cast including Bryan Cranston (Jack O'Donnell), John Goodman (John Chambers), and Victor Garber (Ken Taylor), but one actor stood out among the rest: Alan Arkin. He played Lester Siegel, a big-name Hollywood producer. Arkin's performance gave the viewers a source of comic relief in this otherwise intense film. Arkin effectively but subtlety added humor to his serious dialogue through his inflection and tone of voice. It is no surprise that Arkin's performance in Argo granted him an Oscar nomination for best supporting role. <br/><br/>Although, Lester Siegel was the only fictional character in the film, Affleck proved himself once again by adding this role into the film. Without it, Argo may have taken on too dark of a story line as many films in drama do. <br/><br/>Argo's incredible direction by Affleck and successful acting contributed to the film's immense accomplishments in the film industry. Affleck's film fully deserved its Oscar for Best Picture. The success and adrenaline-filled emotions Argo generated raised the bar for the entire drama, thriller genre in film for years to come."

Ben Affleck is absolutely superb as both the protagonist and the director of this film and everything Affleck seems to touch at the moment turns to gold. This film got huge plaudits from the critics and this film has just a bit of everything in it to create a real emotional attachment to these characters in this situation and create the huge tension towards the end of the film. The fact that this was based on a true story helps the narrative really hit hard on the terrible acts occurring in the film, there is also some cool references to other sci-fi films which are enjoyable. Overall, this film only has a few slow scenes also with the fact in my opinion Affleck's character's relationship with his family isn't explored enough to really care about it.

We watch characters that you feel for so badly because they are innocent and should not be in this predicament. These are characters that you can root for with acting just where it needs to be. The 70's setting is accurately depicted and this is a film that you can say ""I feel like we are in the 70's"". Once we reach the final act, you really don't know what the final outcome will be which keeps the viewers interested right until the end.<br/><br/>The most beautiful thing the film does is to depict how a film is made. The movie is not only original but you really learn how to make a film including how to do casting, marketing and set location. Most of it was stuff I knew but it is still some very fun and interesting stuff.<br/><br/>I could never love this film like some others and I don't see this having a big impact on me. It is a little long for my taste but Argo is a movie I recommend because we can learn so much about an important story and also see some outstanding direction by Ben Affleck. This is a film that in the end feels like a big fun history lesson."

","I was a bit sceptical about this film after nearly drowning in the wake of its hype and accolades. However, I did really enjoy it. The film is based on a very simple, linear story; that happens to be true. <br/><br/>Normally Hollywood would add in a few car chases, explosions or aliens to spice it up. Affleck surprisingly didn't. This leads the film to be fairly understated but engaging and tense.<br/><br/>It appears lots of research was done and the temptation to overly vilify the Iranians has been resisted. <br/><br/>In short,. A simple story very well executed. It's power lies in it's grounding, so don't expect a big Hollywood blazer, action is thin on the ground.<br/><br/>Watch all the way to the end of the credits"

","During the storming of the US embassy in 1979, six American personnel escape to the Canadian embassy. The CIA puts together plans to get them out of Iran.<br/><br/>The winning plan was to produce a Canadian science fiction movie shot in Iran. Tony flies to LA and gets together a director, a complete script that they own, a prosthetics genius, a walk-through of the script by a full cast of actors in full costume, and a storm of press coverage. In Iran, Tony convinces the six escapees to study up on their biographies as his crew.<br/><br/>The relevant ministry gets the script for the fake film, Argo, and the press releases. He writes Tony that he wants to discuss locations with his crew the next day. The six learn their new identities as movie people. They meet with the minister at the appointed place. This is not without challenges along the way. Presenting the difference between American and Canadian has to be done now and then.<br/><br/>In the night before the last day, the day to fly back, Tony grills the six on their backgrounds. After a long session of this, the movie tells us that Washington pulled the plug on the operation. So what do Tony and the group decide to do?<br/><br/>No surprise. They go through with it. Jack in the CIA threatens Hamilton Jordan with embarrassment if it does not go through.<br/><br/>The last piece was really delicate. The only Farsi speaker explains the story boards. The guard wants to verify with Los Angeles. Unfortunately, John and Lester are out of their office and blocked by filming.

At the time, the efforts of the Canadians were assigned roughly 100% of the credit for the plan and the successful execution. I remember feeling a great deal of kinship toward the Canadians at the time. Also, reactions from Canada in 2012 mirror the same view. So, accuracy was not set at a premium here.

This film stays in that line of directing and plot ark. Ben Affleck has been cultivating through his directing that has become a very dependable voice. In other words, when you hear Affleck is directing you know what your going to get So what are you getting when you buy a ticket to Argo? The story is a glamorized historical event that took place in the 70's that may or may not have anything to do with our current situation in the Middle East.

"donuthaters12","8","0","2","5 November 2013"," Up There With The Best Films Of 2012
","Argo is the best picture of 2012, according to the Academy Awards and after watching it twice it is hard to argue whether it is deserving of it's honor. I have seen most of the films that Argo was up against for Best Picture and I must say that there were much better overall films but none can match the intensity and suspense that Affleck has crafted here.<br/><br/>Argo's screenplay was written by Chris Terrio and won the award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Argo's plot sounds interesting even on paper but it when you watch it, you start to see the brilliance that most people have given this film credit for. The screenplay's strong point is the first half of the film where it focuses on the ridiculousness of the plan and the weight it bares on the lives of 6 people. I do wish that Terrio did a little more work on the film's dialogue as at times feel a bit too straightforward and simple. The other issue I had with the film, particularly in the extended cut, was the small focus on Mendez's family issues which would be fine if the film spent more time with it but the film only slightly focuses on it so watching it subsequent times, it does slow the film down. I love that Terrio has written Siegel (Arkin) and Chambers (Goodman) as comic relief as it keeps the slow moments of the first half to move along faster. A lot of the audience's negative reaction to the film is the inaccuracy of the film's story but to me that aspect is not as important. When a film takes a biographical/historical approach then it should be approached cinematically. If I wanted a film to focuses heavily on facts then I would watch a documentary.<br/><br/>I have seen all of Ben Affleck's directed films and I can definitely say, at least for now, that Argo is his strongest film. Affleck's direction is the star for this film as it meshes both comedy while retaining the weight and intensity of a suspense film. It may not appeal to everyone but I thought it was effective and it gave the film that style that other filmmakers can't achieve. Affleck's greatest achievement in film is the final 40 minutes of this film where it kept me locked towards the screen and always thinking on how the scene will play out.<br/><br/>Rodrigo Prieto is responsible for the film's photography, he is mostly known for his work with Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's films and Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain. Prieto was able to capture the late 70's effect in the image, particularly in scenes shot in 8mm and 16mm, but still able to retain that contemporary look and style that is found in recent films. The shot choices that both Affleck and Prieto has used for the film is fantastic. The shots that are chosen have definitely been planned and it shows the confidence that Affleck in his filmmaking abilities. I am glad that Affleck has chosen to take a much more patient and stable approach to the cinematography and avoiding the style that Paul Greengrass has perfected with his films, a camera that is constantly moving and have that shaky cam feel. Shots in this film move gracefully and I found this very attractive.<br/><br/>Alexandre Desplat is a composer who has worked with many of the big name films these past few years. Desplat has worked on some of my favorite films like Moonrise Kingdom and The Tree of Life. His work here may not be up to par with those films but his score is able to maintain and support that intensity that compliments with Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography. The score shows it's best moments in the final act where it becomes much more dramatic. If only the score is like this throughout the entire film then I would have given this area of the film more credit.<br/><br/>The film's cast is amazing. I can't stress enough the amount of familiar faces in this film and is done in a way that doesn't feel over the top and have us retracted from the story. Affleck is the protagonist of the film but there isn't much to the character in this film as the film's focus is the operation and the weight of it rather than having a personal and intimate focus. Bryan Cranston is probably the best thing about this film as he brings something here that I have not seen from him in his other films. I am a fan of John Goodman and he is always good on whatever film he is in and that goes the same for Alan Arkin. Both Goodman and Arkin delivers their comedic lines brilliantly with Arkin giving a much more out there performance. The actors playing the six Americans were cast perfectly and definitely worked well together.<br/><br/>Argo is great overall but it isn't a personal favorite of mine from 2012. This doesn't mean that it should not be given a try as you would be missing out on an experience that you would want to come back to over and over again. I am excited to see Affleck's next directorial effort and hopefully it would at least be at the same level as this one."
"TiagoRicardo","9","0","2","4 November 2013"," Affleck has done it again
","It's becoming a fact without a single doubt that Ben Affleck is a better director than an actor and ""Argo"" is a proof of that. I have to confess that I had the high expectations on this one and it did not disappointed me. In fact I would have never predicted that ""Argo"" was going to be such a very enjoyable ride. The tension represented in the early segments of the movie drives the spectator to a very amusing story about a man whose job is to take a group of people back to America. Alan Arkin character is great and Affleck is not bad at all. ""Argo"" is an attempt to recreate the escape from Iran of the American embassy employees and despite having some misinterpretations of the facts, it's a very well made movie and really pleasant to watch. ""Argo"" is therefore a victory for Ben Affleck's career and a great movie for everyone to watch!"

","Actor and director Ben Affleck tells the true story of a CIA agent, undercover as a Hollywood producer in order to rescue six Americans during the U.S. hostage crisis in Iran in 1980. I was afraid this was going to be one of those heavy-handed serious movies that is educational but is a watch-it-one-time-and move-on kind of deal. I was pleasantly surprised with a great cast of Alan Arkin, John Goodman, and Bryan Cranston and its fast pace. It played like an Ocean's Eleven movie with the feel and music of the times, and at the same time was very respectful of the subject matter and the people involved and brought the viewer inside the world of these six people. I would very definitely watch this again. It's interesting to see all the posts of those who found this boring and/or awful, when I found it to be very entertaining. But then again a lot people liked the new Les Miserables and I didn't. So there you have it. Watch Argo and learn and be entertained."

","When the movie was released I was strongly against the movie because, well, It was about my own country and my people. I was fighting myself to not watch this movie but I finally did and it really convinced me. Argo is inspired by a true story and it's true and if you ask any Iranian, they'll approve it. but it really doesn't mean that it hadn't been exaggerated! Sure, the situation in Iran back in early 70's was a disaster and people had been brainwashed by Khomeini but it doesn't mean all 35 million Iranian people were the same. These wildly acts continued to the Iranians respectively and that was the point when Iranian understood their wrong choice. But, Affleck's movie was pretty convincing and every time got my heart pounded that I never knew what's gonna happen next even though I knew the story itself. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 9/10 my point to ARGO."

","I've seen some some tense films in my time, but OMG the last 30 minutes of Argo, when everything is at stake and our heroes are literally seconds from capture, nearly made me bite my nails off. It's a perfect example of how to maintain protracted tension, so those of a nervous disposition may wish to look away. Of course, the whole movie is based on a true story, so if you know how it ends then that would diffuse the experience. I didn't though... and as those police cars were chasing that aeroplane about to take off... I almost fell off my seat.<br/><br/>It's a real return to form for Ben Affleck who, aside from starring in the lead role, directed the movie too. It also collected Best Picture at the Oscars... quite a feat for a man who's career was written off recently after a host of bad decisions. I can't wait to see how his Batman turns out in the upcoming Vs Superman film... in the meantime, he can be proud of his efforts here. The evocation of dodgy 1980's sci-fi flicks is outstanding, and the cast, including a hilarious John Goodman and Alan Arkin earn top marks all over.<br/><br/>Plus, Affleck makes Iran sufficiently frightening enough for the description Hell On Earth to not be an understatement. If we ever are forced into an Islamic state, we better panic. 8/10"

","Winner of 3 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Argo is Ben Affleck's finest work as a director, is one of the best films of its year & is quite an accomplished piece of storytelling that expertly recounts the real-life event that took place in Iran during the Iranian Revolution in which 6 US diplomats were rescued by CIA with the help of Canadian government.<br/><br/>Set in 1979 Iran, the story of Argo follows 6 US diplomats who go into hiding when Iranian revolutionaries invade the American embassy in Tehran, taking several of them hostages. In an effort to get its people out of the country, CIA goes through various options & eventually settles with an insane plan; to arrive in Iran for scouting locations of a fake Canadian film & smuggle its people as part of the production crew.<br/><br/>Directed by Ben Affleck, the best thing about Argo is the way it builds up its plot & manages to keep the tension alive throughout its runtime. Affleck shows massive improvement in his work behind the camera for he methodically elevates the anxiety that culminates with a nail- biting finale & in the process, adds another quality feature to his résumé as a filmmaker. But there are also many elements in the film worth complaining about.<br/><br/>The story takes a great amount of artistic license with the true event, completely downplays the role other nations played in making the then-covert operation a success, makes use of few inaccuracies for dramatic purposes & while these elements did provide a more thrilling cinematic experience, the absence of subtitles when any Iranian is on the screen but the presence of one when an American is speaking the same language is plainly insulting.<br/><br/>Coming to the technical aspects, production design aims for the 80s aesthetic & gets much of it right. Cinematography encapsulates the whole narrative with a foreboding atmosphere that never dissipates. Editing keeps the plot tightly-gripped at all moments & there isn't any moment in the picture that feels irrelevant to the plot. And last but not the least, Alexandre Desplat chips in with a soundtrack that makes the experience all the more brutal & restless.<br/><br/>As far as performances go, Argo features a dependable cast in Ben Affleck, John Goodman, Alan Arkin, Bryan Cranston & others. Although none of the characters are fleshed out that well, the work by Affleck, Arkin & Goodman still lifts the film up by a few points. The actors playing the US diplomats also do a fine job in their given roles & in the end, the sum of the inputs put in by its entire cast manages to do a better job than any individual contribution.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Argo may have a few shortcomings in the narrative plus its retelling of the ""Canadian Caper"" leaves out much of what actually happened but simply as a thriller, it just works. It manages to sustain its uneasy ambiance for 2 hours, effortlessly succeeds in keeping its audience at the edge of their seats and is an incredibly tense, fiercely exciting & wildly entertaining ride which in the end feels worthy of all the accolades it has garnered so far."

","I remember these events as they happened. I was ten years old and I was given my first real taste of fanatics taken to the extreme. Every eye was on Iran for 444 days. the world held it's breath. When The American Embassy was stormed and Hostages taken. The Fanatics demanded the Former Shah sent back to face punishment. The Former Shah was dying of cancer and in No shape to go back. President Carter Refused to deal with them. then There were reports of Six Americans Being smuggled out of Iran. And that was being done by the Canadian Ambassder Ken Taylor. For years afterwards we heard the stories about the bravery of the Canadian government in helping get these Americans home. AndSince Iam A Canadian. The Story rings true. Like I said I lived these events that was one of the topics the school I was in kept talking about. Now I'm long past that I'm a Father now and When My kids read about it in the history books I'm sure it'll be just a great adventure story to them.<br/><br/>A Film Like Argo does something different. It transforms it from a great adventure story to a human story. And While it does play fast and loose with the facts. remember that after all this is based on The American's Point of View. The American in point One Tony Mendez. Mendez is a Former C.I.A. Agent and while I don't doubt their bravery in the field I do believe they can stretch the truth a little bit to make themselves look good. But this is a Hollywood film. Taken from the American P.O.V. And while it plays from the American side of things That in itself isn't a bad thing. Ben Affleck is growing as a director. He's done a great job carefully crafting this movie and honing it into a good solid tribute to a time when the world held it's breath. Affleck's Tony Mendez is Sharp witted and he's Very Good at what he does. He's a extraction specialist. Whih means he gets people out of tough spots. This one requires a little more finesse. And when MEndez gets inspiration to make a false film to get them out of their as Members of the false film. The False film is called Argo. A Star Wars Battlestar Galactica Krull Type of movie. They find a Make up who is a part time agent named John Chambers and we find out that The C.I.A. and Hollywood have worked together before. Chambers gets them hooked up with a producer named Siegal who simply demands that if his name is going to be attached to a fake film it'll be a fake film that'll be a hit. They let the media hype go to work and hype it out to the press that Argo is going to be the greatest Sci-fi movie of all time. They get a script made and Story boards drawn and everything is set. Then the action begins.<br/><br/>I watched the movie and when the suspenseful parts hit I kept reminding myself the six got out. But Affleck makes you feel every moment of their escape. Some people found it dull. Others a disappointment. Me I found it to be a very good movie I intend to watch again."

"nesfilmreviews","9","0","2","29 July 2013"," A hat-trick for Mr. Affleck.
","""Gone Baby Gone,"" ""The Town,"" and now ""Argo,"" -- Ben Affleck scores a hat trick with three acclaimed films that exhibit his impressive command behind the camera. Producing the film with George Clooney and Grat Heslov, who worked with Mr. Affleck for the award winning ""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" (2005) ""Argo"" is also based on history, with its fair share of dramatic license, that uniquely incorporates Hollywood during the tumultuous times of the Iran hostage crisis of the late '70s to early '80s.<br/><br/>""Argo"" opens with a compelling re-creation of the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Iran by militant students. It's November 4, 1979 and the world is about to change. Civilians force their way into the Embassy slowly, then, once the gates are forced open, in droves. Employees and diplomats rush to shred and incinerate all sensitive material before the building is completely overtaken. Six of them - Bob Anders (Tate Donovan), Lee Schatz (Rory Cochrane), Mark and Cora Lijek (Christopher Denham and Clea DuVall), and Joe and Kathy Stafford (Scoot McNairy and Kerry Bishe) - escape and make it to the residence of Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber), where they are hidden for nearly 3 months.<br/><br/>The State Department, helped by the CIA, decides to mount a rescue mission. By mid- January, concerns are rising that, if the diplomats aren't smuggled out of Iran, they may be captured and publicly executed. The Canadian government, concerned about the safety of the ambassador and his staff, is also applying pressure. CIA director Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston) calls in agent Tony Mendez (Affleck), an infiltration expert, to devise a plan to get the six people out. The primary problem is that there is no viable reason why a half-dozen North Americans would be wandering Tehran. With the help of Hollywood makeup artist John Chambers (John Goodman) and producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), Tony establishes a fake production company for a cheesy sci-fi movie called ""Argo,"" and devises a cover story that will hopefully allow them to pass through security at the airport and board a Swiss Air flight.<br/><br/>""Argo,"" is directed with flair and style by an admired actor/director, and as a period recreation it is just about flawless. There is a notable lack of on-screen bloodshed or violence, confident in its compelling story to invoke edge-of-your-seat tension. The movie has a surprisingly celebratory, feel-good tone rather than dwelling on any political overtones or commentary. The film is made to resemble something coming out of that era, integrating archive footage that lends authenticity to the retelling of the ""Canadian Caper.""<br/><br/>A closing-credits side-by-side montage shows to what lengths Affleck has gone to re-create the real-life places and people of ""Argo,"" and its his impressive command behind the camera -- the staging, editing, and the calibrated progression of the story, especially its harrowing final moments -- that solidifies Mr. Affleck as a talented and formidable director. ""Argo"" deserves to find the discerning audience it has been made for: After all, if we buy tickets, it hopefully leads to more intelligent, sophisticated filmmaking."

People slag off Steven Seagal because... well it's Steven Seagal... people slag off Kirsten Stewart because she can't act and she's additionally miserable.<br/><br/>Me, I've slagged off Ben Affleck because in the two decades he's been making the rounds, he's had a grande total of about three different hairstyles AND the most used one, the one he wears in films where he's a douche trying to be popular - The Bouffant - is usually when he is at his most unlikeable.<br/><br/>So, Argo! He plays a CIA agent in the early 80's that looks like the guy that tries to sell out John McClaine in Die Hard only to have his brains blown out into a glass of Coca-Cola AND the guy put a large dose of his creativity, political knowledge and creative power into a factual docu-drama about how the CIA extracted hidden US citizens from Iran after the invasion of their US Embassy.<br/><br/>One thing I really appreciate other than a drama that catches the emotion and atmosphere of a pretty devastating moment in history is one that looks and feels like the era it was set in and Argo successfully delivers on that level, taking me back to some classic cinema.<br/><br/>Argo, the title of the film, lends itself from the name of the fictional movie production devised by the CIA and cheap and cheerful movie producer Lester Siegel (played by Alan Arkin) in order to legally and safely get into Iran and extract the US citizens with false IDs before they are captured and executed.<br/><br/>I really liked Argo and that came down to Affleck's untypically laid back and sombre performance, along with strong supports from favourites John Goodman and Bryan Cranston. But as I say, not to discredit the good work on behalf of all involved, it is Alan Arkin - the old rogue that brought us Catch 22 - that really steals the show AND carries it for much of the film.<br/><br/>Aside from some breathtaking suspenseful moments, I only have two/three problems with this movie. One and two, it's a bit of a mixed bag that doesn't always stay on track and without some pretty unnecessary scenes, it could have been half an hour shorter.<br/><br/>My only other problem is that I didn't give a flying hoot about the US citizens hidden away in Iran. Clea Duvall, Tate Donovan and Scoot McNairy are three actors I can safely say have never done anything for me, with exception to McNairy's turn in this year's Killing Them Softly (which only worked because you're not supposed to like him).<br/><br/>I feel that this film is praised more for the fact that it deals with a past political situation that is relevant today more than ever after 911 and otherwise it wouldn't have had such critical acclaim.<br/><br/>And as well-made as I can accept this film is, it's worth it for the acting alone, but maybe now Ben Affleck will stop trying to seek critical acclaim and just get on with making movies that won't make him look like a bushy headed yuppie.<br/><br/>Thumbs up, overall, Affleck. But without Arkin, this film wouldn't have been enjoyable at all!"

","As always with history, the events and specially the victories have always multiple unexplored or unaccredited facets. Argo here portrays one of the sides of the coin with Canada as the supporting side watcher. <br/><br/>The story is about the turmoil in Iran during 1979 when militants took control and 6 Americans from U.S Embassy manage to sneak away from the angry Iranian rebels by taking refuge in the house of the Canadian Embassy. The CIA agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) hatches a plan of fictional sci-fi movie (Argo) to be shot in Iran as a plausible cover up to rescue the fugitives. The fake movie is then given buffed profiles and other charades to authenticate it for the cover. Under the assumed roles of directors and co producers etc. the refugees are to be escaped out from the country. <br/><br/>The film has been kept simple and evenly paced. It looks authentic and scenes like the overlapping of the script reading and the telecast from the news makes for a good contrast. Ben Affleck maintains a cool, understated charismatic performance. But the rest of the premise fails to sell itself. The refugees are hollow cardboard cut outs of the characters. The deep emotions of panic and desperation that such situations evoke are missing. And just when the plot starts to look promising with at the edge of the seat car chase,the movie draws to an end. The rescue in itself though significant had been so simplified that the celebration at the end kind of looks exaggerated in the context of the movie. Overall, Argo makes for an entertaining watch but fails to touch the hardships and the fears of the hostage crisis."

","This is a great movie. The story, acting, pacing, editing, etc. was just fantastic. Affleck's directing was solid, and the suspense will keep you entertained right through to the last seconds. I loved it. <br/><br/>It did have one irritating thing, though, kind of a big one. It pointed most of the accolades to Affleck's character and the CIA. This really was not true. It was Ken Taylor and the Canadians who really pulled 'the Canadian Caper' off so successfully.<br/><br/>""When Taylor heard a few years ago that Mendez had sold movie rights to his book (which, to be fair, is much more generous than the movie about Canada's role), ""I said, 'Well, that's going to be interesting.'....""The movie's fun, it's thrilling, it's pertinent, it's timely,"" he said. ""But look, Canada was not merely standing around watching events take place. The CIA was a junior partner.""<br/><br/>""The old postscript sent the message that, for political reasons, Canada took the credit. A sarcastic kicker noted that Taylor received 112 citations. The clear implication was that he did not deserve them.""(Sept/Oct., 2012, thestar.com)"".<br/><br/>So the USA does another revision on history here. I believe 'Argo' goes this far. Yes, it's based on a true story - the movie does it's best to allude that it sticks to technical accuracy. And it really does, in some ways. Historical pictures of flag burners, rioters, gate climbers, etc.. up against Argo film stills run by during the credits make it seem that the facts were adhered to down to the tiniest detail. In reality, it wasn't Tony Mendez or the CIA who were responsible for the success of this operation; actually they were barely there. <br/><br/>Since the movie premiered, Ben Affleck has added emphasis on the movie postscripts since then that gives kudos to the Canadians' role. This was after Ken Taylor politely complained, as a Canadian would tactfully do. But Affleck did this only after pressure from Taylor himself.<br/><br/>I can understand the need to spice up events to make them as exciting and entertaining as possible, don't get me wrong. But this film needs to let the audience know that more explicitly than it does, even after the changed postscripts.<br/><br/>Still, a really entertaining and riveting film, very well done, and easily worth seeing.

","Argo is a refreshing movie for people who enjoy smart, good-hearted historical dramas, and who are not too picky about historical accuracy. It's got the right mix of thrills and comic relief, with snappy dialogue and plenty of memorable set pieces. By virtue of telling its story in a straightforward, familiar way, it lacks any unique or superlative qualities that might make it an all-time great film. A broken marriage storyline regarding Ben Affleck's character feels shoehorned, and is reminiscent of the equally-extraneous marriage storyline in ""Moneyball"" (2011), a similar film in more ways than one. Quibbles aside, ""Argo"" is a fun ride."

","Embassy staff at the US embassy in Tehran in 1979 are minding their own business when a student march arrives at their door. Things get more and more difficult as it turns into a protest with protesters climbing the walls, eventually they make it inside while the staff frenetically tries to destroy documents. Some who are at the public's entrance decide to escape the embassy while the rest are held hostage. These six make it to the residence of the Canadian ambassador and stay there.<br/><br/>This of course becomes the Iran hostage crisis. But the focus of Argo isn't on that, but on the 6 held up at the Canadian residence. It gets to the point where they are putting at risk the Canadians who themselves have asked the US to do something.<br/><br/>Back in the US, CIA and State mull over scenarios to get them out. One idea is to have them ride a bike during the winter to Turkey disguised as agricultural experts. But eventually the CIA's exfiltration expert, Tony, comes up with the idea to pretend to film a movie in Iran and the 6 are part of the crew. He has to make it look real so he travels to Hollywood, finds a sci-fi script, gets in touch with a friendly make-up artists who connects him with a producer who will produce the fake movie. Argo is the title of the script they settle on. They do casting calls and script reading and get stories published in industry magazines.<br/><br/>With that Tony travels to Iran, gets in touch with an agent and deals with the culture ministry and so on. The 6 of course don't like the idea of having to risk their lives for freedom. Eventually of course they agree. Things get risky when they do location scouting pretending to be a film crew in a busy bazaar.<br/><br/>Meanwhile in the US, State decides to shut the operation down, but Tony doesn't see any other way out than continuing the operation just as the Iranians are about to storm the Canadian residence.<br/><br/>Argo does work surprisingly. Surprisingly because it doesn't have much of a lead or main characters. Tony is silent and laid back. We know almost nothing about the 6 and only see them when they start complaining about Tony's plan. Of course when the movie focuses on Hollywood it becomes enthusiastic and our producer who's been around the block a couple of times knows how rotten the business is. Those scenes provide some comic relief.<br/><br/>It's the story here the carries the movie. It slowly creates suspense despite some obvious exaggerations and unrealistic scenes designed to keep you on the edge of your seat. Will Tony and the 6 make it to the plane? Will the Iranians, who are already on the alert, discover the ruse? Argo does an excellent job with the setting of the 70s with its documentary tone. That makes it all fairly realistic since much is based on actual footage of the time. Argo is an exciting and entertaining movie if you set aside some of the minor flaws. It's not quite a best movie of the year, but Hollywood loves nothing more than to glorify itself and make its absurd line of work appear heroic."

","Every summer, I review Oscar nominees that I haven't reviewed before. To kick if off, I will start with last year's best picture winner, Argo. I meant to review it back when I saw it, but i forgot. Argo is a fantastic movie that really shows us Ben Affleck's true talent: directing. I'm not saying he's a bad actor, but directing seems to be his true calling.<br/><br/>The film takes place in the 70's. Seven American tourists are currently quarantined in Iran. Enter Affleck, who plays a C.I.A. agent named Mendez. Mendez hatches a seemingly impossible plot to get them out of there. The plan: disguise them as a film crew working on a big budget sci-fi film. Alan Arkin and John Goodman also star as two Hollywood experts who show him just how to prepare this movie.<br/><br/>Argo is a great movie for a lot of reasons. It's smart, it's funny, and there isn't a boring second in the entire thing. It also has a great story and the pace is consistent. The acting is pretty good too. Affleck is overlooked here, mainly because he has to keep up with the scene-stealing Alan Arkin. What I admire about Argo most is how Affleck pulls it off. It feels as if you're watching an Ocean's movie.<br/><br/>With a lot of fact-based Oscar winners, we are sort of left bored or trying to look for historical inaccuracies. Here, we just can't take our eyes away from it. It's the rare true story that is ingeniously entertaining. I loved Argo. I understand why it won Best Picture (though I don't quite agree with it). I don't understand why Ben Affleck was snubbed for Best director (probably because of Affleck's past, including Surviving Christmas, Daredevil, Gigli, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, and Chasing Amy).

"olihist","9","0","1","9 June 2013"," An Excellent, if not completely historically accurate - Movie
","I've just viewed Ben Affleck's ""Argo"" for the second time, and it really is a well-made film (and surprisingly so, considering its leading actor and director). The acting, script, and direction in this film are all very good, and the final thrilling scenes at the Tehran Airport were especially well done. <br/><br/>""Argo"" has something for everyone - comedy, suspense, and intense historical drama. What makes ""Argo"" less than a 10 for me, however, are a couple of historical inaccuracies. As the film portrays very well, the Canadians carefully sheltered the six Americans who managed to flee the Tehran Embassy but the Canadian government also played a leading role in their evacuation from Iran (which is why the real operation was named the ""Canadian Caper""). Perhaps the most glaring inaccuracy in ""Argo,"" however, deals with the British and New Zealand Embassies, which, contrary to the film, did shelter the beleaguered Americans for a time rather than simply turning them away (Ben Affleck later admitted in an interview that he decided to alter the British and NZ contributions in order to dramatize the dire situation facing the Americans in Tehran).<br/><br/>In spite of these inaccuracies, ""Argo"" is still an excellent film that deserves much of the accolades that it has received. Its historical inaccuracies are worth mentioning but in my view do not seriously take away from an otherwise well acted, well written, and well directed historical drama."

They start the movie simply stating facts about the history of Iran. It made me stop the movie and research more about it. Iran has a fascinating history, and it is just a shame to what it has turned to today. <br/><br/>Of course the Americans will always make movies that make them look like the superheroes, even though in cases like this one, it is partly (should I say mostly?) their fault. I suggest you also read up how the Americans and English took out Iran's leader in 1953, M. Mossadegh, who was considered the Man of the Year in Times magazine. Interesting turn out, right?<br/><br/>Even though the Americans are NOT the superheroes in this movie, in my opinion it was the Canadians, who risked their lives to help those people out, and they should have been awarded the star, this is JUST a movie. And this movie sure got me twisting in my chair, and made me horrified of the Iranians and their ways of torture (which was probably learned from the Americans).<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 9 out of 10 because of the way the story was told, and how you could feel like you were in their shoes and made me cheer for them to safely leave the country. A movie that makes you feel like you are a part of it is just so rare nowadays. This made it entertaining, because in the end that is what movies are - entertainment. If you want to know more on the history, rely on sources on the internet and preferably not American and certainly do not rely on this movie, for this is the Americans' point of view."

","What about Argo? Well, it's no denying that Argo is an enjoyable espionage movie. The pacing is tight, there is some tension and an interesting story arc. It's easy watching and certainly no waste of time. But it gets lavished with all this praise. Just take a look at some professional reviews and you see what I mean. This movie is meant to show how much Ben Afleck (let's face it: he used to be a horrible actor) has grown over the years both in terms of acting and directing. It is indeed hard to deny that his acting skills have greatly improved (his directing skills I cannot comment on). He is far more reserved, and far less cheesy: just very composed and steady. But it's also not difficult to improve on the horrible performances he used to give. Only the smallest bit of self-reflection should do it. But let me ask: is all the praise he gets for the film really justified? I don't think so. Firstly: it's just an entertaining movie, no more, no less. We've got millions of 'm. Secondly: it's hugely patriotic; think the 'subtle' inclusion of American feelings/flags etc. Thirdly, and most importantly: the angry Iranians are either being portrayed as generic Orcs in Lord of the Rings, or as the generic aliens surrounding Jabba the Hut in Star Wars. When we see them driving the car through the streets we see exactly the same angry mob we always see on the tube: a false stereotype is being reinforced here, without any subtlety whatsoever. More importantly: when one of the American guys was talking to an Iranian official he started to talk in a Jabberish Irianian accent that sounded like ""Jabba di Jabba"", just like 3CPO said it. I thought that was a little dumb to be honest. I thought that at the time I was watching that scene. And guess what... right before the end credits they even showed us the friggin' Star Wars action figures for crying out loud (!), and lo and behold who figured prominently... 3CPO.

As for the other actors, I find their role too simple. The story line is what amazes me. It's really hard to imagine that it happened in reality. Especially when they were escaping from Iran and the soldiers were too close to capture them already. Though some I don't believe that some of those scenes did really happened.

","Winner of the best picture Oscar at the 2013 Academy Awards, Ben Affleck's film is a political thriller that tells a true story of incredible courage against the odds but don't let that put you off.<br/><br/>Before Argo, Affleck's career in the director's chair (Gone, Baby Gone and The Town) was progressing in a very respectable ascent. With Argo, that ascent has fired it's rocket boosters and blasted out of the stratosphere fully cementing his reputation as an unlikely, but very exciting talent. Not content with sitting in the big chair and barking orders, Affleck also takes the lead role in this fascinating true story of a daring attempt to rescue American embassy workers trapped inside an unstable Iran in the late 1970′s.<br/><br/>Having absolutely no prior knowledge of the events depicted in the film, I found myself gripped throughout as the drama unfolded. Thanks to period perfect production design and Affleck's basic ability to tell a story, the film is a huge success. It often occurred to me that the film shared similarities to Apollo 13 – not only because of the fine period detail – but also in the cutting back and forth between events inside Iran, and the drama back in 'mission control'.<br/><br/>As with any story, the less you know going in the better time you're likely to have. Clearly, this is a tale told best in the most unfussy of directorial styles, and with that Affleck really comes through. Without over egging the pudding or giving in to hyped up sentimentality, Argo succeeds as an engaging thriller, a worthy history lesson and a fine film. Also, great use of Star Wars figures."

The crew did a great job of convincing the audience that they were there during the late 70's traveling through crowded bazaars or meeting with Iranian officials in elaborate ancient buildings. The other half of the filming took place in LA and gave an old time feel of being on set with Goodman and Arkin. <br/><br/>I thought the supporting acting from Arkin, and the hostages almost out- shined Affleck's portrayal of Mendez. Affleck did capture a caring father who genuinely wanted to help these people whether with or without the help of the CIA. The scene where he watches the same movie as his son while on the phone with him added touching emotion in a heartfelt way. <br/><br/>This films is not perfect, with many historical inaccuracies along the way, however I am glad they added Arkin's role of Lester Siegel into the film although it was fictional Arkin provided comic relief that was actually funny.

"sashank_kini-1","9","0","3","5 May 2013"," Argo Allows You To Breath In Every Moment Of The Film And At The Same Time Leaves You Breathless With Excitement. Its Two Hours Of Pure Rush Without Ever Feeling Rushed.
","Argo is a kind of film which allows you to breathe in every moment of the story as it builds and at the same time leaves you breathless with the blazing tension and excitement. There isn't a moment of 'Zero Dark Thirty'-like self-consciousness in its direction and cinematography and neither is Argo surfeit with dialogues like Lincoln – the film is purely two hours of rush that not for a moment feels rushed. I deliberately chose to watch Argo after the eight other nominees for Best Picture as it would be easier for me to decide whether or not it deserved the acclaim and accolades. After watching Argo I understand why the film won – it has this winning formula that 2010's Oscar-snubbed Social Network and Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' had: it keeps you hooked every second every minute of its appropriate 2 hour runtime. You are never distracted, and not for a moment do you twiddle or purposelessly text on your stupid cell-phones. <br/><br/>Talking about cell-phones, Argo is a film where telephones play such an important motif because the film is set in late seventies, a time when cell-phones were still in its infancy. In fact, in Argo's case, lives are at the stake of telephones and there's a climatic, teeth-grinding moment that'll make you feel two things: 1) ""Wow, we're so lucky we have cell-phones these days!"" and 2) ""Dang! You could get away with such stuff in those days!"". What stuff? Well, just pretending you are a Canadian shooting a ludicrous sci-fi film in Iran with the real purpose of rescuing six fugitives who also need to play along by posing as the film's crew in order to flee the country (and ah, you all are Americans by the way). Sounds crazy right? Well, then you might go f*ck yourself!<br/><br/>This scenario actually happened in 1979 when Tony Mendez, an American exfiltration expert rescued six American fugitives who secretly encamped at the official residence of the Canadian Ambassador in Iran after escaping an invasion of the American Embassy by Iranian revolutionaries. Our bearded hero (played by a usually clean-shaven Ben Affleck, who should sport this look in more films for it suits him for serious subject-matter films) is called to a meeting where the other members seem unwelcoming towards him and yet can't help but follow his idea, not finding any better-of-the-worst idea. Tony at first pitches a rather unviable plan but soon rejects it and instead chooses the fake Hollywood film shooting plan after being inspired by a clip from Planet of the Apes, catching it during a conversation with his son. For executing this 'Are You Serious!' mission, he gets in touch with Oscar-winning make-up artist John Chambers and producer Lester Siegel who agree to produce, promote and most importantly (for this film) storyboard this movie. Tony poses as the film's director to Hollywood so he can get easy sanction to go to Iran for shooting, get permission from the Cultural department in Iran to 'shoot at locations' and then call the film off and leave, taking along with him the six refugees who shall pretend to be the film's crew, having with them fake Canadian passports handed by Mendez. To these six refugees, Tony doesn't reveal his true name until he consciously discloses his identity to two of them to gain their trust. If Tony succeeds, it's not just USA, Canada and CIA who are celebrating, but also Hollywood which could make all this happened, the best part being that Argo the movie actually never happened.<br/><br/>Some of the things that happened and maybe still happen in the world surprise us, and one scene that stunned me comes later in Argo where Iranian children are used to meticulously reassemble the shredded documents which would reveal the identities of the six American refugees. What didn't surprise me much however was the benefits a 'film' related tag can give you at any place; just mentioning you come from the film-industry grants you some immunity or respite in USA, in Iran or any other place. There's an interesting scene in the film where the quack crew is accompanied by a member of Iranian Cultural Affairs to location scout at the bazaar and the latter asks fake director, now played by one of the six refugees, whether the film was about a Canadian woman's romance with Iran's culture and its people. That's precisely the kind of movies you see today which aim at sensitizing different cultures and breaking cultural barriers; my point here being that Hollywood can really help achieve that. The climax is another moment where the character's fake film credentials really work for them, and it's a treat to watch such an implausible thing actually working.<br/><br/>Argo isn't a performance-driven movie but a story-driven film, but the presence of Ben Affleck, also the film's director and producer, as the lead protagonist works best because he's like George Clooney, not hogging each frame to show how well he can act but to give his dutiful services to a greatly written and directed film. There are no standouts here, and I wasn't expecting for any but the script is a winner and it pulls in everyone to draw out their characters well enough without over- complicating them. Alan Arkin as Lester Liegel has the film's best line and he may probably be remembered for that line only. If you catch that movie and don't know what the line is, then you can go f*ck yourself (just kidding)!"

In other words, about as large as the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Germany COMBINED! Tehran,the capitol has population the same as New York City, which is about 8 million! The entire country is 75 million, which is about twice the population of California. According to the Composite Index of National Capability, Iran has the 15th most powerful military in the world! So all you warmongers salivating at going to war with Iran keep in mind we will be fighting the equivalent of two California's simultaneously - with one of the most powerful militaries on earth! I hope you're planing to send your sons, daughters and get a second mortgage on your house to fight a war of this magnitude! <br/><br/>All I can say is to everyone involved with Argo from President Jimmy Carter to Ben Affleck is THANK YOU! Argo is a shining example of the power of cooperation and creativity over force and stupidity!"

","I'm a sucker for a good political drama, I really am. But to be clear I don't mean that which gets reported, analysed and re-reported by the media about the goings on in government. That stuff drives me nuts. No, what I mean is a good film – and to be a little more specific, one that has any or all of the following elements:<br/><br/>is ""based upon true events""; has an element of conspiracy about it; has been produced and/or directed by someone who has leanings toward anti-establishment; makes me want to read up on the subject afterwards.<br/><br/>Let me elaborate on each of those a little more.<br/><br/>For me to be truly drawn in to a film of this genre I need to know that it's not just come out of the head, off the pen and onto the paper of an expert fiction writer. Now don't get me wrong – I'm well aware for the need to make good use of brilliant screenwriters. And I also applaud the use of 'artistic licence' (though not to the point where history is being totally re-written) – hence the clause ""based upon"" is generally good enough for me. I simply mean that for the most part these type of films benefit from being rooted in something historical.<br/><br/>Who doesn't love a bit of a conspiracy? I remember being rather unnerved to say the least when I watched JFK and can almost entirely blame Stone for my admiration of this genre. I was always partial to a bit of the X- files too.<br/><br/>I'm going to stick my neck out here and say ""thank god for George Clooney."" Love him or loathe him as an actor (and I'm more pro his acting work than not) what he's done for 'Hollywood' films in terms challenging 'the system' at the same time as bringing in the numbers to the box-office has to be respected. Oddly enough, and I only just realised this as I was preparing this post, he's produced the last two films that I've watched: The Informant and Argo (the subject of this post).<br/><br/>If a film has done a good job on me then I will most often want to go away and either Google it, wiki it or amazon it to find out more: the truth, the historical context or what happened to those involved afterwards. These type of films should have an effect on you, they shouldn't remain a passive experience and were never intended by the director to be viewed in a vacuum.<br/><br/>Argo ticks all of those boxes for me. Ben Affleck – who I must admit since Good Will Hunting has never drawn me to part with the cost of cinema ticket – turns director/producer/actor in this political thriller. And a bloomin good job he does too. I knew very little about the Iranian US embassy hostage crisis and I had no idea at all about the particular element of that crisis that this film focuses in on – the escape and hideout of six of the US embassy staff and, more central to the film, the CIA/government backed plans for their rescue.<br/><br/>Affleck plays the role of seasoned CIA man who comes up with a somewhat left-of-centre plan to rescue the six – using the cover story of being part of the film crew for a fictitious science fiction movie called Argo. I almost want to say: ""and hilarity ensues"". But it doesn't of course, despite the preposterous plan . What does follow is, a well thought out, albeit dramatised, depiction of the events that followed the hatching of that plan.<br/><br/>I'm not going to spoil the outcome – though if you know the history here there is no real surprise. Strong performances from Affleck and the supporting cast drew me in so well that I found myself gripped by the 'will they/won't they get caught' mindset. The film also benefits from great production design that drops you back into the late '70s and good use of location (Turkey) to provide the atmosphere of revolutionary Tehran.<br/><br/>I liked it – a lot. Directors and studios: do more of this stuff please."

Even if the self-references are funny and barbed, it's still self-referential.<br/><br/>But that's a quibble. This is a rare film where I notice the editing because it's so good.

"ChristianUnchained","9","0","2","23 April 2013"," The legitimately ""thrilling"" political thriller
","The Short: Argo is smart, politically potent, sharply written, incredibly well directed and chock full of important ideas and messages - all while being entertaining and enjoyable by even the most pedestrian of movie-goers. Argo is a tough film to review. Not because it is a tough film to swallow - quite the opposite. Argo is the ""Inception"" of historical political thrillers. Sure, on the surface Argo is a historical political thriller. <br/><br/>But digging deeper Argo is so much more. Argo is a meta homage to science fiction film, an unexpectedly exciting look at an event that changed history, an often times funny and laugh out loud comedy, an intense and exciting thriller, all while being a smart and incredibly potent political statement along with taking a sharp and incredibly smart stab at Hollywood. Yeah, that's a lot to digest, I know. But the brilliant thing about it? Argo presents all of these major ideas and messages so incredibly well. It doesn't become muddled, cloudy, or boring. Rather, Argo is a slow-burner that keeps you invested by continually introducing elements that have never been effectively used in a historical thriller, which it does it rather well. <br/><br/>Argo doesn't fall prey to the long and droning office banter that most historically ""accurate"" thrillers offer, but rather changes the sets, characters, and scenery frequently. From Iran to Hollywood to Washington and back, Argo progressively feels something like a Bourne or James Bond ""secret agent"" style flick, and while it never features intense shootouts or the quick elimination of a room of bad guys in a stylish fashion, it still maintains a sense of intense thrills and a finale where all suspense simply just boils over. <br/><br/>Argo is no doubt exciting, but it accomplishes this in its own, very unique way.And what the about the cast? Well, you've got the stoic Affleck donning both lead role and director's cap, the great John Goodman playing the anti-Hollywood big shot, and the hilarious Alan Arkin (recently played chief in Get Smart) in the main roles. The supporting cast is strong as well, both funny and incredibly dynamic. There are a couple of film clichés that permeate this otherwise fantastically original film. Other than that, there are seriously no other flaws that I could find watching Argo. Nor did I care, because Argo was awesome.In the end, Argo is something seemingly normal that feels fresh, and at the helm is someone who knows how to get those ideas across tremendously well. <br/><br/>Argo is something special, and it's timing couldn't be any better especially with the rising tensions with Iran some 30 years later in 2012. Argo is not only good, it's so crazy you won't believe it's actually a true story. Bravo, Mr. Affleck. Bravo.Second Opinions: I'm standing by my 4.5. Saw it again, and it just wowed me how incredibly well it maintains all of the tension even a second time around, yet it remains at the ""so close"" to re-watchable perfection."

","I read some of the reviews of this movie on IMDb and Moviefone and they looked pretty good so I decided to see it. Then a part of me became skeptical because I thought it is was going to be one of those long boring movies what a lot of people give too much hype. After seeing the Oscars and watching Argo take home the award for best picture I decided to rent it anyway still with some hesitation. Let me tell you, I'm so glad I rented this movie. It had me on the edge of my seat and yelling at the screen at times. This was basically a perfect movie. It was well written, directed and produced.<br/><br/>Ben Afleck is doing a real good job directing and producing movies. Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and this one, they keep getting better and better. I hope he can keep up the good work. Pretty soon I'm going to put him up there with Martin Scorsese, George Lucas, Spike Lee, and Steven Spielberg. LOL.<br/><br/>So if you're looking for a good edge of your seat movie, this one would be a perfect one. I recommend that you rent it at your earliest convenience."
"davidec23","7","0","7","17 April 2013"," Its fiction people...
","This is a movie! Not a documentary... Most of the facts are exaggerated and most of the historical details are inaccurate. In my opinion if you go see this film without any bias its actually quite enjoyable and brilliantly directed. <br/><br/>Maybe it is propaganda, but what movie doesn't have a social/political message in it??(Lincoln & Django both about black oppression, both released before Obama's re-election and lets not even mention Bigelow's absolute crap)If you want Hollywood to depict history accurately you'll be disappointed 99 % of the time. For example, most of Hollywoods war films are complete garbage, only showing one side of the story and the American army being the mighty hand of God himself while the enemy is portrayed as cruel and ruthless.<br/><br/>Actually Argo doesn't glorify the US. It shows a critical political situation and a government that is failing to get out of it cleanly. A CIA agent comes up with a daring plan to rescue the embassy staff who survived without harming anyone... The mistake was not giving enough credit to the Canadian government who actually saved the day and took most of the risks. Iran was the villain so obviously everything about the people, police etc. was exaggerated to the extreme. But hell if you know a little about history you wouldn't give a damn.<br/><br/>Again Argo is fiction and it has to be viewed as such. The plot is great, the editing superb and the acting was decent. Affleck's directing is also excellent, giving a realistic feel to the movie and always keeping you on the edge of your seat. Worthy of an Oscar for Best Picture? Probably not, but the Oscar for editing was well deserved. <br/><br/>Watch this film without trying to understand the political aspect of it or taking parts and I am sure you will enjoy it."
"gslzll3","10","0","4","13 April 2013"," Impressive outing for Affleck the director
","As I was watching Argo, I attempted twice to lay down on my sofa and relax. I just couldn't do it. As soon as my head hit the pillow, I popped right back up again and began biting my fingernails; the suspense was literally keeping me on the edge of my seat. This is an excellent movie. One of the best pictures to come out of Hollywood in a long time.<br/><br/>Argo is based on the true story of a daring rescue of six American diplomats from Tehran in the midst of the Iran hostage crisis. It's very simple to get online and Google this to learn more about the story, which I did after watching the film, and I was impressed by how true to the events Affleck managed to stay in the film. It is Hollywood, though, and one can't expect it to be completely accurate, but the discrepancies are minimal in this case.<br/><br/>I was greatly impressed by the early eighties period detail in the film. The era was rendered quite precisely. I read another review that criticized the fact that Zeppelin's ""When the Levee Breaks"" wasn't from this period, but really, is it such a stretch to think that these people might still choose to listen to them? I remember seeing them putting an album on the turntable and they were having a celebration at the time. There are many fans of Led Zeppelin out there, possibly including diplomats in hiding.<br/><br/>The only thing that fell short in this film was the acting, specifically that of Ben Affleck. I think his performance was too restrained. In the circumstances he was in I have a hard time believing that he wasn't a bit more emotional; he never seemed stressed out enough or afraid enough throughout the film. <br/><br/>Argo is very technically sound, with top-notch cinematography and excellent production design. It's suspenseful, entertaining, and as historically accurate as can be expected of a film. I give it the highest marks 10/10 and I highly recommend it."

","Being a Canadian, I had some preconceived notions that the accuracy of the movie would be in question, shifting the importance of the contributions of the Officials at the Canadian Embassy to the American CIA during the hostage crisis. I thought it was quite clever how the ending was handled that made me wonder if our own media hadn't skewed the events in favour of the Canadians. Apart from that, the movie was suspenseful and gave us a great insight of what life would have been like in Iran during the revolution. There was a lot of great historical information presented in a very entertaining way. The acting was superb and believable. There is little doubt as to why it won an Oscar for best motion picture of the year."

This one had me from the opening scene all the way to the end. I have seen mentions of historical inaccuracies within the movie, but at its core, the story maintains integrity. This is an important story that should have been told long before now, but was apparently waiting for the direction of Mr Affleck to find its success. Well done. Very well done."

","In this dramatization of the 1979 Iran hostage crisis, a CIA agent devises a plan to rescue six Americans. While not Oscar worthy, this is an exciting look at the daring plan that was classified until recently. Afleck is turning into a competent director, but he should hold on to his acting gig for now. He and the writers go a bit overboard here in trying to add excitement to the historical events. Although the film is shot in a documentary style and implies authenticity, the final act is too contrived in building up the suspense to be believable as a true depiction. The acting is pretty good, with Arkin and Goodman coming off best as a couple of Hollywood personalities involved in the rescue mission."

","Beautifully made with all everything from the costumes to the technology accurate to a tee. I loved the way the film was intercut with archive news footage of the time; this really gave the audience a sense of the world at that juncture. All the performances were excellent with Ben Affleck taking centre stage, but I really enjoyed seeing Alan Arkin as a Hollywood producer; he stole it for me! There was real tension towards the end of the film; it slowly builds for quite a long time and I found that quite masterful. It's something that has been missing from many Hollywood films for a long time now but Affleck seems to have rediscovered the art. Because it's a film based in real events, there's little time for character development and I think it suffers slightly because of it. Other than that, it has some interesting songs on the soundtrack and it's well worth a look!<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED<br/><br/>My score: 8.6/10<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."

","Although ostensibly this is a movie involving hostages, ultimately you probably won't really care that much about their fate because they are never fully or even partially developed as real people who gain our empathy. Meanwhile the Iranians are characterized as evil Muslims for us to root against(how imaginative). No significant or serious political issues are fully explored although the top notch cast is compelling and there is some good dialog. This is a film that wants to be taken seriously yet lacks gravitas especially considering it is a work of historical fiction as admitted by its creators. Essentially just another prosaic ""political"" thriller that turns into a melodrama although admittedly with some suspense toward the finale. Shocking ending (no spoiler) includes Acadamy Award for best picture."
"Ironed_Out","8","0","1","2 April 2013"," 'Argo' - simplicity at it's finest
","Occasionally, simplicity is the best route to go down, and Affleck does it to perfection with this gripping picture.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie, and how Affleck has created it, is that it had the potential to be quite a dull, slow film. It's not, which is testament to how it's produced and directed. It's best described as a suspense thriller, with a bit of action and humour thrown in.<br/><br/>Is it the best film you'll ever watch? Highly unlikely. No doubt there's better out there, other films that are far superior to Argo have been completely bypassed for awards. But, what makes it great, is it's simplicity. There's no complex plot, no deep, in depth twists and turns. It's just a funny, edge-of-your seat and completely compelling spectacle, which is almost flawless. Affleck goes back to basics, and focuses on producing a film not driven by violence, but by excitement.<br/><br/>It really is a great watch. The two hours fly by, and you get completely hooked into the plot. I wouldn't take much notice of the 'based on actual events' link. This isn't a historically accurate story-telling film. It's not meant to be. You will find that it's quite wide of the mark in that respect. It uses the factual events as a template to build, what ends up being, quite a fictional plot and story. Affleck does that for the better.<br/><br/>The acting is bang on the money. Arkin and Goodman are brilliant in their laid-back roles, and bring the comedy value to the table. Affleck is excellent and the entire hostage team do a good job at what they're asked to do. Like the feature, the characters are basic and simple, but it's what gives you the ability to just watch and get sucked into a world of paranoia and suspense.<br/><br/>As long as you don't go into this movie based on the awards it's won, you'll enjoy it. It's not the best film you'll ever see or have seen. The awards aren't given because it's complex or brilliantly acted or full of uniqueness. They're given because the film is exciting and enjoyable. It's basic, simple and predictable, but it's flawless simplicity. It peels back the outer layers and presents you with what's important and interesting.<br/><br/>And, sometimes, simplicity is best."
"owenmcalister","9","0","1","2 April 2013"," Appreciate the genre
","I think the main reason for most of the negative reviews on here is that those people were probably expecting explosions and stuff like that. After all, it is a film about a CIA operative extracting six fugitives from Iran. However, this film does not include explosions, or gunfights, or any James Bond stunts.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a film like that, walk away now. What this film is a tension filled political thriller, and a bloody good one at that. Some people in the UK have given this bad reviews plainly because they were not credited. Yes, the British Embassy sheltered the fugitives for a few days before agreeing they would be safer in the Canadian Embassy, but so what? I'm a British citizen and I couldn't care less about our absence in the movie. If the director wants to go the extra mile and add a pointless half an hour on the movie, let him, but Ben Affleck pulled this off with flying colours. <br/><br/>Speaking of Affleck, I've never really been a huge fan, but he is phenomenal in this movie. He does a great job as a director and an even better job as Tony Mendez. The only complaint is there wasn't enough of a backstory, he talks on the phone to his kid near the beginning but they weren't very believable as father and son. For me though, Alan Arkin and John Goodman make the movie. They supply the comedy to the movie while Affleck does the drama. Also, Bryan Cranston didn't have a big enough part, hes a great actor but he didn't get chance to show it in this film. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a mature spy thriller, with an exceptional cast, and *very* believable characters. On a side note, the sound track fits perfectly and Lora Kennedy (Casting Director) definitely, without a doubt, picked the right people for this movie. Ignore the negative reviews and watch this, because this is one of those films people will be talking about for a while."

I really liked the authenticity because I really felt like I was brought back to the seventies, and at first I couldn't help giggling at the mustaches, haircuts and glasses, these reminded me of the old photos I've seen of my parents and their friends.<br/><br/>All in all Argo is an awesome movie about conflicts between countries and about situations were people get stuck in these conflicts.

","Let me skip the usual intro that would start with something not really related with the movie and then making an amazing connection with the movie no one saw coming. Let's go in medias res:<br/><br/>1) The story. ""Inspired by true events"" can be a tricky thing. One can hold on to the facts so strong that it becomes boring, or one can give it too much imagination so in the end it doesn't even slightly resemble the true version. Argo is neither. It is smart, fun, entertaining and provocative at the same time. The parallel stories showing confusion, panic, fear at one end (the field operation), combined simultaneously with almost the same elements on the other end (the CIA and presidential offices) is something not many can do. The story is fantastic, and it will rip the nerves right out of your body! The thing that makes it more interesting are the end credits when we are presented with photos of the pictured event that show us just how pedant (documentaristic I dare say) Affleck was while directing it. But be aware, the final half an hour is seriously nerve damaging. I cannot recall a movie in the last 10 years that made me feel this way.<br/><br/>2) The acting. Since there are a lot of small roles, a lot of almost cameo roles in the movie it would be impossible to give a good review of the acting because no one, except Affleck, had a lot of screen time. The roles of Arkin, Cranston and Goodman were brilliant. Arkin and Goodman had so much fun while acting that they could hardly hide it (if they were even trying to). They form such a great team, so entertaining and vivid, that every scene with them was so fun to watch one could watch it over and over again without getting tired. Cranston on the other hand gave a much more serious role (and had a more serious character). His acting was an amazing opposite to Goodman and Arkin creating a perfect harmony between them. Everyone else was also very good or excellent. Even Affleck gave a really good role, but the best of him was his face. It doesn't change, move, or form any kind of gesture during the entire movie. Stone cold and great.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that is all I can say about this movie. A great spy thriller with amazing roles, great acting and an interesting subliminal political criticism of the Carter administration and the Iran revolution. Now, is this Oscar worthy? Yes, but not best picture. The Oscar for the script is well deserved, but instead of best picture Affleck should have gotten one for best director."

","I must confess that when I saw the trailer for this I thought it looks like an enjoyable enough, but generic and conventional typical Hollywood thriller. Argo looked to me as a film to rent, but not to watch at the cinema and the expense that entails. All of a sudden, the hype seemed to get bigger and bigger, with constantly excellent reviews. However I had missed my chance to see Argo at the cinema, and then of course all the awards came along. There was a one of chance to see it again at my local independent cinema, but that showing was completely sold out. So I had to wait for the DVD release. Sometimes films can be over-hyped, putting expectations sky high and only leading to disappointment. I am pleased to see I personally feel that the hype is justified. Foe me, Argo is an extremely enjoyable and well made old fashioned style thriller. <br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed Gone Baby Gone, and The Town was also a good watch. Argo poses a much bigger challenge to Affleck as a director with different story strands, various contrasting locations and trying to create a sense of tension while holding all this together. I have to say I thought this is all handled extremely well. There is very rarely a dull moment as the pacing is excellent and the film constantly grips with something always going on as what is happening in Tehran, CIA headquarters and Hollywood is all held together extremely well. The scenes in Tehran are extremely well made, feeling claustrophobic and containing a real genuine sense of intensity and edge. There is also a genuine and authentic feel of what these various places would be like 1980. What is produced is an excellent thriller proving that Hollywood can produce genuinely gripping and intelligent thrillers instead of the generic and forgettable crap it usually does.<br/><br/>However, Argo is not without flaws. There is a subplot involving Mendez' relationship with his son. This may be here to try and add depth to the character, but they add nothing and just prove an annoying distraction from the main plot. Affleck himself is adequate but not amazing, which begs the question as to if he was not producer and director, would he be the one playing Mendez? Maybe Ben should decide to remain behind the camera, especially as he has a brother who is a very talented actor. Argo is of course based on a true story; the key word here is 'based' as this allows a certain amount of dramatic license. There were possibly a few too many clichéd 'that was close' moments towards the end, it surely could not be the case that these all happened. I understand the need for dramatic tension, but these sometimes feel a little clichéd and mechanical, detracting from what is already a naturally tense situation. There is also a really cringe worthy scene at the end involving an American flag in the background. I do not know if this was intentional, but it all feels a little Team America. However, these are minor quibbles with what is otherwise an excellent thriller thoroughly deserving of the awards it has received.<br/><br/>Argo is an excellent addition to a directorial CV that is becoming continuously impressive. Argo is a very entertaining and extremely well paced thriller that grips till the very end, demonstrating Affleck as potentially one of Hollywood's up and coming directors."

","The plot of Argo is so crazy and unbelievable that it must be true. In order to get six US diplomats hiding in the Canadian ambassador's residence out of Teheran, the CIA set up a fake film company, publicize the production of a fake film and send an agent into Iran who tries to smuggle the six out under the pretense of being a location scout team. Ben Affleck directed the film and he plays Tony Mendez, the real CIA man behind this ultimately successful operation. Argo is not a tale of heroism, it is a tale of professionals doing their job. His Tony is a serious, realistic man who knows the risks but is also aware that this is their best chance, as crazy as the idea sounds. Argo allows the viewer deep insights into the bureaucracy, the envy and power games, the lack of reality, a power apparatus like the CIA brings with it. Yet, it never condemns or exaggerates. This is, after all, a bureaucratic organization and within that framework, these people are trying to do what is best. The scenes within the CIA are one highlight of the film, those inside the ambassador's residence in which Mendez and the six refugees struggle with themselves and each other about whether they can and should take the risk, are the other.<br/><br/>Argo is a film about people under pressure, humans in a state of emergency trying to figure out and do what is right. These scenes as well as the one in which the fake location scouts visit a Teheran bazar are of an almost unbearable intensity, driven by a painfully close, increasingly unsettling camera which captures and mirrors the threat of people unravelling, fearing for their lives. In these moments, Affleck gives the film an almost documentary feel, plunging the viewer right into the scene as it happens. But Argo is also a very cleverly constructed thriller in which the suspense rises almost imperceptibly until the audience are suddenly right on the edges of their seats, hardly knowing how they got there. Affleck does a great job letting the story breathe, never artificially heightening the tension, allowing it to organically grow from the existential threat under which these people live. Adding a wonderful subtle little Hollywood satire, perfectly enacted by the fake filmmakers Alan Arkin and John Goodman, Argo is a memorably film about normal people surviving under pressure, in which good and bad are still a little too easy to differentiate.<br/><br/>http://stagescreen.wordpress.com"
"doug_park2001","8","0","2","21 March 2013"," Compelling 1980-like Film
","Tip: If you are unfamiliar with the story and fate of the six Americans who escaped from the U.S. Embassy during the hostage crisis in Tehran, 1980, it might work better if you do not read any more about it before watching this film in order to allow more element of surprise.<br/><br/>Either way, however, ARGO is quite gripping, and even those of us who remember the event(s) will find the new information (declassified in 1997) an interesting spin. Moreover, even those who already know how the basic story comes out should find human interest and a compelling narrative in the micro-events of how it all (supposedly) occurred.<br/><br/>Many have complained that ARGO has a TV Land feeling to it. I agree, and consider that one of the film's strongest points. It's easy to understand why many who are used to today's finely tuned film production are disappointed or at least dismayed by ARGO's atmosphere. Its subject is neither ""current"" nor what most of us consider ""history."" Ergo, the straightforward and unsensationalized cinematography helps to capture the mood of these events and also contributes to the time setting, i.e., really harks back to 1980.<br/><br/>Excellent script: Especially insofar as the CIA and State Department are concerned, it made me think, ""That's how the talks must have gone."" The news bits and recreation of the demonstrations in Tehran are equally mesmerizing. There were times when I wished for subtitles of all the chanting and certain other dialogue from the Iranians, but at the same time, I like the way it allows room for anyone not fluent in Farsi to sense the gist of it all.<br/><br/>Though his acting performance is stilted, Affleck's direction of this film is truly fine, and the acting by most of the other major players, particularly those who play the would-be hostages and those who play the Iranians, is quite commendable."
"TxMike","Null","0","2","21 March 2013"," Mostly true, with some fictional elements, "" based on a true story.""
","The movie has an excellent opening scene, basically summarizing the history of Iran, formerly Persia, over the past 2500 or so years. In modern times, starting around 1950, gradual ""western"" elements in Iran were objectionable, until in the 1970s real hatred of the USA came on full-force when the Shah was given refuge.<br/><br/>This story starts in 1979 when angry Iranians stormed the US Embassy and took prisoners. Six of the Americans managed to sneak out into the streets and sought refuge with the British and Canadians. The story told here focuses on their being given refuge by the Canadians.<br/><br/>Back home members of the government, including the CIA, brainstorm on how to get the six out of Iran to safety. Ben Affleck is Tony Mendez (real person) who calls himself an Exfil. We looked it up and it is short for ""exfiltration"", the opposite of ""infiltration."" One evening while talking to his son by phone, and watching one of the ""Planet of the Apes"" movies, Tony has a brainstorm, maybe he can go into Iran posing as a filmmaker scouting locations, then represent the six captives as members of his scouting team, then get them out of the country with fake passports and a fake movie script, complete with storyboards.<br/><br/>Since it is ""based"" on the real events and not a ""documentary"", invariably some things are presented to increase the excitement. Like the last-second approval for tickets to get home, or the dramatic chase of the 747 on the runway during takeoff. But the overall story is faithful, and the whole movie illustrates the vast divide between western values and those of culture with ancient roots, like the Iranians.<br/><br/>The actors are all first-rate, and it was fun to see Bryan Cranston as one of the Washington operatives, after getting to know him so well in his role as Walter White in ""Breaking Bad."" <br/><br/>Overall a very entertaining movie, we all enjoyed it. We didn't worry at all that some of it is fiction, it's movie-making after all!"

","If we park the liberties taken with actual historical events and some reviews on this site read more like a doctorate on American foreign policy than a review on the film.

This did the one thing I want on a Saturday night it was entertaining, good story line, the actors carry the story convincingly, good pace and a sharp as a tack script, my favourite line is ""at least they will be confused when their torturing you"" I know some people are hung up on it not being historically correct but I love Blade Runner and it bears little resembles to Phillip K Dick's novel Do Androids dream of electric sheep which I also love, both stand as works in their own right I believe this film stands as a work in its own right.

"ihatewindows-635-119645","4","0","3","17 March 2013"," A historically inaccurate propaganda film
","Argo is a dramatic period piece recounting of the events that unfolded in the middle eastern country of Iran after the Shah was exiled and his regime overthrown in 1980. The United States Embassy was over run by protesters in support of Ayatollah Khomeini and the staff is taken hostage in exchange for the return of the Shah to face justice for crimes against his people. Ben Affleck portrays Tony Mendez, an expert CIA operative that specializes in getting people out of these situations. The action begins after a brief history lesson that gives us the context for these characters and helps to establish characterization of the protesters through external action in contrast to the internal action that the embassy staff are experiencing. The theme of this movie is one evocative of patriotism, and indeed, it's departure from the factual and historical truths provide a very compelling protagonist American hero, however , history tells us that the Canadian government actually did a majority of the clandestine operations that led to the escape of 6 American Embassy employees stuck in Iran after escaping the Embassy. The story is depicted in chronological order and evokes maximum emotional response, but begins in a very brief exposition and directly into the complication, with the white knuckle climax of the escape through 3 separate check points in the airport with fake credentials. John Goodman and Bryan Cranston lend stellar performances to this film which make it a compelling story. I found myself very thrilled by the tension and the symbolism of revolution being used at such a contentious time in our history being recounted at a time when our relationship with Iran is currently tentative at best. The musical score for this movie is well produced and by Mickey Mousing the suspense creates a crucial element in the narrative, adding just the right amount of drama and tension through the climatic scenes. The film is wrought with irony and may be a fine example of propaganda by Hollywood being adopted for use by governments to wage a psychological and ideological war against Iran. The theme depicts the moral implication of spying agencies running covert operations on foreign soil, and the social problems that are caused by geopolitical manipulation of governments or people through politics in the struggle for human dignity. The Iranian people had been through so much they had become overwhelmed with American agencies lying and supporting the tyrant that had ruled the country for the past 30 years. The cinematography is excellent in its portrayal of the era. The consistency throughout the film is coherent and lends itself to effective storytelling, allowing the audience to suspend disbelief and travel back to a place in time where Jimmy Carter was president and 20 hostages spent 444 days held captive for the sake of politics that don't have citizens best interests, but interests of those who rule them in mind."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","0","4","13 March 2013"," A film for those who remember the last fifty years of world history
","This film is a complex and complicated story. <br/><br/>The first thing to say is that the acting is good, very good, contrasting the tense situation, nerve-breaking actually, and the very calm behavior of most of the six hostages and the placid looking behavior of the CIA agent. Not to speak of the tremendous mental tension of most of Iranian people at the airport and the extreme excitation of some in the bazaar and most of the revolutionary guards. That is well done and very effective for us to believe we are in a real situation and not in some James Bond film.<br/><br/>Then the story itself is a very sorry episode of Iranian history, when the Islamic revolution succeeded against the corrupted regime of the Shah who had taken over after the ousting of Mossadegh who had nationalized Iranian oil. The film forgets to insist on the fact the CIA had heavily helped in the coup d'état that ousted the elected Prime Minister. That would have shown how there was a time before 1975 and another after 1975. Before 1975 the US played the cop of the world and after the defeat in Vietnam they became more humble, though not that long. Reagan brought the pride out again. That's what is more or less forgotten in the film that pretends to speak of real events.<br/><br/>The film though is quite good at showing the enormous change that started after 1975. In twenty years the world was to be completely transformed. The defeat in Vietnam caused the emergence of strong movements negating imperialism. Iran was one of these though it was hijacked by the hyper fundamentalist clerics of Iranian Islam who imposed a violent revolution with all kinds of coercion against the people who resisted the strict application of Islamic laws, and of course against Americans. <br/><br/>The strangest evolution was still to come yet since all those who stuck to a non-market economy were to fall down the historical chute, the flushing chute. The Soviet Union and all their Eastern European block were the first victims and they just fell into the free market economy with a great splash in the world's attentive tension. China felt the trend and changed their policy at the end of the 1970s and we know what happened next. The world was to be completely restructured and economic power was to be completely reshuffled and redistributed.<br/><br/>That's in these transitory years of 1979 to 1981 that the hostage crisis in Iran took place. The US embassy was taken over by the revolutionaries and the American personnel was taken hostage, but six had escaped and found refuge at the Canadian Ambassador's residence. The film concerns these six who were in great danger. They were retrieved by a CIA agent sent there as a film producer with the complicity and help of some Hollywood people. That's another change taking place in the USA this time: Americans were ready to serve, even if it was not exactly very good for their public images. Hollywood was on the patriotic side after having been widely against the Vietnam war.<br/><br/>That's what I like in this period and in this film. You feel the world is tilting in a different direction though the film does not explain which one since the past is not examined and the future is not even hinted at. But we feel more than perfectly that in-between spirit and atmosphere. The Americans are on the run but they are no longer defeated. They are pulling back in order to revamp their forces. But fear is their basic emotion and that too is a good thing about this period. Fear had changed sides and the USA have had to reconquer their stamina and to try to start getting rid of their arrogance and absolute certainty to be right above all others. <br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
"fredschaefer-406-623204","9","0","2","8 March 2013"," Well Made, but Best Picture....Maybe?
","There is no doubt that Ben Affleck is a major directorial talent; Agro, his third effort after Gone Baby Gone and The Town is the story of Tony Mendez, the CIA operative who infiltrated Khomeini's Iran at the height of the 444 day Hostage Crisis and safely extracted 6 Americans who had escaped the takeover of the American Embassy on November 4th, 1979 and found sanctuary with the Canadians. At the time it was known as the ""Canadian Caper"" and the Central Intelligence Agency's role was classified and kept from the public; all credit for the rescue of the Americans went to Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor, his staff, and the government of Canada. <br/><br/>Argo therefore can be seen as one of those ""the real story"" expose's, an attempt to set the record straight and give credit to a heretofore unsung hero, Tony Mendez, the man who came up with the idea of creating a fake movie project to use as a cover in order to get the six Americans through Iranian customs disguised as members of a Canadian film crew.<br/><br/>And within these parameters, Affleck succeeds admirably; first in very accurately recreating the world of 1979-1980, not only in Washington and Tehran, but also Hollywood, right down to the shaggy hairdos, way to many mustaches, and side burns worn by men who should have known better. Then, in Chris Terrio's script, laying out just how desperate the situation was for America in Iran after the fall of the Shah when the most powerful men in Washington could do nothing but sit in their offices and hold endless meetings while a government half the world away waged war on them in a manner for which they were wholly unprepared.<br/><br/>Mendez, played by Affleck himself, is presented as a quiet, competent company man, who pulls off a very difficult job using nothing more than smoke, mirrors and pure bluff. Mendez is the anti-Rambo and he would be utterly out of place in a typical action movie revenge fantasy. This is the heart of the story Affleck presents: a tribute to American competency and our dedication to getting the job done.<br/><br/>And there is the rub, for many in the wider world do not see it that way and Argo has rankled many, especially those in the Great White North, who feel that Affleck had tweaked the record at the expense of their country's considerable role in the rescue of the Americans. After all, it was Ambassador Taylor and his staff who stuck their own necks out for months on end by hiding the six Americans in a city where the Ayatollah's mobs ruled, while Mendez was in country only a few days. They certainly have a point, but Affleck has made it clear that this is Mendez's story, told from his point of view.<br/><br/>Then there is the matter of the CIA's role in keeping the Shah in power for so many years; this along with America's support of an oppressive dictator is only lightly touched on in the script. There are many around the world who saw the Hostage Crisis as nothing more than America's just desserts. But the staff at the American Embassy were no more responsible for the Shah than they were for the rise of the Ayatollahs. Khomeini or the Shah? One thing everyone can agree on is that the people of Iran deserved better than either of them. <br/><br/>Bottom line, Affleck has made an historical drama, and as always with movies of this type, especially ones that deal with recent history, the toes of those with political agendas get stepped on. It is up to the viewer to see the movie for themselves and make up their own minds free of influence while taking into account the bias and propaganda of others. <br/><br/>One thing no one disputes is that certain events depicted in Argo have been tweaked for dramatic effect: I'm talking about the tarmac chase at the conclusion, something that never happened in real life.<br/><br/>One thing no one can find fault with is Argo's great cast of familiar faces: Bryan Cranston, Victor Garber (as Ken Taylor), Tate Donovan, Rory Cochrane, Clea Duvall, Kyle Chandler (as Hamilton Jordan), Michael Parks, Chris Messina, Titus Welliver, Zeljko Ivanek, Bob Gunton (as Cyrus Vance), Philip Baker Hall (as CIA Director Stansfield Turner), Adrianne Barbeau. But the real standouts are John Goodman and Alan Arkin as two old Hollywood hands whose involvement in the scheme was essential to its success. Arkin got a well deserved Supporting Actor nomination, while this is the second Best Picture winner in a row to feature Goodman (the other was The Artist).<br/><br/>Did Argo deserve to win Best Picture? Probably not, it's no where near the league of The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Godfather, or even The Departed, all Best Picture winners that resonate with audiences years and decades after they win. I'll bet in a few years we'll be wondering why either Life of Pi, Silver Linings Playbook, Zero Dark Thirty or Lincoln didn't take home the golden statue."

Cliffhangers had their fair share in my days but I cannot complain at all, given the Star Cast in this. My particular favourite, Mr Affleck, looking rather mature, for a change, and it suits him well, not forgetting Chris Messina and the ever enduring Zeljko Ivanek! All wow factors, for me!

"dblake168","8","0","1","25 February 2013"," Deserving of its Oscar (mostly)
","First off, I am an American who is half Iranian, so I may have experienced a few different emotions from those watching it with me. This is mainly due to the fact that Iranians are the clear antagonists in this plot, so I felt a little conflicting rooting against them as you would, say, against the Joker in The Dark Knight. You really just want to see Batman punch him in the face a few times. <br/><br/>However, this is part of why the film accomplishes its goal quite well. If you go into this movie expecting a completely historically accurate film down to every little detail that presents a completely neutral viewpoint, then you will be thoroughly disappointed, because that is not its purpose. Plenty of scenes replicate actual photos and video footage from the Hostage Crisis, though of course there is a small amount of theatrical liberty taken with the storyline. I didn't feel like this took anything away from the film's credibility, etc.<br/><br/>In this movie it's a diplomacy battle of America vs. Iran, and shortly after the opening historic background sequence you will be taking sides with America for the next 2 hours. As an Iranian I didn't have a problem with this; it's part of the film! If you don't understand that and are going to take huge issue with this kind of U.S. viewpoint, then you should watch a documentary instead. Another review mentioned the lack of subtitles for the Iranians... this is a typical strategy in film to create both suspense and mystery. It's not demeaning to Iranians. I thought it was appropriate and also necessary. Again, to contradict another review, not all the Iranians are portrayed as angry.(Small spoiler maybe): Sahar the housekeeper's daughter is subtly a huge part of the operation succeeding and in the Bazaar scene several Iranians try to protect the ""Canadians"" from the angry people in the street.<br/><br/>Although the directing was fantastic (how Affleck did not get nominated by the Academy is beyond me), I thought Affleck's acting was a bit dry, which is the main reason I give Argo an 8 instead of 9. If not for one scene with him on the phone with his son, I wouldn't have thought he had a soul. He was much better in The Town, his other self-directed starring role. Arkin was hilariously brilliant again (see: Little Miss Sunshine and Glengarry Glen Ross) and Cranston was excellent as always. I also was impressed with the selection of the actors to play the 6 escaped Americans. Their emotions and personalities were quite convincing. <br/><br/>Overall, an excellent film worth watching, regardless of whether you have any previous knowledge of the 1979-1981 Crisis. It does a fine job presenting what is one of the most important intelligence missions and government cooperations in American history while keeping you on the edge of your seat and sometimes wrenching your heart. Could have given a little more credit to the Canadians, but if you are one of those Americans that just think Canada is the United States' syrup-filled hat, your mind will surely be changed."
"bob-rutzel-1","9","0","1","20 February 2013"," Tension, Suspense and a Terrific Cast win this one
","This is based upon a true story. An American film crew posing as a Canadian film crew is to make a movie in Iran, but the real purpose is to free 6-American diplomats hiding out in the Canadian Ambassador's house. The CIA knows that the Iranians will soon discover that 6-diplomats are missing from the American Embassy staff so time is of the essence to save their lives. <br/><br/>This movie works because there is tension and suspense throughout, and this tension is transmitted to the viewing audience. I was riveted to the screen. Even though we know the eventual outcome we are tense and apprehensive anyway. The pacing is perfect and the shots alternating between the 6-diplomats and the CIA provided a sense of urgency. This is a tribute to director Ben Affleck and the entire cast. Hey, if we were apprehensive, think how the real 6-diplomats actually felt when this was happening to them. The portrayals by the actors in here helped sell this. And, the people behind the scenes trying to free these diplomats were on the same page even though they knew how dangerous the plan was. <br/><br/>The entire cast was perfect and this includes the actors portraying the Iranians, but 3-actors stand out: Bryan Cranston (as Jack O'Donnell - CIA chief); Alan Arkin (as Lester Siegel - Director); and Ben Affleck (as Tony Mendez who came up with the film plan). I was impressed with Affleck's portrayal of Mendez who was most calm during everything. Was Mendez really this way? No matter as everything worked. Hey, I bought it. <br/><br/>Was everything told and was this the way everything really happened? No matter as we were given plausible scenarios and convincing dialogues and the plan worked. There may have been some poetic license near the end when the 6-diplomats and Mendez were on the SwissAir plane racing down the runway just ahead of the Iranians in a jeep chasing the plane. The Iranians knew the missing 6-diplomats were on the plane. <br/><br/>I am reminded of Hannibal from the A-Team (TV show) saying he loved it when a plan came together. Or something like that. <br/><br/>After some of the credits at the end, we hear President Carter talk about this incident. <br/><br/>Was this good enough to win the Oscar for Best Picture? Yes. And, Affleck for Best Director? Yes. And Allen Arkin for Best Supporting Actor? Yes. (you done now?) Yes. Thank you, Canada. (9/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Soft stuff only and not much of it."

I feel sorry about the Iranians who are watching this movie, it should be very sad to see how the billion dollar movie industry in US can show any country whatever they want. I know this because another movie (Taken 2) showed Turkey as a 3rd world country with all the women covered and the streets like hell.<br/><br/>They never showed any single educated Iranian, their arts, etc. All of the Iranians were angry people except the housekeeper.<br/><br/>I don't know the actual history behind this movie but the acting was good, I am very surprised to see Ben Affleck as a very good acting in this movie.<br/><br/>The story evolved very nice keeping the tension up until the plane passes over Iranian air border. I was thrilled until the last 5 minutes.<br/><br/>John Goodman and Alan Arkin added a nice taste to this movie but their part was not that long.<br/><br/>I took 3 stars out because, this movie is full of propaganda. But still it is a watchable movie and I don't think it deserves any Oscar since this movie is made because of the propaganda reason.

"jake-law123","8","0","3","18 February 2013"," The hot film of the year!
","Ben Affleck, after all these years, is catching up with the other directors in the Oscars. All his films are either not that good, or not Oscar worthy, but now he has made a film nominated for 7 Oscars, including best picture, which it may win in a week from now. But it is well deserved. This IS the film to watch if you're looking for something hot and fashionable. It's got a perfect 1970's feel to it, with an excellent score, and writing.<br/><br/>The Oscars have finally recognized that Ben Affleck has talent, as he adapts a film to the 1979 mission to extract 6 American hostages from revolutionary Iran, as the CIA sends in special agent Tony Mendez, (Ben Affleck) to extract them with their confidential plan to fake a film to make the Iran visit more real, hence the name of the film ""Argo"".<br/><br/>From beginning to end, the mission is the main focus. No filler in any scene, the characters are likable, and fun to watch, as well as watching as they plan out the mission. The writing is brilliantly adapted, and not simple minded ""here's our plan"". During the mission, I was on the edge of my seat in the theater from beginning to end. Every scene is tense because any minute any of them could be compromised, destroying them all. Performances are brilliant by all. Ben Affleck maintains a straight professional face for most of the film, though I think it still works. The reactions of everybody as the mission unfolds is just so tense. You feel how scared they are, and even though you know they make it out, the tension with the music and cinematography is still amazing.<br/><br/>What do I mean when I say this movie is hot? This is the Dark Knight of 2012. That 1 film that exploits every magazine, TV ad, or billboard. It shows it too. You feel that 70's feeling with the 70's music, hairstyles, and so on. Ben Affleck did a great job and making you truly feel like you were in the situation with these characters, and like Ron Howard's masterpiece Apollo 13, this film, despite knowing what will happen, can still shock and surprise you, and any film that does that is definitely worth a watch. Though i'm hoping Lincoln will win best picture, this film, if it does, is still acceptable."
"cultjones","8","0","3","17 February 2013"," A Go for Argo!
","Based on a true story that transpired during the 1979 revolution in Iran, Argo tells the tale of a CIA mission to extract 6 Americans under the rouse of a film crew. Donning the hat of the lead and director, Ben Affleck unravels the story brilliantly keeping the audience chucking and at the edge of their seat simultaneously. The large and recognisable cast from John Goodman and Alan Arkin to Bryan Cranston, play their roles perfectly well and keep you glued to the screen. <br/><br/>Even though you may know how the story ends, you'll still find your palms sweating as you forget to breathe while rooting for the underdogs. The Argo team must also be commended for visually recreating the 70s/80s to give the audience a certain authenticity. <br/><br/>When Ben Affleck burst on the scene with the Oscar winning screenplay of Good Will Hunting, he was billed as one of the next rising stars with an abundance or promise. However Hollywood is a fickle wench where you're only as good as your last movie and after a few bad choices such as Jersey Girl and the unpronounceable, Gigli, Affleck's star dimmed considerably. It was a credible performance in Hollywoodland along with his writing/directing prowess in The Town that firmly stamped his mark in the industry. With Argo, he simply cemented that stamp. This is definitely one to watch."

This film could have been a total disaster, but it works so well. And very sure will get the odd Oscar or two. To be honest its the director that really gets the credit on this. There is a lot of detail in the movie and it really shows. Well done. Hope to see more movies like this."

","Directed by Ben Affleck<br/><br/>Starring Ben Affleck, Bryan Cranston and Alan Arkin<br/><br/>Written by Chris Terrio, Tony Mendez and Joshuah Bearman<br/><br/>Argo is 'a dramatization of the 1980 joint CIA-Canadian secret operation to extract six fugitive American diplomatic personnel out of revolutionary Iran.'<br/><br/>This film surprised me. I was coming in with a so-so attitude. I wasn't expecting it to be good but I wasn't expecting it to be bad. But when the film ended, immediately I knew that I just finished watching an excellent picture.<br/><br/>There is one man who I give so much credit to in this film and his name is Ben Affleck. He did a great job. This was my first film directed by the actor. His vision of the 80's was excellent. Everything was there; set design, appropriate cars, signs, clothes and cameras used in the film itself. The music chosen was great. It gave an 80's edge to it. There is also music given the Iranian tone as well. Gave a great atmosphere to the film.<br/><br/>Affleck's great directing skills came into play in the beginning of the film and in the climax. The beginning gave the film it's voice. It couldn't have started any better. All the facts were there. It presented why the hostages were threatened and Iran's anger. The climax was some of the best film making I've seen this year. The music, acting and camera movements blend really well together. The cut scenes from the airport and the FBI agency was superbly edited. As the hostages along with Ben Affleck's character are boarding the plane, I was on the tip of my seat. The film doesn't let you relax because new information is being thrown at you every second. I don't want to give much of the plot away because it is something you certainly have to see for yourself.<br/><br/>That all being said, this film also has it's flaws. There were times in the film where I was questioning this picture because there are long bouts of dialogue in the process of getting the 'film' made with a few witty remarks. it kept me border lined entertained. But once the film's wheels started turning, the flaws seemed so distant.<br/><br/>Argo was something I didn't expect. I salute Ben Affleck and hope he keeps this great run of directed films. A must see!"

","This could be another movie about Americans struggling through a mission in the middle-east. But it is not. At the beginning it displays an historical background about what led to the moment when this action occurred, which shows that at the time the Iranians were just trying to free their country from tyranny, creating an empathy with them (capitalized in the sequence where one of the hostages describes ""Argo"" to the airport officer).<br/><br/>In this movie we don't get to see spectacular acts in this movie (besides Ben Affleck), and there aren't many special effects. But it triumphs because, during most of it, there is great tension and drama, since there are many ways the plan can go wrong (again, capitalized at the airport).<br/><br/>I recommend it to anyone, and is, with no doubt, one of the great movies of 2012."
"drqshadow-reviews","9","0","2","11 February 2013"," One of the Year's Best - and Most Digestible - Thrillers
","Ben Affleck's latest bit of Oscar bait effectively balls up the tension, drama and political tripwires of the Iranian hostage crisis without feeling overly dense or inapproachable. An impressive, authentic collection of '70s wardrobe and scenery is partially to thank, with bad hair and cigarette smoke billowing about freely, and goes a long ways toward immersing its audience in the era. The abundance of distinct, colorful characters and speedy editing, though, are what I found most appreciable. At times it almost feels like one long montage, with a short attention span and abundance of quick cuts, but a nose for pertinent info and several key performances from its cast add enough substance to flesh things out nicely. Although Affleck's grim, game-faced leading character is often subdued to a fault, his Hollywood contacts (Alan Arkin and John Goodman), Washington supervisor (Bryan Cranston) and scared-stiff American refugees make up for those inadequacies with vigor. Alternatingly funny, adventurous, powerful and intense, it's a melting pot of emotion with a hectic, exhilarating third act."

","""You need somebody who's a somebody to put their name on it. Somebody respectable. With credits. Who you can trust with classified information. Who will produce a fake movie. For free."" In Iran in 1979 the citizens were not happy. The Shah who massacred the people was sick and given refuge in the US. When the US refused to extradite him the citizens stormed the American Embassy and took 52 hostages. Six managed to escape before the embassy was overrun and find refuge with the Canadian Embassy. Worried their lives will be in danger when the hostage takers find out the launch a rescue effort. The best bad idea they had was to set up a fake movie and fly them out as part of the crew. The movie is fake but the drama and story is real. Sometimes seeing a movie after it's been hyped up you are disappointed. After all the talk of this plus it's Golden Globe wins really put this in an area where you have a certain expectation. This is one of the few that can hold up to those expectations. The movie was very very good combining humor and extremely tense situations made it extremely entertaining. I knew really nothing about this aspect of the actual story so the whole thing was new to me and that helped my enjoyment. I still think Lincoln was a better movie but if this does win best picture at the Oscars I would not be disappointed or surprised. This is a definite must see.

"lakeober","8","0","1","6 February 2013"," One Word Describes It... ""Intense!""
","I saw the trailers for this movie about a month before it came out, and quickly thought to myself ""I'm gonna pass on that one"". However, a few weeks after it's release, one of my college professors had spoke about it in his class, and said that it was an exceptional film. So, when I saw that it was playing at my local discount theater, my wife and I decided to go. As soon as we arrived, it was obvious that we were not the only ones who had this idea... the theater was filled to capacity (for the 2nd weekend in a row from what I was told). I can truly say, the trailer doesn't do this movie justice. As soon as the film began, we were faced with an intense and realistic scene of violence and action. We were thrown right into the story, and felt as if we were in the middle of the crowd. After the opening sequence... the action is calmed down a bit, and you have the chance to sort through what all happened in the intro scene. However, it doesn't last for long. The director of this film does an incredible job of making the audience feel as if they are part of the group depicted in the movie. He designed the film so that the intensity slowly grew and grew throughout the film, and builds up to an explosive and powerful ending. The ending of the film was in fact so intense, that the entire audience in the movie theater was clapping and cheering when it occurred (my friend had told me that this same thing occurred at the movie theater he saw the film at). I found myself literally sitting on the edge of my seat, and extremely tense, wanting to know what would happen to the individuals in the film. So, all in all, I would highly recommend this film to movie buffs and the average Joe. It is a film that perfectly blends action, comedy, and drama all into one powerful and intense experience."

","Argo is by far one of the best movies of 2012. If you compare it to movies released in 2011 it might fall short but in 2012 Argo was the best I saw. The movie starts with a brief history about the True story, which I felt was important as I am neither an American nor an Iranian. The movie does not justify what was happening nor does it show any country Bad or Good, It just shows the danger of being in a wrong place at the wrong time. The Acting by all the actors was super, specially Alan Arkin, He stole the show with his witty and funny dialogues. The best part of the movie is that it keeps you gripped till the end all thanks to the Script and Direction, That is why I feel it should wind best Director. What you learn from the movie is the most important part,that innocent people can not be made responsible for what the government or People of Power in their Country do.

","This story is bigger than the movie. An analysis of the movie Argo must reflect on the history.<br/><br/>Giving Ben Affleck's hit movie a 10 star rating has more to do with my prediction about the endurance of the now classic film than with the historic quality of the movie. This is more than a popular movie with a suspenseful and historic plot. It's a multiple layered history lesson describing how Americans became so reviled by many Middle East clerics; it's also a moral story about how international diplomacy should work during humanitarian crises.<br/><br/>Of course, we know the heroic ending of Argo, but the suspense builds, even knowing the outcome. Almost miraculously, 6 Americans (very accurately portrayed by the cast) were safely removed from Iran, led by CIA operative Tony Mendez (played by Affleck), while 52 other American Embassy personnel were held captive for 444 days during the crises. History will eventually look benevolently on President Jimmy Carter for the diplomacy he endured while trying to protect the safety of all the American hostages. Unfortunately, Carter lost his 1980 re-election campaign as a result. Yet, this hot Iranian political issue transcended the change of administration leading to the Reagan presidency. In spite of the crisis, President Carter has endured, while subsequent administrations have yet to experience the full magnifier of history. I love Argo because it entertains while it teaches multi-generations about current history, as well as the importance of international diplomacy. Most important, Argo brings President Jimmy Carter's administration into the limelight. Argo is a classic film. It gets ten stars from me because it will endure beyond the Hollywood spotlights. Affleck has created a wonderful movie and a history classic."

","With all the buzz of Argo I was excited to go and check out what the fuss is about. I must say that I loved it. It has politics, suspenseful, and even though you kinda know where it is heading there are several nail biting scenes. I sort of remember the hostages in Iran, I was ten at the time and do recall the yellow ribbons around the trees and the count up on the amount of days they were held. That event ensured that President Carter would not win a second term. In Argo, the embassy is overrun by unrolling Iranians in protest to the United States and a renegade of embassy workers, six in all, are able to escape to the Canadian Embassy. Then there is a conflict back in the US to how to rescue the Americans. In comes CIA operative Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) who comes up with the ideal cover, that they workers are actually Hollywood scouts checking out scenes for a action flick. Ben Afleck both stars and directs, but he makes for a believable undercover agent who balances following his higher ups and taking care of his people. This movie is a must see of a story that recently has come out from declassified documents. One interesting reference is when they scramble to contact White House Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan, they call under the auspices of calling from Pace Academy, a private school in Atlanta where his kids attended."

"Danusha_Goska","9","0","3","3 February 2013"," May Very Well Be the Best Film of 2012
","""Argo,"" among the nominees for the 2012 Best Picture Academy Awards, may very well be the best film of 2012, and Ben Affleck may very well be the best director. Unlike other frontrunners, ""Lincoln"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" ""Argo"" is a movie-movie. Like those other two films, it tells a true story, but unlike those other two, disappointing films, ""Argo"" is not a starchy and lumpy docudrama. ""Argo"" is a smoothly running machine. <br/><br/>""Argo"" tells a gripping story in a gripping way, never preaching (""Lincoln""), never getting too caught up in one aspect of the story to distort the narrative line (""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Lincoln."") ""Argo"" wants to entertain you, and it does. It's a thriller. My palms were sweating as much while watching this movie as while watching an old- fashioned suspense flick by Alfred Hitchcock, even though, like most viewers, I know how the story ends. I found the opening scene of the storming of the US embassy in Tehran so frightening I could hardly watch it. This is all the more remarkable given that I'd heard a radio interview in which Affleck joked about finding only older actors to perform the part of the ""students"" storming the embassy. <br/><br/>""Argo""'s cast is full of actors I know well, have seen in many other films, and whom I like a lot: Affleck, John Goodman, Alan Arkin, Victor Garber, Bryan Cranston. It's testimony to the film's power that I stopped thinking about these actors and got lost in the characters they were playing. <br/><br/>""Argo"" tells the true story of a CIA plot to release six Americans from Iran during the hostage crisis. The plot: pretend that the six Americans are Canadians there to scout locations for an upcoming Sci-Fi flick. <br/><br/>John Goodman and Alan Arkin are utterly believable, funny, and moving as the Hollywood part of the team. There's a brilliant, throwaway scene in which Alan Arkin and Richard Kind bargain over the price of a movie script. The scene doesn't advance the plot, but the dialogue is perfect and fast. It's just a witty respite in a tense movie about a life-and- death situation. Ben Affleck is perfect as a CIA operative. He keeps his cards very close to his chest. <br/><br/>Farshad Farahat plays an amazingly hairy airport guard. He screams in Farsi. Most audience members, not speaking Farsi, will have no idea what this man is saying – there are no subtitles. Even so, we are terrified. Farahat deserves an award for his brief but pivotal performance as the face and voice of the enemy the entire world now confronts, an enemy driven by incoherent, focused, murderous rage. <br/><br/>""Argo"" has a little bit of heartwarming family drama, a little bit of arcane CIA in-shop detail, a little bit of Hollywood behind-the-scenes banter, a very little bit of nightmarish torture. It never lingers in one type of scene too long; it just glides along, telling its story as economically and movingly as possible."
"manendra-lodhi","9","0","2","2 February 2013"," A very well made thriller.
","Having an upper hand on the film's story being happily ending, Affleck has proved once again that his directorial capabilities are arguably one of the best this time. The backbone of the film is its ultimately thrilling story combined with a very powerful editing.<br/><br/>The story adapted from a real incident where CIA gets out some people from Iran during crisis time is nothing new but how they did it is what makes the film so special. The film takes enough time to establish itself, so that we slowly dive into the situation mentally. Than in the second part they devise a plan to rescue all of them which looks stupid at the first thought coz it injects an abruptness in the thoughts of the audience as the story which was serious till this time has suddenly gone funny. But it is this part which makes the film different from all those different extraction films where they go the hostage place, fire some shots and rescue. This film on the other hand rarely has the firing and the protagonist who saves them all never ever fires any shot in the entire film. The film becomes a black comedy during the part when they are planning how to rescue.<br/><br/>The transition from here to the last part i.e. where the rescue operation had to take place, is smooth and engaging. You move from being in a funny state to again a serious and thrilling part of the story. A very important aspect of this film is its editing. The way that the parallel edits engage you into two places and keep you excited everywhere is difficult to achieve but it is there. The use of TV footages of those times was good and pushes the film more towards a real feel. The starting narration sequence was very good where you are taken from a long time back history to 1979 and then just after that you show the present 1979. The acting performances by all the cast was amazing and every possible thing in a filmmaking, contributes towards the last 20 minutes of the film which keeps you on the edge of your seats and finally you want to clap.<br/><br/>The film's screenplay and direction is amazing and that gives the film a sure watch signal. Argo f**k yourself.<br/><br/>MESSAGE: 'You have to be decisive.'<br/><br/>VERDICT: 'Do not miss this one.'"

","If you ever grind drama, suspense and a hint of comedy together you would definitely get a fully baked ""Argo."" Argo explains the 1980s international conflict between Iran and USA, along with the intervention of Canada. During that period, a revolution broke out outside the US embassy in Iran as the Iranians urge the Americans to release their Iranian president so that they'd execute him themselves. Along the process, 6 employers in the embassy escaped this horrific attack and made refuge in the Canadian ambassador's house namely Ken Taylor played by the underrated Victor Garber. Wasting no time, the CIA wishes to retrieve the '6' by sending Tony Mendez played by actor/ director Ben Affleck; who disguises himself and the six, as ironic it may seem, as filmmakers.<br/><br/>This movie is associated with a journey of extreme classification and difficulty. The six and Tony are nothing but random workers six in an embassy and one in a CIA; they have neither the knowledge nor the training qualification that is adequate for such calibers of a mission. Tony is indeed a CIA agent but has no on field experience. Therefore their road to freedom should have a sense of ""rookieness"" and ""incapability to continue further; and this is exactly how it is portrayed! The sprinkle of no professionalism and mistakes here and there was the icing on the cake. The rise of certain obstacles that they haven't anticipated or the initial refusal for the mission to commence added the ""lifelike"" impression to the movie; that, as a result, provided a pathway to bond with the characters and sequence of events! The viewers felt united with the six and Tony, the suspenseful ""up and down"" moments in the screenplay was well constructed for the viewers. When a problem had emerged I felt a need to solve it myself and satisfied when solved. This kind of bond; when the viewers relate with the characters, no matter how weak the story is you would have in your possession a remarkable movie. And this movie has a firm story and is indeed remarkable.<br/><br/>The thing that helped Ben Affleck's cause for a director nomination was the camera movement. It refrained from settle movements, but moved in briskness and suddenly, that satisfied the ""up and down"" movements in the script. That quick transition and movement to another character when he's talking and the quick change in scenes, made us feel that we are running with the characters; we are applying our full attention to the characters, as if we were in the room and could see all of them, that is how well the camera movements were.<br/><br/>However, once the coin is flipped, there are certain scenes that sparked a reminder to the viewers that this is indeed a movie. The minimization of the screen to show a shoot of the real life incident was really a breather from the chain of events and once the scene comes back to the movie we are back to the edge of our seats. This did not help out Ben Affleck's cause. He seemed daisy and did not plan out properly the introduction of shoots of real life, he grouped numerous shoots in the credits and sprinkled ones here and there throughout the course of the movie, if they were all in the credits, that would have been much better. When they were in the middle; between scenes, the viewers were comparing the situations of the real life and the movie, and remarked if at all they portrayed the scenes well. This suspenseful movie should not have breathers the breather should in the course of the events like the comedic scenes where Lester Siegel played by Alan Arkin gave moments of relaxation, and is still bonding with the movie.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck! How he showered me with awesomeness, and to pay him back I shower you with respect. To act and to direct yourself and others is not every director's cup of tea. But with Argo and the town he made into his daily morning ""late to work"" sip of tea! A best actor nomination you ask? Not to that extent, it was a great performance but not to be seated along the likes of Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh Jackman. This movie earned itself 7 Oscar nominations, including best picture and original score.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a political roller-coaster then I suggest this movie and a sturdy chair that can withstand weight on the edge of it."

It is one of the most beautiful 'real' thrillers of its kind. All the recent skirmishes in which America was embroiled into, all the major spots in the world where its Snipers are positioned at, where rebels are deposed off replaced by obsequious Yes Men, where even a molehill is considered a towering mountain by its news media – Middle 'Oil' East has been, is and will be its sugar pie, its bone of contention, something to pine for and sought after, and something to vent its fury at. And 'Argo' has captured it all. That is not to say I have picked a side. Nor particularly, though definitely American, has this movie. And the good thing about this is that, it's not a war movie. Nations have been known to go at war, but none of them has been as over reported, prodigiously pondered at, loquaciously talked about in one formulaic movie after the other, pondered some more in television series as has the 'Always on the right side' American wars. Oie, I digress! Set in the Iran of Ayatollah Khomeini, it is observed, right at the beginning of the movie, the Embassy of America being taken over by a furious mob who wants the hide of its past Shah, who was originally planted by Americans, and to whom it has given refuge. But America refuses to budge. As a result, the angry mob takes hostage all the diplomats inside the embassy. But six of them escape and are taken under the wing of the Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor. The people in the White House are at their wits' end as how to extract them out from their shitty predicament. But with time running out as the Iranian guards hounding every nook and cranny, desperate times calls for desperate measures. So CIA plans a phony sci-fi movie 'Argo', whose makers are scouting for an exotic location (in this case, Iran!), and sends in one of their best exfils to get them out! CIA and Hollywood are firmly hand in glove! Tout, chilling, with subtle and beautifully timed music, from its head to toe, 'Argo' got a tranced stare from my side!! Though Canadians definitely didn't like it as it undermined their role (this incident is famously called the 'Canadian Caper'!) in providing shelter and protection to the six Americans.

There are so many good performances it seems churlish to single any out, but Alan Arkin once again proves he is simply in possession of one of the greatest, and funniest, presences in cinema today.he whole thing is paced like a whip, and the third act may literally be the most suspenseful piece of film I've ever seen .

The story slow paces to a high tension convincing climax. Although the 747 chase and the assault on the airport tower where a bit overdone.

","Argo is a true story that takes place during the Iranian Hostage Crisis in the late 70's and early 80's and stars Ben Affleck, Bryan Cranston, John Goodman and Alan Arkin to name a few as well as being written and directed by Affleck. <br/><br/>The movie is about Ben Affleck's character Tony Mendez and his insane plan to rescue 6 hostages who escaped the embassy and who are hiding out in the Canadian Embassy. It's only a matter of time before the people in the US embassy find that they're missing and the CIA have to find a way of getting the 6 out of Iran. Affleck's plan is to make a fake movie and pretend to be location scouting in Iran and then come out of the country with them. It sounds crazy but it ACTUALLY HAPPENED! <br/><br/>Every actor in this movie does a great job there are no bad performances in this movie. Bryan Cranston pulls a typical great performance, John Goodman the same and Alan Arkin is a scene stealer. But the true star of the movie is Ben Affleck. He plays Tony Mendez and plays a subdued role and it suits perfectly. You can tell he loves this project and his passion shines through in his performance.<br/><br/>Affleck directs this movie fantastically. It's a tense thriller that has a lot of humour in it while still holding tension which is a credit to Affleck. Affleck has now made three movies and has now made three great movies with Argo being my personal favourite.<br/><br/>This movie is a fantastic thriller that had my nails bit back to the knuckle and one of the best movies of 2012, deserved it's win at the Golden Globes and one to watch at the Oscars<br/><br/>9/10"

I'll give him more credit as a director than as an actor, since even though he was playing the main character, it was almost as if he was invisible. I think it's on purpose, though, and extremely well played. The real main character is the tension. He builds it like a maestro, makes you feel it, as if you were there. It is with you like a great weight, until the all clear. Thankfully, he doesn't leave us in such a state, and gently bring us back down with an ending that ties up all the loose ends, while even adding a charming little detail.<br/><br/>I'll give even more props to the writers for being able to insert some laughter in such a grim story. I'm not sure exactly how the managed it, but it fits, and it is direly welcomed.<br/><br/>If you don't mind a movie set during the Iranian revolution, or all the trappings of the late 70s, it's a great movie.

This is a good example of a very solid thriller film based on real events. I will not talk about the plot here because I don't think that plot matters for most movies: the premise is basically this: the CIA has to deal with a situation where you have to evacuate a bunch of people from a hostile country. And this film shows how they done it, adding a bit of melodramatic touches to increase tension (specially the ending!).<br/><br/>However, this film is not art and it doesn't pretend to be art.

It is not surprising that ""Argo"" quickly became a box-office hit, a critical darling and an awards season favourite.<br/><br/>The Canadian Ambassador at the time complained that Canadians weren't given enough recognition for their role.

","Ben Affleck's newest movie ""Argo"" is nothing short of a masterpiece for me! The movie had everything i expected: good acting, interesting plot, great pacing, nice screenplay and magnificent editing that will probably win Argo an Oscar! Ben Affleck have now made three very good movies, and he deserves a bit credit for that, I believe! This is possibly the best movie about a dramatic event in the past. The movie has already won a Golden Globe for Best Director (Affleck) and Best Picture, and been nominated for 7 Oscars, including Best Picture. I dare say, that every award given so far is deserving, and I expect a few more to be under way, though I don't believe the Academy will grant it the Best Picture Oscar...<br/><br/>Being fifteen years old when at the time I'm writing this review, I ain't even close to have lived in the time period the movie takes place in. I've heard a few stories about it lately, but generally I didn't know anything about the events portrayed in this movie, before Argo was published to be a movie directed by Ben Affleck! I feel as though I've been introduced to the story the best possible way, and the money spent on the tickets was definitely worth it! Affleck's direction is brilliantly tireless and is clearly visible in every scene. Affleck demonstrates once again his incredible eye to detail in storytelling and his ferm grip on material that he is directing. Affleck isn't even nominated in the directing category at the Oscars... This I see as a downright Oscar snub, though there are many good directors this year!<br/><br/>Ben Affleck has never been equally as impressing with his acting as his growing directing career, but he delivers a stellar performance and is clearly doing the best he can. I thought he was quite good. Bryan Cranston is an actor who is generally casted in the same supporting categories, and he is also good in Argo. John Goodman and Alan Arkin were the acting stars of this movie, imo. They deliver their lines with finesse and you believe in their characters all the way! Arkin is definitely deserving of the Oscar nom! <br/><br/>There ain't much visual effects in this movie, but the movie has a nice score and excellent cinematography that induces the artistic and documentary feel of the movie! Many times the movie uses archival footage, actually. The best thing about the movie in the technical category... is the film editing! It's probably gonna nab a deserving Oscar for the editing, as I mentioned before.<br/><br/>Overall, Argo is an excellent movie, that shows Ben Affleck's growing career in the director's chair, as well as proving that Hollywood can still provide a movie, that eventually will be remembered as a classic!<br/><br/>10/10"

The film begins whit an amazing sequence were we get a glimpse of Irã history showed in cartoons that turn in real photos, that goes so well with the film because its a movie based in a real life event and this is pretty much a cartoon of what happened in history, and Affleck makes it so more clear that and he puts the characters of the film beside with photos of the people who lived that history. Other big achievement of the director its his ability of making working for the film to be funny and serious when it has to be. You can laugh when Ben Affleck goes to Hollywood to meet Goodman and make the fake movie look real, bud when the attention moves to Irã the movie becomes tense and you don't feel that Affleck don't know what he wants for the film, you think just the opposite, and realize how good director he became. The biggest flaw of the movie its that goes with the normal positioning of Hollywood movies and puts the United States people in the good guys role and the ugly Irã people in the bad guys role. They ware making a revolution for Christ sake they ware not happy with live and they ware trying to change it. Its sad that it went out of proportions when innocent people were hurt, but the entire role of the USA in the recent history of that country was not worthy of a good guy role."

","It is not easy to put you on the edge of your seat especially if you know how it is going to end which is where Argo triumphs. Hostage rescue from a hostile territory with no macho action or physical daredevilry requires some smart writing and believable performances which are a plenty as do the period and location attention to detail. Some aspects do look highly dramatized and fictitious especially the last step where the rescue happens just in the nick of time from the Iranian republican guard or intelligence. The dark humor is hilarious at times and background score is superb when required. It is a well made entertaining movie but may not be of Oscar winning worth. Ben Affleck has come a long way surpassing expectation and building a solid reputation for himself as a director with each venture, this time he has done one better by coming out of his comfortable Boston setup.<br/><br/>Loosely based on the rescue and exfil operation of 6 American diplomats who were taking refuge in the Canadian Ambassador's residence during the midst of the Iranian Islamic revolution. Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) proposes a preposterous plan to CIA to rescue the six American diplomats. It was so farcical that they all believed no one would suspect it and it worked. The basic plan is to setup a fake production of a middle-eastern themed science fiction movie titled 'Argo', pose the diplomats as location scouting crew and get them out. The operation is planned to the T with the help of his trusting superior Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston) and ably supported by his Hollywood acquaintances Lester (Alan Arkin) and John Chambers (John Goodman).<br/><br/>Talking of humor I just couldn't control myself laughing for no reason in John Goodman's introduction scene without him even saying a word. Bryan Cranston fits the role perfectly with a new look since the only other role I have seen him and so often is his egotistic manipulative Mr. Hiesenberg. The Hollywood script reading exercise could have been a little toned down, CIA hierarchy and method of general operations felt too generic. In some parts, the urgency and dramatization felt a little forced to elevate the thriller element. Ben Affleck thankfully was superb with no special histrionics and brings a sense of calm which was so required. The actors who play the diplomats were well chosen and bring in their best at the right moments. Last but not the least is the high attention to detail in regards to the gadgets, clothing, sets and location of the period bringing in a highly authentic feel to it. People playing the Iranian guard were also very intense and believable.<br/><br/>Darkly funny, toned down performances and attention to detail makes this a winner."
"advaitkamat","7","0","1","10 January 2013"," A leading contender for the top prize?
","""Argo"", Ben Affleck's directorial follow-up to ""The Town"", is one hell of a thriller. Based on a true story of the CIA mission to rescue six American hostages in the 1979 Iran crisis, Affleck gets just about everything right, wangling fantastic performances from his cast and building the tense atmosphere that a thriller like this demands.<br/><br/>In 1979, the Iran revolutionaries take over the American embassy in Tehran in retaliation for America sheltering the Shah in exile. The whole staff of the embassy is taken hostage but six members escape and hide in the house of the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber). with the situation of the members who escaped being kept away from the prying eyes of the revolutionaries, the CIA starts to make plans for bringing them home. Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), a CIA specialist, is brought in to try and find an alternative. He makes a ridiculous plan : to help them escape from Iran in guise of a film crew. In preparation for that, he sets up a fake studio in Hollywood with the help of John Chambers (John Goodman), a make-up artist and Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), a Hollywood producer and gets the press to sell this story. Will he be able to help the escapees get out of the country by making his plan work?<br/><br/>I won't go any further because the rest of ""Argo"" is a thing to be relished. Affleck, who has directed two films prior to ""Argo"", sinks his teeth into the wonderfully-written screenplay by Chris Terrio. He infuses wry humor into the tense setting and builds tension slowly, though the pace of the film won't give you the luxury of breathing. The opening sequence is choreographed supremely well, as is the climax which is bound to leave you breathless. But where Affleck really shines is how he handles the sequences, like the market sequence, which are shot in the open city with Iranian characters. He etches out his characters really well, adding subtle layers to them by showcasing their desperation with a few terse conversations. <br/><br/>Of the performances, the whole cast turn in convincing performances, but Arkin, who plays the only fictional role in the film of a pompous Hollywood producer Lester Siegel, shines above all others. He generates most of the laughs in the film along with Goodman, who is equally good in his role. <br/><br/>The only issue I have with this beauty of a film is that it runs contrary to my belief that if a film is based on a true story, it should not fictionalize any event. The film has quite a few moments which have originated from the mind of its writer Terrio, like the role of Siegel or the fact that the American embassy staff were turned away by a few diplomats. Though the reason for fictionalizing events for dramatic purposes is understandable, I believe one should not dab at a factual plot.<br/><br/>Although I was aware of this before I saw this film, I could not help but enjoy it thoroughly. ""Argo"" has given me the same sort of wonderfully unexpected thrill I had experienced while watching ""The French Connection"". Seldom have I watched a film that had me this hooked from the moment it began. I'm appalled by the fact that Affleck has not snagged a nomination for Best Director, though I expect this film to be a leading contender for the top prize."
"dfranzen70","9","0","3","6 January 2013"," Argo to Iran and all I got was this awesome movie
","A CIA operative enters Iran during the 1979-80 hostage crisis with the intention of bringing out six Americans who managed to escape the American embassy and are hiding in the Canadian embassy. He plans to do this by giving each a cover: together, they will represent a Canadian movie crew scouting Iran for filming locations for a Star Wars knockoff movie. The clincher? It all really happened.<br/><br/>At first, the students who took over the American embassy do not know that six of their captives are missing, which buys everyone some time. The CIA brainiacs try to figure out a way to extradite them to the US. Have them pose as teachers? There are no American teachers left in Iran - they'd be spotted. Have them escape via bicycle? It's winter, no one's riding a bike. How about as farmers? See above. There's snow in Iran. And then Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck, who also directed) gets the idea of getting the Americans out by way of Hollywood. <br/><br/>Tensions are extremely high. There is anti-American hatred in the streets of Tehran, and there's plenty of anti-Iranian sentiment in the U.S. as well. The students want to show the world that they mean business, but the U.S. doesn't negotiate with terrorists. Things don't look good, especially with the knowledge that inevitably someone will notice that six Americans are missing among the captured. Time is not on our side.<br/><br/>Since the premise of the six Americans' cover is that of a Canadian film crew, there needs to be a script. And a producer, and a director. Mendez contacts John Chambers (John Goodman), a veteran makeup/costume artist, who brings in at-the-end-of-his-career Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin). They find a script, called Argo, that involves an alien invasion. They option the rights and set up an office. It all must look legit; no chances can be taken.<br/><br/>Getting Mendez into Iran is not too difficult; it's getting his ""crew"" out that's the fly in the ointment. Meanwhile, the houseguests at the Canadian embassy are getting restless and paranoid. They can't go outside. The only other residents at the embassy are the ambassador and the housekeeper, who is Iranian. Something's gotta give, as they say.<br/><br/>This true story was declassified only in 1997 by President Clinton, and from what I have read, the story was left basically intact. Amazing. A single American enters a place in which Americans are essentially hated and departs with six more. That's some serious moxie. Them's some serious cojones for sure.<br/><br/>Affleck's quick-paced film is stunning and evocative; a compelling, artful piece of work. He's well cast as Mendez, an operative who generally looks like he's lost, utterly alone, in the world, hoping that this mission will save him from himself. We get just enough of Mendez's backstory to see him as a sympathetic man with a lot on the line.<br/><br/>It could be that 2012 winds up being one of the best years for movies in quite a long time, and as such it might be hard for Argo to dominate as it might in other years. But it should do very well come awards time. It's already been nominated for five Golden Globes, and I can believe Oscar nods for Arkin, Affleck (thrice), Terrio, and co-producers George Clooney and Grant Heslov. <br/><br/>Watching the movie can be a traumatic experience. History isn't always the best subject of Americans, so let me clue you in on this much: If Mendez had been unsuccessful, we wouldn't be watching a movie about the experience. Even those who were not alive in 1980 will be riveted, rooting for the Americans, cringing when obstacles arise, weeping when those obstacles are overcome. Chris Terrio's screenplay is powerful, but it's the interpretations given by Affleck, Goodman, Arkin, and Bryan Cranston (as Affleck's boss, and looking a LOT like George H. W. Bush) that really generate this film's strength. It's a genuinely astonishing movie, tightly edited, crisply written, and acted with true grit. Affleck himself turns in a particularly gutsy performance."

""Argo"" is too damn good -- and if Affleck continues to make films like it plus ""The Town"" he's one of the best directors working anywhere right now. Keep directing! Perhaps because I'm older now I appreciated this movie more than a younger person. I vividly remember the time and events covered in the film. And in many ways this is an old fashioned movie. It's about people and honor -- if you like things blowing up or cartoon characters, forget about it! This the kind of movie Hollywood used to make before they began to cater to 16-year-old boys or 14-year-old girls. This is NOT Batman or a Twilight movie. And in my opinion I wish there were more of them. PLUS the acting in this film is great. John Goodman and Alan Arkin play film legends -- and become legends themselves.

","All children of the 70s and earlier will recollect, to some degree, the alarming news story of the brutal attack and capture of the Iranian American Embassy towards the end of the decade, by the enraged victims of the despotic Shah whose illegitimate seizure of power the American Government had fully supported. The horrors faced by the American staff who were brutally held as hostages in an attempt to force the government to allow the hated exiled Shah, who America was protecting, to be brought to justice, were the stuff of one's worst nightmares, and almost impossible to fully imagine. It was a truly gripping saga that occupied the news both in and outside of America for months, but an even more twisted turn of events that received deliberately less coverage was that of six diplomats who managed to escape the hostile protesters and mercifully found refuge in the Canadian Embassy. As the Iranian political climate became even more violently anti-American, to the point of extremity, it seemed ever more impossible to extricate these six survivors, until skilled agent Tony Mendez brought an ingeniously unorthodox rescue plan to the table. He planned to have them fly back to America disguised as Canadian filmmakers on a location scout in the Orient for a B-Grade science fiction Hollywood production entitled Argo. <br/><br/>From a simultaneously oddball yet chilling declassified story from the archives of the American Central Intelligence Agency, rookie filmmakers Ben Affleck and Chris Terrio have managed to serve up a perfectly thrilling heist film with the added touch of many clever comedic scenes, and all on the solid foundation of arrestingly real political conflicts.<br/><br/>The opening scene of the terrifying riot outside the embassy is captivatingly intense, yet tragic, as those on and off the screen are both fearfully preparing for an unstoppable invasion by burning and shredding as many confidential documents as they can, but also anticipating it with a melancholic sense of inevitable, impending doom. Despite the drama, this opening retains a sense of documentary-style realism, strengthened by several intercut shots of a room full of world- weary Iranian citizens waiting for their liberating American Visas. The mundane tedium of their long exercise in patience grounds the scene in a historical integrity.<br/><br/>Few of the other major sequences are so committed realistic, but we don't need them to be. We enjoy the observant black comedy of the deliberations between imbecilic government officials who seem less capable of saving the diplomats' lives than their cleaning staff, and even more entertainingly, the astute dissection of the Hollywood sci- fi/fantasy production line. The CIA board's understanding of the country they are attempting to infiltrate is as shamelessly stereotypical as the movies that have been worked on by special effects designer John Chambers (John Goodman) and big-time director Lester Seigel (Alan Arkin), who use their Hollywood know-how to create an authentic fake movie. Watching these two acting veterans making Terrio's dialogue ring with such welcome comic relief is a delicious treat on top of the riveting humanist heist story.<br/><br/>Although the heightened intensity of their depicted ordeal carries some of the sadism of a squirmy thriller, where the character's pain becomes the audience's pleasure, we never forget that these events did actually take place thirty years ago, in more or less the same fashion. The characters that find themselves cornered by the horrific dangers of the streets outside, the Iranian government's rapid progress towards finding their hideout and the unbelievable craziness of Tony's scheme, are very relatable, fleshed-out and very true to life, as is their situation. A comparison against images from the film of these key figures, and the horrors of the environment they were trapped in, reveal just how meticulously they were recreated. As Robert Anders, Mark and Cora Lijek, Lee Schatz and Joseph and Cathleen Stafford, Tate Donovan, Christopher Denham, Clea Duvall, Rory Cochrane, Scoot McNairy and Kathy Stafford are modestly believable, and are even made to look very much like the actual six from the ""Canadian Caper."" Even Arkin and Goodman, who still wear their grand personalities over their naturalistic characterisations, bear an impressive resemblance to the real movie-making gurus behind the elaborate plan. However, the creative license taken in pursuit of chuckles and chills, most notably with the contrivances of the nail- biting climax, are effective, forgivable, and offset by the stark realism of scenes as such as those showing teams of thousands Iranians hurriedly piecing together the shredded documents and photographs from the embassy for political ammunition. <br/><br/>It isn't hardened psychopathic mercenaries who are racing towards the knowledge of the six escapees with their razor-sharp perception. Instead, it is the jigsaw puzzle skills of innocent children inside whom their parents have started to breed a simplistic hatred of Americans, and the support of a tyrannical movement to kill and oppress them all in the name of justice because they installed a tyrannical leader who killed and oppressed them. Even though the film rarely returns to these political issues after the very helpful prologue, the hypocrisy of both nations is interesting to contemplate."

John Goodman was really great as that guy who did all the make up for Planet Of The Apes.<br/><br/>Dialogue. Some of the best dialogue I've ever heard. It can be really dramatic but also has a little dark humour.<br/><br/>Great true story. You'd never believe this actually happened except for the fact that it did. It's a really clever story about saving some hostages from a country whilst trying to make sure they don't see you.<br/><br/>Direction by Ben Affleck. He's come a long way since Gigli and Pearl Harbour. This is his third movie and he has shown that he is one of the best directors of this generation. Three shots, three kills.<br/><br/>Great editing. It's not like a lot of true stories where they tell you it happened in the form of film. In this one, they try to make it sink in that this happened and also make you feel the period it's set. Real news reports and video footage were put in to make it look authentic and it does its job amazingly well.<br/><br/>Thrilling last act. I chewed my fingernails so much I doubt they'll grow again. This is a film that proves that you don't need a lot of violence to cause suspense or thrills. A truly ground-breaking film in an age where thrills rely heavily on intense violence and action.<br/><br/>The Bad: Only one nitpick I have is that Ben Affleck always seems to hold the same face throughout the film. But other than that, nothing bad.<br/><br/>Overall Verdict: 10/10: Instant Classic. When I look at this film overall, I feel like it has accomplished all the assets as to what makes a good true story thriller. Sticks to the facts, nail-biting thrills, brilliantly developed characters and great direction make Argo an Instant Classic."

","Intriged by its trailer several months earlier, I looked forward to seeing this film, and have since seen it four or five times and its effect has not worn off for me.<br/><br/>After shooting down bad ideas involving, among other things, having hostages ride bicycles 300 miles to the Turkish border, the CIA dreams up idea of shooting a bogus movie in Iran, and quietly smuggling out six hostages. <br/><br/>Scenes of the bogus Argo being ""produced"", its casting call, reading, newspaper ads being placed, are good, in a behind-the-scenes sort of way, we see how a real film would be put together. <br/><br/>Amazing film. I was hooked from minute one, its intentionally cheesy font, the grainy 1970s film stock make it look like this was really produced in 1979/ 1980. The filmmakers got a lot of suspense from the story. Great cast all around, and just enough intentional humour to break the tension when necessary, and give the audience a breather. I didn't want to chomp down on any more popcorn during the film, as in doing so, I might miss some of the dialogue."
"Red_Identity","Null","0","1","8 December 2012"," Incredibly tense
","Argo is easily one of the most entertaining films of the year. It's definitely not hard to be swept up by its incredible tension or its technical mastery, the editing and the fierce pace of it all. There are a few scenes that don't fit in with the tone as well, but it doesn't really do damage. Affleck has yet again proved he's an incredibly capable director, and he's a large reason as to why this works so well. It's also a film where you feel very emotionally invested in. By the end I realized just how effective it all was.<br/><br/>Now, the problem with such a perfect mainstream film like this (and it's definitely a film that all audiences can enjoy) is that, when looking at the structure of it all, it's not a particularly meaningful film. It's one of those films where the more you will think about it, the more you will see all of the strings and the successful formula that, although incredibly well done, is still rather one-note. But that's how films like this can be, and while this is a film where I don't see much afterthought, it still manages to be one of the best of 2012 and Affleck's best directed one."
"Plainjane45","10","0","2","8 December 2012"," Amazing film
","Such an interesting story, I was taken to this without knowing anything about it. I recommend you don't watch the trailer & try to avoid researching the story as best you can. Argo features fantastic performances across the board from star like Victor Garber, Bryan Cranston & John Goodman, who once again proved he shines in more then just comedy. <br/><br/>It focuses on the ""Canadian Caper"" which was the popular name given to the joint covert rescue by the Canadian Government and the Central Intelligence Agency of six American diplomats who evaded capture during the seizure of the United States embassy in Tehran, Iran, and taking of embassy personnel as hostages by Islamist students and militants on November 4, 1979.<br/><br/>I have previously not liked any of Afflecks acting work, but i thought he directed this brilliantly and his performance was excellent, his character was really likable & his performance was charismatic. <br/><br/>I give ""Argo"" a big fat 10. It's amazing!"

","Hollywood leftist propaganda in the beginning, where the narrative paints the Shaw as SO terrible (yes he wasn't good, but many living there at that time told me they MUCH preferred him to A$$ahollah, peace and prosperity versus violence and a collapsed economy) and goes on about the west as being ALL to blame for the situation. Never-mind the fact the west was the reason they had a developed economy in the first place. Nationalization of another companies investments is wrong. Period. The rest of the world no longer trusts you nor wants to ""play"" with you anymore! Then it goes on to say how good the revolution was; oh only except there was some ""score settling"" which was ""kinda bad""... Anyway after that bit at first it was pretty great action/suspense-filled and brought back high school memories and memories of conversations I had with many Iranian students here at university who were glad to be here in the US and decided they were never going back (to live under Sharia Law). Would have liked to have seen the Mickey Mouse ""Hey Iran"" T-shirts, on at least one of the High-School students in the brief ""news interview"" scene. :-)"
"octopusluke","9","0","1","6 December 2012"," Affleck directs this all-star cast to nigh-on perfection
","Whether you like it or loathe it, Argo is most certainly the zeitgeist movie of 2012. A year that has seen dramatic changes to the face of democracy in the middle east, it voluntarily speaks for the Western world with a typically Hollywood premise. A ""declassified true story"" from 1979, its the retelling secret mission between the CIA and the Canadian government to extract and save six American diplomats trapped in revolutionary Iran. It's the kind of yanky- doodle tale which would usually be wince-inducing. But, under Affleck's ""hands-dirty"" direction, this surprising blockbuster smash hit is intelligent, funny and unmissable. With no simple way of extraditing the captive Americans, the American government calls in Tony Mendez (Affleck) to come up with some audacious master plan. After some back and forth discussion with his CIA boss Jack (Bryan Cranston), Mendez comes up with ""the best bad idea"" possible – to pose as the head of a Canadian film studio, with the exiled Americans in- hiding as the film crew scouring across Iran for locations to shoot a Star Wars rip-off called ""Argo"". It's risky, but Mendez gives the alibi some clout by recruiting Hollywood make-up artist John Chambers (John Goodman) and movie producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) to put their name behind the fake-movie's marketing campaign. <br/><br/>A drop-out from a Middle Eastern Affairs course at University some twenty years back, it's no wonder that Affleck has some handle on the subject. What is quite remarkable is how he is able to use the real-life CIA case as the basis for the narrative, but never feel creatively bound by it. <br/><br/>Written with incisiveness by newcomer Chris Terrio, it's the first of Affleck's three films where he doesn't take a writing credit, leaving him to juggle acting and directing duties. Affleck maintains a retro aesthetic with great fluidity blending humour with breathtaking tension, whilst never letting the sizeable cast revert to parody. With Rodrigo Prieto's grimy cinematography and the use démodé jump-cuts – which could someday become Affleck's trademark – it's more pact than the ruminative Gone Baby Gone and protracted The Town, and definitely illustrates that the Bostonian is maturing as a filmmaker. <br/><br/>Even if it's his most tautly crafted, Affleck's appearance on-screen as leading man Ben Mendes is somewhat jarring. Throughout his patchy acting career, I've never considered him as leading man territory, much preferring his zany roles in Kevin Smith movies as an ensemble member. With such an astonishing supporting cast here, particularly Bryan Cranston as the paternal CIA agent, plus John Goodman and Alan Arkin as the joshing Hollywood duo, Affleck's acting ability is tested, and Mendez ends up feeling a little stoic and monotonous by the film's nail-biting end.<br/><br/>For the most part, Argo is a genre-spanning triumph. A melange of scathing political satire, Hollywood farce, broody drama and tense thriller. I could throw around comparisons to Clint Eastwood, Michael Mann, Sidney Lumet and Paul Greengrass but, to his credit, Affleck is playing in a league of his own. <br/><br/>www.366movies.com"
"seaview1","9","0","1","5 December 2012"," Truth Is Better Than Fiction in ARGO
","Ben Affleck has been a leading man with credibility behind the camera as the Oscar-winning co-writer (with Matt Damon) of Good Will Hunting. Having shown promise as a director in Gone Baby Gone and then excelling in The Town, he has peaked in his craft with Argo, a thoroughly engaging, real life thriller grounded in historic fact and abetted by a superior screenplay (Chris Terrio from a news article).<br/><br/>On November 4, 1979 in revolutionary Iran, angry students storm the US embassy and take civilian and military hostages, but unknown to the public, six Americans escape to a nearby Canadian's home where they remain stranded with no hope of rescue. Despite a myriad of standard tactics to spirit them out of Iran, every plan has a serious flaw, and each passing day heightens the probability of the Americans' discovery, capture, and possible execution as spies. Enter Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), an expert at ex-filtration or the liberating of valuable government assets for the CIA. His plan is a bold, imaginative conceit: a Hollywood movie crew scouting locations in Iran while sneaking the Americans out as part of the film crew. Despite the misgivings of highly skeptical State Department and CIA officials led by Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston), the mission is given a 'go' with little hope of success. Compounding things is the fact that the Iranians are painstakingly sifting through the embassy's hastily shredded documents. With the assistance of an Oscar winning makeup artist, John Chambers (John Goodman), and producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), Mendez creates an elaborate, fake science fiction movie named Argo complete with a script and cast. Will this movie cover work and can Mendez get the six Americans to freedom in time? As a true story only recently declassified by the US government, these actual events lead to a breathtaking finish.<br/><br/>The authentic reenactment of the embassy takeover is expertly, vividly intercut seamlessly with real news footage. Affleck has a keen eye for detail, and he convincingly captures the chaos and paranoia that grips the trapped Americans. Good use of hand-held camera-work adds to the authentic feel of this quasi-documentary narrative. It's like an episode of TV's Mission Impossible, and, in fact, this could easily have been a made-for-TV movie, but it works better on the big screen where it has maximum impact. There are more than passing similarities to Wag the Dog and its phony movie ruse. <br/><br/>The Anti-American sentiment and mistrust fosters a claustrophobic atmosphere as the six Americans are under great pressure. The film depicts the real threats and atrocities in the city streets including random executions. Not knowing who to trust, the Americans bicker amongst themselves with some expressing serious reservations about this unusual rescue premise while others are feeling despondent. Their fear is not unlike those of pursued Holocaust civilians in World War II. <br/><br/>Mendez, who risks his life to save these strangers, is also a father, and it is that relationship that frames his character in the film emotionally. Chambers and Siegel (a composite character) are patriots with big egos, and while their comic relief is welcome (including a running gag: an off-color play on the word Argo,) in an otherwise suspense-filled narrative, one wonders what truly motivates them? <br/><br/>The final airport sequence is unbearably tense as it ratchets up the threat, and such a relatively basic situation is executed to great effect. We know how the story will end yet it affects us in a visceral way. If the filmmakers take some dramatic license at the end, the film has earned the right to embellish the facts a bit further. After seeing their story, to see the images of the actors and their real life counterparts in the closing credits adds poignancy and credibility.<br/><br/>One can only hope that Affleck can excel to loftier heights with his next project. He is already in rarified air, and an Oscar nomination awaits. In Argo, he has fashioned a nail-biter that never ignores the humanity that binds us together, whether it be father and son, husband and wife, or a rescuer and his newly found friends."

My heart rate was skyrocketing throughout the whole movie and you feel as a viewer that you are taking part in this adventure. I recommend this to everyone. This is a must-see!

Well, all of that is thanks to brilliantly written scenery that keeps you on the edge of the seat for a whole 2 hours and delivers you one hell of the ride. Acting is a pinch above average and it's almost unnoticeable, because everybody on set after couple of minutes simple get swallowed by the tide of rushing and fast pacing story directed by life.

"Tcarts76","9","0","1","24 November 2012"," Ben Affleck, a job well done!
","""Argo,"" is based on a true story of the CIA's scramble to rescue a group of 6 staff members who escaped the 1979 Iranian takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Iran.<br/><br/>The Good: This is a well crafted thriller. The mood of tension throughout is wonderful and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The acting was top notch, and even Ben Affleck himself turns in a wonderful performance. The scenes inside Iran were done well and really shows the chaos, brutality, and anti-Americanism of the time period following the Islamic Revolution. The lead-in was sound as it really doesn't sugar coat the British and American involvement that led to the revolution.<br/><br/>The Bad: The only bad thing I can say about this movie was on a stylistic note on one aspect. In the scenes of building the cover story they tried to use the music of the time period in a style kind of like other movies such as ""Casino,"" and ""Oceans 11."" That part kind of fell flat for me and seemed really out of place from the rest of the movie and that's the only point deduction for me.<br/><br/>I've read a lot of other reviews where they take a few shots at historical accuracy, but let's face it, Hollywood always takes some liberties to pump up the entertainment value, and if you want complete and total accuracy watch a documentary instead. Others have to say they portrayed the Iranians as a hysterical mob and didn't play up the U.S. involvement that really led to the Revolution, but those people must have missed the first 5 minutes of the movie, as that was all explained. And might I add that although the U.S. may have gave asylum to the Shah ( a guilty man) that gave no right for the Iranians to hold innocent Embassy staff members as hostages.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 9 out of 10. I don't know if it is Oscar worthy, but it may be worthy of a nomination. The mood of tension was great, it was well crafted, and wonderfully acted. Really a good movie and Ben Affleck deserves a big pat on the back as the Director, and the lead role. Definitely a job well done."

","""Argo"" is certainly a top-quality movie where everything works, plot, atmosphere, up to Affleck's impeccable direction. The flick's superlative, based on a true story that nails some specific details — right down to every smoking ashtray — making the era come alive. The tension is carefully built by Affleck, who perfectly moderates the tension with some marvelous dialogs, much of it uttered by Arkin and Goodman to great comic effect. Ben Affleck as well is wonderfully subdued as the agent who has so many lives in his hands. This is an intelligent movie, not only entertaining but also providing a glimpse into an important moment of world history. The end credits wrap it up perfectly as one of the finest stories that 2012 has to offer."
"rubenm","7","0","1","10 November 2012"," Truth is stranger than fiction
","Americans are usually very good at making films about their own historic events. Just a few examples that come to mind are 'Frost/Nixon', 'Milk', 'J. Edgar', 'A Mighty Heart' and 'The Social Network'. 'Argo' is no exception. It's a well-crafted, solid movie about a bizarre event that took place during the hostage drama at the US Embassy in Tehran. In a clear case of truth being stranger than fiction, the CIA smuggled six US Citizens out of Iran, disguising them as members of a Canadian film crew making the sci-fi movie Argo. <br/><br/>Director Ben Affleck used this event to make a suspenseful thriller. He knows how to make a story exciting: by showing parallel developments that put the audience on the edge of their chairs. While the CIA is working on the escape route, the Iranian intelligence is assembling photo's of the six by puzzling together pieces of shredded paper. Who will be the first to succeed? Although the audience knows how the story ends, the suspense is being built up through the entire movie. <br/><br/>Immediately after I left the cinema, I planned to find out how much of what I had seen has really happened. As it turns out: quite a lot of it is made up. Just read CIA-agent Tony Mendez's own account of the operation on the website of the CIA. (His report is titled 'A Classic Case of Deception'). He describes how the operation went 'as smooth as silk'. There was no problem whatsoever getting the six out of the country. Let alone revolutionary guards driving armored cars on the runway to stop the plane, as is shown in the movie. <br/><br/>But of course, a feature film is not a documentary. It's okay to spice up the historic facts in order to make a better movie. Argo is very well-made, with a genuine period feel and a clever script. The only thing that bothered me a bit was the too-good-to-be-true last-minute escape against all odds. The film would have been more realistic if it wouldn't have emphasized the breath-taking thriller elements so much."
"KineticSeoul","7","0","1","3 November 2012"," 3rd time is still the charm for Affleck
","I am still not sure of Ben Affleck as a actor but the guy can certainly direct movies. And third time is still the charm for this actor/director. So Argo is basically a crazy true story about Americans working at a U.S. embassy getting taken hostage by in Iran. But six of them escape and is left of them escape and stay at a home of a Canadian ambassador. That is when the CIA come in to try and free the six hostages and bring them back home. The best bad idea comes in from Tony Mendez(Ben Affleck) to make a fake movie and act like a film crew to bring the hostages back home. While working under the supervision of Jack O'Donnell(Bryan Cranston). What I liked about this movie is how it didn't try to intentionally convolute the story while still showing it in a intelligent manner. Personally I think the movie as a whole could have been directed a bit better but Affleck still did a good job. Especially with the editing and witty dialogues. There is also quite a bit of tension in this movie and although you don't really know much about the six hostages I just couldn't help but root for the mission to get accomplished. Definitely looking forward to Affleck's next project.<br/><br/>7.9/10"
"dutchs-1","8","0","1","3 November 2012"," Tense, fast moving, exciting, historically flawed.
","This is a fine film but I give it only eight stars because of its unnecessary denigration of the roles of some of our most loyal allies. With George Clooney as a producer, it's not surprising to get some of his trademark moralizing about the Middle East, although any sympathy I might have felt for Mohammed Mossadegh and the victims of SAVAK rapidly evaporated upon being reminded afresh just what the Iranian Revolution was really like. I didn't expect so much humor, but the dialogue in Hollywood as Tony Mendez tries to set up his bogus film company is often hilarious. The tension during the escape is heightened for effect: in reality there was no visit to the bazaar, no problem with tickets and no attempt to stop the flight. In the film, one of the six diplomats is an annoying, fearful twerp who becomes a hero when he talks the group through their final checkpoint. Most serious is the slander of the British and New Zealanders, who actually were helpful. The British even housed the six for a while but had them move because their location was unsafe. The Canadians were actually principally responsible for the escape and worked closely with Mendez on the cover story and furnishing documents. I can't see a single cinematic reason for those errors."
"nickmesafilms","10","0","2","2 November 2012"," Argo (2012) - Ben Affleck, I Salute You!
","Based on the declassified true story, ""Argo"" tells the true tale of one of the most unbelievable escape plans ever assembled, during the Iran Hostage Crisis, lasting from 1979-81. While 52 members of the U.S. Embassy were taken as hostages by the citizens of Iran, 6 of the hostages were able to escape, and are now in hiding at the home of the Canadian ambassador. But they have to get out of Iran quickly, before the people of Iran go door to door, find the six hostages, and kill them. So, the members of the CIA try to think of an escape plan to get them out of Iran. But that's when CIA specialist Tony Mendez, played by actor-director Ben Affleck, comes up with an idea so crazy, that it just might work. He suddenly thinks up of a scheme where they pretend that they're making a ""fake"" movie, a sci-fi film called ""Argo"". They pretend that these 6 hostages are members of their film crew, and they will just fly them out of Iran, as if they were scouting the locations. But it's one of those ideas that are so bad, that it just might work. This is such an entertaining premise for a film that talks about an event way too impossible to believe, but people need to understand that it actually happened. Now, we are given one of the most thrilling films of the year, all thanks to the incredible directing talent of Ben Affleck. After becoming a household name in the directing department in films such as ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""The Town"", Ben Affleck has finally made a triple home-run with his newest masterpiece, ""Argo"". He is probably becoming one of the best directors working in Hollywood, as we speak. Ben Affleck really cares about the movie he plans to make, and he is absolutely passionate on knowing how a film should look or feel. You can tell that every time Ben Affleck directs a film, he always remembers to treat it with care. But most of all, he has this incredible ability to tell a great story, that keeps audiences engaged in the story, without being either bored or losing attention for the entire running time, without any guns being shot or fired. Thanks to his amazing ability to direct, his acting has incredibly improved because of it. Although Affleck delivers one of his strongest performances, there are still plenty of members in the cast that really deliver the goods, with possible hopes that they'll walk away with Oscar nominations. John Goodman is terrific playing the true John Chambers, a make-up artist who has been known for his work in the ""Planet of the Apes"" films. Bryan Cranston of ""Breaking Bad"" fame delivers one of his finest performances as Jack O'Donnell, supervisor of Tony Mendez. But, it's the one and only Alan Arkin who deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as the hired ""producer"" for the fake movie, while treating it like a real picture. The rest of the talented supporting cast includes Kyle Chandler, Victor Garber, and Tate Donovan. As I mentioned before, Ben Affleck is a great story-teller, providing his own special method to keep the audience invested in the story and it's characters. This film travels back and forth with three separate story lines that both inter-twine with each other. There's one storyline about the 6 hostages in Iran, the other taking place in Hollywood with comic relief from Goodman and Arkin, and the other showing the situations being handled in the CIA. Mixed with real-life archival footage, and the professional actors that help re-enact the story, ""Argo"" is like one piece of interesting history. In the first two acts of the film, Affleck starts the film with an interesting tone, while still being entertained. But it's until the third act of the film, where Affleck decides to kick the suspense up a notch. I was literally on the edge of my seat, biting my nails, with my legs shaking. ""Argo"" is just one of those films that knows how to impress audiences by keeping the suspense flowing and the drama leaving you affected. Accompanied with smart and realistic writing, incredible performances, and top-notch directing, ""Argo"" definitely deserves the Oscar buzz. I just hope that this movie will definitely have a shot for being nominated for both Best Picture and Best Director for Ben Affleck. If it does not get any recognition, this awards' season, bad things will happen. ""Argo"" is one of the smartest, interesting, affective, entertaining, suspenseful, and realistic films I've ever seen. ""Argo"" is one of the best movies of the year. ""Argo"", in my review, ""Top-notch storytelling, beautifully directed, acted""."

","After long last I can describe what has been a near-perfect movie viewing experience watching the masterfully directed Argo. Oh! What a relief.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, Argo has a rather ordinary plot line for a movie. Even if I shared it with you, you'll probably say..are you sure this'll be worth a watch? I mean, it sounds rather like a documentary considering the situation it is set inand I couldn't blame you. But wait till you enter the theatres and the siege begins. You'll feel like you are in it, part of the mayhem..maybe even one of the six..ah, but I get ahead of myself.<br/><br/>Despite having a pretty good hunch on how it'll turn out well ahead, you still can't be too surethat's the kind of underlying tension Argo creates. Most scenes are close up shots and camera-work as well as editing is superlative. The movie may tend to slow down but its just the right pacing for the narrative to be told and once it picks up you'll probably feel the adrenalin rush. There are practically no explosions or death defying action stunts, yet the movie sends your pulse racing and a plane taking off may never have mattered more Despite not looking it, Argo is a sure thrill ride. This is achieved through brilliant direction, excellent use of background sounds, great camera-work and slick editing – there's little one can complain about. The performances are great as well especially from Affleck and Bryan Cranston (from Breaking Bad fame). John Goodman and Alan Arkin provide the satirical humour and most of their lines will make you chuckle Oh! and be sure to stay back for the credits where you can witness the level of detailing and research that was put in to make this movie what it is or you'll really miss something On a side note, What does Argo mean? Well I am tempted to respond to that but then I'd probably have to use an expletive in this post (something, I try and avoid as a rule)so go 'find out for yourself'<br/><br/>To read my reviews on other movies check out my blog at http://www.anitalks.blogspot.com"
"DJRMewzique","9","0","1","30 October 2012"," Astonighingly good work from Affleck. Yes...Ben Affleck.
","For anyone who doesn't believe in second comings, one just has to turn to....Ben Affleck? Yes. Ben Affleck.<br/><br/>After making a huge name for himself in the late 90s and early 00s as an actor and heartthrob, winning an Oscar (yes, everyone, remember, Affleck already has an Oscar for co-writing ""Good Will Hunting"" with Matt Damon) and being half of Bennifer, ""Gigli"" happened and Affleck from being the most over-exposed man in the world to all but disappearing for a few years.<br/><br/>And then, he rose from the ashes, first proving himself as someone who could actually act in ""Hollywoodland"" before making his completely-out-of-left-field mark as a promising director with ""Gone Baby Gone"" (which he also wrote). And then, for those who thought it was potentially beginners luck, he went on to write and direct the highly-acclaimed ""The Town,"" which many thought would lead him to bask in some more Oscar nominations. Ultimately, the film got nothing but an acting nomination for Jeremy Renner, but the seed was planted.<br/><br/>Now, Affleck returns once again to the director's chair and the lead-actor's position with ""Argo,"" the completely ridiculous-but-true story of how a fake film thought to be in production by a fake Canadian production team helped extricate six American hostages from Iran during the Iran Hostage Crisis in 1979. Based on the true story of CIA operative Tony Mendez, declassified in 1997 by Bill Clinton, the storyline of this movie would be considered completely idiotic if it weren't based on true events.<br/><br/>Affleck, as Mendez, takes on the role, and 70s chic, with an incredibly impressive voracity. As a man doing exactly what he specializes in trying to pull off what most thought was a suicide mission, Affleck shows a great strength in his depiction of vulnerability. But with such an outstanding cast around him, and this film truly is a group effort, including excellent performances from everyone from Victor Garber, Alan Arkin, John Goodman, the delicious Tate Donovan and a possible Oscar-nomination for the impeccable Bryan Cranston (can this man do no wrong?), ""Argo"" may very well put Affleck in the spotlight for yet another couple of nominations himself, including Best Director.<br/><br/>A film based on true events can be a tough sell for a thriller, when many know the ultimate outcome walking into the cinema, thus making tension difficult to achieve. However, this film is so impeccably edited and paced, despite knowing exactly what happened, the levels of stress were still fully formulated that you find yourself on the edge of your seat, just waiting for the moment you can let it all go, as a tear runs down your face.<br/><br/>I salute Mr. Affleck. Not only has the man gone from Oscar winner to action superstar to tabloid fodder to punch line to, now, distinguished director, he has carried himself with grace and charisma and has shown that underneath the silliness of his early days, there was a real cinematic talent there that just needed the right time, the right push and the right story. He found that in ""Gone Baby Gone"" And because of that, we got....""Argo."" And yeah, the dude is still smoking hot."

You know mostly what the TV news (in the movie) are telling you. You just don't know how much they know. You are lost in the middle of a hunt game. For every action that brings the Americans in hiding closer to escape, the Iranians get one step closer to finding their trail. All the actions are difficult and time consuming so the illusion of time passing adds more to the frustration of all characters (and we as spectators). Affleck manages to keep this conduct during the entire conflict, bringing always a subtle piece of information to the wrong hands and getting the characters to the line, about to behave out of desperation and pressure giving us a constant sense of being in front of a ticking bomb with no clock on it. Argo manages to keep this line of storytelling and thrilling emotions right 'till the absolute end of the movie when you're barely breathing out of claustrophobia. A film with a great visual tone, amazing script and wonderful casting. Shoot as if it was done in the 70s and it feels like if you were there in the conflict. <br/><br/>I only have one wish today... Ben, when are you doing the next one?"
"RMS1949","9","0","1","27 October 2012"," Excellent Movie
","As someone who followed the events of the Iran hostage crisis on a daily basis, this movie brought back all the emotions I felt back then. The tension, anger, frustration and the eventually emotional relief were all presented right there on the screen. Ben Affleck did a fantastic job with the direction and all the actors gave excellent portrayals. With a special nod to both Ben and Bryan Cranston for their roles.<br/><br/>While I know some dramatic artistic license was taken on exactly how some scenarios played out, the essence of that event was kept together in a gritty suspenseful cinema experience. <br/><br/>It's a movie I will definitely buy on DVD."

","Ben Affleck takes on the suspense thriller, not one of the easiest genres to deliver on, and scores. This isn't Hitchcock, mind you, but parts of it reminded me of The Year of Living Dangerously. Based on the true story of the extraction of 6 American embassy workers during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis, Affleck winds the mainspring with a masterful hand, ratcheting the tension up with nary a misstep, folding in historical footage in a way that enhances the production, as though it's all of one piece. The production is straightforward, avoiding such things as noir or atmospherics, electing to let the storyline carry the picture. Affleck also avoids the trap of melodrama, allowing the story to unfold at its own pace, producing its own, genuine drama and suspense."
"bigcalkenobi","9","0","1","17 October 2012"," Argo is a rare movie that caters to a more adult audience because of its sophistication, tone, and intense story it's trying to tell
","Ben Affleck may be a bit polarizing when it comes to his acting career, but his directing career up to this point has been excellent with two very outstanding films The Town and Gone Baby Gone both receiving numerous awards and critical acclaim as well as moderate box office success. His latest film Argo attempts to give his directing career more genre diversity as it is a historical thriller that covers the recently declassified events that took place during Iranian Hostage Crisis that begins in 1979. Can Affleck successfully take on this historical event and do it justice or should he stick to more personal character dramas?<br/><br/>Read the full review: wp.me/p1tyJd-j3"
"kinseydude","8","0","1","15 October 2012"," suspenseful but self-congratulatory and smug
","I didn't know Ben Affleck had it in him, and I thoroughly enjoyed this film--with a few reservations, of course.<br/><br/>Ben as a government operative, John Goodman as a 70s B-movie director, and Alan Arkin as an aging producer in the same tarnished golden age of movies, engineer a fake movie as a cover-story for getting six Americans out of Tehran in the middle of the 1979-1980 Islamic Revolution and hostage crisis. The film has some great laughs at Hollywood's expense, and maintains a successful, suspenseful storyline as Affleck tries to outsmart trigger-happy revolutionaries and get six reluctant, terrified bureaucrats to safety. It's down to the wire as the entire sequence of the disguised Americans getting through Tehran airport security has you biting your nails: you know they get out alive anyway, but you feel the tension of their escape, and as much as we hate airport security, our hearts were beating as fast and anxiously as were those of the escapees. A true-to-life story that stayed classified for 17 years emerges as an entertaining, politically sensitive drama, and I bet a lot of viewers were like me, doubting that Affleck had it in him, but engaged, all the same.<br/><br/>My hesitations involved some of the politics of this film and the way the Americans frame themselves as the undeserved good-guys, and follow a narrower, less ambiguous story, amid the much more complicated Islamic Revolution under way around it. The film's brief, voice-over narration at the beginning gives the history lesson of the original Shahs, the democratic secularist whom the people elected, and the ruler (Khomeni's predecessor) whom America and Britain installed in the democratic ruler's place. But no one so much as wrung their hands over the course of the rest of the film over America's helping to create the strife in Iran in the first place, when all eyes were focused on getting six Americans to safety instead. One is glad they're eventually free, and one can see Affleck's character as a hero this way, but I thought it was much too easy to congratulate ourselves for freeing six innocents, when our nation's hands are dirty in bringing suffering, oppression, and death to thousands. A more complicated, more ambiguous movie could have explored American involvement from a greater array of angles, but I think the resulting film would have been less self-congratulatory and smug about the ways American interests have backfired overseas."
