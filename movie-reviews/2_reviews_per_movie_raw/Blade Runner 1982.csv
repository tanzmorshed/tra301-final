"gogoschka-1","Null","162","200","11 February 2018"," A Milestone Of Science Fiction And A Cyberpunk Masterpiece
","A feast for the eyes. Dark and uncompromising. With a haunting musical score by Vangelis that adds a hypnotic quality to those breathtaking megacity landscapes of future Los Angeles. Ridley Scott's adaptation of Philip K. Dick's post-apocalyptic bounty hunter story 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep' is a visionary work of art; it's a dystopian masterpiece and I'd personally call it as much a milestone of science fiction as Kubrick's '2001' (and be advised to watch the version known as the ""final cut"" if you want to catch 'Blade Runner' as it was intended by its director). <br/><br/>It's hard to overstate how influential the film was; it invented the sci-fi subgenre now known as ""cyberpunk"", and it was also the first ""film noir"" in a sci-fi setting. And although it looks so distractingly gorgeous that even today there are people who still dismiss it as superficial and mere ""eye candy"", it is a philosphically deep film that ponders existential questions about the nature of being human. Its slow, brooding quality will perhaps leave some modern audiences who are used to a different pace and more action underwhelmed - but make no mistake: this is a groundbreaking masterwork of its genre and a timeles classic. 10 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/"
"Flagrant-Baronessa","10","493","650","25 July 2006"," A glorious, timeless nightmare
","Dark, deep, uncertain, unsettling  imagine the most beautiful nightmare you've ever had  this is Blade Runner (1982).<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is a brilliantly crafted science fiction film that not only touches upon, but bravely plunges into deep philosophical questions, making it simply ten times more important than any film of its genre. I love it not only for the initial feeling it gives, but because of its perseverance  none of the visuals, themes or technology feel dated but as deep, gripping and current as ever. It is timeless beauty with huge doses of emotion.<br/><br/>Set in 2019 Los Angeles, Blade Runner zooms in on the eerily-lit, urban streets of the city and follows Richard Deckard  superbly played by Harrison Ford who brings an exquisite moral ambiguity to his character  a special policeman who tracks down and terminates artificially-created humans called replicants, who have escaped from an Off-World colony and made their way to earth and need to be stopped. The things Deckard encounters on his detective journey raise many philosophical questions like: Who is really a replicant? Are replicants really bad? If replicants are bad, when why did we go to such lengths with our technology to create them? Are replicants really humans? Is Deckard a hero? This truly is a film that demands subsequent discussion and its ambiguous ending leave a haunting and eerie feeling.<br/><br/>In spite of a rich glaze of science fiction and futurism coating this adventure, there are distinct film noir elements present  primarily in the bluish haze that the film is seen through and its gritty urban atmosphere. Whoever thought of this combination is a genius. Since it is all about technology, it fits then that Blade Runner features a ridiculous amount of product placement, especially from Atari. In any other film, this would have felt out-of-place but here it is simply perfect. The score by Vangelis is strangely gripping when combined with the striking cinematography of the film.<br/><br/>Blade Runner deserves credit, celebration and remembrance for it is simply an excellent film. <br/><br/>10 out of 10 (and I don't just throw this grade out like SOME people)"
"Ivan-28","9","348","456","5 August 1999"," Still outshines the others 17 years later
","Blade Runner belongs on a list of 2 or 3 movies that had me walking out of the theater in a stupor as though hit by a sledgehammer, the first time I saw it. It fulfills one of my requirements of great films in that I walked out of the theater a different person than when I entered. And it fulfilled another requirement in that it improved with repeated viewings.<br/><br/>There is so much to take in visually, intellectually, and emotionally that my mind was overwhelmed at the first viewing trying to sort it all out. Unlike the so-called ""entertainment"" we get today at the movies, this film didn't spoonfeed its meaning to you. It left the ending ambiguous so your imagination has to supply it.<br/><br/>The film demands discussion. There are so many topics to debate. Is Deckard a replicant? Do Deckard and Rachel live happily ever after? Why is there a unicorn in the director's cut? Is Deckard a hero? Or are the replicants really the good guys? Every time I watch it, my answers change.<br/><br/>I may be one of the few that really likes the original. Probably because I've seen that version a couple dozen times since 1982 before the director's cut came out. This may contradict what I said earlier about being spoonfed, but I liked the narration because it explained what was going on in Deckard's mind. And I didn't mind the ""happy ending"" because it still implied that their troubles may not be over. ""I don't know how long we had together. Who does?"" But with that version memorized, I now appreciate the directors cut. It probably has the better ending. (At least I think so until I view it again!)<br/><br/>It's also fun watching actors before they became more famous later like Sean Young, Daryl Hannah, M. Emmet Walsh, William Sanderson, and Edward James Olmos. I think they all did a great job. And Vangelis did a beautiful, moving score.<br/><br/>After ""Blade Runner"", most of the big blockbuster science fiction movies boil down to good guys vs. bad guys with lots of loud explosions and in-your-face effects. Very simplistic messages, if any. That's why I still contend that an ""oldie"" like Blade Runner still outshines them all. It has incredible special effects, but never at the expense of the story. The cityscapes do more than dazzle you, they involve you.<br/><br/>The more I think of it, the more I realize that ""Blade Runner"" is not only my favorite science fiction movie, but one of my favorite films in any genre. I wish Ridley Scott would return to science fiction, but then again today's Hollywood would never release a movie like ""Blade Runner."""
"joelhoff","10","803","1075","5 March 2002"," A compelling, thematically-deep SF film
","This is truly one of the greatest science fiction films ever made, one that requires a thinking viewer in order to understand and appreciate it.  The director's cut is the recommended one to see as it omits a somewhat distracting narration and avoids an unnecessary Hollywood-style ending that is at odds with the rest of the film's tone.<br/><br/>A true science fiction story or film is about ideas, not spaceship battles, futuristic gadgets, or weird creatures.  ""Blade Runner"" fully qualifies as this in its examination of the impact of technology on human society, existence, and the very nature of humanity itself.  These themes are set in a fairly basic detective story that moves slowly but gradually builds power as the viewer is immersed in a dystopian futuristic Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford fans accustomed to the normally dynamic roles that he plays may be dissatisfied with the seemingly lifeless lead character that he portrays here as the replicant-hunting detective known as a ""blade runner"". They should be, for this dissatisfaction is part of the film experience, part of the dehumanized existence in the story's setting.  However, as the story unfolds, we see Ford's character, Rick Deckard, slowly come alive again and recover some humanity while pursing four escaped replicants.<br/><br/>The replicants, genetically-engineered human cyborgs, that Deckard must hunt down and kill are in many ways more alive than Deckard himself initially. Their escape from an off-world colony has an explicit self-directed purpose, whereas Deckard's life appears to have none other than his job, one that he has tried to give up.  By some standards, Deckard and the replicants have thin character development.  However, this is a deeply thematic and philosophical film, and as such the characters are the tools of the story's themes.  Each character reflects some aspect of humanity or human existence, but they lack others, for each is broken in ways that reflect the broken society in which they live and were conceived/created.<br/><br/>There are several dramatic moments involving life-and-death struggles, but most of these are more subdued than in a normal detective story plot.  The film's power is chiefly derived through its stunning visual imagery of a dark futuristic cityscape and its philosophical themes.<br/><br/>Among the themes explored are the following: - The dehumanization of people through a society shaped by technological and capitalistic excess. - The roles of creator and creation, their mutual enslavement, and their role reversal, i.e., the creation's triumph over its creator. - The nature of humanity itself: emotions, memory, purpose, desire, cruelty, technological mastery of environment and universe, mortality, death, and more. - Personal identity and self-awareness. - The meaning of existence.<br/><br/>If you are not someone who naturally enjoys contemplating such themes, the film's brilliance may be lost on you.  The climax involves a soliloquy that brings many of the themes together in a simple yet wonderfully poetic way. Anyone who ""gets"" the film should be moved by this; others will sadly miss the point and may prefer watching some mindless action flick instead.<br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" is a masterpiece that deserves recognition and long remembrance in film history."
"jfitch7","Null","391","526","6 March 2001"," Intriguingly Philosophical
","Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott and based on Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, is a Sci-fi slash Noir film about a cop named Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) in a decrepit 2019 Los Angeles whose job it is to ""retire"" four genetically engineered syborgues, known as ""Replicants"".  The four fugitives, Pris (Daryl Hannah), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Leon (Brion James), and their leader, Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), have escaped from an off-world colony in order to find their creator and bully him into expanding their pre-determined four year life span.  This film originally flopped when it came out in 1982, but since has become a widely acclaimed cult classic with a director's cut to boot.  A large part of the success that this movie has received can be attributed to its ability to operate on many different levels.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's hauntingly possible depiction of what might become of Los Angeles down the line is absolutely brilliant.  It captures elements of Noir with its urban atmosphere of decadence, lighting, and characters neither clearly defined as good nor evil.  Corruption is everywhere.  The garbage-littered streets and permanence of dark and rain give us the sense that we've seriously screwed up the atmosphere, and the impression that all respectable human beings have fled to the off-world colonies, leaving only the scum of the earth behind.<br/><br/>There is a hint of style from the 40's, especially with respect to cars, costumes, and music.  Rachael's entire outfit, including her hair, screams the 40's.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, arranged by Vangelis (who won an Oscar for his Chariots of Fire score), consisted mainly of Jazz and Blues.  This functioned to represent a dark, moody world of uncertainty and pessimism.<br/><br/>The special effects were exceptional.  Much of the set was pulled off using models.  In my opinion, sets made by hand require leagues more of skill and are much more impressive and realistic than those computer generated.  These guys really knew what they were doing.  I was especially fond of the pyramidesque Tyrell Corporation building, which hinted at the god-like presence of Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkell), the creator.<br/><br/>The script (Hampton Fancher, David Peoples, and of course Phil Dick) worked for me, as well as the actors who gave voice to it.  Harrison Ford was well...Harrison Ford.  I thought he did a tremendous job down-playing the role.  His voice-over narration helped you along, and was yet another feature conducive to Film Noir (apparently this was taken out of the Director's Cut).  Rutger Hauer's performance was intense.  His lines at the end were intriguingly philosophical.  Daryl Hannah's chilling robotic expressions were quite impressive.  Joanna Cassidy was just plain hot.<br/><br/>There is more to this film than just pulp.  It works on so many remarkable levels.  The movie itself is a detective noir quest for the meaning of life in a science fiction environment, but the story is a commentary on what it means to be human and the questions each one of us have about life, like: How long have I to live?  Why do I have to die?  What happens when I die? Doesn't my maker care?  Is this all merely an illusion?  At the end of the film we are left to wonder if these Replicants are human, and if Deckard himself is in fact a Replicant.  Scott raises more questions here than he answers, and as a result, critics are still debating the mysteries of this film today.  In a sense, the ambiguity of Blade Runner is the culprit of its success."
"Videot-3","Null","246","353","7 December 1998"," A futuristic allegory about the value of life
","OK, I admit...the first time I watched this movie I detested it. But hey, I was 16 years old and had expected an action-packed sci-fi adventure. Blade Runner is not such a film. But I am grateful for this, for after maturing a bit and rewatching the movie a couple of times, I discovered its greatness. It is not a traditional sci-fi movie, it's a touching drama about the value of life and the importance of making the most of what you've got. One of the most important themes in the film is the question of what is more valuable - humans without emotions, or machines with? The film gives no answer - it just opens our eyes and makes us aware that we should be grateful for being alive.<br/><br/>Some people prefer the Director's Cut, but I like the original version better - mostly because of the wonderful end line: ""I didn't know how long we had together. Who does?"" That pretty much sums it up."
"marntfield","9","327","474","14 July 2005"," Timeless
","What can be said about this film that hasn't already been covered in preceding decennia? Blade Runner (either version) stands the test of time as an epic story which transcends a disparity of genres, as well as the seminal ""dark"" sci-fi film which has been mimicked so frequently (to varying degrees of success) since its original release. The interplay of film noir, sci-fi, and what is one of the most philosophically symbolic and academically analyzed narratives of the modern era holds its ground on both visual and cerebral levels even in the face of today's CGI laden blockbusters. The new director's cut, contrary to many cinematic re-hashings, actually serves to clarify many of the more nebulous aspects of the plot and makes a great film even better, arguably allowing it to be modernized and polished for a new generation of viewers who are more picky and yet simultaneously less idealistic. All while sustaining the feeling and flavor of the original. Call it restorative work if you will. The tinny and meandering score by Vangelis is pure 1980s at its most brooding and fits the texture and mood of the film beautifully. Indeed, for many reasons, finding this film in someone's DVD collection makes a true statement about their discriminating and refined taste in movies, and equally their appreciation of film as an artistic medium. I would suggest picking up a reader by someone like Nietzsche, Foucualt, Descartes, Kierkegaard, or any of the great existentialist philosophers after viewing this film in order to appreciate the story & its concepts at a whole new level, regardless if you're watching it for either the 1st, or the 100th time. An enduring classic and an intrepid piece of film-making with rich & often haunting visuals designed to entertain and promote introspection amongst its viewers. 9/10."
"ArmandoManuelPereira","8","7","7","12 April 2020"," The Final Cut Is Ultimately Superior.
","When I first watched the Final Cut, I felt that it diminished the entertainment value of the original theatrical release. So I gave it 7/10. Afterwards, I read some reviews and comparative analysis, then watched it a 2nd time the next day. When I did, I had to agree that it was the superior version. So my rating bumped up. Otherwise, the film is what its always been. Remarkably aesthetic, with great camera work. In addition it possesses one of the most beautiful romantic moments I have seen in any movie. (I am referring to Dekkards wooing of Rachel after she has played the piano.) I admit that a few scenes tend to clog up the flow of the narrative (in my humble opinion), but not enough to lessen the overall enjoyment of the film."
"usernumber655321","6","256","373","18 July 2012"," good atmosphere/ production design, but everything else was weak
","This movie is obscenely over rated. It is clear that ALL the attention was given to the production design and overall look to the film, as the script (no matter the 'version') is awful. For a film so raved about by nearly every critic, the plot is cookie cutter and drab. The pacing is, well, there simply isn't any pacing. It is S L O W. The characters are completely uninteresting and the film isn't deep or genuinely philosophical enough to warrant the attention it asks us to pay. There are many parts that are simply goofy and unintentionally funny, like when Rutger Hauer pops his head through the wall towards the end and says something silly, or when Darryl Hannah could have killed Deckard but instead decides to back up and then do a bunch of goofy gymnastics flips in order to give him time to pick up his gun and blow her ""guts"" out. It is one of my best friend's favorite films and it took a lot out of me to hold my tongue while watching it with him."

","This is a film that is so deep, rich, and multi-layered, it may require more than one viewing to fully absorb the brilliance of what you've just seen. At first glance, it can be a bit slow. It's told in a classic film noir fashion, so this is to be expected. Director Ridley Scott seems to want to savor every shot, and an astute audience will be able to sense this.<br/><br/>Now, I say the film is told in a classic Noir style, but this can be misleading. There is no Humphrey Bogart in Blade Runner, snapping off brilliant one-liners once a second. Only hopeless people, in many ways victims of the merciless world of which they are all a part. Deckard is a typically downbeat protagonist, a hard-boiled cynical leading man with a weakness for heavy drinking. The plot is a mystery in name only, as the audience is allowed to know what Roy Batty, Pris and Leon are all up to before Deckard ever finds out. This only lends to the dread and inevitability of the film, lending further to its pervasive gloom. There is no final scene at the end where the bold detective puts all the pieces together and says ""Ah-Ha!"". Instead, we find Rick Deckard questioning his own existence and drinking away his constant doubts, all the while embroiled in a romantic relationship with someone he's sworn to kill.<br/><br/>Blade Runner requires audience participation, particularly in the Director's Cut, which is entirely devoid of some rather necessary exposition provided by the Original Cut's much-maligned voice-over. Certain facts will not be clear even at the end of the film, requiring personal interpretation in order to be appreciated fully. Other facts will be given away in much more subtle ways than in most modern cinema, such as through visual cues and tenuous dialogue.<br/><br/>Finally, visually, this movie is quite simply a science fiction triumph. It looks better than modern computer effects in every way that counts. Superimposed special effect objects don't give off that unnatural, clearly computer-generated ""Lord of the Rings"" sheen common in today's effects-driven blockbusters. This, of course, is because Blade Runner - while a gorgeous movie - is not effects driven in the least. Rather, it is a visually driven story that doesn't rely on special effects. This is an important distinction to make in today's Hollywood.<br/><br/>""Touch of Evil"" really wasn't the last of the Great Film Noirs!"
"RusselleBell","Null","251","374","12 December 2004"," Finest hour.
","This is simply Scott's finest hour. There are a sheer plethora of futuristic films with vision. Films which crudely grope into a possible time ahead,when perhaps a post apocalyptic era is scattered with cliché upon cliché and often miss the whole point. What Ridley Scott achieved with this film,is an entirely possible scenario. It really does feel like a science fiction novel brought to life,but not so much as its derivative penned by Phillip K Dick(do androids dream of electric sheep?). Its a grimy,violent world inhabited by the sick,lower class,villainous second citizens who haven't quite made the grade for the off world colonies. We have a true smelting pot of nationalities.The heavy eastern references within china town like inner cities is particularly poignant.<br/><br/>This film also sees Ford in perfect casting.Theirs a rye charm that Ford has that no other actor could fake or fill quite as effortlessly. Its a mixed review depending on what version you have seen. For me,the directors cut is simply too cut. I preferred the audience friendly screening which had the wonderful narration. The finest moment with this narration has to be the moments described by Batty in his dying eyes and the summing up by Ford of this man/machines passion and love for life.. No other sci-fi futuristic film has ever made the grade before or since in my humble opinion. It captured the raw smells and light of a brutal future scarily depicted in films or even so well. From the chase scene with Zora to the flybys over the city capturing a stunning skyline,chimneys and skyscrapers in one shot. This is my favourite movie of all time for all the reasons above and many more i could effortlessly type all day and night."
"NikosMarkant","10","48","66","25 March 2018"," One of the greatest Sci-Fi movies of all time.
","Blade Runner is perhaps the best sci-fi film and undoubtedly one of the best films of all time. Along with 2001: A Space Odyssey, it is one of the most philosophical and influential movies ever created, as it conveys a plethora of fundamental questions, which are woven in the very fabric of the human essence and existence. It seems near impossible to imagine a more suitable fusion of two of the most successful genres of all time, Science Fiction and Film Noir. By merging together the moral conflict and the emphatic character arc of the private detective, a trait that is exclusive to and definitive of the Film Noir genre, with a futuristic dystopian environment, Blade Runner creates the ultimate Neo-Noir setting, the only one capable of supporting such strong ideas and posing such significant questions to the viewer, without compromising on an interesting plot development and an appealing pace, things that are masterfully achieved via a tight script and persuasive performances.<br/><br/>In a dark, future dystopian portrait of a 2019 Los Angeles, where humans have alienated themselves with their true nature and claimed the title of god/creator of life, effectively manufacturing artificial intelligence and bioengineering androids, called ""Replicants"", a retired ""Blade Runner"" named Rick Deckard is assigned with the undertaking of terminating four rogue such replicants that have illegally returned to Earth in a quest to force their maker, Tyrel, into postponing their grim destiny, basically prolonging their already predetermined four-year lifespan. Their greatest sin, however, is having the audacity of desiring one of the most sought-after values in the history of the human species, the freedom to live as they please. In this uneasy and twisted world, the lines between humanness and machinery are blurred and Deckard is faced with the consequences of the realization that not all is as it seems and there is more to ""being-alive"" than most believe. <br/><br/>Blade Runner's unique depiction of the future has been imitated numerous times quite unsuccessfully, mostly due to the fact that no other film to this date has managed to create such an engaging atmosphere so beautifully connected to every part of it, effectively enhancing every scene and allowing for a strong conveyance of all the moral and existential questions that are posed during the whole duration. The audience is instantaneously absorbed by the vivid and compelling world depicted in the film, and that's where Ridley Scott succeeds the most, offering a glance into an original and somewhat disturbing reality that might very well be humanity's near future. The cinematography is impeccable, the art direction is gorgeous and along with some of the best visual effects that have ever been used in film-making, creates one of the most realistic and visually stunning environments that have ever graced a motion picture to this day. Vangelis has also composed one of the best and most awe-inspiring scores of all time, effectively managing to capture the very essence of each scene, thus making all sound a significant and inseparable part of the whole cinematic experience that Blade Runner has to offer. <br/><br/>This thorough examination of what it means to be human isn't, thankfully, to no avail, as a careful observant, is forced to question their beliefs and attempt to choose a side on dilemmas that are still discussed by philosophers to this day, such as the traits that define humanity, the relativity that characterizes concepts like right or wrong, good or evil, as well as the meaning of life itself. The moral and existential complexity of this reality that Blade Runner has offered to the world reaches depths unparalleled by the majority of the films available, therefore greatly distinguishing it from all others and thus emphasizing its uniqueness through the most complete portrayal of science fiction to date."

"krishnaraj613","10","223","358","9 July 2005"," Science Fiction Epic
","I have an interest in science fiction films and TV programmes. I like shows like (the original) Star Wars trilogy, (most of) the Star Trek films, as well as Star Trek TV series (Voyager for modern times,preferably, as it had the least number of useless episodes), etc. In my experience, most SF material turns out to be distilled garbage. Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' was a masterpiece. I am not hesitant to say that I blatantly dislike Spielberg's definition of SF- ET, Close Encounters, & (worst of all) War Of The Worlds. Neither do I appreciate any 'Alien' film apart from R Scott's 1979 original (although Alien2 was OK)-Alien vs Pred is a disgrace not only to all genres, but to the film industry itself. So when I heard of Blade Runner on the net, I wondered; what could be so good about this film? I have HBO,Cinemax, Star Movies- yet this film has never been shown. So, I got myself the Director's Cut at the local video store. I watched it once. Then I re-watched it two days later. My verdict: This film is fantastic.<br/><br/>It is one of the greatest films ever made, on par with 2001: A Space Odyssey. Upon 1st viewing, new audiences may be bewildered. One anticipates a futuristic run-of-the-mill 80's shoot-em-up (in the like of Outland,say). What you get is a film so deep that it is difficult to grasp the 1st time. There is so much symbolism, introverts and questions that I was left stunned. The film is hauntingly beautiful, and I doubt that these screen landscapes could be reproduced today as well as they were here. The plot centres around the question of humanity- something we take for granted. It is not an auctioneer, which was probably what audiences expected when they walked into theatres in the 80s, causing the film to fail commercially. Blade Runner is not for the adrenaline junkie, nor for those who like flashy gadgets and bright explosions, with a healthy Hollywood-made dose of convincing storyline spoon-fed for their satisfaction.<br/><br/>The film is set in the apocalyptic, suggestively post-war future Earth, where there seems to be a lag in technology. Perhaps there was a war which ravaged the world, forcing humans to migrate (the cramped cultural richness of LA), and rebuild, explaining the retro technology. 6 'Criminal' Nexus 6 replicates (genetically engineered humanoids), hijack a ship and come to Earth seeking their maker. These slaves(machines/automatons// regard them as anything which has been created by Man to lessen his burden) have developed emotions, and they fear death for they cherish their memories (Think robots weeping over photographs). Their cause: They want a longer life, they want to experience more, they want to be... human.<br/><br/>Enter Rick Deckard, Blade Runner. His job: kill trespassing replicates; Kill living, breathing humanoids composed of flesh and blood who only have 4 years to live out their miserable lives, seeking haven on Earth rather than serving as slaves in mining outposts on Mars. Kill? Murder seems more appropriate. But that's his job. replicates which trespass are a hazard. These 6 replicates have killed 23 people and hijacked a ship. They have to be killed, right? If you're planning to take sides in this film, you will be pleasantly if not unnervingly surprised. There are no sides. There is no good and evil. Harrison Ford plays the reluctant, burned out Blade Runner very well. His character is drab and dull, as it was meant to be; look at him in the Spinner on the way to Tyrell corporation- pure boredom. He hates his job. If there were any narration, it Should sound dull and uninteresting, reflecting his character. Rutger Hauer gives the greatest performance of his career (so far) in this film, playing Roy Batty, Replicant 'project manager'. He dominates the later part of the film. He is cold, stiff and evil, but in the end speech, one of the Greatest endings I have ever seen, his performance alone makes this film a Classic. The ending is beautiful, and the score by Vangelis is perfect.<br/><br/>All in all, the film is excellent. Well directed by Ridley Scott, innovative and stunning imagery underlined by Vangelis' superb score, and plenty to think about (on your own- no spoon feeding). Check out the trivia for this film; scientists voted it better than 2001:A Space Odyssey. Is the quest for humanity a crime? Find out for yourself. Blade Runner is a Must-Watch, and a Must-Have film.<br/><br/>My rating: 8.9 / 10 Thank you for your time. Kris"
"ccthemovieman-1","9","78","123","7 December 2008"," New Blu-Ray Disc Made Me A Blade Runner Fan
","Sometimes you just need to give a film a second chance, even if it is 20 years later! Only some rave reviews about the picture quality of this new 5-disc ""Complete Collector's Edition"" enticed me to watch this again. Wow, I am glad; this was a very entertaining and a tremendous visual and audio treat.<br/><br/>I actually appreciated the audio best because, even in this new Blu-Ray era, one doesn't often find a film with very active surround speakers. However, this ""restored"" version did and the sound is, at the point, the best I've heard on a Blu-Ray disc....or any DVD, for that matter. The visuals? Well, fans of Blade Runner know all about them. They are fantastic. Scene-after-scene reminded me of a Stanley Kubrick film or another bizarre 1980s movie called ""Jacob's Ladder.""<br/><br/>Because there are so many things to see and hear, and the story is different, one filled with strange characters, I can see where people would watch this film multiple times and enjoy it very much each time. The ""Collector's Edition"" has the best picture ever, according to director Ridley Scott, and ""is the version I'm most pleased with."" It has added scenes one didn't see in earlier versions. The rest of the DVD has those earlier versions. Apparently, there are several including those with Harrison Ford doing narration, like out of a late '40s film noir.<br/><br/>Speaking of the latter, that's what this film looked like: a combination film noir (or neo-noir) and sci-fi movie. It has many dark images, fantastic night-time scenes, wonderful closeups and an always-interesting color palette. Sci-fi films usually get dated in a hurry, thanks to ever-increasing special-effects progress in the movie industry, but this still looks very good. Despite being made over 25 years ago, Blade Runner still looks very much state-of-the-art.<br/><br/>Scott says this is the best version and the best his film has ever looked and sounded. Since it's his movie, who am I to argue. So, if you're like me and never gave this movie a chance (I lost interest halfway through with my VHS look at it), give this a second look on this Blu-Ray edition....and you will be blown away. This is, indeed, an amazing film."
"antialias11","10","175","292","4 January 2005"," A movie you have to watch twice
","First time I saw this I wasn't impressed. Maybe because I expected more action from a Sci-Fi movie. Then I rented it on VHS, and upon re-watching I figured something out: This is one of the very few movies that gets better the more often you see it. It is a subtle movie. Slowly but surely this one has made it into the top 5 of my 'best movies of all time' list.<br/><br/>I don't particularly care for the director's cut version, though. The inner monologue is missing - which gives you some of the most thought inspiring moments, and some of the added scenes downright make no sense at all. if I'd seen that one first I might never have given it a second chance.<br/><br/>The cast is exceptional. Every one of them does a really fine job. Especially Rutger Hauer who otherwise has very few good movies to his name (maybe 'Day of the Falcon') delivers a stunning performance. Most of the cast who were unknown before this movie have moved on to fame (and some to fortune) - and rightfully so.<br/><br/>From a technical point of view there is not much to criticize. More than 20 years later this movie still doesn't look dated (apart from 'Atari'-neon signs). The atmosphere is created with a lot of attention to detail, and the models of buildings are some of the most beautiful and believable ones I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Now I recently read the book on which it is based ('Do androids dream of electric sheep' by Philip K. Dick). It's a quirky read and, frankly, not a very good book. It has too many plot holes, deus-ex-machina devices and logical inconsistencies, plus a total letdown of an ending. What it does add to the movie is the setup of why the atmosphere is like it is (polluted, dark, many 'freaks' around), and the nice question whether the Hero might be a replicant himself."

","I can imagine that back in the 80s this was mindblowingly good and the visuals hold up very well to this day, but story and character wise... For a movie that's relatively slow paced, there is hardly any character development, logical decisions or motivation (aside for revenge, survival and being forced back on duty) for most of the runtime. Characters make such rash decissions, it's almost laughable. All this sadly makes a decently build up universe, pretty boring.. The acting wasn't bad though. I'm giving this a 5 just for visuals and the fact that this probably has inspired quite a bit of (better) sci-fi today."

I remember Gary Franklin (A Movie Critic on Television) gave this film a ""10"" on a scale of 1 to 10 ""10"" being best. <br/><br/>When a friend of mine saw this he hated it and so I never saw until 1992. That is when the ""Director's Cut"" was released theatrically. I was now 25 years. I wanted to see this because I saw a clip on television and someone saying this film was meant to be seen on the ""Big Screen"" and so off I went. <br/><br/>This cut of the film is most well known for being the version that ""Took Away"" the Harrison Ford Voice Overs. It also included a shot of a unicorn that implied that ""Harrison Ford"" is a Replicant. <br/><br/>I was not blown away by this film. I thought it was ""good"" not ""great""<br/><br/>The story does take its time but the rewards are huge if you pay close attention. . Its haunting images are so memorable that it influenced future filmmakers. In more ways than one it became the ""Metropolis"" of a new era. <br/><br/>From the future setting to having different versions released. ""Blade Runner"" and ""Metropolis"" are 2 films one should watch back to back. <br/><br/>Now my problem with ""Blade Runner"" is that each version is SLOW! The action could of moved faster.

"Damien-10","Null","115","195","19 March 1999"," Best Sci-Fi Ever
","I will confidently make the statement that Blade Runner is the best science-fiction picture ever made. I have seen every important sci-fi movie, and personally, Blade Runner reveals itself to be a superior film.<br/><br/>
Space Odyssey and Alien come close, but they do not hold up as well as Blade Runner upon multiple viewings. Space Odyssey tends to lull in its more psychedelic moments, leaving one with a feeling of confused longing. No matter how many theories are expounded based on the content of the film, its ultimate meaning will remain ever-ambiguous, as Kubrick intended it to be. Alien is weakened by its inability to reach the viewer on a higher philosophical plane. The suspense in the film is nearly unparalleled, and Sigourney Weaver is fantastic, but it falls short of the excellence displayed in Blade Runner.<br/><br/>
Let me explain why Blade Runner is my favorite:<br/><br/>
The most striking aspect of the film is its cinematography. There is nothing but genius in the shooting of every scene. The use of shadows and low camera angles bears an uncanny resemblance to the cinematography of Citizen Kane. My favorite shot is when we get our first glimpse into Tyrell's office. The lighting effects in all of that set's scenes are fantastic.(especially when the windows become tinted). Please note that the lame-brains at the academy did not nominate Blade Runner for Best Cinematography. How stupid can you get?<br/><br/>
Behind every film is the Director's vision, and in this film, Ridley Scott displays incredible vision. His conception of a futuristic LA, as characterized by the inevitable demographics of the future, is what allows the film to transcend its era and remain appreciated in the future. Many of the themes in the movie originate from the sci-fi novel (which carries an absurd title that does not obey the rules of logic:one does not dream of sheep; one thinks of sheep in an attempt to achieve a state of dream), yet the manner in which those themes are presented brings about the full genius of Ridley Scott. (How many Hardcore rock fans know where the phrase ""more human than human"" comes from?) Through the example of the replicants, Scott exposes the human sin of taking life for granted. Furthermore, he asks: what does it mean to be human? Do we have a false vision of our own morality as a race? Do we ignore our own evils? Can we play God as Tyrell attempts to do? The complexity of all these questions allows for many viewings of the film.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And then, of course, there are the actors. None of them stand out in their roles, and yet the acting is perfect. Harrison Ford plays Deckard, the misanthropic ex-cop, who comes off as a veritable anti-hero. Sean Young plays Rachel, the incredibly human replicant that steals his heart. Rutger Hauer plays Roy, the umistakably Aryan leader of the replicants. All three of them deserved Oscar nominations. The other minor roles are superb as well.<br/><br/>Finally, Blade Runner would not be itself without the Vangelis soundtrack. It has a wonderful mood-controlling effect throughout the film. I especially like the Blade Runner Blues, and Rachel's song.<br/><br/>
I think that anybody who's read through my entire comment gets the point: I love this movie and I find it to be the best. If you haven't seen it, get over to the video store NOW!!! For first time viewers be sure to get the original version. When you have become familiar enough with the plot, go see it as it was meant to be, (without the voice-over), and rent the director's cut. If you live in a big city, you might be lucky enough to catch it on the big screen at an independent theatre."
"formiscosas","1","208","382","20 November 2010"," overrated trite
","For the life of me I can't think of a reason why this movie is held with such high regards in the sci-fi community, except for having the holy trinity of geekdom (it's set in the future, sexy robots and Harrison Ford). Every movie geek that wants to secure their geek cred will go out of their way saying this movie is awesome and the best thing to happen to sci-fi since the invention of movies. In reality, they are loath to admit that it's a boring, overrated piece of cinematographic crap that nobody outside the community actually likes. Even though I've had all my life to watch this movie, I've never made it the whole way through in one sitting. In fact, I've seen more of Flash Gordon and Conan in one sitting than I have of this movie (and the fact that I made it almost all the way through both Guru and Gigli is a testament to my unwillingness to turn away from a movie once I start to watch them). Overall, a boring movie that nobody should bother with. If you want Ford, robots or movies set in the future there are far better things out there than this one. Having all the things you like in one movie doesn't make it good."

All the characters are near to completely shallow, the dialogues are pathetic and scares, the wanna-be-Protagonist (i.e. the replicants) are seem to be on cracks with super-power and no apparent real intellect (or moral, if that even matters). The concept of sending one man (may he be a replica or not) against the ""most dangerous escapee"" is ridiculous, all the genius ""gene creators"" have no security none so ever, live in dirty places (and always alone!) and have no survival instinct at all. I can't believe Philip K. Dick book is that shallow (which I haven't read as of yet). This was a boring movie, with no real philosophical point, no trigger to continue watching it and no deep thoughts at the end...<br/><br/>Is this really the movie that was considered a milestone in Sci-Fi?

There are literally 5 things that happen in the movie. People read way to far in this movie about how it's supposed to be about how the robots were more humans than the people, personally I believe that's a load of poppycock. When the original was released nobody went to see it, the original was cut and given a commentary for a reason, the film was too long, boring and doesn't make much sense.

"utku_kamil_ozen","10","23","37","24 September 2017"," The finest of Sci-fi genre, and my personal favorite film of all times (Had to cut my review in parts due to a word-limit for reviews on IMDb)
","It is ironic how Sci-fi genre is the most dependent on the technical side of the filmmaking compared to other genres and yet with all the technological improvements we will probably never see a better sci-fi film than most of the older ones. And even more ironically, the technical side of the filmmaking was the very quality that created the unique styles of the old sci-fi films. So, what makes these old films, Blade Runner in particular, so good looking compared to modern films, despite the fact that they had little technology back then? Speaking of visual style alone, what makes it so memorable compared to new films that are made with all the technological possibilities at filmmakers' disposal? There are three main answers to these questions:<br/><br/>1. singular artistic vision as opposed to an army of graphic designers,<br/><br/>2. director's own decisions as opposed to a director who does whatever he's told to,<br/><br/>3. and lastly care and love in craftsmanship for the film by those who involved in making of it.<br/><br/>Did you know that one of the buildings in Blade Runner was actually a kitchen sink? With all its miniatures and matte paintings the city looks gorgeous. Because people took their time to create it and they cared. It looks more real too than those created with CGI. And I know that uncanny valley effect is a term used for humans but I think it applies to objects as well. You can tell, most of the time, whether an object is physically there or it is a computer effect. CGI looks cheap. Blade Runner is like a hand-made classic European sports car whereas most modern films are like a Toyota Corolla, supposed to be better than the old ones but they are not, made out of plastic in an assembly line, and they look cheap.<br/><br/>Another thing, other than the visuals, that makes this film so good is the soundtrack. Vangelis is one my favorite composers of all time. His style is unique and his music is so emotional. The soundtrack for Blade Runner perfectly fits and even helps create the ambiance of its universe. There are some films, like Jaws (1975) for example, that owe most of their success to their composers. I am not saying Blade Runner is one those films. Because it's visually and story-wise so good, It would still be a great film with different soundtrack, but at the same time, the soundtrack of Blade Runner is probably the best soundtrack for a movie ever, even though it didn't depend solely on its soundtrack for the mood.<br/><br/>The story and acting are also very good. Though I must note that when I say acting, I mean Rutger Hauer's performance specifically. What a great performance from him. In fact, I wouldn't even bring up the acting in this film if it wasn't for Rutger Hauer. He totally steals this film. Harrison Ford is so mediocre most of the time and at times his acting gets even weird and bad. But in my opinion, this contrast of acting performances somewhat serves the film in a serendipitous way. We see how much there is to Roy, how a great character he is compared to Deckard, who looks like a mere policeman following orders with no depth to his personality. This brings me to the story of the film which is very simple in itself but brings up so many questions to the mind. Roy, an artificial human -a replicant as named in the film- seeking more life. As an agnostic person who suffers from death anxiety, I couldn't relate more to any movie character in my life than I relate to Roy. Don't we all suffer from fear of death, like Roy? I don't even know if I was created or not, as an agnostic. So I don't get to go after my creator, if there is such a thing, and ask for more life. But Roy has this chance and this is the plot of the film. But it is only incidental. For me, the film is all about the tragedy of being mortal. And by giving replicants a life span of only 4 years, we are reminded how short our own lives are. It is hard for us to realize somethings in life before an artist magnifies or reduces something so we can see it better. 4 years, 40 years, 80 years... In eternity, all those numbers lose their significance, as Roy put it more poetically ''...all those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain...''<br/><br/>And then there is this fact about Roy that he is an artificial human, but his passion for life makes you think about what makes us alive and sentient. I remember this line from another film ''I, Robot (2004)'' it goes like this ''...When does a perceptual schematic become consciousness?...'' this is a very good question indeed. In fact, even for (organic) organisms, you can question the extent of their consciousness or for more simple life forms you can even think whether they are conscious at all. Or you can ask what makes us special and unique. Is it because we have souls? Or perhaps soul is something we made up and it is all about the chemicals that effect our decisions and the complexity comes from merely endless combinations and permutations of these chemicals. That idea makes you question your very own existence. The very fact that we have medication for depression tells us something about human mind. But we can speculate about these facts. I choose to accept that Roy is nothing less than a human in that matter. I've heard people complaining how they cannot relate to a ''robot'' regarding this film, but in my opinion that just shows lack of imagination."
"Hannibal_Chigurh","10","30","51","2 February 2008"," I Finally Get It
","I had seen the Director's Cut (a misleading title) of Blade Runner and was slightly underwhelmed. I mean, sure it looked great, but the supposedly deep story just didn't grab me. Then I got the five disc briefcase for Christmas and immediately put in the Final Cut. Wow. It's all clear now.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is one of a precious few pantheon of science fiction film that has become even more prescient as time passes (the other that comes to mind is 2001: A Space Odyssey). Look at the L.A. in this film, then look at present-day Los Angeles. Subtract the flying cars and robots and you've got the same city (horribly polluted and overpopulated with many ethnicities mixing language and cultures). We follow Deckard, a specialized cop known as a Blade Runner who hunts down androids known as replicants. These machines look like humans and, if given time to mature, emote like humans. They are used as labor and sex slaves, but die out after a 4 year period so their emotions do not develop (this too has ties to the modern world. Planned obsolescence is the reason your electronics never last more than a year or two). When a replicant starts to piece things together before it dies, Deckard must take it out before it harms humans.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, we can see that Deckard doesn't particularly like his job despite the fact that he is the best Blade Runner in town. The replicant Rachael (played by Sean Young) seems to trigger a re-evaluation of his life, and he takes no pleasure in hunting the group of dangerous androids he's been hired to ""retire"".<br/><br/>This film is Sir Ridley Scott's masterpiece, and the one that best shows his talents. Like his idol Kubrick, Scott knows how to light a scene just the right way, and his use of smoke and blinds and fans and anything else that distorts light is what gives the film its noir feel. He drops clues all along the way to that paramount of questions: Is Deckard a replicant? Every clue can be construed to fit either side of the debate, and it proves that there is no wrong answer to the question.<br/><br/>The Final Cut essentially omits and touches up more than it adds. Most ""director's cuts"" are excuses to throw in material that was cut for a reason (and a good deal of them are done without the director's consent). Here, Scott digitally touches up a few technical flaws, but he doesn't go crazy like Lucas. Also, we get the complete unicorn scene, which is crucial to the film's big question, as well as sticking with the DC's omitted voice-over narration (which is such a blessing, by the way).<br/><br/>In the end Blade Runner is a masterful look at that which makes us human. Roy Batty's final act gives us all the insight into replicants we need and his final speech is perhaps the single most moving moment in science fiction. It serves to underscore the whole film, and it sends chills down my spine every time I see it. Blade Runner is one of those precious sci-fi films that actually challenges you to think, and it almost single-handedly founded the film genre of cyberpunk, which had been present in literature but hadn't crossed over. Cyberpunk is unquestionably the most thought-provoking sub-genre of science fiction, and this film is its masterpiece. Many people award a film they like a perfect 10, but this is truly a cornerstone that has influenced directors, actors, and entire genres of film."

","Blade Runner is perhaps the worst film adaption of a novel ever made. To say that Blade Runner is an adaption of Phillip K Dick's inspiring novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" is not only a lie, but it is an insult to both Phillip K. Dick and any movie that has been adapted to film with even a marginal degree of success. It is most generous and honest to say that Blade Runner is inspired by ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"".<br/><br/>Blade Runner presents, at best, a surface-level representation of a select few of the novel's characters; these representations are devoid of the depth that made them captivating. Likewise, there are many great (and well-developed) characters who were excluded from the film.<br/><br/>The subplots, entire segments of the plot, the greater part of its ethos, and major aspects of the novel's theme are also expunged from this film. In short, the elements of the novel that have moral, narrative, effusive, or dramatic merit are conspicuously absent from this film.<br/><br/>Instead of being a narrative that re-affirms greater truths about humanity, Blade Runner exists only as a testament to sloppy adaptation by screenwriters who have such little respect for literature that they would cinematically re-hash a novel's spark notes.<br/><br/>I believe that, were the novel by which Blade Runner is inspired more widely read, society would recognize Blade Runner as the fecal insult to great literature that it is."

","Even before the plot kicks in, Blade Runner's strangely beautiful neon sci-fi images make this an instant masterpiece. Blade Runner's philosophical plot aligns with it's appealing visuals focusing on how even the smallest things in life are fascinating. Even the most fantastic imagery comes from some of the most basic things, such as smoke from a cigarette glimmering in sunlight. In Blade Runner, Earth has become numb to such a dazzling gift life is, which allows a deeper exploration through Harrison Ford's well preformed slowly realizing Rick Deckard and Rutger Bauer's Roy Batty.

"exterminator_99","7","91","180","24 January 2001"," Style over substance, yet still impressive
","Blade Runner has become a cult hit in the 19 years since its release.  It is understandable why.  The film has a disjointed, postmodern narrative surrounded by superb photography and set design.  The hero is not even a hero and the conclusion of the film, at least the director's cut, isn't all that happy.  Most of all, Blade Runner eerily shadows the near future for our own world, the future of cloning and unnaturally created humans. Science fiction has always been able to show us images of ourselves or our world in a future or alien world, things we would prefer not to see.<br/><br/>Blade Runner's premise is simple.  Deckard (Harrison Ford) has to hunt down four Replicants': artificial humans who have great intelligence but superior physical attributes.  These replicants have run amock in space colonies and now human authorities on Earth are worried that the replicants will do the same here.<br/><br/>All of this is really nothing more than a faint attempt at a story.  Blade Runner's success lies not with its story element, but with the amazing vision of fantasy and fear of its director, Ridley Scott.  Scott had previously made ""Alien"", another postmodern vision of man's possible future. In that film he questioned colonisation, globalization (but on a intergalactic scale), our fascination with destriction and the corruption of modern business.  In ""Blade Runner"", Scott explores corruption, man's destructive nature, but he also delves into emotion and the possibility of someone ELSE creating those emotions for us, as is the case for the replicants.<br/><br/>The plot plays second fiddle to the set design and costumes.  The choice of Los Angeles being the setting for the film is brilliant: at present L.A. is a city blanketed in sunshine, with an image of blonde babes and surfers all too obvious.  In ""Blade Runner"" the city is nothing like it is today.  It has become a blend of Tokyo, New York and some Eastern European wasteland of pollution.<br/><br/>The vehicle, weapons and costumes all have a distinctive 1980's - apocalyptic - retro feel to them, the flying cars are almost too cheesy to be taken seriously, but combined with Vangelis' synthesizer score and the noir-ish feel of the narrative they fit just perfectly.<br/><br/>
""Blade Runner""'s narrative is just that: film noir.  Deckard is akin to Sam Spade, he's seen it all, been there and back, and is a tortured soul.  It's got the femme fatale, the more evil than evil villan and the corporation that is somehow responsible for all this mess.  At the same time the film is a thriller, a western and a science fiction yarn.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford is suited as Deckard.  He is the anti-Han Solo or Indiana Jones.  Rutger Hauer is superbly evil too, it is a shame he hasn't been able to follow this up with anything as good.<br/><br/>Many films since this have tried to show a world void of any semblances of what we take for granted today, but none have compared to ""Blade Runner"". The film that came closest to it would be the Japanese animation ""Akira"" which also deals with similar themes.<br/><br/>Science fiction always succeeds when the viewer is planted in the story one step beyond what might have actually happened.  See Planet of the Apes, Alien, Star Wars, et al.  In ""Blade Runner"" we get a vision of the world as it may actually be one day.  Maybe not 2019, but somewhere down the track the science fiction of films such as these may become science fact.<br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" is one of THE definitive sci-fi movies ever made."

","Hey! Get this straight. If you don't like Blade Runner, you don't understand it. Why? Because you don't. You're not allowed to dislike it.<br/><br/>Over the years Blade Runner has gathered around itself such a huge fan-base (that's so out of whack) that anyone who says they dislike it is instantly discredited and dismissed as an idiot. So, you better like Blade Runner, or you're an idiot, got it? <br/><br/>Blade Runner is a completely brain-dead, wannabe, intellectual, Sci-Fi film that spends 2 hours delivering a careless and poorly managed love story and then ""Wham! Bam!"" at the end it's suddenly a statement about the meaning of life. (Sorry, but the last 10 minutes don't make up for the first 2 hours.)<br/><br/>And the question was raised - ""Was Deckard really a replicant?"" Who cares! Harrison Ford's portrayal was about as realistic as that of a robot. And about half the time he walked around looking like he'd just been punched in the nuts.<br/><br/>Is Blade Runner a finely sculpted masterpiece of cinematic excellence? No, it is not!! <br/><br/>If this film is really Ridley Scott's idea of poignant commentary, then it sure makes me glad to know that he doesn't have an ego."
"jaywolfenstien","Null","17","28","2 February 2008"," A frame to die for.
","I spent a weekend with the new DVD set of Blade Runner. Watched all four versions pretty much back to back (minus the work print version) starting with the US theatrical and finishing with the Final Cut. And across those eight hours I spent with the film, I did not get tired of watching – just watching – that futuristic film-noir vibe: deep dark shadows and majestic use of light and color used to make a run-down polluted cityscape look so beautiful. In fact, when I got to the Final Cut, which had been cleaned up, restored, and remixed, the picture and sound quite literally took my breath away.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is easily one of the best looking films ever made.<br/><br/>In some ways, many ways, Blade Runner strikes me as silly. Particularly in its more climactic moments where the protagonist faces off against a replicant. Pris's acrobatic means of attacking Deckard? When Roy Batty chases Deckard in his shorts (when a few moments before he was fully clothed?) The film goes over-the-top to the point where I find myself asking, ""why in the world would the characters do that?!"" But here's what's interesting: as silly as Blade Runner may get it never betrays its own world. Everything that happens, in some queer way, feels natural to this strange futuristic world.<br/><br/>I like the movie in its action scenes, but I simply adore it during the quieter moments – the parts where not a whole hell of a lot is happening, and you can simply watch and absorb Jordan Cronenweth's marvelous cinematography. My favorite scene comes when Rachel has saved Deckard's life. An emotional wreck of killing another replicant on top of the revelation that she, herself, is a replicant – she stands by a window where light floods in, so much light that the whole screen goes white, and then it recedes again and we see the characters again. Later in that same scene, she sits at the piano, plays for a bit, and then lets her hair down. Hearing Deckard stumbling in the other room, she looks out of the corner of her eye  and shot after shot after shot through this entire sequence demonstrates absolute mastery over the frame.<br/><br/>Plus some of the other quiet moments resonate with a truer low-key science-fiction feel such as the scene in Tyrell corporation where Deckard applies the Voight-Kampff test to Rachel. More or less a mundane questionaire/interview with a typical sci-fi gadget sitting on the table, but Ridley Scott and Terry Rawlings compacts the lengthy endeavor into a few short moments using a stunningly simple montage.<br/><br/>Later on, Deckard sits in front of a voice-activated screen analyzing a photograph. The task is presented as a dull monotonous job (made especially evident in Harrison Ford's delivery), yet the scene, itself, never bores. The voice-activation not only serves as a staple sci-fi device, but cleverly allows Deckard to take the audience's hand and guide them through this investigative process. And perhaps what I like most about the scene: the audience, and even Deckard himself, doesn't even really know what he's found. Things don't magically fall into place with a Scooby-Doo moment of revelation. He finds another clue that might lead somewhere (albeit, since it's a movie it's a good guess the clue does lead somewhere.) In my mind at least moments such as the Voight-Kampff scenes, Deckard's briefing, the photograph analysis, both of Rachel's scenes in Deckard's apartment gives the world of Blade Runner a solid grounding so later on it can get away with the absurd.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the replicants. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) in particular, whose strangely sympathetic in that his murderous tendencies spawn directly from his fear of dying. This is a man who possesses a strong conviction that he deserves life perhaps because he looks around on earth and sees people squandering their existence while he knows he only has a few short moments. Why should a shmuck like Deckard live for 50+ years when Roy in his 4 short years has seen attack ships burning off the shoulder of Orion and seen C-beams glitter in the dark  ""If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes,"" he proudly and warmly tells one of the scientists who helped create him.<br/><br/>As for which cut of the film, I don't think any single one is perfect (and I'd honestly watch any of them in a heartbeat.) I prefer the ""Final Cut"" over the others and admire Ridley Scott's restraint in his definitive DVD release. Most of the modifications are fine-tuning tweaks the casual viewer won't even notice unless watching two version back to back, and most of said fine-tuning improve the film (although, admittingly, Roy's beckoning of Sebastian could've been left out.) But hell, all versions of Blade Runner are included, so people don't have much room to complain about the changes. And no matter what version you go with, it's still a beautiful film to just  watch."

","Awful - this is the only correct word that comes into mind while trying to express an impression after watching this horrible, endless, long, slow, trite, banal, bland, vapid, tasteless, languid, sorrowful and pitiful movie. Risdley Scott made this maybe as a film noir, instead he made a deep insult to all of us. Mindless bog, slow dark laughable waste of time and money, terribly poorly sync'd, with all plot holes, silly dialogs and unbearably poor acting of Hannah, Hauer, Harrison and all the rest. Ut seems they were all dead bored with this curio, and endless steamy dark scenes only build up a bigger misery that this film evokes. There are no redeeming features in this bog, no light in this drabness, no sense in this ugly mire.

","There are movies that stand the test of time with the exception of some outdated special effects. Some movies in this category are: the Star Wars trilogy, Poltergeist, and even The Terminator. Then there are movies like Blade Runner, where one leaves the theater, or turns off the DVD player, scratching his head. Movies like Poltergeist and The Terminator work because both stories revolve around ordinary people with ordinary lives to whom the viewers can relate. Star Wars, while not completely relatable, has such an interwoven, tightly knit story in a fantastic world, that viewers can imagine the existence of such world. Even further, viewers know how to adapt to this world to the point where they can play dress up, speak Wookie, and recreate this environment. I've never heard of a Blade Runner convention.<br/><br/>This movie wants so bad to be taken seriously, or does it? The soundtrack alone contradicts itself. The title sequence begins silently with a few heavy pounding beats and shrilling chords, making the viewer believe she is about to experience something along the lines of a war film, or better yet, a thriller. The movie's prologue somewhat adds to that assumption, although it's a little wordy and complicated of a background for the viewer to completely understand. Replicants bad. Humans good. Why? Dunno.<br/><br/>After the serious introduction, the film loses credibility with its choice of bizarre magical fairy notes as though the story was a Read Along and it was asking its viewer to turn the page. Yes, the movie was made in 1982, but so was Poltergeist. And even then I am sure people were associating that sound of chimes with whimsical fairy dust. The sound often implies that something supernatural or magical has or is about to occur. However, it was just odd.<br/><br/>There are other contradictions in the film, mainly the Replicants themselves, which left me with many questions. Why were Replicants created? If they are dangerous and illegal aliens then why is the Tyrell Corporation still producing them? Why are Replicants made in the first place if they are not supposed to exist? What is their beef with humans? What is humanity's beef with Replicants? Roy and Leon can handle sub temperatures like pros but Pris freaks out about a little rain? Am I supposed to feel sorry for Rachael? Why did Roy save Rick? What did Pris's acrobatics have to do with anything? Why didn't Rick retrieve his gun after he dropped it? Was climbing out onto the windowsill and scaling the side of the building really his best option? What's with: the guy with the mustache; the boiling eggs; the singing Japanese/Chinese lady; smoky/misty rooms and the city being foggy; the unicorn and the photos? Finally, how come the Replicants can run through sheets of glass, ram their heads through walls, and drive nails into the palms of their hands, but they fall down dead after one gunshot? The building is called the Bradbury, but if I were Ray, I would not feel flattered. Perhaps I did not catch on to every detail and many of the questions were answered in the movie, but I do not plan to watch this film again to find out."

","In the beginning of the Twentieth-First Century, the Tyrell Corporation releases the evolution of robots in the Nexus phase with Replicants that are identical to humans, but with superior strength and agility and the intelligence of the genetic engineers who created them. They are used off-world as slave labor in the colonization of other planets. After a bloody mutiny in a colony, the Replicants are declared illegal on Earth and hunted down by the Blade Runner units, special police squads that shoot them to kill. The execution of a Replicant is called retirement.<br/><br/>In November 2019, in Los Angeles, the retired Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is summoned by his former chief Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh) that assigns him to hunt down four Replicants that are hidden in Los Angeles. Deckard studies the profiles of Roy (Rutger Hauer), Pris (Daryl Hannah), Leon Kowalski (Brion James) and Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) and finds that they had been designed with four years lifespan maximum and they tried to infiltrate themselves in the Tyrell Corporation. Deckard visits their creator, Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel), in his corporation. Sr. Tyrell asks Deckard to demonstrate his Voigt Kampff method to discover the Replicants in his assistant Rachael (Sean Young) and Deckard concludes that she is a sophisticated Replicant but she does not know. When Deckard ""retires"" Zhora and Leon, he feels affected by their deaths and by the question of Rachel whether he has tested himself to know whether he is a Replicant. But he needs to end his mission and find Roy and Pris. <br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" is a melancholic work of art that raises existential questions about fear, life, death, emotions, mortality, humanity, dehumanization and love among other philosophical questions in an environment totally destroyed by excessive pollution, technology, marketing and consumption. The wrecked Earth is left to police and little people only, the others inhabitants have moved to the colonies in the off-world. The conflict appears when the retired Blade Runner Deckard is forced to hunt down Replicants again but now with different feelings, after falling in love for the Replicant Rachel and in doubt whether he is also a Replicant. Sean Young certainly has the best role of her career. The bleak cinematography and special effects are awesome and the soundtrack of Vangelis is among the most beautiful of the cinema history. I can not precisely say how many times I have watched the different versions of this film that is among my five favorite movies in the movie-theater, on VHS, on DVD and now on Blu-Ray, but my guess is at least twelve times. The last times I had seen this film were on 06 May 2000 and 31 May 2003. My vote is ten.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Blade Runner"""
"Freddy_Levit","10","26","49","7 June 2005"," A warning and reflection. A film subtly compelling. An experience ""More Human Than Human""
","How much has the world changed since 1982? The computer wars were beginning and arcade games were the craze, yet our lives were at a height of sociability. Things were simple for the sake of simplicity. Life seemed to make more sense. But our minds were unconsciously drifting away from reality, whilst reality slowly made its way towards the visions of this powerful film. 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?', written by famous American Science Fiction author Phillip K Dick, was adapted to the screen by Sir Ridley Scott into 'Blade Runner'. Ridley's masterful transformation of Dick's nocturnal vision to celluloid, confused audiences who misunderstood a world which would seem more like reality only ten years later in the technology boom of the 90s. The film gained 'turkey' status upon its release and was quickly abandoned as a mess, soon doomed to gain dust in relentless video libraries.<br/><br/>Ten years later the world only further resembled Blade Runner's scary vision. Upon its 1992 re-release, tickets sold out before they even hit the box-office. Even critic Roger Ebert rephrased his 1982 statement claiming it a masterpiece. And here began the Legacy of the most acclaimed Cult Film. Film critics around the world named it the most important science-fiction of all time with Kubrick's 2001 - and the most visually mesmerizing.<br/><br/>The film follows the enlightenment of a Blade Runner (a cop) Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) in Los Angeles 2019, a dystopia falling apart from permanent drizzling twilight, rare natural life and where technology dictates existence. Following early retirement from his police unit, Deckard is forced into a desperate assignment by his ex-boss 'Bryant'. Four Replicants (humanoids) have escaped from an 'off-world colony', taking a shuttle back to Earth for unknown reasons. His mission: To kill all Replicants declared illegal on Earth. Deckard's unconscious approach to his job in a world deteriorating from lack of nature,sociability and eternal darkness slowly deteriorates when his eyes open to the most important questions in life. Beginning his investigations in the Pyramids of the Tyrell Corporation, responsible for manufacturing the Replicants, he meets his turning point, Rachel, who due to Deckard's Void Kompff machine (an empathy tester) is found a Replicant. Following a cold, immoral revelation to her about her origins, he is inevitably drawn to her emotionally, soon leading to his first sign of awakening, LOVE.<br/><br/>From a cold beginning, without any sign of 'empathy' towards those around him, what Deckard finds out about Rachel, Elden Tyrell, and the so called ""EVIL"" Replicants he intercepts, enable him for the first time to feel and understand Love, Hate and the preciousness of Life respectively. Roy Batty, the leader of the Replicant mutineers, played convincingly by Dutch actor Rutger Hauer, is the most important symbol in the film, and is the ultimate enlightenment in Deckard's quest for humanity in learning that no matter if you're human or not, love, compassion and empathy are the most important human characteristics, and some Replicants are ""more human than human"". Contrary to initial perception, Batty shows these characteristics and we sympathize with him, something we wouldn't usually do with an 'artificial' human, with theoretically no emotions. Tyrell becomes the focal point of human degradation, in that in his vision of technological advance, he brings humanity, morality and nature closer to extinction as he sits atop his corporation like a 'Pharoah'.<br/><br/>Finally, there are many evidences to suggest 'Deckard' is a Replicant, and this has been immortal debate since release. Either way, the film's message remains as strong. It's filled with overwhelming symbolism and meaning, that one viewing of this art-work will be exhausting.<br/><br/>The film's intentions are not only to question what makes us human, but it also makes strong focus on reflecting our current issues of world Conservation, technological advance and the degradation of humanity from the media, exploitation, capitalism, and the complacency and destructive nature of humanity. In Ridley Scott's vision, the Sun that gives life has been blocked out by pollution due to the dominance of technology, and dreams of Unicorns suggests we long for the past, for rarity in Nature. What one must notice is that 'Eyes' play a key symbol throughout the film in explaining this, for it appears that most are 'artificial' than not.<br/><br/>'Blade Runner' is Ridley Scott's masterpiece and perhaps one of the most poignant films of all time. Countless copycats including 'The Fifth Element', and 'Akira' have tried to imitate his legendary vision of a dark world gone wrong, which only seems more possible as the years fly by. I am happy to see that Blade Runner is so respected and that people understand its vision. It has embedded itself into my movie collection and along with 'The Mosquito Coast', another similar film with Harrison Ford regarding humanity, is my favorite film of all time.<br/><br/>The music composed by 'Vangelis' is God-sent, sounding so mythical and dream-like. Set designs and cinematography have rarely been equaled  marvelously detailed. The whole cast were superb in bringing their characters to life. Especially Joe Turkel (Tyrell) and Rutger Hauer who played opposites of one another beautifully. Harrison Ford was irreplaceable as the lead, showing his transformation from a cold being into an human being expertly - it just seems so natural with him. However I believe Rutger Hauer should have received the Oscar for his performance as the human like Replicant. He has a commanding presence. Sean Young, playing Rachel, was a great choice. She's stunning and projects innocence well in showing Deckard's shortcomings. This film will be in the hearts of more 'as time goes by' and will never again end up accumulating dust in forgotten sections of video libraries. It's more than a 'classic'. I recommend everybody who loves film or philosophy to watch and explore its masterful telling. I have never seen a film as movingly deep. It's a poem from beginning to end and ""more human than human""."

","I saw ""Blade Runner"" in the theater again today (more on that later). First time I saw this film, it was the original version when it came out in Belgium (where I grew up) in 1982. Decades later, I saw it again, this time on DVD and in the ""Director's Cut"" or ""Final Cut"", I can't quite remember. The version I saw today was definitely the Final Cut.<br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" (originally released in 1982; The FInal Cut released in 2007; 117 min.) brings the story of Deckard, as he tracks down 4 replicants who have escaped from an Off World and need to be ""retired"" with extreme prejudice. As the movie opens, we are reminded it is ""Los Angeles, November, 2019"". YES, this very year! In Ridley Scott's (bleak and dark) vision of the future, LA is in permanent darkness and rain, with lots of pollution, and lots of overcrowding. Our man Deckard (Harrison Ford) meets Rachel (Sean Young), who may or may not be a replicant, who can tell for sure? In the meantime Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) is the leader of the replicants and up to no good...<br/><br/>While watching this in the theater today, I was struck by several things: first, the enormous vision from Ridley Scott this movie asked for (and received). Second, the set design and production is out of this world STILL, now almost 40 years later. Third, while there is very little ""action"", this movie flew by in no time (same as its Blade Runner 2049 sequel, incidentally). A movie like ""Blade Runner"" begs to be seen on the big screen. As luck would have, my art-house theater here in Cincinnati is doing a month-long sci-fi classics festival during July, and this was the first (and certainly not the last) that I was eager to see again in the theater. The July 4 matinee screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, and I imagine the later screenings will be PACKED. If you have a chance to see ""Blade Runner"" in the theater, run, do not walk! It makes for an unforgettable movie theater experience."
"arkif1","10","33","65","11 February 2007"," Human ambition
","There are several extraordinary things about Blade Runner.<br/><br/>1) It does not state who's good and who's bad. 2) It throws you into a scenario that you'll probably not enjoy. 3) It doesn't bother to explain why things are the way they are. 4) It shows us something that, although it doesn't exist anywhere, still has an existential meaning to us.<br/><br/>Apart from that Blade Runner has the best score ever. Vangelis created a style that in its simplicity strikes you far more as being of the future than any more sophisticated electronic music could ever do.<br/><br/>The thing I was referring to in 4. is a grown up without experiences of his own. That is a logical impossibility, a paradox. But paradoxically it's one of the most powerful stimuli of existential reflection that were ever shown in cinema. The point being that it lets you ask yourself what all your experiences were good for.<br/><br/>Not quite so subtle, yet still of interest, is the idea that you could be born into life knowing full well what your purpose is and how long you'll live. What does that do to you? The film answers that though, it's unacceptable, you'll deny it, seek something else, something more. It just cannot be that everything will be lost like tears in rain.<br/><br/>But human ambition is a much broader theme of this film. The world itself, in which Blade Runner takes place, is a statement about the human longing for progress and power, his forwardness and his backwardness. Some concepts seem ridiculous from nowadays perspective, but the overall atmosphere is right on the spot. And in this respect I have to say that the original cut has the better ending, because of the contrast, because of all the emotions that are awakened by that contrast, which does not appear cheesy, but rather estranged, a release into the completely unknown."

","I actually appreciated the audio best because, even in this new Blu-Ray era, one doesn't often find a film with very active surround speakers. However, this ""restored"" version did and the sound is, at the point, the best I've heard on a Blu-Ray disc....or any DVD, for that matter. The visuals? Well, fans of Blade Runner know all about them. They are fantastic. Scene-after-scene reminded me of a Stanley Kubrick film or another bizarre 1980s movie called ""Jacob's Ladder."" Because there are so many things to see and hear, and the story is different, one filled with strange characters, I can see where people would watch this film multiple times and enjoy it very much each time. The ""Collector's Edition"" has the best picture ever, according to director Ridley Scott, and ""is the version I'm most pleased with."" It has added scenes one didn't see in earlier versions. The rest of the DVD has those earlier versions. Apparently, there are several including those with Harrison Ford doing narration, like out of a late '40s film noir.<br/><br/>Speaking of the latter, that's what this film looked like: a combination film noir (or neo-noir) and sci-fi movie. It has many dark images, fantastic night-time scenes, wonderful closeups and an always-interesting color palette. Sci-fi films usually get dated in a hurry, thanks to ever-increasing special-effects progress in the movie industry, but this still looks very good. Despite being made over 25 years ago, Blade Runner still looks very much state-of-the-art."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>In the mid-seventies, I exchanged a few letters with Phil Dick, who had then dropped his obsession with parallel, valid visions and had developed a similar obsession with created realities. This concern maps well to the wave of film theory that was sweeping the film world, post-Kubrick. Its a sweet justice that this film from his book was sort of a milestone of that philosophy.<br/><br/>It concerns a narrator whose recollection of the events may be colored. Some may have happened, some may have been manufactured memories. Within the remembered story are people who fold memories, from the fellow who manufactures replicants, to he who makes `toys,' to the fellow who literally folds. This first use of noir in scifi underscores the matter: noir denotes a coloring of the world, an implied narrator (usually but not necessarily paranoid).<br/><br/>What makes this a watershed is that the studio bosses washed all that out of the theatrical release, making the narrator a trusted one by literally narrating. The film was a flop. With the director's reinstatement of the ambiguous truth, it has become a success. And who says the viewing public is too stupid to appreciate multilevel truths? Even people who think it is a simple story sense something deeper.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford as a person is completely clueless about the forces that created, surround and buffet him, so he is a natural for this role, probably his best. Joanna Cassidy (Zhora) is a redhead. Great films seem to have more than their share.<br/><br/>This camera is highly architectural. The state of the art with effects did not allow much camera movement, so all the perspectives are borrowed from Welles. So it doesn't innovate there, but the emulation is quite masterful. Where it does innovate is in the vision of an alternative (not future) world, but of course you knew that. However, it is worth noting how rare this is.<br/><br/>The combination of knotted truths, architectural camera, effective reinstatement of alternative worlds, and the confused projection of self are completely in line with what Dick intended (if not quite what he wrote). And it is enough to place this in the top three of my best science fiction films, and on my list of must viewing for students of visual thinking.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation: 4 of 4 -- Every visually literate person should experience this."

Not just in the special effects which are just mind-blowing but also in the cinematography, colours and sets. Another strong asset is the score, in fact Blade Runner is easily one of Vangelis's best by how mysterious and haunting it all is.<br/><br/>The story is just great. True, it is the sort of film you need to see more than once to understand/appreciate it, but that is not a flaw in any way, quite the contrary. The story is very compelling, and also very deep thematically. Blade Runner is further advantaged by memorable dialogue, superb direction by Scott and good pacing. I can understand why some are underwhelmed by the ending, I was at first, but the more I saw the film the more the ending made sense to me. Finally the performances. Harrison Ford is perfectly cast, and Sean Young supports him admirably, but the real star of the cast is Rutgar Hauer who is outstanding in his role.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a brilliant film and something Scott should be proud of. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

","Who knew a film named ""Blade Runner"", a movie with such high praise, could be so boring. TBH, I stopped paying attention halfway though, and surfed the web on my phone. Blade Runner's lone quality is it looks great. As with Alien, it does everything a sci-fi movie should do. Its dark, its detailed, and shows off the culture and technology.<br/><br/>Other than that? As an action film, its abysmally paced, with no special scenes or charismatic characters. As a ""deep, philosophical"" film...I don't buy it. You can't support your themes without strong characters. And Blade Runner's entire cast is uninteresting. It may have been intentional for them to be lifeless and robotic, but this movie didn't make me care about machines. Why even bother answering the questions this movie supposedly asks? ""Is genetic engineering ethical? What makes us human?"" Who cares? I don't care anymore after this film than I did before.<br/><br/>The noir romantic relationship had zero impact on me. Just as typical and shallow as any other relationship from the genre. But I suppose its okay, since Scott meant to do that. *eye rolls* Its another sci-fi classic that seems like it can get away with anything if its shot well and merely mentions its themes. I'm not going to give it a second chance."

","One of the best science fiction movies ever made, Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" has survived the passage of time thanks to Scott's impressive attention to detail and the strengths of Philip K. Dick's source material. Harrison Ford makes for a striking leading man here, managing to walk a fine line between confidence and vulnerability, and he's surrounded by a top-notch supporting cast, but none as effective as Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah and Joanna Cassidy as the Replicants: Hauer's performance is a peculiar stand-out here, while Hannah and Cassidy makes the most out of limited running time. The score is majestic and the special effects are jaw-dropping, and while the pace is slow, it's an extraordinarily effective classic. (Final Cut("

","I consider myself somewhat of a movie buff, and several of my friends had highly recommended this movie to me. So a few other friends of mine (who'd also never seen it) and I watched it one night, and we very nearly turned it off. It was not the movie we were expecting, and we were certainly not pleasantly surprised. It was marketed to us as an action film, yet the actual action sequences were few, far between, and frankly rather boring, especially in contrast with Harrison Ford's usual daring escapades. I generally enjoy think pieces, but this one was an exception. I found the plot to be a bit hard to follow, and nothing about it made me want to put in the effort or the second viewing needed to fully comprehend what was happening. For example, the nudity was completely gratuitous, and Harrison Ford gave, in my opinion, the weakest performance of any movie I've seen him in. I don't want to give away the ending, as it seems that most people love this movie, but I felt it was not a good resolution to the story, and that in particular a speech given by one of the characters was trite and not nearly as life-changing as it thought it was. (I've been told I missed the point, and I guess that must be true because I couldn't even find a point...) I personally would not recommend this movie to anyone, although it seems I'm in the minority, so watch it if you want. But don't say I didn't warn you..."

","""Blade Runner"" is one of the best science-fiction movies ever made. This movie shows that science-fiction stories have brains. It was directed by famous writer and director Ridley Scott. Starring legendary Harrison Ford and famous only in his native Holland Rutger Hauer. The main female role went Sean Young for who it was a debut in the full-length movie.<br/><br/>The film tells us the story of Rick Deckard(Harrison Ford) replicant(androids) hunter. Once he gets a task to stop a group of replicants who escaped from a colony. However, the group under the Roy Batty( Rutger Hauer) command is not going to give up. Pursuing a group, Deckard understands that he has strange feeling in relation to one replicant Rachael(Sean Young). This is the main question of the film whether people can feel something to the machines and if so, are they different from us.<br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" has a lot of positive moments. Firstly, the movie looks very spectacular. Special effects look realistic and the style is one of the best in cyberpunk stories. Also the film is notable for its excellent acting and wonderful musical accompaniment.The film has only one minus. It is a little tight but it does not spoil the impression

","Blade Runner is a prime example of how visionary and brilliant Ridley Scott can be when he tries. The film mixes extraordinary (well, for 1982) visual effects, great acting and a genuinely original and deep plot about what it means to be human.<br/><br/>The plot, on a base level, concerns the exploits of ""Blade Runner"" Deckard as he hunts down rogue Reploids; advanced human-like androids that have a four-year lifespan to compensate for their other advantages. The rogue group, lead by Roy Batty, is looking to extend their aforementioned lifespans. This is really only a simple interpretation. The film is really about what it means to be a human being, especially when the reploids seem to demonstrate more humanity than the humans.<br/><br/>Visually, the film looked in incredible in 1982, and still looks pretty good today. It's not just the backgrounds, but the incredible sets and mise en scene that truly bring the film to life in a way that makes it feel real. And as we approach 2019 (this review was written in Oct. 2018), the world of Blade Runner looks more and more eerily similar to our own.<br/><br/>The performances in the film are just incredible. Harrison Ford as a depressing, inhumane drunk may not exactly sell itself, especially considering the types of roles he was known for playing at that point in time (i.e. charming rogue). However, Ford proves beyond all reasonable doubt that he can play his part, giving a stellar performance that allowed him to break free of the Han Solo typecast. But the real star of the show is Rutger Hauer, who gives a Shakespearean performance as Roy Batty. <br/><br/>The soundtrack also deserves special mention for being varied and bizarre, and yet always managing to fit the scene perfectly. A deep, melancholy magnum opus, Blade Runner will surely be remembered as one of the greatest films ever made."

Dick's work is very hard to translate into a mainstream movie.<br/><br/>SPOILER AHEAD!!!<br/><br/>In the book, Rachel has sex with Deckard in order to prevent him from killing the other replicants. She does it as a job for Tyrell Corporation, in a sense. And Deckard ends up thinking that only child born humans are humans, man built androids are not. Dick answers one of his main question in this book: What is humanity? The movie gives the opposite answer. Rachel is human for Deckard, maybe more human than Bryant or Tyrell. This is Scott's sacrifice to the happy ending. Director's cut end is less happy (how ridiculous was this extended lifespan story?). My end to the movie would s ee Deckard kill Rachel while she's asleep. Some would say the actual end gives the movie more power by leading the audience to think Deckard is a replicant. How about a man who protects himself from mere sexual desire by killing a machine? Not a happy end, I know..."

I ended up eventually doing the same things in my line of business. At first not as fancy, then we just made leaps over what was fantasy in that movie. We are still working on the genetics aspect. My job takes me to places that amazing young people work on applications that seem unrealistic to me. Person specific medication is one. No longer needing to take medicine with side effects or too much of one chemical and too little of the other. Laser sharp medication is more like it. Based on your DNA and anything that makes you what you are chemically, a mixture of medication with exact doses of each ingredient will be produced and it will target the problem that you have. Instead of a shotgun approach. I am told that it's not there yet for mental health issues but it works on addiction. Mental health issues are another category in themselves. Probably 30 years from now one of these people told me. Maybe never she said. If it is so darn complicated I wonder if there is hope for the poor souls living every day of their lives with one for or another of anxiety. Like the characters in this movie. The poor replicas did not even have a say in their existence. No different than us really. But their lives came with an expiration date.

"FlorisV","9","7","11","3 November 2008"," One to re-watch over and over...
","How this film has been underrated when it came out (mediocre, dull etc)!<br/><br/>This is one of the very few films I like to re-watch from time to time. Ultimately this is not something I do for the story. Although I sometimes find new content here and there, things I missed the first time, the major reason to re-watch films like this is: <br/><br/>-the astounding visuals (watch it in High Definition and be amazed, factor 10); <br/><br/>-the music, I love Vangelis' unique soundtrack because he managed to make jazzy/bluesy synth music;<br/><br/>-the atmosphere. Sure, it's all been done before, the film noir routine, but here it engages without being too formulaic. <br/><br/>The philosophical themes are interesting too providing plenty of questions if you are interested. Mostly: what does it mean to be human? For instance, watch Rachel cry when she finds out she's not human after all. It evokes a form of pity, because, is she really that different from us? Isn't she worthy of a normal life? Aren't we all machines in a way, following the written routines in our own DNA code? Lack of empathy makes the replicants different from humans, but only for older models. And they get more human by the day. When they get too human they expire...the 4 year lifespan. But like any life form, they want survival. More even, to get the maximum out of the whole experience called life. Human after all?<br/><br/>If you're not interested in such questions, this is still a beautiful film for the unequaled visuals, music, atmosphere and acting.<br/><br/>I like the simple, original romantic ending, it's less ambiguous than the director's cut and I didn't mind the voice over at all. The director s cut has a completely different climax which is maybe less satisfying but stimulates much more thinking. Both versions endings are good and deserve recognition (particularly the original version has been bashed too much).<br/><br/>The film is also better than the book though some would disagree. The book fails in truly capturing the atmosphere of a future where most living things are mechanical because it's one of Dick's less efficient books with a very forgettable ending. As much as I like his tales, his ideas usually outshine his writing. The film has much more atmosphere and tension."

","Dear reader of this review, I feel sorry for you. Why? Because reading this means that you've probably seen this crap of the movie, and you're wondering what happened, how this tedious, ugly, pointless crap could possibly be so highly rated? As one other reviewer pointed out, to call this movie overrated is just not enough. This movie is supposed to be philosophical. What is the meaning of life, what is the point of death, why must I die? Well, there are hundreds of movies and books out there dealing with this subject, and every single one of them does a 1000 times better job at it than this movie. BTW, try reading the Bible and the Gospels for answers about life and death. Since other reviewers have pointed out the terribly slow pace of the movie (the only other movie that was this slow was first Star Trek movie ""the slow motion picture"" - don't watch that one, either), I will write about something else - the ugliness. First of all, the creators of this ""masterpiece"" have used the irritating clichÃ© of setting the entire film at night. It's always dark, in every single scene. Every single room is ugly. The makeup is ugly. The whole damn thing looks like a hell hole full of broken drug addicts, and the music contributes to the feeling. I felt mild nausea throughout the whole thing. There are a few visually interesting scenes of Los Angeles from above (at night, of course), but the most prominent thing in those scenes are gigantic videos (placed as advertisements on buildings) of Asian women swallowing pills. Maybe the best symbol, of how wrong the makers of this movie were about the future, were prominent advertisements for Atari and Pan Am. While they drive flying cars in 2019, they watch TV on old sets which look like from 1970s. It's just a terrible movie, overall."

The colors of the movie are not to my liking, but I understand this is a matter of choice. However, more and more as the movie goes, the main theme of the movie becomes a violence. For the first time when it had no sense whatsoever, was the meeting of the white hair android leader with the chief designer of that generation of androids, the Sebastian. The rebel android leader had no reason for killing Sebastian, even less the director had no reason to make that scene so gory. Even less reason for killing, had the same android to kill the 25 year old genetic engineer, who took home him and his female android partner. In a similar manner, although less gory, the android hunter Deckerd showed plain cruelty, when he effectively raped the female android Rachael, especially when she saved his life some time earlier.

The pacing is never more than a crawl, we are given no reason to care about the characters, and it has the worst quality a film can have: it bored me to tears.

"chaswe-28402","10","7","12","9 September 2017"," Miraculous masterpiece: great
","Several years ago I may have read the original story, but don't remember it; and it doesn't matter. The same bleakly powerful message probably pervades both book and picture. The fact is, we are all replicants. The bitter truth is, we have no purpose, except to reproduce ourselves. Whether our life-span last 4, 40 or 140 years, it is as purposeless and pointless as if we were androids. Which we are. It doesn't matter what we have seen or experienced. We will pass and be forgotten, like the rest. It has been noticed that this film contains no families, or children. The need for that traditional, outdated method of self-replication has been eliminated, and people are simply duplicated, in different models, with variations. Memories are routinely fed into replicants, to convince them that they have reality, however spurious. If there ever was a creator, he was definitely killed, for his presumption. There is no doubt that, like everyone else, Deckard is a replicant. The film is frighteningly and permanently effective, for anyone who thinks about it, in every way. It's an image of our actual lives, here and now.<br/><br/>Now that I've read the book, and watched ""Dangerous Days"", I learn that Tyrell, the supposed creator, was merely another replicant, which simply confirms what I already believed."

","Vangelis once said ""Music has to be in the moment, not overthought, never to be repeated"" He also said "" To try to make a hit is failure; To make something honest is a success"".<br/><br/>Both of these quotes fit Blade Runner perfectly. The making of Blade Runner was chaotic.The nature of the film changed several times before it even got made. Film staff and some cast dropped out. It nearly became a film noir with Dustin Hoffman as the lead. The two stars hated each other, and it was a box office flop when it first came out.<br/><br/>The problem with films these days is that they are made by a board room of number cruncher's. A films success is based on box office takings, rather than anything of substance and virtuous accountability.<br/><br/>Blade Runner has since made a profit. If it hadn't does that mean its a failure. NO.<br/><br/>I can't help but think that part of the reason it was an initial flop was due to the interference of executives in the original release. The Directors cut and Final cut were what the film should of been 35 years ago.<br/><br/>Phillip K Dick was a visionary. His books are not the easiest to turn into a film. I enjoyed Adjustment Bureau, yet just like Blade Runner originally, I hated the happy Hollywood ending. Im hoping for a darker directors cut where David and Elise future isn't to assured.<br/><br/>I may be slightly biased as Blade Runner is one of my favourite films, but for the Directors Cut and the Final Cut everything just works perfectly together, like a Jigsaw.<br/><br/>The tension between Harrison Ford and Sean Young is real, they hated each other. Vangelis was in his prime. The cinematography is stunning. Ridley Scott is one of the most influential directors going. I like that for the Final Cut, it was treated subtly. They didn't over do the CGI, Gloss and mastering.<br/><br/>The scene where Deckard 'Retires' Zhora leaves you battling your conscience. A woman was basically murdered in cold blood. Shot in the back as she was running away. All in slow motion with the beautiful ""Blade Runner Blues"" summing the scene up, shining a light on the cold nature of the killing.<br/><br/>When I saw the Directors cut, I was pleased that Ridley Scott was finally allowed to say a big Fu!! you to Hollywood. The daring nature that Deckard and Rachels fate is sealed. Living on borrowed time. As well as the ongoing questions. Is Deckard a Replicant ? Did Gaff let Rachel Live ? How long will they survive in the outside world ? Hollywood loves a happy ending. Ridely wasn't having that. As a director he is unapologetic. He hates the politics of Hollywood. He could finally discard the crap footage borrowed from the Shinning, in which we were expected to buy into the notion Rachel was different and built to survive, and they can live happily ever after.<br/><br/>The unicorn scene in the directors cut, flips the film over and is the nail in the coffin to lets all dance into the sunset.<br/><br/>The final sequence, when the elevator doors close on a forlorn Deckard and Rachel, and the thunderous baseline kicks in then all makes sense. What doesn't make sense is getting up the moment the film finishes and not staying to listen to Vangelis at his best.<br/><br/>On a picky critical note: Some might say Deckard is supposed to be detective, but hardly does any investigating. Blade Runner isn't a detective murder mystery film. This is a film about humanity, empathy, equality, compassion, ethics. All challenges we face today.<br/><br/>Is one life worth more than another ?"
"forbidden-1","10","7","12","22 December 2001"," Still a classic
","I first saw this movie on a rented Betamax video when I was about 8 or 9. It came across as a really sinister and bleak sci-fi movie at the time.  I enjoyed it as a young kid, but guess I didn't really understand fully the themes behind the movie. I saw the vastly superior and definitive Directors Cut many years later and I instantly rated it as one of the best movies ever.  And this is why:<br/><br/>To fully understand how good this movie is, you have to put it into the context of it's era.  When it was released it broke new ground and became what is still up to this day an unrivaled benchmark in sci-fi cinema.<br/><br/>It was the first film to depict with such lavish splendor the nightmarish vision of future Earth.  Set in post apocalyptic Los Angeles, the film tells the tale of Deckard (Harrison Ford), a semi retired cop who is persuaded back into his role of a Blade Runner (special units trained to identify and kill outlawed androids, or ""replicants"", who illegally return to Earth). His task is to hunt and destroy a band of off-world androids, led by Rutger Hauer, who fight their way back to Earth to confront their maker, the ingenious Tyrell, head of the monstrous Tyrell Corporation.<br/><br/>The film is dark and broody. The photography is exquisite throughout and Vangelis' musical score is a now a classic masterpiece in itself.  Director Ridley Scott's melancholy vision is so stylish and smooth that the film is able to emerse you into its chilling future world from the very first shot. Visually, this is one of the most gorgeous films I've seen.<br/><br/>Deckard's character is similar to that of a film noir private detective. He comes across as a somewhat washed up and helpless soul lost in the polluted rat race.  This film provides Rutger Hauer with his defining moment on film, a role I think he has failed to live up to since.  With his fellow replicants, he seeks answers that only his creator can provide - all replicants all built with a lifespan of only four years and they are determined that their fate can be altered.<br/><br/>The reason the film is so popular is that it asks so many probing questions which, in 20 years of movies since the film came out, have rarely been asked since.<br/><br/>The themes look at humanity and the meaning and life.  Should we really create ""people"" and choose their fate and mortality?  If we choose to play god then we must be answerable to those who we create.  Is there any real difference between life created naturally and that in a laboratory?  And so do we really now what we are?  Or why we are?  Or who created us?<br/><br/>The film is inspired by the Philip K Dick novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?""  Although this movie introduced me to reading countless Dick novels, I've deliberately resisted reading this one.  Consequently, I can't comment on how it compares although I know the book is substantially different in places.<br/><br/>The movie is quite slow paced, although ""smooth"" is a better word.  Die hard action fanatics might not like this film although sci-fi lovers will embrace it instantly.

","You can only be in awe of this seminal film.<br/><br/>Retro showings of the director's cut in the cinema gave me the wonderful opportunity to watch this film in this final cut on the giant screen for the first time. For some reason it brings out so much more to see. I'd watched it on video and DVD on my old home teles, but now for the real experience as the director always wanted.<br/><br/>Where should we begin. The inspirational look, the majestic synth music or the existential allegories. No short review can do this film justice. There's just so much to discuss and take from this film. There are no answers, but questions and thoughts.<br/><br/>I really recommend this to all. As a tour de force of cinema and sci-fi, it truly is peerless. Can't wait to watch it again."
"fred-83","10","6","10","7 December 2006"," Never been equalled
","Many have praised this one before me, so I will try to keep my comment brief. One of the few movies which still towers majestically over the majority of SF-movies produced before or since. I rate this, along with 2001 and Solaris, as masterpieces of cinema which take the medium to another level. Funny that there are three SF-movies on my top ten movies of all time. In this age of CGI, the environment created for this film has still never been equalled. It is not just the intense layering and detail, it is also the pace which we move through the environment that is just as important. Allowing us time to rest and contemplate the surroundings, along with the magnificent music, brings out so much more atmosphere and sense of place. The acting is interesting, mixing low-key realism with the highly theatrical style of Hauer and Turkel. Yet that mixing never feels out of place. Also, the important ingredient Ridley has in BR that has been lacking in some of his subsequent efforts, is a rich, multi-levelled story. The existential aspects, what is human, real versus artificial memories, the unanswered questions. Almost all movies I consider to be masterpieces have an unanswered question at the end and which brings me back for subsequent watchings. This is one of them. May it soon appear on a Special Ed. DVD with tons of extras."

","Director's cut rules! It's been 20 years since this movie was made, and by far, it is still one of the best films ever.

The wardrobe and architecture are a combination of the 1930's, 40's, 50's and beyond, which give it the timeless look that enables us to see the future. There is not one weak performance, and the casting was impeccable. The direction, the vision, the script, the soundtrack, art direction, and casting - all exemplary. <br/><br/>Other films have come after it, but this one set the bar so high it has yet to be surpassed.<br/><br/>A great short story, (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Phillip K.

","Ridley Scott is a legendary filmmaker, his body of work is exception. 'Blade Runner', which is now known to be a Cult Classic by many, in my opinion, is Scott's weakest effort. <br/><br/>'Blade Runner' is based on a epic battle between genetically engineered beings called replicants & and a semi-retired blade runner. It takes place in 2019, 9 years from now, well it seems like a boring future. Let's not forget the that 'Blade Runner' was a box office disaster when originally released. Some films are lucky to earn Cult Status, & this sci-fi flick is surely one of them. <br/><br/>Scott's direction is not up-to the mark, mainly because the script is filled with loose ends. Cinematography by Jordan Cronenweth is worth a mention, his work is great. In the acting department, Harrison Ford has always been a competent actor, and his performance here proves that fact yet again. Rutger Hauer is okay. Others are plain average.<br/><br/>All said n done from this writer, 'Blade Runner' is a overrated classic. A debacle, compared to it's hype. Thumbs Down!"

Ridley Scott, fresh off the success of Alien is in top form and Blade Runner will be the film he will always be remembered for. Harrison Ford is competent as Deckard and anyone expecting him to be the usual dashing hero will be disappointed. Rutger Hauer steals the show as head replicant Roy Batty.

"brianberta","6","5","8","2 May 2015"," A classic neo-noir and sci-fi film with great themes
","This is a slow moving sci-fi film but it has great themes. It's about a man in the police force who's hired to kill 4 murderous replicants. It's mostly slow-paced but its engaging climax and great production choices are what makes it such a masterpiece. Its themes require audience's to think rather than experience. The voice overs are unnecessary but later cuts are devoid of them. Ridley Scott has proved to be a visionary artist here by producing a bleak society where it's always dark and raining. Its climax serves as an iconic portrayal of ""man vs. machine"". Its climax is very moving and engaging and it's one of the more memorable scenes from the 80's. Then at the last shot, the movie pulls the rug out from under you. I liked the cinematography. It made the movie look bleak and it made the society look like it was dwindling. The acting was strong on all parts especially coming from Harrison Ford. Because of this movie's production choices, I can see why it's as famous as it is today. Unfortunately, it failed at the box office probably because it came out 2 weeks later than E.T. the Extra Terrestrial. But it has become a cult classic and today it's regarded as of the best sci-fi and neo-noir films."
"mattheddy","3","8","15","15 September 2019"," Painful to watch
","This movie is extremely slow! I could appreciate that if there was some great story telling going on. However it's not really clear what the hell is going on.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford is just walking around looking confused. Shoots a lady that I think was a robot, then he practically raped another robot after she saved his life. You see the antagonist only twice in the first hour of the film. He goes to his creator asking for more life since the replicates only live for 4 years, then he kills him. Seems counter productive to me. Ford's character has another run in with the other lady bot and that was honestly laughable. What the hell was that? Then the showdown with the main antagonist, again laughable. I really was expecting so much more from this film. But I find it really hard to watch.<br/><br/>I feel like everyone giving this movie high ratings is clinging to older styles of film making and trying to make this some philosophical masterpiece but I just don't see it. Then there are those saying this is so good because it doesn't use special effects and recent sci fi movies are full of bad cgi. There are plenty of sci-fi film's that have way better story lines and make you ponder life regardless of good or bad cgi. And how does a film not using cgi or special effects automatically make it a good film? This whole story is just blah. I'm really so confused why this has such a high rating. It's in my opinion very tough to watch. I feel like they could have done so much more with this film. Don't get me wrong it is visually appealing especially for being made in the early 80's but that's about the extent of the pros with this movie.<br/><br/>I'm watching this movie because I wanted some background before I watch Blade Runner 2049, I just hope the story telling and pacing are better than this one."
"mrtimlarabee","10","8","15","12 December 2007"," Excellent, no matter which version your watching
","I think I've owned 3 different versions of this film at one time and can finally 'retire' my old versions after being dished the final cut alongside the versions I grew up with.<br/><br/>To be fair, the first version I saw of this was on home video and included the now infamous voice overs and happy ending. I loved that version. Given, Harrison Ford's voice over sounds like he wasn't taking the ordeal too seriously, it unintentionally provided another layer for the movie.<br/><br/>One of the things that stood out in Ridley Scott's vision of the future was how America was more than a melting pot, it was a blur of images of past, present, future and a blur of culture and ethnicity. In a word, it was a blur of identity. The voice-over, love it or hate it, always gave an almost non-time feel to the movie, combining old fashioned detective film noir to a gloomy, messy future. Looking back, many of the narrations feel silly, but it still added an additional layer to the film.<br/><br/>Looking forward, the director's cut creates a different film. That idea of identity is further explored as the lack of narration makes Deckard's thoughts more ambiguous as his own identity is questioned. This version always created a sense of isolation and curiosity. Ridley Scott's vision seems more authentic.<br/><br/>I always loved the non-CGI visual effects of the film, which still hold up to this day (if you don't believe that, then do not wait for the 5 disc DVD - rush to a city showing it on the big screen). In the early 80s, sci fi films were popular and while many were experimenting with new technologies, a lot of Blade Runner is old fashioned models, which blow away ANY CGI (note to George Lucas, Robert Zemekis and all cgi aficionados everywhere). The sets were great - the muddled future, looking like a New York Nightmare.<br/><br/>But the simple story is what still stands out. Brushed off as a gloomy search and destroy pic in its original release, viewers now see the questions the film raises about humanity and identity, perhaps also raising eyebrows about how it all fits into science. The acting was always top notch, notably from Rutger Hauer who appears first as a classic villain but shows much more depth in his limited screen time. He's also got the best dialogue.<br/><br/>Whatever version you watch of Blade Runner, you're always in for a classic. The vision of this film is unprecedented and something about it remains fresh 25 years on. If you haven't seen it - watch it now. If you have, watch it again. There's always something new to discover about this classic."
"mattymatt4ever","7","8","15","2 July 2002"," One of those films that requires a second viewing
","When I saw this movie the first time, I found it boring, meandering, pointless and utterly lifeless.  This time around I paid closer attention to the film and it grew on me.  I was intrigued by the original--though somewhat slow-moving--storyline.  The sets are elaborate and beautifully constructed.  Yet the lighting is low-key and the atmosphere is filled with smoke, giving it that neo-noir touch.  So this is not your conventional science-fiction movie.  There are no spaceship battles or goofy robots. Harrison Ford is not playing Han Solo from the ""Star Wars"" movies; this is totally different.  The performances are good all-around.  But I will still say that the film does drag.  I would edit a portion out of almost every scene.  It's obvious that Ridley Scott didn't have the pacing in mind.  And what was with that friggin' soundtrack??  Did Kenny G do the score?  I know Scott was attempting to give it a noirish feel, but the score needed to be a tad more upbeat--I mean we're not sitting in a dentist's chair for God's sake!  <br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" is not a great film, in my opinion, but a good one and pretty well-done.  I liked the ending; it wasn't predictable.  I'm surprised at how high it ranked on the IMDB:  It's Number 74!  I know the film bombed at the box office and received unanimously bad reviews, so it must've received a major cult following.  I don't have enough enthusiasm to vote this as one of the best underrated films ever made, but it's worth a look.  And you didn't like it the first time around, it's worth another look. <br/><br/>

I could analyse it all night, but if I mentioned the music by Vangelis,the oriental music as the children ride through the streets on their bikes, the photo that Deckard looks at of Rachels family that suddenly comes alive and you hear the sound of laughter and better times, the moving speech by Roy as he declares Its Time to Die... , those lucky enough to see the film will now what I mean about its constant ability to generate a wide array of deep emotions."

As time goes on and movies evolve we tend to demand better quality.<br/><br/>Unlike Casablanca, Blade Runner has become shallower over the years. Still a good movie, its just no longer 'that good' of a movie.<br/><br/>In general I find that directors who leave open key themes in the plot deliver a more shallow product. Weaving the threads of each theme in a plot together to form a composite whole is what a voice over does.<br/><br/>Ultimately the play between good and evil for a cop/detective/centurion is a timeless story about individual response to evils of socially engineered injustice (intended or unintentional).<br/><br/>I would like to see a re-release of the movie with the original voice over.

It has perfectly flat, uninteresting characters who are handed inept or trifling exchanges. I don't know what you could even characterize as a climax or even a development (and I like me some dull movies). The movie traipses into editorializing ""Who's the greater danger?"" territory with the replicants not being especially evil by comparison. You don't see them gunning down a terrified woman in the streets like Deckard does. But really, any clarity or philosophical weight that a fan insists is in there, is projected into it by the viewer. It does equal or (can you believe it?) surpass some of the very best old, noir compositions; but we do see that giant billboard one or two times too many. Ignore the bare-bones story. Turn the volume off and enjoy the visuals.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott had no peer in the visualizing department in 1982, then he went on to less visual, more 'shaped' output after this (Thelma and Louise, Blackhawk Down...

","On first viewing of Blade Runner most people will be left confused and probably a little disappointed. Even thought the studio had there way to some extent (cutting part of Scotts original vision in order to increase profits) this was not a film made to appeal to a mass market audience. Anyone looking for a generic action film with an obvious conclusion will be disappointed. For these reasons it did fail commercially on its first release in 1982.<br/><br/>It could be best described as a film noir set in the future. Power hungry corporations harness control over a mixed race of neo-Tokyo lower-class citizens living in a decadent Los-Angeles slum. Enter Rick Decard a retired private eye who gets unwillingly hired to hunt down and eliminate a group of replicants who have escaped an off-world colony and arrived on earth to in order to extend their four year limited life span.<br/><br/>Based on the Philip K. Dick novel ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep"", there are many existential themes running throughout and many questions purposely left unanswered so the viewer can come to his own conclusion. What is the nature of our existence? What does it mean to be human? Do we fully appreciate life? Are but a few.<br/><br/>Everything about this film works. The cinematography is outstanding with every scene meticulously shot. The set and design are also stunning and still sets the standard for which every sci-fi film aspires too.<br/><br/>The actors are also cast perfectly. Harrison Ford plays Rick Decard a man troubled by the demons of the past with seemingly no escape from his violent reality. Rutgar Hauer is Roy Batty the replicant leader haunted by his mortality, unable to find a cure. The supporting cast also put in memorable performances. A special mention to the futuristic, synthetic score by Vangelis that draws the viewer deeper into Scotts dystopian view of the future. It gets better with repeat viewings in that you slowly uncover new insights into the character motivations and the heavy use of symbolism. Its a near flawless film and could entertain endless hours of discussion. Watch both the directors cut and voice over editions to fully appreciate this masterpiece."

","This masterpiece, is probably the finest Sci-Fi movie ever made, and i can't see a reason for it not to have a place in everyones collection.<br/><br/>The story, direction and cast are all perfect, and although i agree that the directors cut is better, i still believe that the original Harrison Ford voice over is pretty good, even if the end of that version was s**t.<br/><br/>I first saw the movie when i was about 15 years old, and it blew me away (and yes that was the original cut of the film). At that age without the voice over the film would have been too difficult to follow, so i do have my reasons for liking that version. I also think that the original cut of the movie probably has wider appeal.<br/><br/>My advice is this, see the original cut and if you like it watch the directors cut. If you jump straight into the directors cut, and don't give the movie your whole hearted attention, you will miss out on a masterpiece in cinematic history.<br/><br/>Original Cut 8/10 Directors Cut 10/10"
"JamesHitchcock","10","8","16","4 August 2011"," One of the most intelligent and profound science-fiction films of all time
","""Blade Runner"" is, together with the original version of ""Planet of the Apes"", my favourite science-fiction film. The two films ask diametrically opposed questions of fundamental philosophical importance. That posed by ""Planet of the Apes"" is ""What distinguishes humans from animals?""; that posed by ""Blade Runner"" is ""What distinguishes humans from machines?"" <br/><br/>The film is set in the year 2019. In 1982 that doubtless seemed a long way away, but in 2011 we can see it as yet another sci-fi film which greatly overestimated the speed of technological progress. Fortunately, the quality of science fiction movies is not always dependent on their ability to foretell the future. The central idea of the film is that science has perfected organic robots called replicants, virtually indistinguishable from adult humans, the one difference being that replicants (supposedly) lack emotions. Replicants may only be used for dangerous or menial work in outer space or on other planets; their use on Earth is forbidden. Nevertheless, replicants have been known to defy the ban and return to Earth, where they are hunted down and killed (or ""retired"" to use the official euphemism) by a special police squad known as ""Blade Runners"". <br/><br/>The main character is Rick Deckard, a Blade Runner assigned the task of ""retiring"" four returned replicants hiding in Los Angeles. In order to prevent them from developing human emotions, the life-span of replicants is limited to four years, and it is believed that these four have come to earth to force the Tyrell Corporation, which manufactured them, to extend their lives. Another important element in the plot is a romance between Deckard and Rachael, a beautiful young woman whom he later discovers to be a secret replicant. Unlike the other replicants we see in the film, Rachael is a more advanced model who believes herself to be human, having had artificial memories implanted into her mind. <br/><br/>Despite its science-fiction theme, ""Blade Runner"" can also be regarded as belonging to the neo-noir genre. Like other neo-noirs from this period, such as ""Chinatown"", ""Body Heat"" and ""Gorky Park"", it has a very distinctive visual style. The city we see is very futuristic, complete with towering buildings and flying cars, and yet for all its high-tech buildings, the Los Angeles of 2019 is a gloomy, rainswept city disfigured by litter, graffiti and poverty, a literal and metaphorical City of Dreadful Night. The atmosphere is reminiscent of 1940s noirs such as ""The Big Sleep"", also set in a dark, rainy Los Angeles, although it is said that director Ridley Scott also drew on his roots in the industrial North-East of England. Since 1982 this dark, moody look has become something of a clichÃ© in science-fiction, horror and superhero movies, but in its day it marked a radical alternative to the bright, gleaming ""Star Wars"" vision of the future. <br/><br/>Another typically noir element in the film is the character of Deckard, a disillusioned, world-weary detective of the type who, had the film been made thirty or forty years earlier, would undoubtedly have been played by Humphrey Bogart. Harrison Ford was already known to the public as Han Solo in ""Star Wars"" and Indiana Jones; ""Blade Runner"" was perhaps the film that first revealed him as an intelligent, thoughtful actor as well as an action hero. This, together with ""Witness"" and ""The Fugitive"", is probably his best performance. Sean Young is an actress who has largely disappeared from view in recent years, but in the eighties she was a rising star, and here she gives her one really memorable performance as Rachael, the woman who has to cope with the knowledge that everything she has hitherto believed about herself is a lie. Rachael's hairstyle is a deliberately old-fashioned one, possibly in order to suggest another link with forties film noir. (Sean is one of several female actors of her generation to be known by a male forename; another, Daryl Hannah, appears as one of the four escaped replicants). <br/><br/>The third great performance comes from Rutger Hauer as the replicant Roy. Hauer, who is Dutch, speaks English fluently, but with a slight foreign accent, and this is put to good use in the film to suggest a being almost identical to, and yet subtly different from, the human characters. (Rachael's rather formal speech has a similar effect). Roy is believed to be a dangerous, alien being, yet as the film progresses it becomes clear that he and his fellow replicants are fully human souls with their own personalities who have developed in full the emotions they were not supposed to share. <br/><br/>A key scene comes near the end, where Roy stretches out his hand to prevent Deckard from falling to his death. This scene called to mind Michelangelo's famous painting of God creating Adam, but reverses its meaning. Deckard is a member of the race which created Roy, and therefore a metaphorical ""god"", but here it is the created being who stretches out his hand to his creator and thereby confers the gift of life on him. In this moving scene we see that the replicants are every bit as capable as humans- if not more so- of experiencing the emotions of pity and compassion. <br/><br/>The film initially performed poorly at the box office, but later became recognised as a classic, especially after a ""director's cut"" was released in 1992. (I must admit that I never saw the original version that was released in cinemas; my comments are based upon the director's cut and the more recent ""final cut""). Scott is said to regard ""Blade Runner"" as his most complete and personal film; I would regard it as his finest. There is not enough space here to do justice to all its complexities and shades of meaning, but it must count as one of the best films of the eighties and one of the most intelligent and profound science-fiction films of all time. 10/10"
"juzzy_anderson","10","8","16","5 August 2006"," Do androids dream? I would hope so.
","I first saw this film when I was eight years old and the first thing I felt was that this film had depth. inhuman beings become more human than human over the course of the film and Rick Deckards black and white world turns to grey as he falls for one of the feared humanoid replicants. Can he find his own humanity? I love this film and was surprised to find that it was panned upon release by critics who were expecting action. Whats not to like it launched Rutger Hauers Career, Harrison Fords was on the rise and with this film under his belt he could go even further. The Noirish atmosphere paints a bleak yet hopeful picture for humanity down to the original releases Lead character's drawl as narration explains motivation and the times along with the femme fatal played by Sean Young and another played by Daryl Hannah this film is a a beautiful package of sights and character.<br/><br/>This film has stood the test of time and it's effects could easily be mistaken with what they achieve today digitally. The score by Vangelis is beautiful, powerful and unique and enchanting as we are drawn to the underbelly of Los Angeles in 2015. <br/><br/>The book is quite different with similar messages as the film both life assuring and there are entirely different scenarios which make for an interesting read. Phillip K Dick is a Sci Fi master. Both book and film are unique visions of the future. The special edition alludes to a different effect but I wont ruin that for you if you haven't seen it yet. I love the ending too which says a lot. This film is sensational. enjoy!"

"John_Titor_2036","10","7","14","15 May 2008"," More Human than Human ... that's Our Motto ...
","Careful ... contains a few spoilers ...<br/><br/>Having seen this movie probably more times and in more different formats than most people, I thought it was time I write a few words about this masterpiece of film-making. Truly, I wasn't boasting with my assertion that I've seen this movie as much as I have (I watch this movie almost once a week and have done so for almost 10 years). I own several, still unopened, VHS tapes that for a large part of the nineties I did my best at collecting. I own the Japanese Laserdisc version, a rare bootleg VHS version that was distributed over the internet a handful of years ago that has the narration selectively placed back into the Director's Cut version of the film, not called the Esper Version as some would want to label it, the Director's Cut and now the HD version of the Final Cut. That makes 5, but 6 if you count the Workprint version that comes with this box set. So, I would say that's one more than most.<br/><br/>Blade Runner first and foremost, is probably the greatest film ever made, from beginning to end and in all of its variations. A bold statement when the film doesn't even rank in the top 10 in the American Film Institute or on IMDb. Spots #97 and #104 respectively (ahem). But as these kind of lists are subjective and truly under the control of mere mortals and their own strange whims, and I take no offense that so many so-called aficionados have over-looked this film for so long. Roger Ebert slammed Ridley Scott and the film during the first theatrical release by stating that 'Scott cared more about the lush environment of the film than he did of the story', which as we all know - and even Ebert now, in hindsight, has stated that he was unkind and grossly unfair to both Scott and the film.<br/><br/>For years, Blade Runner was divided into two different camps, or rather four and they are: Those that preferred the narration and those that did not and the other camp was those that thought Deckard was a Replicant and those that thought he was either human or felt it was left ambiguous. Ridley Scott has very gracefully over the years, given homage to these thoughts and made many statements that most readers are aware of, chiefly - that Deckard was a Replicant. Unfortunately, due to the studios fingering with the film during post-production, Warner Brothers had the right to trim anything after the 120 min mark, and thus butchering the nuance of the film and leaving several things vague and forcing Scott to tack on the Happy ending and the narration - because as we all know ... we're all just too stupid to get it.<br/><br/>The new and most refreshing part of the new argument, evinced in the 210 (wow!) min documentary 'Dangerous Days' is that Scott gives equal time to those that enjoyed the film with the narration, with Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth / Hellboy) in the forefront, with his very candid telling of how Blade Runner changed his life and launched him down the road into film-making. We also get to hear a very lucid and warm retelling from Harrison Ford of the nightmare that he not only endured making the movie but the further commitment of having to do the Voice Over narration months later, which ended up having its own strange story as well.<br/><br/>So, now with 5 versions available in this box set, you get to see Blade Runner in every single angle imaginable and it is engrossing every time. Ebert also said in the Nineties that the re-release of the movie for the Director's Cut gives you yet another version of the film, but fails to handle the main problems that were so apparent the first time around. As the film has changed Ebert has gone from student flippancy to utmost respect and enjoyment. Ebert's own site has all three versions of his reviews which are interesting to read in context to the passage of time if you're interested.<br/><br/>There are so many layers to Blade Runner and so many things that can be said from the brilliant look of the newly restored cut, the awesome remixed sound, the Original Score by Vangelis, and the story itself. Blade Runner is probably the high water mark of all films and will probably stay that way for quite some time. Internet voting puts the film as the 4th greatest movie of all time, according to AFI's own user polls - so that really puts perspective on AFI's and IMDb's so-called Final Lists.<br/><br/>On a final note, when people watch this film, a lot of people come away with a strange feeling of familiarity regarding the content, the story and the character of Rick Deckard the protagonist, the Detective, the Blade Runner. You should know that Philip K. Dick was an incredibly huge fan of Raymond Chandler and absorbed every one of his stories on a personal level. Hampton Fancher, the screenwriter was privy to this when he penned the screenplay while making the adaptation for 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' and did his best to not only pay homage to this for Dick but for Chandler as well. Movies like 'The Big Sleep' really bring it home and make it evident to the viewer. The novel almost reads like the narration and in latter years I find impossible to not hear Harrison Ford's voice as I read 'The Big Sleep'.<br/><br/>""What do you think of my Owl, Mr. Deckard?""

"dbutler-5-608400","3","11","25","20 August 2014"," 5 minutes of SFX and a bad story
","A few points: 1. The fantastic visual effects we see occupy the film for the briefest of moments. They don't really factor into the story AT ALL, other than just as a reminder that indeed, this story takes place in the future. As one other person pointed out, the ENTIRE film takes place at night, and if it's technically daytime out, then every scene is suddenly indoors. You just never see the light of day. The initial title sequence and score is GREAT, but it's like it's all meant for some other storyline/film.<br/><br/>2. What kind of future is this? Outside of a few gadgets like the Void-Kampf machine (which might as well be a polygraph), and perhaps the darkening technology that we see in Mr. Tyrell's penthouse, the only other examples of advanced technology are the spinner cars, Deckard's gun (maybe), and the replicants themselves...which as far as I can tell and the movie relates, aren't really androids, but rather, test-tube humans grown in a lab with bioengineered short lifespans. Not exactly advanced robotics. Other than their physical strength (which seems misused as none of them seem to know anything about fighting, even Roy, and their strength really just doesn't feature in the story much other than them beating up on Deckard a few times), they might as well BE humans. Honestly the plot makes more sense if they weren't replicants in the robotic sense, but the bioengineered test-tube humans I've suggested. This is all the more apparent by Roy's discussion with Tyrell over extended his lifespan, when all that they discuss are cell structures and virus chain molecules, etc, etc...clearly suggesting that the 'replicants' are simply test-tube humans. Another thing I didn't get is the fact that the replicants bleed like any other human when injured, so again, not exactly robots. And, why does a combat-model replicant experience extreme pain when driving a nail into his hand, but not when he gets hit in the head with a crowbar, or when he drives his head through a wall? It's like the story only fits whatever it's trying to accomplish per scene.....<br/><br/>Continuing on with the 'future' thing, Why is virtually everything so utterly retro? Contemporary technology (ceiling fans, TV sets, radios, late model cars, etc) can be seen all throughout the film, giving you the idea that this 'future' is really just an alternate reality set in current day (for 1982). No attempts are really made to depict giant viewscreens, small devices that were if anything, predicted even in the 80's... Other than the brief visual FX we see (point#1), they should well have just set this story in today's world. There's really no reason anything that we see in the movie couldn't well have taken place today. The film completely wastes its futuristic setting.<br/><br/>3. The suggestions that Deckard is a replicant are stupid. The movie goes out of its way to depict Roy and Rachael's persons as the pinnacle of replicant technology, but Deckard is just as weak as any other human. The question has to be asked WHY would you even create a replicant as frail as a normal human if indeed his job was to hunt other replicants who can hand him his own arse in a fight? It would make more sense that ROY was a Blade Runner. Additionally, if anyone is going to know what Deckard is, it's Tyrell, and yet he interacts with Deckard in a standard way, and even the other replicants treat Deckard as they would a human. I also didn't observe anything Deckard's character does in the film as 'good', in that he displays no apparent skills at tracking down replicants that any other cop wouldn't have. His chief calls him in out of semi-retirement saying he wants the old magic, but other than getting himself beat up half the time and being super-lucky the other, I don't get it.<br/><br/>4. It seems kinda stupid that if these replicants are prone to escaping (indeed, they have cops specifically tasked with tracking them down), then it would make sense maybe to have some sort of remote control switchoff device or something? It's like, hey, this is the far future where mankind is apparently out exploring other planets outside our solar system, but we can't keep a handle on the numbered and created replicants? If they're gonna design them with limited lifespans, why not a kill switch or something else? Ack, makes no sense.<br/><br/>5. About the only thing that makes any real sense in this story is Rachael discovering that she's not actually human. They could have done something with that. Perhaps make an entire story centered around her character learning this tidbit, then her trying to extend her life after going through all the emotional trauma, and then being hunted down by a blade runner. It would accomplish everything this movie was trying to tell, but failed at.<br/><br/>6. Indeed, there's really no explanation why the replicants themselves are so utterly violent and psychopathic. This isn't in their programming. Leon is an ammunition loader programmed to take orders and designed for his strength, Pris is a pleasure model. Only Roy and Zora are combat oriented, yet as such, they would likely be level-headed and cautious. It's kinda odd that all of them so easily transcend their 'programming' and pretty much go around killing everyone they encounter. Instead of killing Tyrell, the best outcome I could have seen for Roy upon learning that he can't extend his life is to maybe just enjoy his remaining days, or the scene end with him sobbing uncontrollably like a child, and maybe for Tyrell to take pity on him and turn him off some other way, or maybe to show him that via other models, Roy's memories might live on in a way. Something...jeez."

","Goodness! 'Blade Runner' (1982) scores 8.2/10 out of over 600,000 IMDb-users.
When that movie appeared, I was just finishing school and loved Ridley Scotts 'Alien' (1979), one of the greatest SF-movies ever made. Like so many others, I was eager to see Scott's next strike, but the disappointment was all over the place - most who went to see it uttered explicit warnings. It was perceived as extremely boring, with a thin narrative plot stretched to the limits, so that the entire movie seems to be in slow motion. No thrill at all, no tension. The only appreciated point was its dystopic, sinister style, making this a showcase for style-over-substance-movies, which it still is today.
But part of the community apparently loves this style and gets fascinated with the dark expression of the movie's content, irrespective of how thin and stretched it may be. While these people dominate internet platforms and movie magazines, they still make only a tiny fraction of the audience out there. Public numbers indicate that about 83 million people paid to see 'Alien' but only about 8 million came to 'Blade Runner' in 1982. Yet, 'Blade Runner' was the long expected successor, meaning that over 70 million potential cinema-visitors stayed away because most of those watching 'Blade Runner' where disappointed, which spread by word of mouth. Without 'Alien', 'Blade Runner' would have probably even gone unnoticed.
The number of this audience is two orders of magitude higher than the users voting 'Blade Runner' to a top-rated legendary classic. Therefore, in reality, the audience has voted this movie (by simply ignoring it) as one of the most overrated bores in SF-history."

"gftbiloxi","8","5","9","1 August 2005"," A Triumph of Style of Substance
","To say BLADE RUNNER is an incredible looking film is a gross understatement.<br/><br/>The art direction--whether costume, scenic design, or special effects--is simply stunning, creating an extremely dark, sometimes beautiful, but always fascinating vision of a future Los Angeles that has begun to collapse into grotesque decay. Hardcore science fiction fans will instantly recognize that the city's spectacular highrises reference Fritz Lang's silent METROPOLIS; art history buffs should notice a distinct Frank Lloyd Wright tinge to some of the set designs; costume designs are clearly intended to evoke the spirit of 1940s film noir. The resulting melange is simply extraordinary, very powerful, and incredibly atmospheric.<br/><br/>The cast gives able, stylish performances in keeping with the film's dark but glossy tone, but the script they play is a very muddy one. The story concerns a special agent (Harrison) who is assigned the task of locating and ""retiring"" (i.e. killing) a handful of violent androids who have illegally landed on earth. While I greatly admire the film's decidedly ""open-ended"" conclusion, I do not greatly admire the on-going vagueness that besets the storyline as a whole.<br/><br/>We are persistently asked to ask believe that Harrison Ford locates his quarry via the vaguest information imaginable; moreover, although specifically described as a highly experienced and formidable agent, Ford's character gives little evidence of it: he's always being bashed around to the point of death and then overcoming his opponent more through dumb luck than superior skill. Most annoying of all, the film flirts with issues concerning creation of artificial life without actually amplifying any of them in a consistently engaging way.<br/><br/>In spite of these failings, the performances and most particularly the incredibly compelling make BLADE RUNNER a fantastic triumph of style over substance. It is extremely enjoyable, and it is easy to understand how the film has drawn so many enthusiastic fans.<br/><br/>The DVD presently available is a ""director's cut"" version and offers both widescreen and modified-for-television formats. The former is recommended, for the latter undercuts the visual fascination of the film. The picture quality of the widescreen format is superior; the sound is good but not exceptional.

","I'm not sure how this movie got good reviews, or how anybody likes this. This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>This is supposed to take place far in the future, where people can make clone robots, and live on other planets, and have flying cars, in....2019.... I think they missed the mark a bit there. Everything looks remarkably like the 1980s, except for the flying cars. There are no special effects, no fancy computers, not even cell phones. Everyone has the 80s hair styles. Without the flying cars, I would have assumed this took place in the 70s or 80s. But...you can't fault someone for not knowing the future.<br/><br/>If they didn't explain the story line with text in the first 30 seconds of the movie, there would be no coherent plot to this movie. An ex-cop gets forced into hunting down 5 robots that escaped from their planet and killed a bunch of people on their way to earth. These robots have a 4-year lifespan. Here's where the movie gets ridiculous. What they didn't tell you is that all of these clones were on about 3 years and 364 days, and they were just about to die anyway, making the entire premise pointless. Nothing about this movie makes sense and the acting/dialogue is beyond horrible.<br/><br/>If this cop is their last hope, the world is screwed. This is the most useless cop ever. He falls in love with his first target after asking her questions for 15 minutes. His second target is stripper with a snake? Seriously, she escaped her planet and killed 20 people to become a stripper? When he confronts her, she almost kills him, and then inexplicably decides to put on a see-through puffy rain poncho and run away. His third target is about to kill him and he gets saved by the robot he fell in love with. His fourth target is about to kill him, but instead decides to pick his nose, and then do gymnastics. Then he shoots her while she's doing flips. His fifth target is again about to kill him, but he instead decides to go hand him his gun back, go kiss a dead robot, and pet a dove. Instead of killing him while he was doing this, the main character drops his gun and decides to climb to the roof? Then the robot saves the main character from dying and his time runs out and he dies on his own. And that's pretty much the end of the movie. I want those 2 hours of my life back."

The movie brings up the classic concept of ""what does it mean to be human,"" but then never really creates any interesting twists or plot development based on this. I doubt even back in '82 the concept of dealing with artificial life was 'that' novel. I've seen old Star Treks that dealt with the issue. Strip out all the dark lighting, rain, and slum shots and what do you have? - a boring movie. It got so old afer a while seeing the flying police cars over rainy slums. Then inside buildings rays of light kept flashing in as if from search lights. Everything seemed so artificial and it was as if the director was just wasting my time."

","I just don't understand how this movie has such a high rating (8.3).<br/><br/>I've read several of the reviews posted on this site to try and understand what makes this movie so great. Most people who give this movie a good rating all say the same thing. The movie makes you think on some deep philosophical questions. This is quoted from a review by joelhoff. ""Among the themes explored are the following: - The dehumanization of people through a society shaped by technological and capitalistic excess. - The roles of creator and creation, their mutual enslavement, and their role reversal, i.e., the creation's triumph over its creator. - The nature of humanity itself: emotions, memory, purpose, desire, cruelty, technological mastery of environment and universe, mortality, death, and more. - Personal identity and self-awareness. - The meaning of existence."" I think that every bit of that is BS. Technological and capitalistic excess would also be said of us right now by people who lived 50 years ago. Not all technological advances are considered excess. The roles of creator and creation and their role reversal. There is no role reversal. The replicants died. They didn't triumph. A triumph for the replicants would have been a normal life span, which is why the sought out their creator. The nature of humanity is not emotion, memory, purpose, blah blah. If you look through a few history books you'll see the nature of humanity is about power. The most powerful live and and the weak die. I'm sure most will consider this a very cynical viewpoint but do you honestly believe that the powerful care about your emotions. The meaning of existence is death.<br/><br/>The only thing that made me stop and think was when Deckard went from calling Rachael an ""it"" to asking her if she loved him. His character went from believing her to be worthless tool to wanting to protect her. But then again, the movie did not show any relationship development between the two, so that was completely unexpected and a bit insincere.<br/><br/>I don't believe this to be a great sci fi movie. At best it is average and at worst useless."

","It must be quietly disconcerting for Ridley Scott that he directed his greatest film in the early 80's with the knowledge that try as he does, he will always find it difficult to improve upon. I watched this masterpiece of a film first time out and loved it from the start - in fact, it's not only my favourite sci-fi film but one of my favourites of all time. <br/><br/>Whilst everyone is entitled to an opinion, I do find it laughable that some members of the IMDb community can give this classic a 1 star rating. Many conclude that the film does not live up to the expectations of the book. This of course is a nonsensical argument – the mental images derived from a book cannot be realistically compared to the reality of pictures on the silver screen. Everybody's interpretation is different. In other cases, the deep meaning and natural intelligence of Bladerunner appear to be too much for some. May I suggest these people look under the sections for Steve Seagal and Chuck Norris!<br/><br/>These inane comments cannot detract from what is a groundbreaking piece of cinema. In a post apocalyptic Los Angeles where acid rain drenches the city from the gloomy sky above and people who can afford it search for the salvation of off world colonies, we enter the world of the Bladerunner – a specialist law enforcer tasked with the termination of human replicants who have turned 'rogue'.<br/><br/>Not an easy task when considering that the human clones in question are difficult to distinguish from the real article. And in Rick Deckard's case (Harrison Ford), the task is to prove all the more difficult as the 'skinjobs' in question start to develop their own feelings and emotions for the first time.<br/><br/>Bladerunner is a landmark film because unlike many sci-fi epics, it has stood the test of time. Made only 5 years after the original Star Wars film, the movie has aged incredibly well and looks as fresh and modern now as it did in 1982. More remarkably the film was made before the onset of computer aided graphics, which provides a fitting testament to how well this film is made. Star Wars: A New Hope looks dated – Bladerunner does not.<br/><br/>The bleakness of the sets, the quirky dialogue and even quirkier film score by Vangellis, all add together to make a first rate sci-fi thriller which gets better the more times you watch it. Rutger Hauer provides the stand out performance as Roy Batty, the leader of the malfunctioning group, who is a ruthless killer by trade but famously shows compassion for the first time just before he dies as his emotions evolve.<br/><br/>The film delves into a number of thought provoking topics including one which has troubled humanity since the beginning of time – how long have we got? Do you want to know or would you rather not? And in our world where genetic modification is raising questions in the medical sector, Bladerunner also poses this same question but some 20 years earlier. Regardless of whether you watch the original or Directors Cut version, this movie stands out as filmmaking of the highest calibre with a realism that everyone can identify with. Watch it in BlueRay for the experience this film deserves.<br/><br/>Time to Die? In Bladerunner's case I think not. It'll still look good in 2111."
"Tweekums","10","6","12","18 October 2009"," Classic sci-fi
","When I first watched Blade Runner I wasn't impressed finding it overly dark and to be honest a bit boring, for some reason I decided to give it a second go and had a Damascene conversion realising that far from being boring this film was a sci-fi masterpiece. From the opening moments with haunting music by Vangelis playing as we a dark and sinister vision of a future Los Angeles till its ending which I won't spoil here the story is beautifully presented with great pre-CGI special effects.<br/><br/>As I'm sure everybody knows there are several versions of the film, my comments are based on the original UK release. This is a prime example of neo-noir cinema with its consistently dark setting, lots of smoking and Harrison Ford's world-weary voice over. Ford plays Deckard, a Blade Runner who's job is to hunt down artificial people known as replicants who used as off world slave labour but aren't permitted on Earth. A group of them have returned and are trying to find their creator. Initially we don't know why they have returned but soon learn that they were built to last only four years and as their time is running out they seek a way to fix themselves.<br/><br/>In his pursuit of them he is sent to see the head of the Tyrell corporation, who had designed the replicants. Here Deckard is introduced to Tyrell's assistant Rachael who unbeknownst to her is also a replicant who has been implanted with false memories. When she learns what she is she seeks Deckard again to discover what he knows.<br/><br/>When the film starts we know that Deckard is clearly the hero of the film and the replicants, lead by Roy Batty played by Rutger Hauer are the villains but as the film progresses that idea becomes less certain. After all all they want is a life that isn't artificially shortened.<br/><br/>The acting from Ford and Sean Young, as Rachael is very good but it is Rutger Hauer who steals the show as the enigmatic Batty, his finally speech is one of the great film speeches. I'd recommend this to all fans of science fiction, especially for people who like them set in a dystopian future. If you've watched it before and weren't impressed try it again, perhaps watching one of the alternate versions."

","To be honest I don't know where to start. So many reviews have already been written probably containing what I have in mind myself. Another thing is that I have watched this movie (the original from 1982 that is) so many times and thought so much about it that it is difficult to state exactly what my opinion is. Having said that it is still one of my all time favorites. I give this 10/10 which I don't do very often, but this one deserves it.<br/><br/>""(Batty) I have seen things you people wouldn't believe. I have seen tank ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion, I have watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost, like tears in rain. Time to die"". - (Deckard) ""I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than ever. Not just his life. Anybodys life. My life."" And then the Vangelis score. Truly a great moment in cinema history. Batty, who holds Deckards life in his hands chooses to save his life. Deckard who has hunted all the other replicants down, including Pris, is spared. Batty hereby shows us that he has developed one of the most defining characteristica of human beings; the ability to forgive. He shows us here that maybe he is ""more human, than human"" as stated by the Tyrell Corporation.<br/><br/>I really think that it is easier to give a review if you are critical of what you have seen. Here in this movie every little detail seem to come together to create a masterpiece. Even a guy like JF Sebastian who plays a very small part in the movie gives a very disturbing appearance as the lonesome scientist with his aging disease and his little robots around him to greet him when he comes home in order to comfort him. How sad. Pris, as the replicant who has started to develop feelings towards Batty, the other replicant; probably the most hopeless love ever seen. They simply don't have a chance to fulfill that love at any level. Rachael, who is beginning to grasp that she is a replicant (""how can they not know what they are"" (Deckard)) The ""I only do eyes"" guy (Hannibal Chew) who feels some sort of pride when confronted by Batty ""You are a nexus six right? I made your eyes"". And what does that smile mean that Batty sends him (if only you could see what I have seen with your eyes)? Every performance is memorable. The atmosphere is permeated by pessimism, estrangement and a sense of utter hopelessness. Ford of course plays his role with incredible depth. He is forced into this assignment, and he really plays Deckard as a man (or replicant) who has given up on himself and society. He does it because he doesn't really have a choice. He hunts the replicants down but without any pride or feeling of doing the right thing.<br/><br/>Batty finally gets to confront Tyrell and gives him the ""kiss of death"". The anger behind this act has to do with the imposed misery of the replicants since they are given human thoughts and feelings but not the chance to live a life that makes it possible to reach any existential goals they might have. Tyrell is trying to make Batty accept this when he says to him: ""the flame that burns twice as bright burns half as long"" but Batty doesn't want a life that is half as long since it makes it impossible for him to reach self-actualization.<br/><br/>We have seen the same kind of theme in Mary Shelleys ""Frankenstein"" where ""the monster"", because it only meets hostility and mistrust, at last becomes a true monster.<br/><br/>This theme is still very much science-fiction but who knows if we some day will be able to create artificial life. If so we will need to answer those moral dilemmas that exists in doing so and it can be argued that ""Blade Runner"" tries to give us one version of how this can unfold.<br/><br/>Regards Simon<br/><br/>Ps. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review. If not consider the possibility of a lobbyist. If you agree consider putting this post scriptum at the bottom at your own reviews."

I simply cannot understand why this movie is given such praise, it's just not a good movie. Outside of being visually ahead of it's time, it's a huge FAIL."
"senor_spielbergo123","Null","4","7","21 April 2017"," Great atmosphere, visually groundbreaking, little plot, very slow
","The movie setting reminds me of a crossover between a monster flick and a futuristic film noir. The world of Blade Runner looks incredibly atmospheric and it's totally convincing: Dark, lived in, gritty, dirty, mysterious, hostile. I wish modern movies would be more like this - not CGI built worlds that feel sterile and are forgettable! <br/><br/>The two weaknesses of this movie are the slow pacing and Ford's performance. I'll elaborate in a second. Even if you consider it to be a thriller, the few action scenes only drive the movie slowly and tension is not built up as focused as in Scott's Alien. The movie takes almost 2 hours but we learn almost nothing about the characters. Some might argue this is OK since the replicants don't have the past like humans and also miserable Deckard (even if you don't subscribe to Scott's claim that he was intended to be a replicant) lacks a bit of humanity.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that your viewing experience might suffer from picking a ""bad"" version of the movie. There seems to be a consensus that the Final Cut is probably the best choice. On paper the voice-over of Harrison Ford might have been a good idea as it could clear some confusions of viewers and also it gives the movie another film noir touch. But allegedly Ford disagreed and tried to intentionally sabotage the decision with a horrible voice-over performance. Apart from that Harrison Ford is not bad in this movie but not great either. The smirky Han Solo face he sometimes puts on is a bit misplaced for Deckard's character. And of course, Rutger Hauer steals the show!"
"d_vamp","1","23","65","1 July 2000"," highly overrated
","This film is a so-called cult sci-fi hit from Alien, and more recently Gladiator, director Ridley Scott.  Unlike those two films, this one is terrible.  Harrison Ford is basically playing a variation of his Han Solo character from Star Wars.  I went out and rented it on DVD to see what all the fuss was about, and all I can say is that it is highly overrated.  I must say though, it is quite visually impressive for being made before the era of computer animation.  It is also dated by today's standards, despite what people say.  The plot is without a soul.  The visuals are the only thing that kept me interested.  The ending was a surprise.  That was different...  Anyhow, I couldn't wait for the film to end.  When that happens, it usually means that the movie does not deserve to be in the top 250."
"ciaspeedy","2","7","15","19 July 2018"," WOW, that was.... bad
","I basically just made an account so I can review this:
OK I'm willing to accept that maybe back in the day it was an OK movie, but if somebody would recommend me this as a good sci-fi cyberpunk (also it apperently tries to be a Noir?) movie today, I would have to punch him in a face. I'm sorry, the characters lacks... well characters. Over 50% of a time you are watching a silent movie and when they speak the sound is so badly captured I have to rewind just to check what they said. (not all the time I admit but it's still bad) Come to think of even camera job is sometimes sloppy and the pacing is sluggish at best (I'm watching a dude climbing stairs for a two minute realizing that if somebody cut that out, no one would miss a thing, but that's just nitpicking) The onl reason why I didn't gave it a 1 star is that Rutger Hauer is actually trying his best to do with the little he was given and he was the only thing I enjoyed in this movie and he was barely in it. Also that in the end it turns out that he was actually kinda the good guy and Harrison Ford's character the bad guy. But reading all the nonsense about the philosophical questions it raised about ""being human"" seems pretty far-fetched. The only question it raised in my mind is: ""Why do people like this movie?"" But for those who thinks that way, at least you can enjoy telling yourself how primitive I am for not ""getting it"". ;)"
"AaronCapenBanner","5","8","18","1 December 2013"," Replicants
","Ridley Scott directed this adaptation of the Philip K. Dick story that stars Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard, a retired replicant(enhanced human clones used on colony worlds with limited lifespans but unstable personalities) hunter called back into service to locate and destroy a group of replicants that have returned to Earth to kill their creator. The worst of them is Roy Batty(played by Rutger Hauer) who becomes Deckard's chief opponent. Though visually striking and quite imaginative, what is sorely lacking is a compelling story with relatable characters, since this film is otherwise cold and uninvolving. Still, the acting is fine, and it has become a huge cult favorite, but though I have repeatedly tried, I just can't get into it."
"Masoo","7","10","24","18 April 2002"," I Don't Like It; I Watch It Anyway
","I've seen Blade Runner many, many times. It may hold the record for Most Times I Have Seen a Movie I Don't Actually Like. Like most people, I admire the look of the film. I don't know that I appreciate the look as much as others; while I admit it was very influential on the look of subsequent movies, its style-over-substance nature has also been influential, and I don't think that's a good thing. And, again like most people, I am intrigued by the subject matter (what is human?).<br/><br/>That's about it for the things I like. As for what I don't like, well, first off, I'm one of those Philip K. Dick fans. There is a lot more going on in the book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? than shows up in the movie (and yes, I know that's the standard complaint of book lovers, but it's true here). The most important missing element in the movie is ""Mercerism,"" a semi-religion that is v.important in the book's philosophy. In any event, I don't think Blade Runner does a good job of getting at much essential Dickworld. For me, the best example of that world on film remains the scene in Total Recall when the bad guys try to convince Arnold in the hotel room that he is actually sitting back home in a chair enjoying a virtual, rather than real, experience.<br/><br/>As for the non-Dickian aspects of the movie, well, if you've heard from the legions of Blade Runner fans what a classic it is, you'll likely be surprised on first viewing to find out that it's kinda boring. Apparently to help make the point that the emotional lives of humans and replicants are too similar to tell apart, director Ridley Scott instructs the actors playing humans (or supposed humans) to underplay, to make them seem more mechanical, then lets King of the Replicants Rutger Hauer overact oddly, as if he was a leftover from Kubrick's Clockwork Orange (another so-called classic with crappy acting from everyone not named Malcolm McDowell). I guess Hauer's bogus emoting is supposed to make him seem more human than the humans, but this is only true if humans are scenery-chewers.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it's hard to care about any of the characters in the film. I suppose that could be one of the ""points"" it's trying to make; I suspect it's more what happens when you cast dull-as-nails Sean Young in a leading role. Again, I'm aware that this distancing-from-humanity feel could be on purpose. That doesn't make it any more enjoyable. The movie gets everything right except the people. As usual, Pauline Kael hit it on the head: ""It hasn't been thought out in human terms. If anybody comes around with a test to detect humanoids, maybe Ridley Scott and his associates should hide."""

","I have seen both the original cut and the final cut on the big screen. The first Blade Runner left me feeling elated, entertained and full of inspiration. This tired retread left me feeling disgusted and flat.<br/><br/>Why disgusted? In the first Blade Runner we witness the snapping of an important man's neck. The one scene in the whole movie that I could have done without, but it didn't ruin the movie for me! At least it was an instant death. This time in the film, for some godforsaken reason, the director had the replicant's kill by pushing people's eyeballs into their brains. It's horrifically shown once and implied twice. Now what possibly does that add to the movie? Is society becoming so sick that Hollywood thinks that's entertainment? Are we so desensitized that gruesome violence no longer revolts? All it did was turn the bad guys (replicants) into monsters. One is left without an once of sympathy for them unlike in the original Blade Runner.<br/><br/>Why flat? Well the speech at the end of the film by the dying replicant leader now rings quite hollow. Who gives a hoot what wonders he's seen. Just hurry up and die so you don't kill anymore decent people. While those replicant designers were short sighted and a certainly terribly naive, does that warrant a death sentence? The replicants are like spoiled children: If I don't get my way, I'm gonna throw a tantrum! In this case if you don't ""fix me"" I'm gonna push your eyeballs back into your brain! The other reason it left me flat was the ""boy meets girl ending"" is so trite! At least the original Blade Runner had what I would consider a passionate ending by a being that does not torture its victims. <br/><br/>Too bad Hollywood doesn't pay its writers better, instead of forcing them to go on strike.

","Rating-5/10<br/><br/>Blade Runner is a movie starring Harrison Ford set in a future full of crazy robots and Rutger Hauer. Many consider this a cult classic but in my opinion I didn't like it just as much as some seem to do as at times it can seem very slow and very strange and almost like it wasn't made by a legendary director such as Ridley Scott. Its a film you have to see to understand and neo noir sci-fi mixes together to create a film that I just didn't enjoy and found it below par.<br/><br/>Now I cannot doubt Harrison Ford here as he really does nothing wrong to damage the piece but he also never pushes hard on the pedal and ends up seeming confused for large parts of the movie. Overall the acting is never bad but with such strange lines and parts where acting well goes out the window, I couldn't help feel bad even though no one here does a bad job necessarily. As I mentioned on the script, for me it is one of if not the worst thing about this film, lines just not good and many don't make much sense.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott doesn't direct badly but the ideas aren't there to be able to move the scene along well. At times it can almost seem as if the plot is going a little too slow and not a lot happens, now some people claim this to be good because it's Sci-fi without action but even if, it isn't entertaining to see constant shots of the skyline and effects. One point in the technical department is that the cinematography is beautiful and for me is a strong showing from Jordan Croneweth who seems to be able to at least bring a little more excitement to the movie.<br/><br/>On the point of Rutger Hauer, he is a good villain no doubt with sinister stares and some striking blonde hair, he really stands out in an otherwise tame cast. One point in this I truly likes is the ending, not to give anything away but it brings the movie to life and is easily the best bit and most exciting. This is the kind of movie you really have to watch and not do anything else, if you blink you may miss something and understanding what every person says in this is key to how the plot plays out and why it is that way in the first place.<br/><br/>If your looking for big effects you get them but then if you expect large action scenes, shoot outs galore and all the Sci-Fi things that are considered the norm, then you will be sorely disappointed. This is truly a crime thriller but not an action and although things do happen at times, it is up to you whether you want more action or it is just right. The movie seems to create a dystopian vision of the future earth in which man has made a mistake and has to deal with it, one thing about the future that is kind of neat is the way in which languages are combined and evolved and society seems to not only dress and sound different, but just act completely different too.<br/><br/>Overall I felt this was firmly an under average movie and although not quite poor, still for me just doesn't work. I think there are fans out there that proclaim anyone who doesn't like this a stupid person but I think in the case of Blade Runner it not only comes down to personal preference, but also how well you decide to understand and study the movie. This isn't all bad and I think I'm in the minority who dislike it, watch it and give it a go, and try to see the directors cut, I think most fans agree that's the way to go."

If I lived in such a place I would draw my curtains and switch on my lights but, as I say, in the Los Angeles of the future, it seemingly never occurs to anybody to do that.<br/><br/>The plot, where there is of it, revolves around a policeman whose job is to kill cyborgs who are supposed to live only ""off-world"" when they escape and return to Earth. However, unlike every other policeman I have ever heard of, he is expected to carry out his duties alone, without any back-up, and completely unsupported. There is one police character who dogs his tracks but, for reasons that are never explained (a lot in Blade Runner is never explained) he seems to constitute more of a nuisance than a help. In fact, he seems to have been assigned solely to keep tabs on the main character, rather than to aid him in any way.<br/><br/>The cyborgs have several opportunities to kill the main character which, for reasons that are never explained, they each bungle clumsily. These cyborgs, who are supposedly super-human, super-strong killers, simply can't seem to bring themselves to kill this guy. Mostly they fail because they are too busy showing off to kill him. However, I suppose that, if they simply killed him, there would be no movie.<br/><br/>Blade Runner might have made a good 1/2-hour ""Twilight Zone"", or 1-hour ""Outer Limits"" episode. However, it simply doesn't have enough substance for a full-length motion picture. Consequently, Ridley Scott pads it out lots and lots of shots of dystopian scenery which had absolutely nothing to the story."

The building they were filming in had to be returned to its normal state and they literally had no time left.<br/><br/>They had used a stunt double to do the building leap but he could not manage it, the gap was too great for him, so Rutger Hauer in 1 take did the jump the dove scene and even improvised the ending....

"bdro-97133","10","3","5","25 September 2018"," My Favorite Movie of All Time
","When I think of Blade Runner, two defining characteristics come to my head. The first being the stunning aesthetic from beginning to end. Ridley Scott went above and beyond with his use of visual stimulation from the very first scene to the moment credits begin to roll. My second main characteristic of Blade Runner is the complex story happening in the background and the many nuanced clues that don't show themselves until the third of fourth viewing of the film. The screenplay is often seen as ""boring"" and ""slow-paced"". But after a deep analysis, nearly every second of the film is crucial to the not only the story, but the masterful tension throughout the story. 
 By itself, Blade Runner is a genre-defining film. Very few films before it had doven into the science fiction genre with such unique style. This style is a large reason for the film becoming relevant in pop culture. The dystopian pollution paired with the neon, over-stimulated, corporate propaganda make the iconic Blade Runner aesthetic that many come to know and love. The deep blues and purples and the overall dark color palette is gloomy enough to set the tone of the film but beautiful enough to keep the watcher engaged. Speaking of visuals, the CGI is crucial to the discussion. By modern standards, the CGI was decent. But for this level of detail and clarity to be achieved on such a grand scale back in 1982 is nothing short of amazing. This film is made for the movie watchers with a taste for visual beauty. 
 Even beyond the visuals, the rest of the film is fantastic. The soundtrack written by Vangelis is very fitting for the film. It's very unique, and helps guide the viewer to the themes of each scene. I could also write an entire paper on the complexity of the story itself, but I will stick to the amazing story within the story. On first viewing, the superficial story of Decker finding and killing rogue Replicants is obvious. After a deeper analysis, an even deeper story emerges. Replicants are usually easy to identify with the red tint of the pupil, and can be even better identified with the heightened strength, durability, etc. But after a deep analysis, the story quietly suggests that Decker MIGHT be the very thing he is payed to kill. A single scene with his pupils glowing for only a few frames and the Unicorn issue have sparked debates that rage on to this day. This kind of storytelling, that refuses to answer a question that would change the entire story, while also hiding the question under another story is truly amazing. 
 The core message of Blade Runner takes all of the different story elements and squishes them down into a single question. ""What does it mean to be human?"" The answer to that question is different for everybody, and that is just another layer of genius in this story. There is no true answer. No one can definitively say where human consciousness ends and the mind of a Replicant begins. Many believe that emotions are the key to being human, Decker's love interest (key word: LOVE), Rachel, is confirmed to be an experimental Replicant. This is the genius of this film. The key question of the film is intentionally complicated in order for the watcher to come to their own conclusions. The line between humans and Replicants is blurred and bordering on non-existant.
 In conclusion, Blade Runner is a masterpiece. The color palette is dark yet stunning, the soundtrack is subtle yet engaging, the pace of the story is slow yet efficient, the story is unique yet amazing, and the message is valid yet frightening. If you haven't watched it, do it. If you have, why not watch it again?"

"c-36048","10","3","5","21 October 2017"," Great Sci-Fi Noir
","Some People see this film as overrated, and boring. To be honest, I can see where they are coming from. If you want to see a good review from someone who explains exactly why they don't like it, watch RedLetterMedia's Re:View of Blade Runner. I can see the criticisms, but to me the movie is a masterpiece, and in a way its flaws makes it a masterpiece. To me the general slow pace make the film immerse you into Los Angeles, and despite its obvious exaggerations, this future feels real. The slow pace also establishes the beauty of this modern world, established through impressive cinematography, Vangelis's great soundtrack and of course the special effects. This is by far one of the best looking films of all time, and personally that look is really able to draw me in where the film might bore others. Some argue the story and characters are what hold this film back, however I would disagree. No one argues that Rutger Hauer's performance is bad, but many have problems with Harrison Ford's Deckard. To me, he is a sad depressed man who drinks, and abuses women. It's more subtle, and we can see that Rachel in the film probably doesn't like him at all, but just needs to find refuge. The whole replicant/human discussion is definitely interesting, and I won't spoil anything for someone who hasn't seen the film so they discover the debate for themselves. Honestly I don't have a clear idea, the movie works either way, but I am still not sure. Hopefully 2049 doesn't answer the question for me. Blade Runner is one of the greatest sci fi films ever made, and to me it changed the face of cinema and sci fi films forever."
"frederikbarndorff","10","3","5","4 October 2017"," Masterpiece with perfect flaws
","Blade Runner is a 1982 sci-fi, noir film directed by Ridley Scott, starring Harrison Ford, Sean Young and Rutger Hauer. The film was written by Hampton Fancher and David Peopless. The film is based on Phillid K. Dicks novel: Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? There exists multiple cuts of the film, the most prominent being the theatrical cut, the director's cut and the final cut, which is the version i will be reviewing. We follow Blade Runner, Rick Deckard who is assigned to to ""retire"" 4 Replicants on Earth. The film is set in future Los Angeles where the replicants try to find there maker: Dr. Eldon Tyrell. Deckard now has to find the replicants in the polluted City before they can get to Dr. Tyrell. When i first saw Blade Runner i was quite disappointed, i thought the pacing was awful and the chemistry between Young and Ford was non-existing. However, after my second and third viewing something changed. It was also surprising to me that i was drawn back to the film again after the first viewing. I simply couldn't get Blade Runner out of my head and after the third viewing it became one of, if not my favorite film of all time. I began to take notice of all the small details that Ridley Scott put in the film. I discover something new every time i see the film. What also made me love Blade Runner is all the ways it can be interpreted. The themes of what it means to be human and life are strong themes, treated with such complexity through the visuals. What has been said a million times is that this is a beautiful film. I would say it's probably the most beautiful film i've ever seen. The film contains the best miniature work since Star Wars. The performances are a little mixed. Rutger Hauer gives in my opinion the best performance in the film. Ford gives a decent performance, Ford didn't really enjoy the shoot and Worning with Scott and he does come off as uninterested in some scenes, but i think it works for the film. It is a film noir and for that reason Fords' cold performance works. He really reminds you of the classic Humprey Bogart detective. It's Sean Youngs first film role, but she gives a decent performance. I've already talked about the visuals, but another standout feature of the film is it's music. The score by Vangelis is very unique and fits the film perfectly. The atmosphere of the film is enhanced to perfection by the score. For the above mentioned reasons i consider Blade Runner to be one of the best films of all time. You can enjoy the film for the visuals alone, but If you pay close attention you will discover a very deep and thought provoking sci-fi film. Final rating: 10/10⭐️"

","Wow, that was one of the most insane movies I have ever seen in my entire life. Luckily, I'm the guy who absolutely loves stuff like that. What I found weird about this was how there were all these unrelated stories being shown one after another. It was indeed great to see them all connect at the end. It was just hard to keep up with how they kept changing from one to the next. Anyway, this was still an absolutely wonderful film. It's mostly because it's such a beautiful looking movie. I simply can't believe this was made in 1982. I mean with these great visuals, it looks more like it was made in the 2000s! <br/><br/>They mention 2017 as a date at one point and it's weird to be reviewing this in that year. My dad was right. This really was a movie that just puts you in a whole new world. It's hard to comprehend what's going on because everything is just so ridiculous. It's pretty easy to say it was dreamlike. I mean, this literally seems like a dream I would have. I guess dreams are something we can all relate to. It was about as easy to follow as one! I thought that it would be like an overblown action movie at first. Instead, there wasn't that much action and it instead just let its beautiful sets tell the story.<br/><br/>I really do feel myself sympathizing and caring for the characters even though it was really hard for me to follow. I am so glad that there was an opening scene that told us all that was going on. I'll never get over how wonderful this movie looks for being made in the early 1980's. I guess this was just a thing for Harrison Ford back then as it was the same time the original ""Star Wars"" movies were made. While this wasn't as good as those, it was just a visual masterpiece you couldn't help but get lost in its world. The pacing is just amazing, with so much being set up at the right time. Please watch this! ****"
"marcusq22","9","3","5","30 July 2015"," An excellent genre mash-up
","I see Blade Runner as a hybrid of three different genres: sci-fi, art-house, and film noir.<br/><br/>One thing I've long appreciated about sci-fi is that, at it's best, it provides a platform for a treatment of philosophical topics. The ""what makes us human?"" topic is a meaty one, and they give it the treatment it deserves in Blade Runner. The opening scenes with the Voight-Kampff tests are an excellent lead-in to this discussion as they challenge the viewer to ask themselves ""How would I react in these situations?"" That engagement with the viewer does a lot to draw them into the story. The vivid setting elements pull the viewer in even deeper.<br/><br/>Art-house films are more of an acquired taste; they require some patience from the viewer. 2001 kind of set the example for art-house/sci-fi, and I think Blade Runner was following in it's wake. A lot of people badmouth Alien 3 for similar reasons. The big issue there, I think, was that audiences were expecting a sci-fi/action movie (like they got with Aliens (2)) and were served up a slower-paced, more arty, piece instead. Mismanaged expectations. Zardoz is another art-house/sci-fi film along these lines.<br/><br/>Classic Noir films (e.g. 40s-50s era) are typified by bleak tones: people are trapped in unpleasant situations, the world around them is corrupt, and the characters typically drive toward a doomed fate. (The ""Private Eye giving a voice-over"" is also a hallmark of the noir genre.) I've typically described noir as ""part crime drama, part psychological thriller, part bittersweet romance."" Neo-noir builds on the genre and typically adds the following elements: identity crises, memory issues / subjectivity, and -- most importantly -- technological problems and their social ramifications. All of these things describe Blade Runner to a 'T'.﻿"
"johnnymacbest","10","3","5","31 January 2008"," Like wine that gets better with age.
","Blade Runner is a film that eschews cinematic brilliance. It's beautifully gritty, dark, and foreboding in every way in its context and content. It is a sci-fi film, but it is more than that; it is a mere reflection of our modern world where technology has seemingly dominated our lives almost in every aspect. It is also a world where the masses have become more or less human and tend to take for granted just what being human really is. One of the most influential films of all time is finally released as ""The Final Cut"" and its great to revisit a classic film that, like a bottle of wine, gets better with age."
"MartinHafer","6","10","26","2 January 2012"," I just don't get it....
","I admit right up front that I am perplexed by this film and my review will no doubt annoy a lot of fans of this film. Let's face it, ""Blade Runner"" is a cult film--and those who like it usually don't just like it--they adore it. I've known several people who insist rather rabidly that it's one of the greatest films of all time. And, when I tell them that I don't particularly like the film, they are confused---'how could anyone not love the film?' often say. In one case, the film lover insisted that I borrow his Director's Cut (one of about 17 different Director's Cuts or Special Editions, I think) because I must have been mistaken. Well, after my second viewing, I did enjoy and appreciate the film a bit more. But I still didn't get the devotion to this film it often receives.<br/><br/>Here is what I liked and didn't like about the film. It had great sets and was VERY other-worldly. While I think the print was a bit too dark, I understand this was done to fit the very dark mood of the film. However, I just felt the film was too dark--oppressively dark...even sadistically dark (such as the eye gouging scene). It completely depressed me--so much so that I found I just didn't like or care about anyone. And, to top it off, the film ended very badly. The director's original ending (where you learn that Harrison Ford's character is also a replicant) would have been so much better. So, this is one case where the Director's Cut is definitely better, as this original ending has been restored. Overall, the film looks impressive and is original--but these alone were not enough for me to give it a glowing endorsement. It's good but that is all."

","I saw the Director's Cut of Blade Runner How the heck is this movie on the top 250? It is flawed beyond imagination. The only positive thing I have to say about this movie is that visually it is entertaining.<br/><br/>Where to start? It uses many old ideas movies have used but does not bring anything new to them (""I am a robot but I feel real""). The acting was laughable. Even though this movie is not too long, it is very boring. You would think they are taking their time to explain something but no. This movie hardly went into any real depth. The first chase scene was not done well at all (I almost laughed). Gosh, the climax! The part of the movie you really wanted it to pick up speed but they dragged it out to the old cat and mouse routine. This kind of goes hand in hand with it being badly written. The movies attempts at being poetic is truly pathetic. It turned out so corny The final twist that Ridley Scott added to the Director's Cut when you first saw it was somewhat interesting, but then you would realize this twist is so illogical the only way to actually explain it is to have a sequel. Also, the twist is like one of those last minute things that M. Night Shamalan would put in his movie.<br/><br/>Not recommended at all"

"ametaphysicalshark","Null","7","17","6 January 2008"," Blade Runner: The Final Cut
","* This comment was written following a theatrical screening of Ridley Scott's final cut of ""Blade Runner"" and is written about this newest version.<br/><br/>Before I get started I must note that ""The Final Cut"" is a definitive cut of the film. This is the most cohesive, well-paced, and entertaining cut of the film, by FAR. I really hope Ridley Scott doesn't go do another cut because this one is as much as can be done without altering the script or filming new scenes.<br/><br/>Another point I was thinking about during the film is how much of a 'theater movie' this is. I have seen the film in two forms (director's/theatrical) a total of three times, and though I always thought it was a good film, I never quite saw what all the fuss was about. A good, solid science fiction film was what I saw each time, but I had what felt like an epiphany during this viewing. The film is easily one of THE MOST GORGEOUS things I've ever seen. Brilliantly shot by Jordan Cronenweth (and I definitely give Ridley Scott some credit for how good this looks), the film is astoundingly beautiful and effective on the big screen. When watching it one realizes that each shot was painstakingly thought out, but unlike some others I've seen, the film is so fluid that you can't stop to think about such matters.<br/><br/>One of several flaws I still believe ""Blade Runner"" suffers from is Vangelis' then ultra-modern score, which by today's standards is so dated it's distracting. That's not to say the film isn't well-scored, but synthesizer scores always bug me because they're bound to sound dated, and this is coming from a guy who loves 80's electronic music (the good stuff, not MTV). Another distracting aspect of the score was the bizarre combination of East Asian, Indian, and Arabic music which felt completely out of place and often forced. Since I'm criticizing the movie in this paragraph I'll throw in my opinion that the script was unbalanced in points, though drastically improved over the original 'voiceover included' version. I felt that dialogue could get distractingly forced at times.<br/><br/>Still, during this viewing of ""Blade Runner: The Final Cut["" I noticed that the majority of criticism leveled at the film is a big load of rubbish. Technically speaking, there is basically nothing at all wrong with the film. Visual effects are excellent, photography and editing are accomplished, and the acting is phenomenal across the board, be it Ford, Hauer, Hannah, or Young, watching them was a pleasure.<br/><br/>There is something the film communicates when seen on the big screen which is missing from home video viewings, and I'm not sure what it is. Is the film so visually dazzling that viewing it on a theater screen glosses over its numerous errors and some other minor flaws, or is it just that with Ridley Scott finally fully overseeing the final product the film has really improved as much as it did in my eyes? Whatever it was, ""Blade Runner: The Final Cut"" is an outstanding science fiction film, not without its flaws, but still one of the most effective films in the genre I've ever seen, and though it forsakes a lot of Phillip K. Dick's philosophical pondering to focus more on the pulp-ish if quite intelligent sci-fi/neo-noir aspect of ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"", the film stands so well on its own that I left the theater overwhelmed and feeling even a bit privileged to have had the chance to view this incredible film on the big screen and learn to appreciate it more.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Neonsamurai","4","14","41","7 January 2005"," What can be more human than human? Duh?
","There's a place in Milton Keynes called 'Blade Runners' and it's an ice skating rink. I really like going there because the changing rooms don't have doors on them and I sometimes wander in and pretend to be from the Ukraine. Of course I'd only wander into the ladies changing room and stay there pretending to be confused until some of the staff came and led me out. Well, I used to do that. Last time I tried it there actually was a girl from the Ukraine, who I think used to be army special forces or something.<br/><br/>Anyway, when I get discharged from hospital the doctors tell me to take it easy for a few days, until the swelling has gone down so I ask my mum to hire out a DVD from the shop for me. But rather than hiring out the film I told her to she decides to ask advice from the old guy Henry who works there. He's had something against me ever since Rufus got stuck down the back of the freezer and destroyed all that ice cream. So Henry being the 'expert' on films that he is tells mum to hire out 'Blade Runner' by Ridley Scott telling her that it's a 'classic'.<br/><br/>Thanks mum! That's not insensitive after what I've been put through! All the horrible memories of the unprovoked attack and the police caution came flooding back when I saw the title of the film. Besides, how many times have I told her to not believe anything Henry says? Especially when he starts by saying ""The police came to the shop last night asking about your son"" In 'Blade Runner' Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, a man who hunts down robots for a job. That sounds easy doesn't it? Well it's not because these 'replicants' look like people, and he has to use an old projector or something to read their minds, somehow. It seems to take AGES so why not do this instead: Rick Deckard: ""Hi. How are you? Would you like a drink of water?"" Replicant: ""No thanks, I'm not thirsty."" Rick Deckard: ""That's right! Only humans can get thirsty! Die robot!!"" BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! That's much easier than some stupid test and he could kill far more robots that way. His boss would be really pleased I'm sure. I mean, if Rick Deckard sold cars and in one day he sold seven, but there were only four in the shop his boss would be really pleased, just like if there were only four replicants on the loose and Deckard managed to kill eleven.<br/><br/>And whilst we're on the subject of robots looking like people, wouldn't it be easier to make them look a little different? Couldn't they, I dunno, look like George Hamilton or something? That way there'd be no need for the test I just made up and anyone who looked like George Hamilton would be shot. Obviously George Hamilton would have to have plastic surgery to look like someone else, maybe George Lucas. That way when people shouted ""Hey George!"" he'd know that they were talking to him and look round. If he looked like Bob Hoskins and people shouted ""Hey Bob!"" he might get confused.<br/><br/>Also, if I brought a robot and it only worked for four years I'd be pretty annoyed. I'll bet they have a program in the future like ""Watchdog"" over here in the UK. They'd soon have Tyrell on there going on and on about how he was selling robots that only worked for 4 years. If they had him on 'Watchdog' I bet Nicky Campbell would make insulting comments about Tyrell's glasses because they are kind of stupid looking. Surely though another company would make robots that worked for 10 years or something, or until their hair went out of fashion, and then beat the Tyrell Corporation at their own game. And what's with the whole ""more human than human"" thing anyway? That's a moronic motto. How about ""sexy robots that put out""? That'd be a better motto, or maybe ""Tyrell don't smell, are bots are hot and we make 'em like George whether you like it or not!"" That's decent marketing and in the form of a rap as well to appeal to kids and gangsta's.<br/><br/>After watching this film I can't wait for the future, but I don't think it's a classic, not like the excellent 'Battlefield Earth' or a film I wrote last night. There should have been more emphasis on what pleasure robots like Daryl Hannah get up to and maybe some steamy scenes in a women's changing room. Of course if Henry hadn't offered his 'expert' opinion then those are some of the scenes I could have expected in 'The Erotic Witch Project'.<br/><br/>Neonsamurai Film Score: AAB"

Deeply thematic, rich characters, a fantastic script and nuanced performances toppled with some of the greatest cinematography ever put on film this is a film version of the mona lisa- every frame can be hung on a wall. Ridley Scott, fresh off the success of Alien is in top form and Blade Runner will be the film he will always be remembered for. Harrison Ford is competent as Deckard and anyone expecting him to be the usual dashing hero will be disappointed. Rutger Hauer steals the show as head replicant Roy Batty. The noir look of the film has inspired so many movies and video games since there isn't really a point talking about it- you have to see it to believe it. One of the greatest films ever made. Period."

","I thought it'll be a movie after ""Do androids dream of electric sheep"" novel. Boy, was I wrong. This movie is after... nothing that makes any bit of sense.<br/><br/>The film makers decided to thoroughly recreate some not-so-important scenes from the while entirely omitting all the context, all the plot, almost all the philosophy - all the substance of the book. And all the common sense.<br/><br/>This is easily the most boring movie I've ever forced myself to sit through. And while whether you get bored or not is a matter of perception, it's a cold hard fact that the movie has no substance."

","I can completely understand how this film has influenced the science fiction genre as it is visually appealing and the score is outright fantastic.<br/><br/>Unfortunately that's where any good qualities for Blade Runner end. The plot is a Xerox copy of any noir detective novel, the characters are impossible to emotionally invest in the acting, for the most part, is bland to outright silly (seriously, Harrison Ford was NOT good in this movie), and the pacing was S-L-O-W.<br/><br/>Yeah there was that one speech at the end that was moving, but it really doesn't make up for the previous 2 hours of the movie that really tried to put me to sleep.<br/><br/>You can call me an idiot if you want, but there was a reason why this thing bombed in the theaters and there is a reason why it has been cut and re-cut half a dozen times."

","'Blade Runner' is one of those movies that offer so much that it requires and deserves repeated viewing. It is filled with allegory, allusion, other metaphors and so much philosophy. The writing is exceptional as the screenplay is layered and the dialogues are very philosophical. It's a fantastic film to discuss with others as it ends on an ambiguous note and there is a lot of symbolism that is open to interpretation. Perhaps I too will be editing my comment after viewing it again.<br/><br/>On the technical side, it looks amazing. The dark dazzling world is eerily real. It also reminds one of noir classics. It does not have the stop motion that CGI's of today's movies have. I loved the technology that was used in 80's movies like 'Blade Runner', 'Starwars', 'The Dark Crystal' and 'Labyrinth'. They made their worlds more real to me. And when I revisit those movies today, it brings a nostalgic feeling as I remember how much I enjoyed these films. In the more recent movies, it's quite easy to tell which scenes were done with CGI as there is a lack of authentic look about it. Back to 'Blade Runner', the special effects and cinematography are mindblowing and how can anyone overlook Vangelis's powerful score? And what makes us appreciate them more is that none of them are over-the-top to the extent that they compromise the story.<br/><br/>I haven't seen all of Ridley Scott's film but so far I'd say 'Blade Runner' is his best. His direction is solid. This wasn't an easy film to make and Scott deserves all the credit he's gotten. The cast is also interesting as it includes (then) not-so-famous actors. Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos and Daryl Hannah all fit the bill.<br/><br/>Today if one looks at these new science fiction wannabe movies, there's a sadness about how science fiction has progressed in Hollywood. Even now when very enjoyable brilliant films like 'Matrix' and 'X-men' are made, there are always sequels that completely destroy the essence of the first movie. But we will always have classics like 'Blade Runner' and 'Starwars' trilogy to revisit. 'Blade Runner' is a profound movie. It works on so many levels that it provides much more than pulp fiction entertainment."
"Aikdog","10","4","8","1 January 2008"," An absolutely fabulous movie.
","It is amazing how well this film stands the test of time especially on the new HD discs. Simply put after watching the bare bones DVD for several years, the magic of Blu-Ray has let me see how enveloping this movie is. The score by Vangelis is perfect in almost every sense of the word, creating a tension filled fear that resonates throughout the movie. There is no real horror in this film, only the sneaking suspicion that this world is ours in the not too distant future. The severe overpopulation, the destruction of natural wildlife, and the onset of genius level IQ in computers are things that won't happen in the next 11 years, but could begin to show itself in 50 years.<br/><br/>The joy of watching this movie though is how it reveals another layer to you with every viewing. The last time I watched it, I really could sense the acting of the Replicants. After all these were mostly B level actors performing as androids trying to come off as humans. They all nailed it perfectly (except Zora). Watching their eyes reset after determining that they had either achieved one more goal to their eventual meeting of Tyrell or knowing that what they were doing was clearly not working. Then watching Ford doing his best to present a unflinching work ethic in solving his goal of eliminating the other Replicants, you can see how Deckard's computer was turning inside as well.<br/><br/>The main issue I always felt raised though was at which point in the development in AI in computers will they indeed be living? And if this point does come, will we be a fearful enough society to just systematically eliminate them? I don't know the answer to that question, but I know 50 years from now this movie will resonate in real life issues and be dissected by the top minds in the world. Philip K. Dick was a genius indeed and kudos for Ridley Scott for realizing this in one magnificent piece of celluloid. If you have never seen this movie and you definitely like deeper meaning films, it is probably worth buying a HD DVD player to see it in all it's glory."

","Generally, I don't like voice-over narration; it tends to tell us what we are already seeing, or what should be made clear anyway in a well-written story. Yet, I prefer the original version of Ridley Scott's BLADE RUNNER that features narration. Read as a flat monologue by Harrison Ford, the narration is relatively minor and it is bland and lacking any sense of humor or style. And though it does provide some fresh details, it really isn't dramatically necessary. Yet, the voice-over works, I think, because it is so banal; in a film that relies heavily on style and visuals, the narration's absence of any sense of poetry grounds the film. It contrasts with the overwhelming stylistics of the film as a whole. It gives us something real -- something human -- in an overcrowded world of eye-popping fantasy.<br/><br/>Director Scott -- as well as Ford himself -- are on the record as not liking the narrated version and when Scott got the chance to have his say on a quasi-director's cut, the studio-imposed narration was the first thing to go. And while his version, without the intruding words, is more solemnly impressive, it is also more desolate and aloof. Without the narration, we observe the action in BLADE RUNNER from a safe distance; with the narration, Ford's Rick Deckard talks to us and forces us to be his confidante. And I think that is essential to appreciating the film because otherwise it is difficult to care one way or the other about the character or his fate. One-dimensional and unsympathetic, Deckard is not the film's hero -- indeed, he is anything but heroic -- but in the end, all depends on whether he lives or dies and the fact that he has shared his thoughts with us makes all the difference.<br/><br/>BLADE RUNNER is a strange hybrid of genres, an odd melding of the traditional film noir, with its peculiar sense of pragmatic morality, and modern sci-fi, with its darkly pessimistic and persistent distrust of both humanity and scientific progress. There is also an element of the traditional western, and its romanticizing of masculinity and individuality. Deckard is a retired cop, drawn back into service by the proverbial ""one last case."" He is a ""blade runner,"" a policeman by law, but in this dark and murky vision of the future (circa 2019), he is more of a hired assassin, in reality a gunslinger or bounty hunter. His job is to track down and ""retire"" a quartet of humanistic androids -- replicants -- who were genetically constructed to be slave labor on some off-planet space colony. Though they were created with built-in expiration dates and are fated to die soon anyway, the four have violently rebelled and have come to earth to try to force the corporation that created them to somehow extend their longevity.<br/><br/>Though now considered a landmark of sci-fi cinema, BLADE RUNNER was a box office flop when it was released and was greeted with critical indifference. This is understandable; released about the same time as E.T. - THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL, and on the heels of STAR WARS and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, the film represented a jarring difference in style and tone for audiences eager for upbeat sci-fi fantasy or thrilling matinée adventures. And this was especially true given the presence of Ford in the starring role; there is nary a trace of Indiana Jones or Han Solo in Deckard and though Ford plays the part well, it is with a dour lack of enthusiasm. Deckard has a job to do and one that he doesn't particularly like; that is the closest he comes to acting heroic. Indeed, in the end, what many may have found hard to appreciate, if they grasped it at all, is that Deckard is the film's villain, a man with no soul who seeks to kill others because they are deemed less than human.<br/><br/>There are two other points of contention brought up by Scott's revisionist view: One is his dislike for the film's so-called ""happy ending"" and the other his notion that Deckard is also a replicant (though Ford rejects this idea, insisting the character was always meant to be human). If Deckard is a replicant, the film gets an ironic twist at the end -- but it also robs the film of it's spiritual essence. The climatic moment of the story is when the last act of a dying replicant, Roy Batty, played by Rutger Hauer, is to save Deckard's life. If Batty saves Deckard because he senses he is a fellow replicant, it is an act of unity; but if he saves a human enemy, it is an act of forgiveness. As the narration explains, at death Batty loves life so much, he can't bare to take it from another. Batty receives redemption (and reveals he has a soul) by forgiving Deckard; Deckard's soul is reborn through Batty's generosity of spirit. And a beautifully ugly film about death becomes a film about the preciousness of life.<br/><br/>The original ending, where Deckard and the replicant Rachel (Sean Young) flee to the country in the hopes of sharing a life, is optimistic, an underscoring of the idea of rebirth. It is vastly superior to Scott's preferred inconclusive ending, which suggests that the two are doomed fugitives. Though the studio-imposed ""happy ending"" was no doubt a purely commercial decision, it gives the film meaning in a way Scott's pessimism can't. Scott's vision of BLADE RUNNER is like a replicant, an engineering marvel and, like a machine, he assumes it is should run with cold, empty efficiency. But just as hope is what makes the replicants human, it is it's original message of hope that gives BLADE RUNNER its humanity."
"charchuk","10","4","8","9 April 2007"," Brilliant, visionary, and outstanding
","I can't believe I've never seen this until now; it fits right into my favourites mould of dark, near-future setting with noir-ish stories and lots of eye candy. I guess I just never got around to it; now that I've seen it, I'm sorta glad I waited, as I would have found it boring when I was younger. As I remember, I started watching it once but could never finish it. Now that I've seen it for the first time as a (at least partially) mature film lover, I can fully appreciate its brilliance. And it is brilliant.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the most visionary films I've ever seen; it's right up there with 2001 in being incredibly ahead of its time, both visually and thematically. As a result, both films are able to transcend their release year, and both feel as though they could have been made today. The two films are kinda counterpoints to each other; while 2001 presents a relatively light future, this film is dark, dark, dark. The wide shots of futuristic Los Angeles are both stunning in their visual presentation and terrifying in their historical implications. The numerous and at time enormous advertisements show a world with capitalism run amok - not something terribly surprisingly given our world today. This film is 25 years old, but somehow it manages to be relevant even today.<br/><br/>The story is a combination of two of my favourite genres: film-noir and science fiction. I'm not sure, but I think this is the first cinematic combination of these two, something that has be re-done many times since. Some may think that the film moves too slow, but I was captivated by the story almost instantly. I would have liked to see more of Deckard's detective work, but there's ample amounts to satisfy my taste for mystery. The issues of humanity that it raises are intriguing and quite revolutionary, and the director's cut - which I saw - leaves the ending ambiguous as to Deckard's true identity. In fact, it leaves the entire film ambiguous - does Roy know Deckard? Is Deckard the 'missing' replicant? Utterly brilliant.<br/><br/>I don't think I can really do the visuals justice in words. Suffice to say, this is one of the most stunning films I've seen - ever. The effects would be amazing today, and the fact that it's from 1982 makes it even more incredible. The dark view of the future is achieved mostly by the terrific production design - something like 1940s Los Angeles with a digital edge. Not only does it look great, but the design is smart as well; it makes sense that immigration would get even worse in the future, so the city and its design is multicultural and multi ethnic. And the music, while obviously from the '80s, fits perfectly. Technically superb.<br/><br/>Though I've only just seen it for the first time, I feel confident that this will wind up in my all-time top ten after watching it again. I don't remember ever being this blown away by a film upon first viewing: it usually takes multiple viewings for me to really love a film. As it stands, this is one of the best films I've ever seen."
"davisken-1","10","4","8","12 March 2007"," Unparalleled
","It seems that the best ideas explored in science fiction originated in the minds of authors like Philip K. Dick and W. Burroughs. Blade Runner evolved from their ideas, and is an inspired project that really deserves respect.<br/><br/>I was very young when I first saw the movie on its initial release. My friends and I were stunned. We didn't have the wherewithal to properly verbalize what we came away with, but we knew we loved it.<br/><br/>This movie accomplishes something very few works do, it provokes that profound sense of how strange it is to be a human being, and that it's truly difficult to imagine any alternative.<br/><br/>It's interesting to note that the ""replicants"" are referred to in the movies opening as ""robots"" when they are in fact organic, genetically engineered...humans. This is an example of how we structure morality on what's convenient or essential for our continuation, not necessarily survival, but so-called progress. In Blade Runner replicants are required for the colonization of other planets. Society side-steps the moral implications, referring to replicants as robots and to killing them as retirement. It's great that the story focuses on these profound issues rather than space battle action type stuff. That is in fact quintessential to the nature of the story, it's not about what happens on the front lines, but in the dark recesses of a world left to die.<br/><br/>There's so many cool ideas in this film. There are layers of interconnectedness that reach beyond the story. The fact that the hotel in which Sebastian lives was the hotel used to film the Outer Limits episode ""Demon with a Glass Hand"", which explores similar themes about what it is to be human, is an example.<br/><br/>A friend of mine tells me he was instructed by an architect who worked on the film's sets. After filming the architect had the sets burned, so that they wouldn't appear in any subsequent projects. The film makes ample use of stone columns and pylons, and it's great how old structures are situated alongside huge new ones. The backdrops are rich in detail, nothing is plain, and there's strange uncharacteristic things like small fires in the street's gutters.<br/><br/>One of the ideas in the film is Philip K. Dick's concept of ""kipple"", the unwanted and useless junk that accumulates and tends to reproduce itself. The Blade Runner world is full of it, and its presence seems to reflect the situation of humanity itself, reproducing, accumulating, spreading through the universe, blind to any purpose, and incapable of knowing what the ultimate outcome will or even can be. The film's dialog also subtly reflects this, Gaff tells Deckerd; ""It's too bad she can't live, but then again, who does?"" The different ways of interpreting this statement are typical of the film's deliberate ambiguousness, it's not only a statement about mortality, but existence versus living. Both meanings are equally valid. Fortunately, the story isn't compromised with some kind of resolution, religious salvation, or final answers. It's lack of closure gives it more impact.<br/><br/>Technically the movie is brilliant, the look and feel of it aligns perfectly with the story. At first I was disappointed that the director's cut removed the narration, probably because it was the version I was used to. But the director's cut works a little better I think, and it's a bit darker without Harrison Ford's vocal interjections. The movie does have some strange, cheesy quirks, but on repeated viewings they don't have as much impact because you know they're coming.<br/><br/>A great film, it's hard to imagine a science fiction film that could equal it."

"The_Void","9","4","8","14 July 2005"," Beautiful, atmospheric, thought-provoking.
","Based on a novel by Philip K. Dick, this futuristic urban Sci-Fi film is a masterpiece indeed. Director Ridley Scott has managed to turn Dick's story into a dark and complex film-noir styled mystery, that packs as much punch on an aesthetic level as it does on an emotional and substantial one. It's clear throughout the film that the movie makers' intentions was to make this more of an intelligent character study cum thought-provoking drama rather than the thrill seeking movie that the Sci-Fi genre movies usually are. This is shown by the way that the action in the movie is kept down to a bare minimum, and the way that the film always seems to want to put forward an idea rather than an action sequence. The plot, which covers themes such as what it takes to be considered alive, follows a group of four androids (""Replicants"") that have escaped their masters and come to Earth, where Replicants are illegal. Their intention is to seek out 'the maker' and try to add to their maximum four-year lifespan, given to them to ensure that they wont have sufficient time to develop emotions. On their tail is Deckard; a policeman in the business of hunting Replicants; known as a Blade Runner.<br/><br/>Through a grim setting and dark characterization; Ridley Scott has truly succeeded in giving Blade Runner a classic film-noir style. This bodes well with the futuristic metropolitan version of Los Angeles that the film takes place in. Both of these elements blend excellently with the characters, which are intriguing as they are dark. Harrison Ford steps into the role of Deckard; the classic noir protagonist. We never really delve into his character; but at the same time, that ensures that the mystery surrounding him is kept up, which serves in making our protagonist all the more intriguing. Rutger Hauer, who gives a career-best performance as the leader of the Replicants, matches him. Hauer treads the line between pathos and pure evil brilliantly, and it's always easy to believe that he is the doomed android that the movie presents him as. The main thing I love about this movie is it's style; the dark Gothic undertones are superb to look at, and once the film enters it's final third, the atmosphere takes over and the way that it builds to it's beautiful and classic conclusion is absolutely superb. Blade Runner may have been met with negativity on it's release; but today it's an absolute classic."
"SusieWaggonerFrenger","10","4","8","14 March 2005"," About mortality
","This film is basically about mortality and the ensuing rage of the creature against their creator. The basic premise of the NEXUS-6 is that they are so perfect they are not allowed to last... because as they develop independent thoughts and, yes, feelings, they are a threat; consequently, they should be eliminated. A social analyst could write hours about this. But the film could be summed up in Roy Batty's final words: ""I have seen things you people wouldn't believe [...] those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain..."" Living four years as the NEXUS-6 or eighty as a healthy human being doesn't change things: the fact is that we all are we going to die, and everything's lost then unless we find a way to pass it on. Replicants cannot reproduce by themselves; art remains, and having read the original novel I recall a replicant there called Luba Luft, who was specially obsessed by art. And this movie is a work of art. Rutger Hauer could have been an early Gary Oldman, why he didn't find the success he deserved, I don't know. He was great as the demented, enraged, desperate but genial Roy Batty. Sean Young as Rachael is great too, with very subtle moments of quiet grief that are a real treasure. Daryl Hannah as Pris has a remarkable physical control, from the moment she stands like two minutes quiet as a statue, without even blinking her eyes, to the terrible moment of her death. And even Harrison Ford, having had a long chain of mediocre roles lately, is here in perhaps his best role ever. It's touching to see his face after Roy Batty's saving his life and then, as the dove flies, simply dying. It's as if he understood, and of course he did. The famous question of Rick Deckard being a replicant or not is finally solved in the director's cut: no doubts remain. Ridley Scott had then these shadowy, oppressive environments that made his movies so trademark. This movie transcends the ""science fiction"" genre and moves into deeper territory. No marvel it has become a cult movie. The director's cut is even better than the original (the removal of Harrison Ford's Bogart-like narration helps.) A jewel."

","this film is very nonsensical for various reasons. first, if these are androids, there would be an easy way to control and identify them: otherwise, they are just humans, in which case, ethically they should have never been created. if it was ethical to manufacture humans, then cloning humans or genetically engineering an intelligent animal, would have been easier (it takes less sources to follow biology and breed.) furthermore, as an environmentalist, to me this vision of Los Angeles seems awkward, given two things 1) climate change (a virtually insurmountable problem) 2) virtual reality (an easier way to pacify a population through hyperreality). also, the cyberpunk theme is very corny for the same reasons. simply nonsensical."
"timefreezer7","7","6","14","28 February 2002"," Good visuals don 't make a good movie
","The one line summary says it all . Ridley Scott with the aid of a brilliant crew (director of photography , SFX team and a decent music score) managed to shoot one of the most astonishingly impressive films ever but with a thin paper plot and an unnecessarily slow pace . It could as well be a short film. As it is it's just a 40 minutes story stretched to a 2 hours time slot .<br/><br/>First the positive points : Blade Runner gives an original and splendid mix of stylistic themes . It combines the film noir atmosphere of the 1940 's (the detective who ""falls for the wrong woman"" , the clouded alley streets etc) with futuristic sets (flying cars , colourful lights , advanced computer technology) and strangely it maintains the present day reality of a detective thriller of the 80 's or even the 90 's . The result is a wonderful surrealistic background , timeless and not at all dated . This diachronic atmosphere is a very successful depiction of the vision of many famous sci-fi writers , and I am not referring necessarily to Philip Dick . Sci - fi writers usually describe futuristic societies with an amalgam of elements from different historic periods and this is exactly the case with this film . I will have to shake hands with the SFX crew because the overhead take in the beginning of the movie where we get a panoramic view of the colourful-lighted scyscrapers is unbelievably good . Even now , 20 years later , when technology has evolved so much , I still haven 't seen such a convincing simulated image in a movie . For example Judge Dredd (1995) and Fifth Element (1997) tried to walk on the same path but with limited success . But the real kudos must go to the cinematographer because his work is in one word excellent . The cinematography is simply excellent and I doubt if it will be ever topped . It is the soul of the movie and the most representative sample of the spirit the film-makers tried to capture . Unfortunately due to a lame script they failed . Which leads us to the negative points : slight spoilers coming .<br/><br/>This film tries to be philosophical and mind intriguing but it simply doesn 't work . The silence and the slow pace add nothing to the film . No , the film doesn 't pose metaphysic questions about the essence of life and the borders between artificial intelligence and real existence , as the fans and the snobbish critics insist (keep in mind that back in the 1982 they panned it) . The only controversial scene is when Dechard(Harrison Ford) shoots down the dancer Zhora played by Joanna Cassidy. This is a violent bloody murder and one of them most depressing killing scenes in cinematic history . It is obvious that the ""termination"" of a replicant is still homicide of an intelligent entity . If the rest of the film managed to retain the same climate it would indeed be ""philosophic"" . Unfortunately we have a letdown to scattered scenes of erotic hypnotized innuendo between Dechard and Rachael and inane sleepy dialogue between Roy (Rutger Hauer) and Pris(the unrecognizable Daryl Hannah). All this leads to a disappointing anti-climactic finale . No , it is not at all poetic and if the idea was good *******spoiler**** Roy ultimately saving Decard******* the execution was horrible . I believe the main problem of the film was the acting . Although the casting was successful none of the actors gave a memorable performance . They all sleep-walked through their roles except from the a** kicking Cassidy . Now I reckon they were supposed to be deadpan to fit in the film noir climate but  it didn 't take . Although Ford was likeable in his short haircut and had a weird chemistry with Sean Young they didn 't capture the viewer 's heart to the point they should . The ONLY character you root for is actually Sebastian (William Sanderson) who suffers from untimely anility at the age of 25 and hosts the replicants in his house. He is terrified of what is happening but can 't do anything to prevent it. I haven 't read the novel but I have downloaded the original screenplay and there are differences which would have made a slightly better film *********SPOILERS read at your own risk*****************<br/><br/>1) The truth test to certify if Rachael was a replicant was quite longer e.g. it contained the lines ""What would you do if a wasp landed on your hand""  ""I would slap it and kill it""<br/><br/>2) There was another replicant called Mary who lived with Roy and Pris in Sebastian 's house . She was dispatced easily before Pris jumps -literally- on Dechard . She had about 5 lines throughout the whole film so she was easily omitted .<br/><br/>3) The scene in the bar where Decart meets the replicant was also longer. The replicant had cockroaches for pets and he urged Ford to kiss one of them ! Ultimately Deckard was the one who shot the replicant and not Rachael.<br/><br/>4) Roy didn 't only kill his creator scientist but also all his assistants and his family including his cute little 8 year old son . Sebastian actually was not murdered by him in that incident but unfortunately he inevitably bited the dust in the finale by the stray bullets from Dechart who gatecrashed Sebastian 's home .<br/><br/>5) The final duel between Roy - Dechart was actually a more successful shoot 'em up scene than those dreadfully sophomoric lines by Rutger Hauer who broke two fingers of Ford and suddenly he stopped for no apparent reason wanting pretentiously to show the supremacy of the replicants to the humble human kind . ****************************************************************** I cannot understand why everyone bashed the film 's happy ending and said it left unanswered questions . If you want to know the original script had the two leads go to a snowy forest . Dechart leaves and Rachael commits suicide with a gun since this was their common decision as the best solution !!!! The movie would end with a voice-over narration from Ford "" I was glad because now they wouldn 't be able to set their hands upon her ""  (and harm her) . Would you prefer THAT ??? As i said impressive eye candy is not enough for a good film . BR is a landmark but just like the case with the horrible dull ""Alien"" (at least BR is watchable) a groundbreaking ""classic"" is not always a good movie . All in all a rather disappointing<br/><br/>7.5 / 10<br/><br/>Don 't expect much of a story and you will like it . Oh , I almost forgot *****spoiler****** Dechart IS a replicant . In the middle of the film in his house when he talks with Rachael ,  Rachael 's red-shine in the eyes is shown and then Dechard 's eyes come to screen and indisputably the same red shine is CLEARLY VISIBLE**************"

I do not know why this movie is liked by many and why it is famous. 30-40 minutes into the movie felt like 5 hours, I was sighing loudly. The phrase ""didn't age well"" couldn't apply more than on this film. In the 80s people were surprised by the quality of the special effects, but seeing it now it is horrible looking. The pacing is extremely slow, it is so bad that every scene feels like half a movie. The acting is average, long scenes of them having a long face and doing nothing. The characters are not interesting at all, he's a boring retired sleazy cop and she's a girl who stands there smoking a cigarette dramatically. The story could be told in 1 minute. All of the psychology and philosophical subjects aren't really that smart as the movie and people think they are, yeah sure robots and makers and God and life blah blah blah, the idea could be done a million times better. This movie is a perfect example of being popular and highly rated doesn't mean good. I only thought of watching it because of the many ratings and talk about it, and now I completely regret it.

","Blade Runner is considered a masterpiece of science fiction cinema and I can see why visually anyone would be foolish to disagree-the noir look is gorgeous, almost like a beautiful, tragic painting of a dying civilization. But the film is a misery to sit through partly because the characters are unrelatable. Harrison Ford's Deckard is dull and looks bored throughout the film and his chemistry with Sean Young is nonexistent. The plot is too high brow and all but the most ardent followers of hard thinking man's science fiction would be impressed. This is a classic example of overpraised piece of work."
"bill-17550","2","5","11","3 June 2018"," All form, little substance
","This is easily one of the most overrated sci fi flicks ever. I challenge anyone to read the screenplay the whole way through without falling asleep. Yes, it's very visual and Vangelis did a good, appropriate (not amazing) soundtrack to give it that dark depressing ""dystopia"" bit....OK, fine...but that's it. No characters of even the tiniest interest to either love OR hate, a laughably bumbling love angle, and almost zero action except for one brief flurry around half-way through and another at the end. Speaking of which, a totally stupid ending...not Roy saving Decker, that was a great idea (and where it should have ended), but then Decker and Rachel hooking up and going....? where? And do we care? No. This movie was loaded with over-the-top pretentiousness and about zero believability, even given the premise. I saw it in the 80s and went ""eh."" I just saw it now for the first time since then, as I was interested in the new one and wanted this as a base, but found it's even worse than I remember. Read the review titled ""So very very boring""....a bit harsh but sums it up fairly well (and is more entertaining than this entire film)."
"milesy-83342","2","5","11","27 February 2018"," I have tried....
","I have watched Blade runner twice. The first time being because of how highly my dad regards it and the second time being because I was forced to by the course I am taking in college. In all honesty, I enjoyed it at first. The long drawn out establishing shot of the city is amazingly beautiful and a nice way to start film when accompanied by the interrogation scene which follows it. The latter of these shots has excellent lighting and an intriguing intensity that drew me in and making me want more. However, it is that and only that which is led to me rating the film two stars because as soon as the gun shot of Leon (I think?) is shot the goofiness begins. How can such an apparently critically acclaimed film be so insanely awfully written with out of place dialogue and mumbling of Harrison Ford. To put it very simply, it is boring. The story is boring, the characters (with the exception of Roy) are boring and yes it may be very ""pretty"" but its all style and no substance. It seems that if you were ever in need of proof that there is a generation gap in existence this is the film to prove it. I could not count the number of 50 something year old adults on my hands who have said ""how damn excellent the final speech is"". This being the final speech where Roy pulls a dove out of nowhere and awkwardly explains how he is more human than Deckard will ever be. Deep? Yes. Worth the wait? No. Blade Runner, in my eyes, will go down in history as the film that teenagers who still listen to vinyl, were ""born in the wrong generation"" and like to point out that they make their own abstract films will regard as ""fantastic""."
"zkonedog","4","5","11","3 August 2017"," Those Who Enjoy Deep Story/Character Flicks Need Not Apply
","A number of years ago (when I was probably too young to be watching it in the first place), I watched ""Blade Runner"" and was utterly confused and disappointed by the whole thing. Cut to the present and now perhaps my favorite film director, Denis Villeneuve, is making ""Blade Runner 2049"" for release this fall. As such, I gave the original ""Blade Runner"" another chance to see if I was perhaps ""missing something"" (it seems to be widely considered one of the best sci-fi flicks ever). While I now understand what the movie is ""supposed to be"", so to speak, I can also better articulate why it won't appeal to a certain viewing audience.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Blade Runner"" is set in 2019 Los Angeles, where the Tyrell (Joe Turkel) Corporation has begun making human replicant (or ""skin jobs"") cybernetic beings for slave labor in the ""Off-World"" colonies. Predictably, a group of these beings, led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), rebel and commandeer a vessel back to Earth, where they will wreak havoc if not dealt with. This is where Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) comes in, as he is the best in the business at dealing with these replicants. Along the way, Deckard comes across a new type of replicant, Rachael (Sean Young), that challenges him in ways not previously seen.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that ""Blade Runner"" is based on a very interesting, pure science fiction concept: human consciousness in a machine body. There are thousands of stories that could be told on this topic, and many already have been across cinema. The trouble with ""Blade Runner"", though, is that it doesn't care all that much in digging into the meat-and-potatoes of those stories.<br/><br/>Instead, this is a film primarily concocted out of love of noir and setting. Director Ridley Scott (much like he did in his earlier ""Alien"" effort) is vastly more interested in exploring the dark underbelly of a future LA than he is in crafting a really tight story. As such, much of ""Blade Runner"" showcases the aesthetics of the landscape. If you are really into that sort of thing, this movie will rocket up your list.<br/><br/>For those more pulled in by story and character development, however, ""Blade Runner"" only gives out as many nuggets as it needs to in his department. In fact, most of the context of the entire picture is given in an opening text crawl. There are a few ""story moments"" scattered throughout the movie, but they are truly few and far between and too short to satisfy those looking for them.<br/><br/>So, I think the litmus test of whether a viewer will enjoy ""Blade Runner"" comes down to how much you enjoy the noir/aesthetic of a film, as that is the film's primary purpose. Does it touch on some interesting ideas/characters? Yes. Does it explore them in any deeper fashion? Absolutely not."

","Probably the most boring science fiction film I've ever watched, and I've sat through it 3 times really trying to give it a chance. I don't think the script is anywhere close to ""brilliant"" as many have deemed it, however, the story does have potential to make a decent movie had it been done right. The screenplay and overall pace of this movie destroyed any desire I had to watch more than half of it. First time I watched it I kept waiting for it to get more interesting and it just never did.

"Screen_Blitz","9","5","11","15 May 2016"," 80s cyberpunk piece sees visionary Ridley Scott taking Phillip K. Dick's inspiring source material and spinning into cinematic mastery
","Ridley Scott's cyberpunk thriller Blade Runner inspired by the short novel by Phillip K. Dick is a film with a reputation that grew following its trouble history with its studio. The debacle started with Scott facing studio interference that lead to re-edits that neither him or lead star Harrison Ford were satisfied with, especially with its dour performance at the box office. The ordeal was followed with re-edits that made their way into the Director's Cut Edition released on home media ten years later. However, it wasn't until Scott polished with the film with a final makeover, renovating the picture to his most satisfying form known as the Final Cut in 2007. What comes of the final product is a stylish futuristic sci-fi piece showing the director operating at arguably his finest fashion. Scorching with a dazzlingly rich visual heft and narrative that breathes a chock load of ambition. It is blistering sci-fi spectacle blooming with elements that have carried influence on many cyberbunk entries in later years including 'Dark City', 'Ghost in The Shell', and 'The Matrix' to name of few. Now that is a definition of a groundbreaking picture. Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, a local police officer in the futuristic city of Los Angeles in 2019, a city rattled by crime and economic depression. Deckerd is assigned to a daunting task of assassinating four emotionless androids known as Replicants. These otherworldly beings are humanoids who are disguised as regular humans. And the worst part, they happen to be responsible for the theft a spaceship. When he closes in the leader of the group Rachael (played by Seana Young), the only one born with emotion, Deckerd begins to question his identity. <br/><br/>In age when science-fiction was the household for mainly aliens, intergalactic warfare, and post-apocalyptic settings; Blade Runner offered something not entirely seminal but highly underpopulated in the genre, and expanded upon it with ideas not many, if any, filmmakers dared to attempt before. This is where the visionary mind of Ridley Scott is poured into with no restraint of ambition. Set in a futuristic society completed with an eye-dazzling visual design that many (especially back in the day of its initial release) could describe as groundbreaking, the film transpires with a plot stitched together with a plethora of twists and turns that leave audiences' head throbbing with questions of Deckard's identity. Is he the man he always believed he is, or is there a secret hidden within his transparent being? As the events unfold into a steadily paced game of cat-and-mouse with sudden bursts of intense gunplay, conspiracy permeates the grim atmosphere to the point where the most intriguing elements lie not within the questions that are answered but the ones that are left unanswered. The story, uprooted marvelously from the script by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, is handled with grace and moves at pace that may prove to be too sluggish for some, but nonetheless allows the for the characters to build and for the plot to bulk up for the cutthroat climax. If you grab a hold of the Final Cut edition, you avoid the unnecessary Harrison Ford narration that bears seemingly no significant purpose. And as for Ford, fresh from his debut in the 'Indiana Jones' franchise', the actor puts on a performance that is more than desirable. There is a fair steam of charisma smoking through his performance. Sean Young remains solid in her role, but nothing that knocks for sheer impression. She just does enough to show she is talented and fitting for the role. <br/><br/>Blade Runner is a profoundly engaging cyberpunk piece that broke many grounds for establishing powerful elements that have inspired many entries of the genre today. And the accomplished ambition of Ridley Scott's directorial methodology is what holds the film as one of the most influential sci-fi flicks of its generation. Now that is a fine achievement for a film uprooted from a tortured history."
"dilenamountoo","10","5","11","2 September 2010"," Strangely perfect...
","This film is flawed, but it's perfect. I don't really know how to explain what that means, so I'll just say some stuff.<br/><br/>You all know the story: Harrison Ford is a bladerunner, a detective who specializes in the ""retirement"" of rogue androids that are exact duplicates of humans, called replicants. It's an interesting concept that is actually very flawed.<br/><br/>First of all, if replicants have a tendency to go rogue and become murdering lunatics that also blend into human society because they are exact duplicates of humans, why not rectify this situation by not making replicants what amounts to clones of humans. I mean, you've got the whole android part down pretty well, so why not just remove the human features, or give them a giant tattoo on their face at the very least.<br/><br/>Second, that test thing is really impractical. If the only way of finding if someone is a replicant or not is to sit them down and examine their emotional reactions with ridiculous specificiy, then you need to find a better test. Talk about the need for a fail safe.<br/><br/>It may seem like I really think this movie is a pile of tripe for attacking its very premise, but I don't. This movie is a masterpiece for completely different reasons. People should go to this movie for three reasons: 1) To see Harrison Ford be a bad ass going up against super humans(it's bloody awesome) 2) To hear the brilliantly portrayed character Roy Batty ponder the brevity of existence and examine the meaning of humanity. and 3) To observe the stellar, morbidly beautiful urban landscapes and imagery that this film paints so perfectly.<br/><br/>All in all, a perfect movie that is not perfect but is still deserving of a ten for creating such a masterful contradiction.<br/><br/>P.S. Rick Deckard is not a replicant. That would be really stupid. I don't care what Ridley Scott said, Rick Deckard IS NOT A REPLICANT."

"bob the moo","Null","5","11","29 October 2001"," Comments on Director's Cut
","Ridley Scott's horrific future-vision of Alien was a landmark in cinema. Blade Runner keeps his trademark bleak city vision and opens it up with questions of existences in a detective thriller.  The Director's Cut adds a whole new element that many people suspected from the original but makes it clear that this is what we're meant to think.<br/><br/>The visuals and the score in the film are excellent and for me make the whole thing work.  Ford and Penn are good in their roles, but Rutgar Hower is excellent as the lead android making this one of his best performances - who doesn't know his final speech almost verbatim by now?!  Ford's wooden style fits in well with the cold city that he lives in and also lends itself to the fact that Ford may not be everything he seems.<br/><br/>This is the version that we should have seen years ago - it allows us to follow the story ourselves without the voiceover having to lead us by the hand.  The main addition of Ford's unicorn dreams opens up a whole new element to the film and throws up plenty to talk about once it is finished. A beautiful looking film that, thanks to this cut, has plenty of substance to match the visual flair."

Even in 1982, it had portentous narration, moved at a snail's pace, and featured characters too world-weary to care about themselves, much less allow us to care about them.

The last 20 minutes of the film were the only parts worth watching, purely because or Rutger who should've seen more screen time in my opinion.<br/><br/>Would I recommend it to a friend? Not if I wanted to keep them.
I will however watch 2049 purely on the basis that closure is needed, I hope it can connect more than the original.

It also has, in my opinion, the best synthetic humans in a film. The monologue that Rutger Hauer's character gives towards the end of the film is one of the most moving ever, and it's truthful.

","Writing about Blade Runner is no simple task, for it is one of the most important, groundbreaking, movies in the science fiction genre. Don't be fooled though, beyond the mesmerizing visuals and soundtrack there's much more than just a futuristic detective movie. Blade Runner touches philosophical and ethical topics concerning humanity.<br/><br/>Set in a dystopic Los Angeles, in the year 2019, we follow the steps of Rick Deckard in his task to retire replicants. The latter are genetically modified human beings, made solely to serve humanity in their own purposes. However, they can not only feel emotions but they also have a human will. The hunt begins right after the protagonist is forced to dispose of four rebellious replicants. With the best use of futuristic visuals and noir atmosphere, Ridley Scott forged a masterpiece that is highly detailed.<br/><br/>Through the investigation Deckard interacts with Rachel, a replicant that initially is reluctant to believe she's not a real human. During his interaction with Rachel, the detective unfolds a scheme that goes beyond science; Since replicants have a limited time of life, solely to keep them under control, the Tyrell Corporation was experimenting to give them false memories as a background to their emotional responses. Upon discovering that, Deckard is clearly phased, mostly because his infatuation towards Rachel - He carries on the task nevertheless.<br/><br/>Ethical conflicts are clearly discussed throught the movies. Humans creating slaves for off earth tasks, humans creating other humans but depriving them of their rights - the line is blurred, who is real human and who is not? More than that, what does it mean to be human?
The stray replicants on the other hand are fighting for their survival, trying to desperately find a way to live. Roy Batty, the leader of the band, pursues his goal of extending their life time.<br/><br/>In this dystopian future, in which many cultures are put together in a array of neon visuals and different languages, the only fight going on is for the right to live. The lack of a villain and a hero accentuates the ambiguity of our human nature; our ethic is falty, but still we carry on. The resolve of the movie however comes in a thrilling scene of the final encounter between Deckard and Roy. The argument for this movie is just marvelous; the emotional monologue of Roy Batty in the end, enhanced by the rainy scenery and smooth soundtrack by Vangelis, is one of the most beautiful moments and also most important for the plot - It is the moment when Rick Deckard realizes that being human is much more than the common sense, replicants are creatures such as we. His resolve is to run away with Rachel since he's unable to dispose of her due to the feelings developed between them.<br/><br/>This movie is essentially made for sensitive people, there's a lot to think. What makes a person? Who can decide?
It discusses our human nature and our inherent arrogance while also developing characters in all their entirety. We're in 2019, the time we're living might not be aesthetically similar to the one in Blade Runner, but even so this movie remains relevant - that is because of the topics it brings. With our ever changing ethical conventions, that exist mostly to serve our purposes of conquest. There just isn't a short way to talk about this movie, it is as complex as our very existence, our laws and our society. For the watcher with a good head for philosophy and social discussions, this movie will clearly be a masterpiece.<br/><br/>RIP Rutger Hauer - thank you for your genius acting and one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen in my life, your legacy won't be like tears in the rain.<br/><br/>
P.S: I'm well aware there are many versions of the movie out there, I'm writing based on the version I watched which is The Final Cut (2007)."

","Have seen this so many times now but had not watched it for a while. Then went to see it performed with a live soundtrack at the Royal Albert Hall. The show and performance was immense. Anyway back to the movie, great plot, great cast, great special effects. Has not really dated at all. The version I saw was the directors cut, which does not feature Deckards voiceover, which is a shame as I really like that and feel it adds something more to the movie. The one thing I really realised this time round was that it was difficult to identify who the heroes and victims really were in this. I always obviously rooted for Deckard but his profession is not that admirable really. The replicants actually care for each other and have feelings that few actual humans actually demonstrate in the movie. Yes the replicants are violent but at the same time they are only trying to survive. Providing them with feelings and emotions is cruel and then to ultimately end their life abruptly is a horrible way to go. They want answers, revenge, to live a decent life. They are treated like robots which essentially they are, but they have human feelings. You very much feel for them where as the humans, even Deckard at times are the aggressors and have very few redeeming features. The way Deckard seduces Rachael is actually quite rough. Knowing she is a replicant and also that she is very vulnerable makes it all very awkward to watch. Still a great science fiction movie, one of the very best ever."

","Part Neo-noir detective story, part cyberpunk science fiction and visually one of the most striking films ever made. There is an extraordinary world here to get lost in. Set in a dark, rainy, overpopulated dystopian Los Angeles, Blade Runner is a slow-burning picture about man's fruitless dream of achieving immortality and what it means to be human. I wish the film had a better thought-out story, instead of the somewhat contrived and sparsely plotted one we ended up getting. And I wish that the characters were better developed. Rutger Hauer's Batty was the best character in the film. Harrison Ford did a fine job as Deckard but he was not well written. Sean Young, Edward James Olmos and Daryl Hannah all played interesting characters but were underdeveloped. With all of its flaws, I still very much enjoyed the film. When a movie has this much detail in its world building and has such an intoxicating atmosphere, the lack of a strong plot and well developed characters does not hurt it very much. If you have not seen the film, just forget about the negatives and immerse yourself in one of the most unique and fascinating worlds ever created in film.

","I remember my first viewing of 1982's Blade Runner. From the director of Alien, the guy who starred in Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark, and a science fiction setting that was marketed as some sort of sci-fi adventure in the vein of Star Wars, this couldn't go wrong, right? My young teenage self was in for utter disappointment. I did not expect a deep, thoughtful movie that explores what it means to be human. With hardly any action scenes, I was pretty disappointed. More than ten years later, I gave the film a chance with a more mature pair of eyes. I certainly was able to appreciate the wonders of the movie a lot more. This is one of those films that is always misunderstood at first, but people come back to appreciate it later on. Like this one particular viewer!<br/><br/>Ridley Scott, coming off his highly successful horror sci-fi Alien wanted to direct something with more meaning and lyrical, so he was given Hampton Fancher's script to read. Based on Philip K. Dick's story, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,"" the script tackles some dark themes and it ask questions like, ""should we value humans without emotions or androids with emotion?"" The movie and the script borrows themes from classic Greek literature and from the Bible itself. Even with a narrow teenage mind, I was impressed at the overt religious overtone the film had. This film meant much to Scott because he wanted to tackle this kind of project after the death of his older brother. He did have to combat his producers and the studio over this project. For example, he was forced to add mediocre narration that took away from the story. Luckily, he took out that narration in the Director's Cut, released many years later.<br/><br/>It is the year 2019, in the futuristic city of Los Angeles. (I really love how the movie portrayed the year we are currently in). The race of man was able to create technology that allowed them to make humanoids with short, fixed lifespans called replicants. These replicants were banned from Earth and sent to off-world colonies. The main character of the story, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a Blade Runner. A Blade Runner is a cop whose specialization is to hunt down any escaped replicants. When four replicants led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) makes their way to Earth, Deckard has to hunt them down while truly discovering who he is himself.<br/><br/>I thought the performances were very good. Harrison Ford also wanted to have a deeper, symbolic role and he was intrigued by the questions this film asked. He gave a meaningful, but low-key performance. It's a shame that he often clashed with Ridley Scott on set, but these two did not get along. Rutger Hauer delivered the film's best performance. With his striking blond hair and eyes, no one can forget his villainous performance that goes down in the history books as one of the best. I also liked Sean Young's performance as the replicant Rachael who believes that she is human. Keep an eye out for other great supporting performances from Edward James Olmos, M. Emmett Walsh, and Daryl Hannah.<br/><br/>I was blown away with the futuristic design and the special effects. The look of the film was created by Douglas Trumbull, the same man who worked on the effects for 2001: A Space Odyssey. There is also a nice use of product placement in the film, which is the most memorable in my mind. Such advertisements from Coca-Cola and Atari were used. Fun fact! The sales of these companies dropped after appearing in the film, later known as the ""Blade Runner Curse."" Some designs that stood out to me, excluding the whole futuristic look, were the cop cars known as spinners and a lie detector test known as the Voight-Kampff Machine. Philip K. Dick passed away before the film began production, but he was pleased at the look of the film. The visions he saw matched the visions of his brain.<br/><br/>Another important part of the movie is the music. Coming off his Academy Award win for his famous score for 1981's Chariots of Fire, he creates an atmospheric synth-based score. The atmospheric music complements the film very well, and who can forget the tenor sax love theme. If anything is wrong with the movie, it is definitely not the music!<br/><br/>Many film buffs call Blade Runner one of the best science-fiction films of all time. In my own humble opinion, it is definitely one of the most important films to the genre, but maybe there have been better movies, quality-wise. That said, this is still a very good film. My biggest issue is the pacing and the off-hand narration, but Ridley Scott directs this film like an expert. It is a character-driven, theme-based movie that asks many important questions. I do like how they leave many of these questions ambiguous. Of course, the biggest question of all: Is Rick Deckard a replicant?<br/><br/>My Grade: B+"

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","10","2","3","8 March 2019"," A superb homage to film noir contained in the skin of a sci-fi movie.
","When I first saw Blade Runner (1982) many years ago, I understood that it was the quintessential, if not the defining, cyberpunk film. Since I was used to the more modern cyberpunk at the time (a la The Matrix (1999)), I felt the slow unfolding of exposition wasn't nearly as action-driven as I had hoped it would be. Of course, at the time, I might not have been watching the ""Director's Cut"" version of Blade Runner, which was what I watched this time around. Needless to say, it's a much better movie than I initially remembered.<br/><br/>I think part of my improved assessment of this film came from a realization that it wasn't intrinsically a science fiction film. Sure, it is based on a story by Philip K. Dick, it is set in a fast-approaching and somewhat inaccurate representation of the future, and it has the trappings of a sci-fi film (i.e., androids, flying cars, technology, etc.), but at its heart, Blade Runner owes more to film noir than I realized. Take away the science fiction exterior, and you're left with the stark shadows filtering through the mists of cigarette smoke and humid clouds of Los Angeles while a ""detective"" tracks down the antagonist(s) of a crime. Classic noir.<br/><br/>Probably because I hadn't seen a lot of film noir before seeing Blade Runner the first time, I never could have made the connection that this film is not what it seems, almost becoming its own allusion to the ""hidden android"" motif. Sure, Blade Runner still stands as a founding film of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction, but it only does so through the superb atmosphere and ambiance that is created via the noir style from classics like Chinatown (1974) and The Third Man (1949). Clearly, director Ridley Scott knows how to infuse science fiction into other genres, with Alien (1979) combining sci-fi with horror, and Blade Runner combining sci-fi with film noir.<br/><br/>A superb homage to film noir contained in the skin of a sci-fi movie, I give Blade Runner 5.0 stars out of 5."

But this could very well be the precursor to all those different cyberpunk sagas. Here is the story of a gang of near-human androids known as Replicants who want to live comfortable lives. But not if the LAPD has anything to say about it. Harrison Ford plays a police detective whose job it is to eliminate these near-humans. Can he do it? Will the Replicants claim victory?

"theresamgill","7","2","3","12 June 2018"," More like Blade Jogger, but still obviously influential
","I gotta make sure I throw this disclaimer in near the beginning: Blade Runner is not an action sci-fi flick. Yes, it's from Alien director Ridley Scott who would later give us movies such as Gladiator and The Martian. But Blade Runner is much different. It certainly has sci-fi appeal and influence-- video games such as Final Fantasy VII and Mass Effect clearly took notes from the film, and directors such as Christopher Nolan have cited this film as inspiration, but it also doesn't fall into the trippier territory of films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Based on the cleverly titled book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Philip K. Dick (he died before the release of the film, but praised what he saw which was about the first 20 minutes), this movie is much more philosophical. Perhaps Blade Jogger would be a more fitting title-the pacing is very deliberate and not at all what I was expecting.<br/><br/> The movie stars Harrison Ford who was determined to not wear a hat because he was just coming from Raiders of the Lost Ark. The year is 2019 and genetic engineering has advanced so far as to create androids, or replicants, that are superior in intelligence and physicality. Their telltale sign is their responses to questions that are supposed to evoke human emotions. Created to work as slaves, replicants have rebelled in off-world colonies (remember this is 3 years from now) and are declared illegal on Earth and are to be terminated (they use the word retired) if found. This is where Ford comes in when it's discovered that 6 replicants have returned to Earth. Obviously, this has all the ingredients to be a thrilling action flick. But it takes a much different direction. Replicants are designed with a failsafe that automatically retires them after 4 years. It produces cool, thinking quotes like, ""It's too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?""<br/><br/> Ridley Scott liked the idea of Ford being a replicant, but Ford has stated that he despised that idea and said that before filming Scott agreed with him that his character is definitely human. Now I won't spoil anything, but I will say that it's a question toiled with during the film. Also, if you watch the movie, watch the director's cut version (which technically isn't fully Scott's cut) because the ending is much much better than the theatrical cut of the film.<br/><br/> Really, above sci-fi or philosophical or whatever, I'd describe this film as weird. I'm not sure what you're expecting from the film going in, but it's not what you're going to get. There isn't ever a clear tone established, and this just adds to the difficulty of describing just what the film is. Even the highly-regarded score switches from slow, dark melodies to jazzier moments. I will say, however, probably the most consistent element of the film is the lighting. It's certainly always on the darker side, but all the ways the light comes through in every scene is skillfully crafted.<br/><br/><br/><br/> In all honesty I can't even say I'm much of a fan of this film. I didn't care for how it was edited, and some of the sub-plots really were weird. The movie succeeds in getting you to think, but it also makes you wonder what you just watched. I'm not sure how many times or how precisely I can say it, but it's a strange film. Not strange like drug-fueled Trainspotting, and not confusing like Stanley Kubrick, but more cerebral like the very ends of the films 28 Days Later and Sunshine. I can't say you will enjoy this film (possibly because I can't say I enjoyed it), but I'm extremely curious about the sequel, and for that alone it might be worth checking this film out. And in case of rain, make sure to grab yourself a light-up umbrella. Those things are so cool.

","What does it mean to be human? The lines between man and machine are blurred in Ridley Scott's 1982 science fiction classic, Blade Runner. There are numerous theological, philosophical and literary references within the film (and many more within Phillip K. Dick's original story, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?) from the New Testament and Descartes to William Blake. The film, like all good works of philosophy, leaves the central question open for debate, however there is much evidence to suggest the filmmaker sympathizes heavily with that which cannot be defined as ""natural.""
 
In a show of intellectual superiority, Roy Batty, leader of the replicants recites an edited verse of William Blake: <br/><br/>""Fiery the angels fell; deep thunder rolled around their shores; burning with the fires of Orc."" <br/><br/>The original passage from America: A Prophecy reads as follows: <br/><br/>""Fiery the angels rose, and as they rose deep thunder roll'd. Around their shores: indignant burning with the fires of Orc."" <br/><br/>In context, Roy, along with all of the replicants are the ""fiery"" angels. They have come to the ruins of Earth (Hell) from the outer colonies in order to extend their lifespan and have brought with them their anger and resentment (""deep thunder""). Roy talks of living in constant fear as slaves do. This mission of extending their lives is their revolt against their masters. 
As the story progresses, the replicant characters become more and more human while Deckard, the main human character assigned to ""retire"" each replicant, loses touch with his humanity. He becomes desensitized by his monotonous, machine-like assignment, and his connection with the replicants grows stronger the more human they become. His love affair with Rachael is the only thing that allows him to grow an empathetic bond with the replicants, making each subsequent kill harder and harder.
When genetic engineer J.F. Sebastian meets Roy and Pris, he expects them to behave like the machines and toys he creates. ""Show me something,"" he asks. Roy swiftly responds with, ""We're not computers Sebastian. We're physical."" Roy, although conscious of being a replicant, firmly believes that his superior intellect and strength give him human qualities. He understands his life has value, however he lives as a slave on the run with an immanent expiration date. The human race sees him as nothing more than a liability; built as a Nexus-6 combat unit replicant to be decommissioned after four years in order to prevent any sort of rebellion or usurpation of human control. Pris follows up with some Descartes, ""I think, therefore I am."" The question is, who is more human, the replicants or their creators?
During the final confrontation between Roy and Deckard, we see Roy as an allegory for Christ. He shoves a nail into his palm in order to feel pain, as he knows that he will expire soon. Roy also carries a dove, the symbol of the Holy Spirit, and saves Deckard despite the sins he committed towards both he and his friends. We as a species have not only created something with superior-strength and intellect, but perhaps superior morals. Roy is a violent man and his actions are questionable, however he stands for his people and what he believes in. He values life so much that he saves Deckard so he may live the rest of his. The final ""Tears in rain"" monologue is heartbreaking, especially considering he is not human. Roy has given us reason to believe he is better than human. He is a god.
How can we stay in touch with our humanity? Is it our right to play God? Are we fit to judge which species deserve human rights and which do not? These are questions that skeptics, scientists, followers of Nietzsche and many others have grappled with. Blade Runner is a stylish movie with amazing characters that promotes the discussion of these issues, and is a landmark for both film and philosophy."

","There are few films which can even hope to parallel Ridley Scott's 1982 masterpiece when it comes to sheer atmosphere. The striking visual beauty of this film is simply awe-inspiring, but Vangelis' masterwork of a score and the pristine sound editing too create a brilliant soundscape that meshes together with the breathtaking cinematography, effects and direction to form a truly stirring experience. However, the plot is often aimless and eventually loses the noirish feel which was one of the movie's biggest selling points; despite this, Blade Runner is certainly not short of deep and thought-provoking themes. On the other hand, the majority of the characters are rather dull - even so, the dreamlike setting swallows you whole and really dispels any qualms you might have otherwise had. Although Blade Runner sometimes slows the pace down to truly questionable levels, this is still a timeless classic that deserves your attention if only for the soundscape and visuals, which create a dark, brooding but beautiful world. 2007's The Final Cut is the way to go."
"jimbo-53-186511","7","2","3","17 February 2018"," The story and characters are a little thin, but it still contains many strong elements
","Los Angeles 2019; a group of replicants have escaped from their own planet and are illegally residing on planet Earth. Their reasons for escape soon become clear as they are searching for the man that created them in order to extend their lifespan. It's up to former Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) to find the replicants and eliminate them as soon as possible...<br/><br/>Blade Runner is a film that had been in my watchlist for a number of years, but I finally managed to sit down and watch it today. Although it's dubbed as a 'classic' and a 'science fiction masterpiece' I tried to blank these thoughts out and try to take it for what it is and on that basis I found it quite enjoyable...<br/><br/>Granted the film is a little slow-paced and Harrison Ford's narration seems a little bit cheesy, but the fundamental aspects of the story are quite intriguing - fair enough there have been some copycat films that have followed Blade Runner (the recent Alex Garland film Ex Machina clearly owes some debt of gratitude to Blade Runner). I think the interesting thing about this film is that the replicants are painted in quite a negative light, but to be honest I did find myself having some empathy with their cause - they seemed to just want answers and weren't happy that they were only programmed to live for a total of 4 years. Yes the way they go about their business is questionable, but their cause is somewhat understandable.<br/><br/>A couple of failings with this film lie not with the story, but more with how it is developed; the replicants are represented as being self-aware, but emotionless yet other than this we are given little insight into them as characters. A lot of what I've said in the last paragraph are based on my own suppositions and whilst I don't mind figuring out some things for myself in a film I do feel as though I should be given something to work with in the first place. The same can be said for Deckard and his relationship with Rachael - she's an experimental replicant who is capable of emotion through brain implants (presumably in an attempt to fool the Blade Runners), but again this relationship is glossed over and isn't really given the attention that it perhaps deserves - which in some ways taints the warm and fuzzy way that the film ends.<br/><br/>Where the film does excel is in its visuals - it's a striking and beautiful looking film (it's actually scary watching this film now realising that it's only 1 year before it was set). Rutger Hauer is chilling as the leader of the replicants and his final showdown at the end with Harrison Ford was fantastic. A notable mention also should go to Darryl Hannah whose crazy assed antics made her fun to watch.<br/><br/>Blade Runner's thinly developed story and characters are the only really glaring flaws and are the main reasons why I can't bring myself to love it as much as many other people do. That being said though, it still has a lot going for it and is a film that I would still recommend."

","I could go on about a movie that is older than the Matrix and Gattaca and yet touches the question of ""What makes a human human?"" more convincingly than virtually all movies that came after it. <br/><br/>I'll cut myself short for one message:<br/><br/>WATCH THE DIRECTORS CUT. ONLY. <br/><br/>The initial reception of Blade Runner in its ""Theatrical Release"" was what it deserved, something around a 7/10. Because it was streamlined for a mass audience upon release, simplified to a detective story. The ""Directors Cut"" rectified this, thankfully, by adding crucial scenes (unicorn, the ""Immortal game"" as Tyrell's chess match) in favour of the botched ending for a much more thought-provoking and enigmatic movie. The slightly inferior, ""Final Cut"" version turned it into more of a modern action movie: Whilst still an enjoyable version to watch, it is a little on the nose, pushing its message forward and lacking the subtlety and precision of the DC. It's also more graphic - which, in this movie, is arguably entirely unnecessary.<br/><br/>In times of AI emulating humans better than ever before, this movie is as relevant as it is still entertaining. Watch it, if you like movies that make you think. It's bloody brilliant.<br/><br/>""You know what a turtle is? Same thing."""

The electronic score by Vangelis has to be one of the most beautiful works of electronic art ever made.

"mitchell5954","10","2","3","8 October 2017"," Not just one of my favorite science fiction films, but one of my favorite films period.
","Blade Runner is a sci-fi masterpiece. It has almost everything in a good sci-fi flick; breathtaking effects, a deep and philosophical story, good characters, amazing atmosphere, and a great cast. Harrison Ford brings his A-game with this one. This is probably one of my favorite performances of his. In my opinion this is Ridley Scott's best film, and one of my favorite movies period. Admittedly, when I first saw this movie I hated it. I gave the film another chance though and I grew to love it. The reason I didn't like it at first was because I wasn't in the right mindset for it. I was expecting a film like Star Wars which this is definitely not. You really have to be in the right mindset to view this. Blade Runner is not the movie you just pop in for a casual viewing to kill time or if you want to have a fun time. It's dark, atmospheric, philosophical, and has a downbeat tone throughout. This is most likely why Blade Runner didn't do well in theaters. This film came out the same year as E.T. Everyone wanted fun sci-fi which this film clearly isn't. Fortunately, over the years, it has become a cult classic, which it deserves to be.<br/><br/>The film takes place in Las Angeles in the dystopian future of 2019. We follow a retired cop named Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) who is called back to the force temporarily. Several human-like androids called replicants have gone rogue and it is Deckard's job to bring them down.<br/><br/>As I said, the film looks brilliant. I think the special effects are on-par with the Star Wars trilogy. Yes, it's not the most colorful looking film or very fun to look at, but that's the point. The film is going for a very realistic dystopian future with overpopulation, pollution, and very cultural. The acting is great particularly from Ford. The only characters worth mentioning are Deckard or the main replicants, Batty (Rutger Hauer). The story is told from their different perspectives. From following both of them we see both of their views on what it means to be human which is one of the main themes of the movie.<br/><br/>There are things that can be seen as flaws with the film. When I first saw the movie there were many things I didn't like about it until I tried to see things differently. Firstly, the film moves at a fairly slow pace or, at least, it felt that way. This is a trait you see in most Ridley Scott films. The atmosphere and overall feel of the film is a little too good if that makes sense. If you are the slightest bit sleepy this film can easily put you to sleep. I just about fell asleep on my first viewing. I'd watch the director's cut or the final cut of the film if possible. In the theatrical cut you have Harrison Ford give narrations throughout the movie, and it just made the film even more of a snore fest. The film is trying to build atmosphere and enthrall you into the world it's created, but some people will probably have issue with it. It's not bad but I do think people will think the film is too padded-out.<br/><br/>Another thing is the action scenes. The action in this film is not like Star Wars or Indiana Jones. Deckard is actually not a very good fighter. He gets his butt handed to him quite frequently by the replicants. This did really bother me on first viewing. However, I don't feel that way now. I think that the way they did the actions scenes made them feel more real. Besides, if they were to have Star Wars or Indiana Jones type action in this then it would conflict with the tone of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, Blade Runner is a classic movie that should be seen at least once. Just go in with the mindset that this is not like Star Wars, Total Recall, E.T., War of The Worlds, or any of those sci-fi films and you'll be fine. It's sad that it didn't get much recognition when it was first released, but at least it is getting the treatment it deserves now."
"Danielpotato","8","2","3","7 October 2017"," Firstly, and above all a visual experience
","I saw it for the first time, it was in 1996. It was the version released in 1982, I think it was that year, so in this review, I'll talk about this version made that year, because it was the first version that I saw. So to write a review, I will report the first experience.<br/><br/>I saw it for the first time and I was amazed at the visual department of the movie. A harmonious blend, with an exemplary cinematography. Incidentally, I was not the only one, because Blade Runner influenced countless people. It's a unique case where a quality of the film stands out more, which marks the film forever and the general public gets this impression. Blade Runner, and above all, a visual experience with little or no element of drama. It's a visual experience, and if people want to take advantage, they should leave that aspect aside. This is the highest quality of the film, the ability to enter the audience in a cohesive way in that universe and live a visual experience. It's like most sci-fi movies of the 80's, a movie with strong male influences. That is, you will get here, scenes of violence and some nudity to the mix. But Ridley Scott, controlled himself and did not let the train out of the line. Yes, you also have here the evil corporation, but it was done in a more discreet way possible. no exaggeration, of course This is the big difference between a mediocre director and a good director, having a good self-control. Putting things in your movie at random is too banal and mediocre.<br/><br/>The characters were well written, though Scott could not take much advantage of the great actors he had. Ridley Scott always had the problem of not being able to take 100% of the juice of the actors and put human emotions in his works, even in dramas (e.g. G.I Jane). But in this film, Rutger Hauer managed to put a lot of juice himself, especially in the third act, in the confrontation with Rick Deckard, which left the scenes excellent and striking like a great character. In the end, the film does not need much drama element, because there is something bigger here. An exploration, a discovery, that goes beyond the dramatic element. I think Ridley Scott got this great virtue. You get to get interested in the movie, even though it has very little character depth. This is because Scott, is primarily a visual director. There was not in the early 80's, director with better imprint for the visual department. And this for me, is a mark of success. You have difficulty in a job, however find other ways to overcome this same job or task. It is a high quality and a proof of great capacity. As the great director that Scott is, he finds it difficult to achieve characters' depths and achieve human emotions. He was able to create an experience almost 100% depth only with a single department, in this case the visual experiment. But let's be realistic, cinema is primarily a visual art. And like a visual work, Blade Runner is perfect at what it set out to do.<br/><br/>In addition to the timeless visual aspect of the film, Scott was able to insert an exemplary sound aspect that further helps the viewers to be inserted into the film in an exemplary and cohesive way. The soundtrack is almost perfect for this kind of movie, strong and simple. But very well built. The dialogue is also well written in this film. In spite of many clichÃ©s and typical of the 80's, it ends up disturbing the experience a little, but it does not end with the experience of the film, but it hampers a bit in the final balance of the film. This is the proposal of this film, and if the film itself is consistent with its proposal, why not consider the film, a good movie. In the end, if you can overcome, the lack of dramatic element and depth of the characters, and the typical characteristics of the male productions. You will find here a great experience to live. Even for the present day, a unique experience in its own kind."
"MovieSoup","9","2","3","8 September 2017"," This film is genius
","I watched this film a couple of weeks ago as the new 2049 one is coming out and I realised I had never seen the original before. People always told me it was a good film and worth watching. Having watched the film myself I can tell you these people are wrong. Blade Runner is a great film and you need to see it NOW!<br/><br/>The film is gorgeous in every sense of the word. This film is very noir and reminds me of detective noir movies like the Big Sleep or the Maltese Falcon. As you can imagine the cinematography is perfect and the CGI for its time is pretty impressive. The CGI is almost akin to Star Wars IV in how good it looks.<br/><br/>I love the scene in Tyrells office in the first 30 minutes of the film where Rachel is being interviewed. The use of colour and shadow in the office perfectly sets the tone for the interview between Rachel and Rick. The scene also illustrates why Ridley Scott is a great director. He is known in his movies for creating emotion trough darker surroundings and it's perfectly shown here. Ridley Scott has directed some brilliant movies like Alien, Thelma and Louise and Gladiator. However I think his best work has to be Blade Runner from a visual perspective alone.<br/><br/>The music in this film is sublime. It is very synth heavy and perfectly captures the tone and theme of the film. In some parts the music is soft with just faint piano playing to give us a feeling of intimacy which works really well, especially for the scenes between Rick and Rachel. In other scenes we get a fast pace synth heavy track that compliments all the dynamic movement that the characters are doing in the scene. Vangelis knows what he is doing in movies and lends his skills as a composer expertly here. Hats off to you sir ""we are not worthy""!!!! <br/><br/>The plot itself was based off a 1968 novel by Philip K. Dick called ""Do androids dream of electric sheep?"" The film does not follow the book to the letter but the bare bones of the book are there and also the message behind it. The plot is a slow burner in places however there is a fundamental question posed to the audience. ""What makes something a human being?"" The replicants in the film look like people, act like people and die just like people. There comes a point where the androids in the film become more human than the humans are and they express real emotions that are very complex for androids to understand.<br/><br/>The plot deals with mortality and the fear of death as well. The whole motivation for the escaped androids is that they do not want to die. Roy Batty goes after the ""cure"" to death and even goes so far as the meet his maker to try and stop death. When his creator says that escape from death is impossible Batty lashes out at first, and kills his creator and several others, however at the end of the film where he saves Rick Deckard from falling to his death he comes to some inner peace realising that death is inevitable. <br/><br/>The plot of this film has so many interpretations and has been discussed so many times that it has taken on a life of its own. I even may have interpreted it differently to others however the fact of the matter is there is not right or wrong way that a film can make you feel, it is personal to you.<br/><br/>The actors in this are brilliant. You can really tell that they gave a sh*t about the film and everyone brought their A game. Harrison Ford is great and gives one of the best performances of his career hands down! His scenes with Rachel where a high point as you could tell his infatuation was real and at the same time you saw Rick's torment as he realises Rachel is an android and not 100% human.<br/><br/>Rutger Hauer is fantastic as Roy Batty and crosses the line between human and android so convincingly that whilst watching the film you see him become more human with every scene. The scene where his character dies actually makes you feel for a murderous android, and his line about his memories being ""lost in time, like tears in rain"" had a certain melancholy feeling to the scene. <br/><br/>All I can say is that this film is brilliant in terms of plot, acting, music, looks and feel. The pacing is a little slow in parts, which meant I did lose concentration the first time I watched it, but not so much that it distracts from the film. In short this is a true classic and a must see for Sifi NERDS. Go see this film you will not regret it."

"Horror-yo","7","2","3","15 February 2017"," Aesthetically powerful, slow philosophical Sci-Fi
","This film imposes a difficult exercise for the critic. On one hand, it depicts powerful concepts, but on the other hand as a film lacks quite a bit in terms of pace and content. So basically put, its narrative is greater than its own self. The film is a much, much lesser effort than the themes it depicts.<br/><br/>Young Harrison Ford does alright, while Hauer (the villain) is decent as well but so much of this film is in the things it hints at rather than the things it actually actively does. Just Hauer himself is more a compelling character on an aesthetic level really.<br/><br/>The scenery is superb in places, really very impressive stuff visually for a 1982 production. But as so often with Ridley Scott sci-fi's, we're given a lot of arty stuff, of the rarest more sophisticated kind, along with very deep philosophical themes... but his films seem to always have that discrepancy in pacing and in actually developing those themes. This film borders on the genius in what it scratches on, but never achieves that genius because of how linear the scenes are, how excessively paced down the development occurs, and simply, how much the film focuses on all other things but those philosophical themes.<br/><br/>If you'd catch that film at any random point and watch on, you'd never think it was anything more than one of those hot crime type scifi's from the 80's. It's only towards the end we're revealed all the depth that was supposedly hiding in this work. But it's too late by then. A film with such conceptual density needs to, while still maintaining subtlety in execution, make it clear what it's about. Instead, we're really given a succession of scenes with little actual value in themselves: a common, linear body of sequences with ordinary, underwhelming events happening. The fight scenes are long and often in bad taste, most scenes are in themselves totally forgettable, and what really is praised in this one is the narrative and philosophical implications from the very end, so not the film itself but what it talks about.<br/><br/>So that's watching a full two hours of very ordinary, highly paced sci-fi, for just the one powerful scene at the end with the big quotes and all the poetry. It's totally underwhelming in light of what's put in the works. An artisan/craftsman needs to make his works shine and highlight its most precious qualities, not conceal or smother them while other aspects completely dominate the equation.<br/><br/>As trivia, this is a film that's influenced the band Fear Factory enormously, the band quoting many moments like: ""I want more life - it's too bad she won't live... but then again who does - that's what it is to be slaved""... and one must pay tribute to the use of the then very modern synth-based atmospheric soundtrack and how it mixes so well with the blueish/metallic overtone on the visuals, with the rain at the end and that poetic, genuinely deep moment. ""Our memories, like tears in the rain"".<br/><br/>As an ultimate philosophical ideal, this film is profoundly nihilistic. It's clearly saying man and machine are virtually the same thing so long as they are merely as intelligent, so long as they are sentient beings with memories. So no place for the soul, or a god. Organic=artificial, and there's no profound meaning to life.<br/><br/>The other thing is this film has an interesting twist, but again, does little in the way of clarity there.<br/><br/>A sympathy 7/10."

"Otaku_Master","Null","2","3","15 June 2004"," A Must See - Science Fiction at it's very best
","The 1991 Director's Cut (The Director's Cut is a lot different than the original theatrical release in 1982) of Ridley Scotts' classic film 'Blade Runner' is, by far, one of the greatest Science-Fiction movies ever made. 'Blade Runner' takes place in the far future where mankind has developed 'Replicants', genetically engineered robotic-human clones. 'Replicants' were designed to be physically superior to humans, but possess the same intelligence as the common human being. These androids are used as slaves for the 'hazardous exploration and colonization' of other planets in our solar system. At some point in time, (which isn't specified in the movie) a violent 'Replicant' revolt ensues on a colonized planet, this event causes replicants to be declared illegal on Earth, if a replicant is found on Earth it will be immediately destroyed. The title of the movie, 'Blade Runner', refers to a policeman whose job it is to shoot and kill any replicants they might find on Earth. <br/><br/>(All of this, of course, is explained in the first three minutes of the movie, much clearer, and much shorter, but I decided to write about it anyways)<br/><br/>The story is about a man named Rick Deckard (played by Harrison Ford), an experienced 'Blade Runner' who's unwillingly brought out of retirement to finish one last mission. Deckard has to track down four rogue replicants who have escaped from a planetary colony to Earth, killing innocent lives on the way. These four highly dangerous replicants are loose on the streets of L.A., and could kill again unless Deckard can deal with them first.<br/><br/>This film isn't the first time in the Sci-Fi genre for Ridley Scott. His previous film in the Science-Fiction genre is 'Alien', which is an extremely well presented Horror film in space. Ridley Scott knows how to establish a mood, in 'Alien' he makes the audience feel clustered, tense, and alone on a gigantic moving spaceship, the same in 'Blade Runner'. Deckard's' chase scene through L.A. in 2019, halfway through the movie, best describes the atmosphere of the film. Medium shots of Deckard running through the streets, culturally diverse extras constantly filling the screen, talking street lights, loud-annoying street sounds, all of the preceding things add up to a perfect feel of a technologically corrupted Los Angeles. The final segments of this chase scene use slow motion, and a very bluesy musical score that gives the scene such finesse that an audience can easily see the horror of what mankind, in the film, has become.<br/><br/>The overall presentation of 'Blade Runner' is very much like a gritty 1950's detective movie, with Harrison Ford in a majority of the scenes, becoming the stoic private eye who is fed up with his job. Ford has a knack for playing characters that are down on their luck, because of this he pulls off Rick Deckard's character flawlessly. Ford's calm and collected manner of performing all his actions fit the experienced 'Blade Runner' very well. All the roles in the film are played with great skill by the cast, every supporting performance adds to the magnificence of this film. The creator of the combat 'Replicant' models J.F. Sebastian is a timid scientist who lives with his homemade midget robots. William Sanderson, who plays Sebastian, portrays the shy scientist exactly how one would expect. Joe Turkel plays Tyrell, the owner of a major 'Replicant' producing company called Tyrell Corporation. Turkel also gives a great performance as an arrogant corporate owner. One actor to look out for is Rutger Hauer who plays the leader and most dangerous of the four escaped replicants, Roy Batty. The innocence he gives to the ruthlessly evil character is a scary thing to watch at times. What truly makes 'Blade Runner' a must-see film is its' dialogue, every conversation between characters has an underlying theme within it. One of my favorite lines is when Batty says 'We're not computers  we're physical'. The manner Hauer says it will get the viewer thinking. The writing also shines at the end with Roy's last lines in the film, overall a very moving script with a ton of different conversations that are worth listening to.<br/><br/> From the opening scenes of a horribly industrialized Los Angeles, to the chase on L.A.'s crowded streets, and finally the gruesome fight scene which concludes the movie, 'Blade Runner' is one of the breakthrough films in the Sci-Fi genre. This movie is a non-stop journey through a very realistic rendition of the future. The thing to watch out with this movie is also considered to be a Film-Noir. This means that certain characteristics will constantly take shape in the film. For example a Film-Noir will only promote the cynical side of human nature, thus the genre 'Film-Noir' is a very ugly look at life. Many factors in 'Blade Runner' add up to a classification of Film-Noir some of them are: - Deckard's primary job is hunting and killing androids, not a very joyous job. Deckard himself has a very cynical way of saying things. - L.A. is portrayed as a city overrun by smoke and fog. The exterior shots of the city usually incorporate rain. Many scenes take places in dark, gloomy, and empty streets. - As you watch the film you will notice that bright colors are rarely used and the city streets are in constant darkness(because of the pollution blocking the sun).<br/><br/>Film-Noirs are often filled with ambiguity and the protagonist is usually a depressing kind of guy. This might discourage people from watching it, but I highly recommend picking 'Blade Runner' up at the video store just to see at least one Film-Noir in your lifetime. This genre is one of those things that you either love or you hate, a proper Film-Noir will usually not have a picture perfect ending so don't expect one from 'Blade Runner' (at least the Director's Cut anyways). <br/><br/>It is a highly overlooked film nowadays, when the common movie-goer thinks of Sci-Fi immediately big name titles like: The Star Wars Saga, Star Trek, The Matrix Trilogy, The Terminator, etc. are what they would think of. Blade Runner is the true definition of the Sci-Fi genre; it doesn't have the fun and games of Star Wars, or the huge firefight scenes of the Matrix, but delivers thoughts on what it means to live, what our future holds, and a serious outlook on humans in general."
"JumeirahSun","10","2","3","11 February 2002"," Deep as an urban ocean
","Blade Runner is one of those movies you either get or you don't.  Some people find it bizarre and disturbing.  My father loves this movie and I watched it for the first time with him.  Blade Runner is complex and entrancing--the special effects still blow me away.  The gritty world created by Scott in this film is so believable that I wanted to become part of it.  Many fans of Dick's writing hold the movie up to the book, pointing out ""mistakes"" and other changes the script makes to Deckard and to the plot, but I think this is an erroneous argument.  Scott's film shows us a realistic portrayal of what city life might become, and focuses less on the man vs. machine theme of the book.  The two should be enjoyed as separate works, for each is superior in its own way.  Scott's Blade Runner is film noir meets sci-fi, and the result is magical.  Vangelis' floating, mysterious score doesn't hurt things, either; in fact, without it, I dare to say that the impact of the movie would not be as great."
"Albert J. Katraz","2","10","28","7 February 2000"," Sorry, but I hated it.
","After hearing wonderful things about it and reading rave reviews here on IMDb, I finally rented Blade Runner (Director's Cut). And what an incredible let-down it was. I had heard that it wasn't an action-packed, fast-paced film, but I was expecting something...the word evades me....good, perhaps. Thought-provoking. Interesting or original. The movie I saw was none of these. Instead it was 1) unforgivabley slow-moving and 2) very dated.<br/><br/>It started off with promise. The beginning scroll was enough to lure me in, and the interview with Leon was cool. But then we get to the parts where Harrison starts sneaking around, looking for clues. I was told that the original version had Ford reading a monologue during these parts, but that it was cut out for the Director's Cut. Why?? The deadly silence makes it boring beyond belief! I usually don't mind slow-moving movies, but I dozed off several times during this one.<br/><br/>Another problem is that although this is a sci-fi futuristic film, it has a severe 80's look, especially the ladies' hair styles. I'm sure it worked well back in '82, but here in 2000 I find it very distracting. And the idea of machines having feelings isn't a particularily original one nowadays - I'm sure it was fairly interesting when it first came out, but my reaction to the premise in general was ""yeah....AND...?"" (i.e, nothing new.)<br/><br/>I will give this another chance and rent the original version, but I'm doubtful that it will redeem itself. It may be an allegory of truth and value of life to some people, but in my opinion it's just a big ball of nothing trying to be meaningful. It's just not good.<br/><br/>Al's Rating: 2/10<br/><br/>The 2 points are for Harrison Ford and Rutgar Hauer."

","The film Blade Runner set in the future of earth and is about a cop, played by Harisson Ford a great actor for this role, commanded by the Police to find 5 Replicas. A intresting concept, but its not the story which make the film so speciell and awsome. Dont get me wrong the story is decent and its perfect for the films envoirment. But I really loved the sorroundings and how realistic it is, Its not like any other futuristic film which have flying cars or any other too futuristic props. No Blade Runner shows how the future have studied robots and how the worlds different culture, Japan, german, American, etc, have grown togheter and how the growth of People on earth. I also love the buildings and their textures in this movie and the old style they have. Especielly Sebastianns house. And how they have made the envoirment blend in so realistic is just amazing, and it doesnt look to futurestic, love the haze and the rain, which really make an cozy and a dream like feeling.<br/><br/>Anyhow the story-LINE is also very masterful created and exicuted, with so many elements, and still making it work. It just so simple but genius at the same time, Its really good how they dropped a little love and romance to the film, with not at all destroying the other story just impeoving the whole movie and provides a great ending.<br/><br/>The films message is not so hurtful and big like in anyother movies Ive seen lately, it just so blends in and flow with the story. Its totally amazing. Like the Replicans just wanted to live and asked their self the question everybody asks their self. Harrisons last words to on the roof is just too great. And one thing I also had to note is that these robots or Replicans is not drasticly over powered like in other movies, and their not annoying their just a perfect Replicas of the human race. And that is what Ive talked about earlier, how realistic, if you can say so, The film is.<br/><br/>So absolutly best sci-fi movie Ive whatched and can express of perfect it really is."

","Not necessarily being a sci-fi geek yet not necessarily disliking the genre sometimes has its advantages. To be quite honest I am still not able to determine what makes me like one science- fiction movie and hate the other but with Blade Runner I can finally put into words why I was very impressed. <br/><br/>It's amazing to watch a movie from the 80s and be so pleasantly surprised by the quality of the decor and special effects, it looks better than some movies from the 2000s! So Blade Runner takes place in 2020 which is now just 3 years away, but I can imagine at that time it must have felt like the very distant, scary future that was yet to come. We see a very cold looking and industrialized Los Angeles where it always seems to be misty and dark. What's left of the towns population has moved into huge skyscrapers. We get introduced to the ""replicants"" which are just basically extremely real looking, perfect versions of humans who are able to develop both feelings and a consciousness which is ironically the reason they are doomed to only have a 4-year lifespan. <br/><br/>It's so interesting and frightening at the same time to imagine that we could make artificial life, only for it to develop into something stronger and more capable than ourselves and ending up with catastrophic consequences. Also the idea that these replicants value life much more than actual humans holds a very important message. Would we, if ever confronted with the problem of robots taking over, even deserve to outlive them? The philosophy behind the movie is something that especially in this day in age is a frequently discussed topic. Where on the one hand we feel excited that technology is making spectacular progress in increasingly shorter periods of time we on the other hand feel very frightened we may not be able to keep up with our creations. I love how to writers leave this topic abstract to a certain degree, which allows the viewer to interpret it in its own way without undermining the quality of the story.<br/><br/>It's very interesting how Blade Runner presented the future in a way that now turns out to be both way off and realistic at the same time, before watching the new installment I would highly recommend checking this classic out first and forming your own opinion on it."

","The original Blade Runner, directed by then relative newcomer Ridley Scott, is loosely based on a Philip K. Dick novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, but the only things similar are the setting and some of the characters. Even the story only superficially resembles the original written work. As thus Blade Runner has come to stand as its own thing, an inspiration for future films and the cornerstone of an entire subgenre of science fiction. Namely, that of cyberpunk.<br/><br/>The story within the movie goes that Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is called back into service as a blade runner. Those being hunters tasked with identifying and 'retiring' rogue replicants, artificial humans. Four of these have just arrived on Earth, and Deckard's old boss wants them found and retired. In pursuit of this goal we explore the world of 2019 Los Angeles as well as the themes of humanity versus robotics, the meaning of lifespan, mileage versus years and the illusion of memories.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is a slow movie, especially the director's cut that removes the narration added to the theatrical release and returns some of the gorier shots. The film is not terribly action-packed, but rather a neo-noir film set into a dystopian future. It's a detective story through and through, with a philosophical undertone. And for what it is, it's one of the best examples there are. This is a film you can get obsessed over. It almost always requires multiple viewings before you start to truly appreciate it. But when you do, it will likely become one of those defining films, which you'll use to rank all the others like it. And, as stated, it is something of a genre-starter and I'd dare to say that modern science fiction owes a lot of its style and feel to this film. All science fiction.<br/><br/>Is it a bit slow? Yes. Is that a problem? You shouldn't let it be. Is it an amazing look into the future of humanity and the rise of man-made intelligence? Absolutely!"
"w00tw00td00d","Null","1","1","19 May 2003"," A beautiful and marvelous film - quite possibly the best science fiction film ever made
","This text is referring to the director's cut of Blade Runner. What is science- fiction? Is it a future world controlled by machines that involves virtual reality? e.g. The Matrix Or is it something happier, but a world rid of crime? e.g. Minority Report Could it be a world that is dark and is dominated by large skyscrapers and the streets filled with all sorts of character? Enter Blade Runner. Ridley Scott was a new comer at the time of making Blade Runner, and was also quite interested in science- fiction/ fantasy. He completed Alien a few years earlier and three years later he'd make Legend. But the real mastermind behind Blade Runner is of course Phillip K. Dick, who wrote the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Having read the novel, it would only seem fair for me to judge on both levels of an adaptation and a film alone. Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, a futuristic cop also known as a Blade Runner who's duty consists of hunting down robots who appear to be humans, known as Replicants. After a fellow officer is wounded and ends up in critical condition, it is Deckard's job to hunt down six deadly Replicants who killed the crew of their ship and are now lose in L.A. The year is 2017, and the world mainly consists of Asian overtones, with floating vehicles and colorful ground leveled areas. As Deckard, Ford does a noteworthy job by portraying the overall sad and tired quality of Deckard, his performance is certainly not exceptional by any means but it fits the story. On top of it all, this is the Rick Deckard from the novel. Rutger Hauer plays Roy Batty, the mysterious and dangerous leader of the Replicants, who's performance is one of dark strength yet at the same time a sort of provactive mystery. He says his lines with a curious yet commanding voice, and he is definitely the top performer in the cast. Sean Young plays Rachel, a mysterious worker of Tyrell who later becomes somewhat involved with Deckard. Also in support is Darly Hannah as the seductive but harmful Replicant Pris, and James Edward Almos as Gaff, a mysterious man who knows more about Deckard then the viewer seems to. The cast isn't exactly exceptional by all means, they don't turn in Oscar refined performances by any means but it fits the bill. Written by David Web Peoples and Hampton Fancher, the script loosley ties in with the novel but still captures the important essence of it. It's a solid script, could use a bit more attention to detail but there are some definitely remarkable lines. Ridley Scott directs with a real persistence for story and characters, and he is also the man responsible for delivering all the goods. His direction is fully realized and fully capable, painting such an illusive and enchanting vision of a nightmarish future. As an adaptation of a novel, it's not the best one ever, but is still somewhat succesful but it stands out more as film. Science fiction features like Blade Runner come in few numbers, and such beautiful and tight special effects that perfectly balance out with the story are hard to find. This is a film that should always be treasured, a gem that will stand the test of time. Grade: A +"

I find the Plot a little weak for a Sci-Fi movie that isn't all Action, I was expecting more of a plot since this is part Drama. The second flaw is that Harrison is not that good in his role as Deckard. By no means is he bad but he just isnt that convincing. Because of these flaws I cannot call this the best Ridley Scott movie. It is his 4th best though, just a tiny cut under Alien."

","(The famous spoilers shall follow).   To everybody who likes this movie, I say ""ditto"".  It is multilayered, moving, and looks great. <br/><br/>
    I would like to respond to a post that someone left earlier this year. This person commented on the scene where Deckard prevents Rachel from leaving his room, shoves her against the wall,and manipulates her into sleeping with him. She comments that Blade Runner fanatics must not realize there is anything wrong with this. Give me a break. One doesn't have to agree with all of the main character's actions in order to like a movie. This individual also charged Ridley Scott with racism, complaining he indirectly used the frequent Japanese and Chinese characters as scapegoats for the inhumanity of technology. I never associated Blade Runner's high Asian population with the replicant experiments. It just always struck me as a visual way to suggest this was in the future. Census figures are not frozen, they do change. Yes, we have the Chinese character who designs replicant eyes. But we also have white genetic experts in Sebastian, and the powerful Tyrell.  Please. There's enough racism in this world already. No need to sound alarms in corners where it doesn't exist.<br/><br/>    And I must say, I am not entirely happy with the notion that Deckard is a replicant, as the DC version indicates.  I feel the question of ""what does it mean to be human?"" is covered well enough with all of the other replicants. By the end we've already seen a demonstration of two robots' love for one another (Roy and Pris). Deckard's love interest, Rachel, is also a replicant. To then learn that Deckard is supposed to be a replicant is redundant. Why not leave Deckard human so we can also ponder the idea of a human and a replicant having a deep relationship?"

But the story and it's characters are pure genius.<br/><br/>Each character was unique and identifiable.  Actor/Actress selection was perfect.  Harrison Ford, Joe Turkel, Joanna Cassidy, Rutger Hauer etc, etc, etc....<br/><br/>The movie has an obvious ""dark"" atmosphere about it and if you don't like Sci-Fi, best you not watch this flic.  But to me, this is true Sci-Fi.  If you stretch your imagination into the future, perhaps almost believable in some respects.<br/><br/>Today's Sci-fi movies tend to rely heavily on visual effects to draw it's following.  In contrast, Blade Runner is a well thought-out story.<br/><br/>I heard a rumor once, that a sequel was being considered.  That makes me a little nervous.  Sequels can have such a way of diminishing the original production if you don't get it right.

They have a limited life span but are forbidden on Earth under penalty of death, and this is the Bladerunners job, to hunt them down and ""retire"" them.<br/><br/>They are stronger and faster than real humans which makes a Bladerunners job so much more difficult. these replicants have decided they want to live longer and have sought out their creators. People like Choo (who makes eyes), JF Sebastian (who designs replicants) and Eldon Tyrell (the self styled ""God of bio mechanics).<br/><br/>this film explores identity, the concept of the self and if we truly know ourselves from our memories.<br/><br/>After the 15th viewing of this classic I finally found what I was looking for! Ridley Scott hides the evidence that Deckard is a replicant in plain sight, right in front of our faces. I must have been an idiot (with an IQ of 118) not to spot what Gaff says in his final scene. ""You've done a man's job, sir"" Thank you Ridley. I see the light now!"

","The views in Blade Runner, from the beginning, are just amazing...that's all i know how to put it. It's not flashy and screaming for attention like today's science fiction movies.<br/><br/>If futurism was art, Blade Runner's subtle futuristic details (including such things from architecture to the gleaming sky) would be more Ancient Egypt or Renaissance than 3-year-old with neon finger paint for recent Sci-Fi films. Not meant to be so scathing of today's films, but when I first saw Blade Runner I was awed. It was so stylish, so smooth, so elegant. Maybe I'm looking at it from an odd perspective, but I found the entire movie, Ridley Scott's amazing use of light (or should I say usually lack of), and all the carefully placed metaphors to just be incredible. Looking back at Star Wars, it definitely lacks (in all aspects) and just can't compare. If a movie was all looks and no content, it would be flat and not be able to support its own weight and it only crumble!! it would just get bad reviews =)] However, Ridley Scott drew on inspiration from 2 well-known books (the title book-""Blade Runner"", and ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?""). While relying more on the concepts of ""Do Androids"",  Ridley still changed the plot greatly while managing to come out with a big ""thinker"" movie. The producers attempted to change his final product but now (19 years later) usually you can get it in the True original form, the Director's cut. One of my favorite scenes, the unicorn scene where Deckard has a dream of a unicorn while playing the piano in a daze, is one of my favorite scenes and is cut out of the ""edited"" version. This scene could be interpreted as important to understanding stuff in the movie, but I'm gonna make you watch it to figure out why!<br/><br/>Maybe the greatest thing about Blade Runner is the philosophy aspect of it. Without giving away crucial parts of the film, the best scenes were the ones involving the ""Replicants"" (androids) where one's mirroring emotions of sympathy and anger push back and forth at seeing these killing machines defend their humanity and right to live before their human counterparts. I also found the humans' seemingly lack of understanding of the very things they created intriguing as well. All these things the movie dealt with; but to understand better you must watch the movie.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is an amazing movie, and I would say Harrison Ford's best science fiction movie ; ). If anyone has not seen this movie they need to get to a movie store and rent it now because it is one of the greatest movies ever. Philosophical, futuristic, stylish, just plain awesome: Blade Runner!"

","I have seen several movies in my time, too many really. But this one has a big question mark over its head. Unexplained blue's and philosophical mishaps can question its existence. The existence of people that is. The point that the movie is trying to get across is life is precious. Phillip K Dick and Riddley Scott had the same intent.<br/><br/>Excellent acting done by Harrison Ford and the replicants (Sean young, Rutgar Hauer, Daryl hannah, Joanna Cassidy, and the deceased Brion James.) They're acting is good enough to provoke a sensitive look on what the intent of the story was. Excellent lighting to form a gritty look on the future in 2019. Skyscraping buildings portray an excellent set decoration that should have won the oscar in 1982.<br/><br/>Perfection by Art decoration in the urban streets of LA 2019. This movie also shows how much pollution the world has left behind. Constant acid rain, garbage, smoke etc. It depicts very well how careless humans can be to the minds of others. Who knows maybe we will suck up every resource on this earth and have to move to another planet to colonize.<br/><br/>Excellent director Ridley Scott who brought you Alien, Thelma and Louise, and Gladiator. This Movie is derived from the novel ""Do androids dream of electric sheep."" It sounds kind of off ended but you will know what it means after seeing this movie. Very good plot and visual effects that should have wiped out E.T. in the oscars but before 1991 Blade Runner was stuck with a voice over narration by Harrison Ford which removed its dark noir inquiry.<br/><br/>When you watch the movie you can tell how even the replicants can have biological ""FAKE"" emotions.But the question you must ask yourself is, is it moral to the humain protocal. When they are being retired they hang on to their life as much as we do. Their struggle till their last drop of sweat is out of their blood and they mearily colapse to the powerful impact of a 38. magnum. Should creations we make ourself that initiate to environment we collapse to their knee's and receive enforcement.<br/><br/>The movie is the best portrayer of that senario only in a dark un-narrated fashion. Adamant reactions is what Gadhi had although in this futuristic sci-fi noir the only possetion is a story to tell. The damask rose and oragami figures are the symbols that personify the reactions and co-essence of humans and their genetic creations.<br/><br/>The only way to understand is to try and interpret Blade Runner Or ""do androids dream of electric sheep"" by Phillip K. Dick. Questions still arise and vivid deciphering of what the novel meant is still oblivious to us.<br/><br/>The Directing, set direction/art direction, and music by Vangelis vives a perfect atmosphere for this movie. If your strategem is in the mode for a confusing dark frightening noir I suggest seeing this movie"

","The plot centers around a BladeRunner and his latest job - to retire a number of run-away replicants in a futuristic (2019) Los Angeles. This is a truly amazing piece of art: director Scott's direction and eye for details is stunning; the set design and art direction is flawless; the cinematography and musical score is breathtaking; the acting is solid - and in Hauer's case rather touching as well.<br/><br/>It's not a film to embrace easily, and obviously not in everybody's taste, as evidenced by some entries here. But the overall ""feel"" and atmosphere of this movie is something special, especially if you view the ""Director's Cut"". It has some minor, but important, changes compared to the first release from 1982. The widescreen version is a must, since the visuals are absolutely top-notch, and Scott really uses all of the possibilities of a widescreen movie.<br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" is it's own universe, and a major milestone in film making! View it, but give the movie the time it needs to really sink in. They don't do movies better than this! A final word of caution: The DVD edition of the director's cut of ""Blade Runner"" is, in my opinion, rather disappointing. No extras, no trailer, no nothing. Just the movie! On the other hand, that is (almost) good enough, since the widescreen transfer is of very good standard regarding soundtrack and picture quality. Enjoy it!"
"samuelzo_carroll","3","7","18","22 February 2011"," Let-down much?
","First let's get something straight. I am 17 and the only reason I watched this was for school. This movie was made 30 years ago and somehow I don't think teenage males were the target audience, so if I actually enjoyed this movie it would be a miracle.<br/><br/>That being said there are a few factors you can simply judge a movie on to determine whether or not it's good. One of them would probably be character development. Another would probably how well the story is told. Well the main character is given no back story whatsoever and spends the all but the last 10 minutes either apathetic, bored or startled (sidenote: the best bladerunner ever was nearly killed easily twice?). The antagonists are portrayed as evil right up until the last 10 minutes. Not misunderstood or desperate, just evil. The only time they are portrayed as desperate it comes off more as dire manipulation; oh and the desperation is portrayed by the actors saying ""we're desperate"" with sad looks. THIS IS NOT GOOD CHARACTERISATION. Antagonists can be evil...in comic books and Michael Bay movies. There is literally a scene where they find a genetic engineer working in a freezing environment and they strip him of his coat and then interrogate him while he freezes to death...for no conceivable reason (especially seeing as it took the guy twice as long to tell them the important information as he shivered)<br/><br/>I have not yet spoken to one person who could understand what was going on until they watched it twice. Well...sort of twice. None of those people managed to actually finish the movie in their first viewing.<br/><br/>Up until now I have tried to stay away from saying exaggerated things. But seriously...this might be the worst portrayal of the future I have seen. I mean honestly it just seemed like they made a list of cultural things, then just went the opposite way.<br/><br/>All in all I have 3 stars instead of 1 because the ending is good (if a bit forced with the dove/soul metaphor). But as many other reviews say: 10 good minutes at the end do not make up for 2 hours of crap."
"pvanhecke","4","7","18","23 October 2006"," Why the drooling blind respect?
","Hoping to be intellectually, philosophically and otherwisely thrilled to bits after having read these glowing, overflowing with praise-reviews, I watched BR the director's cut yesterday. I cannot for the life of me even begin to see what made these reviewers write what they did. The film has fantastic and potent music, an efficiently grimy atmosphere and decent acting, but that's it! Nothing remotely special here. The thing that made me cringe the most, was the almost stupefying awe so many of the reviewers had for the so-called deep philosophical thematics of the film. Let's get things in perspective: the human-robot theme, its implications on the human condition and one freaky looking professor genius 'playing God' having created it all is NOT what I call an intriguingly abstruse view on man and his role in life. I call it very, very cliché and done about a thousand times before, during and after. And all the while I was reading about Scott's stupendous vision and take on man's complexity and how he forced the viewer to see things his way. Let's get things in perspective once again: Scott is a (good) director, but as with any director, his main task consists of telling actors where to go and stand and how to deliver their lines, only occasionally conferring with the writer as to how this or that scene might be interpreted and filmed. In this particular film, it seems to me that Scott's main contribution was him incessantly coaxing one or other stage hand to set the smoke/water-machine to full blast! There wasn't one scene without smoke or water: it's not difficult then to create 'an awesome atmosphere, presaging the dark reality of what human life is surely to become'. The film for me is a simplistic, superficial little story told in a pretentious and portentous manner, apparently convincingly enough to fool so many into thinking that here is a true cinematographic masterpiece that will stand the test of time. It didn't stand the test of its runtime, I'm afraid."
"Asimov42","4","7","18","23 February 2005"," Visually impressive, but lacks story and focus.
","Like I said, visually impressive, but lacks focus on the main character. <br/><br/>Most of the film is spent watching the antagonist(s) story, while slightly interesting it is not very compelling or attention grabbing. It's simply there in front of your face. When we cut back to Deckard's story it is more interesting but lacks material to generate a good engaging story that we desire. <br/><br/>Hence at the end, the film feels half-baked. If another writer, or even the same writer, did another couple of drafts on the screenplay it probably would have made a world of difference. Sadly Blade Runner wasn't given those extra drafts."
"iheartkp","Null","7","18","26 October 2002"," Dull, shallow SF film
","I saw this film several years ago and remember being disappointed with it. I saw it again after I read the book recently, and was again disappointed. For all the hype and critical acclaim, there's very little to recommend ""Blade Runner.""<br/><br/>It's based on ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,"" by the great SF writer Philip K. Dick, and the film is a very loose adaption.  That might be okay, except that they took out all the deep, interesting aspects of the book- especially the spiritual themes dealing with the futuristc religion, which is central to the novel.  Guess they can't have anything to do with religion in a Hollywood film.  Also, the characters are so bland.  I know, that's the point, humans have been dehumanized by technology, etc. But I haven't found this to be true in rel life and it certainly isn't true in the novel.  the humans are very human in the novel, concerned with being accepted by society, being loved, rising in social status, etc.  And it is easier to relate to Deckard in the novel, than Deckard in the film b/c he is more like us in the novel.  Also, the movie mostly ignores the animal aspect of the book (in the book most animals are extinct so if you own one it is a sigh of social status- also it is considered very wrong to eat an animal) so when the few references are made to animals, like the electronic owl or the empathy test Deckard gives, it remains unexplained.<br/><br/>Okay, aside from taking out all the good parts of the book, it's not a good film anyway.  As to it being a film noir, this is true.  Stylistically it is very dark, no heros, murder plot, etc.  However, the great film noirs like ""Double Indemnity,"" and ""Chinatowne"" are great because they have engaging plots, with many twists and turns.  ""Blade Runner"" has a plot that can be summed up in one brief sentence.<br/><br/>This is basically a film that puts style over substance.  The cinemetography and art direction are impressive.  The score by Vangelis is awesome.  But there's nothing to the film except some suggestiveness that technology is bad because it dehumanizes man, and androids as ""the other"" should be accepted maybe.  Of course these themes are nothing new, and the film does not present them in a fresh way, but rather within the confines of a dull film.<br/><br/>It was a bad film, but I will say that the ending where Roy Batty makes his speech on top of the building was a great scene, surprisingly moving, especially considering that the rest of the film is so tedious.  For a minute it almost made me want to like it."

","I first saw this movie when I was an innocent, unworldly teenager and thought it was boring, slow and though visually very good, disappointing overall. Then I matured, experienced life and decided to watch the blu-ray version as I have often found movies I didn't like first time were so much better second time around. As I watched, I realised there was so much more to the spectacle than what is agreeably some of the finest cinematography ever to grace the screen. I understand the relationship, self-realisation, ethical and moral situations and dilemmas involved in the characters and dark noir- esque world created all those years ago, but the movie itself is still too slow and still too boring. Furthermore, I wasn't intrigued enough to care about the characters and acting involved. I am a huge fan of Ridley Scott and of movies that take some time to build plot and 'force' the story along at a relative snail's pace providing the characterisation is first rate. The Name of the Rose with Sean Connery is a great example of this and I rate that much higher. Sadly, my second watching of the movie was about as enjoyable as the first. It's OK, not great."
"toll-8","4","6","15","28 March 2012"," Looks great, deep message, poor story
","Blade Runner is a film I had grown up hearing so much about, but one that I had never actually watched. It is a film that is often called the most inspirational and I hear it changed sci-fi movies for the better. Due to this I thought it was about time to sit down and watch it.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford plays Deckard, a cop in Los Angeles in 2019. LA is now entirely futuristic, which back in 1982 you may have presumed it would be but today you will see how away from the mark it is. It is home to giant billboards advertising anything and everything. A dark, gloomy, and wet atmosphere heavily influenced by the Japanese, and above all flying cars. To be fair some of it was right on the money. Deckard is a cop known as a blade runner. A blade runner is a certain unit that hunts down replicants (artificial humans) that were created for off-world work. Every now and again replicants go missing and blade runners must stop them and retire them. Deckard is brought out of his own retirement to hunt down six replicants who have escaped and are on Earth searching for their maker in order to prolong their life. Due to replicants growing emotion over time, each has a life span of four years, however when these replicants realise this they head to meet their creator and keep themselves alive. Deckard must stop them before they get too far, unfortunately for him he meets one of these replicants and falls in love with her. Does he retire her?<br/><br/>All of that is generally the back story and what you need to know to understand the basis of the film. Really the film is about Deckard hunting the replicants and falling in love. For those of you that have seen it you will understand what I am about to say, it isn't really about any of that. It is full of philosophical issues that will have you thinking after the film has finished. When this film was first released it wasn't well received and people have taken to it after numerous viewings and discussion. Believe me you must have to watch it more than once because I've seen it once and it is really dull. That may cause unrest with people but I have to say I didn't think much to it. I understand the philosophical views hidden deep but I don't see how that makes it a good movie. There is no real story. The themes could have still been explored with more going on but it was just a lot of sitting around and not doing much. It really wasn't what I was expecting. For starters the villain doesn't really show up till over an hour in, so far into it that I forgot there was even a bad guy. The love scenes didn't work as the characters weren't believable, I understand after reading discussions why that might be, but that isn't good for the average movie goer that wants to leave the cinema happy and finished with it. Not everyone likes to research into the movie. I can really see why it has taken time to be a cult film as it has given people time to put forward their theories which people will then relate to it on another viewing. I'm sorry but I don't get it.<br/><br/>I can however understand why it has influenced so much. The visuals alone are stunning, and the fact it was made twenty years ago is not noticeable. If it was released in cinemas tomorrow you would not have known it was made two decades ago. The production design completely outshines any story within this film. I can also see the influence within the philosophical themes and how they have opened up many questions. Are replicants human if they believe they are? In the film they are implanted with memories to make them believe they are real, but are they real if their memories aren't actually theirs? I get that these questions are well explored, and I do like to see this in a film, but I was not hooked on the story. It never really drew me in and I was waiting for the action to kick off and it never did. It was so disappointing. It does have brilliant things about it but the entire outcome of the film is completely dull. Hopefully over time I may come to like it and understand it more. Maybe I don't like it because I don't get it and maybe that is the problem. I'm sure people will completely disagree with this but something more had to grab my attention and it didn't.<br/><br/>The look of the film is the top draw of this movie. It looks absolutely fascinating, and I would say to watch it just to see how good it is. The acting is generally OK but nothing great. To be fair the characters were so dull that they had little to work with, although some are replicants so that could make sense. The love story is really forced and I never believed it. However there can be an explanation for all of this..... This could be a spoiler, but then again after watching it you'll realise it is not. Six replicants escape, we only ever meet five! Have a watch and you might understand why the movie is why it is.<br/><br/>2 / 5<br/><br/>For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com"

","OK this movie has a cult following etc. but it is boring and produces limited action. Thumbs up to the special effects which are terrific and nothing short of spectacular. But otherwise it is a lifeless movie with Harrison Ford giving a droning Phillip Marlow type narrative. The characters are of little interest. There is an acute absence of humor which could have given the film some life. The plot is also muddled. I read the novel the film is based upon ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" after seeing the movie. The book is fairly interesting while dealing with a strange subject matter. The movie could have expanded on the novel by making the androids more dynamic and having some sequences dealing with what was happening on the planets they were leaving. But it chose to keep the action in a boring inexplicably rainy, oriental populated LA. Honestly movie fans, take away the special visual effects and you have a yawner movie."

","The movie is heavy on images and special effects, and Ridley Scott really knows how to create a Sci-Fi universe, but there ins't much of a story or substance. Therefore, one similar type of movie I'd like to compare this to is The Crow.<br/><br/>The Crow, which I thought was a pretty good movie, also is heavy on visuals and action and nothing else. However, The Crow was all wall to wall with action scenarios. It's filmmakers knew they were making a film without much story and just an idea. Where as the filmmakers of Blade Runner gave this movie a lot of meaningless dialogue and other little things which should have been plot points but weren't really.<br/><br/>There are two solutions the writers could have done. One is two rethink the entire movie and come up with a lot more plot and fill in the long empty gaps that the movie already has in between the action scenes. The next is if they couldn't think of much plot for there idea, just give the story a lot more continuous action or something stylish happening, like in The Crow. That's what kept The Crow going, and in that audiences don't look for anything else."

","Blade Runner has a very weak story line, a slow pace, and poor character development. Its reliance upon special effects and scenery reminds me of the first Star Trek movie, which had similar weaknesses.<br/><br/>For me to enjoy a movie, it is important that I care about the characters. Ironically, the only one I cared about even a little was the replicant, Rachael. Until she meets Deckard, she is unaware that she is a replicant, and this knowledge is a blow to her. The desire for a manufactured being to be a real human is reasonably well portrayed, but better examples are Pinocchio,and Commander Data of Star Trek TNG. What is unclear to me is why Rachael would bother saving Decards life - he has no personality or redeeming features. <br/><br/>I also find a couple of aspects of the ending unbelievable. It is illogical and out of character for Roy Batty to prolong the fight with Deckard, especially when Deckard starts to inflict serious damage to him. His saving Deckard and his dying speech are similarly ridiculous. And when Deckard and Rachael escape the nasty LA scene for they mountains, I wondered why would anyone stay in LA if that is an option?<br/><br/>If you want to see an engaging well made movie of a Phillip K Dick story, I recommend Minority Report instead."

And, just to mention(because of a little bit annoying fans) i UNDERSTOOD the movie. Although i like the scenery A LOT, everything else was just a no pass for me. The characters are completely empty (human or nonhuman) and there's a complete lack of any pace or dynamic in this movie. I just don't know.....maybe this is one of those movies (for me at least) that everyone said: ""oh you have to watch blade runner"" , ""it's a masterpiece"", etc. And when you finally watch the damn movie you hate it.

","I sat down to watch Blade Runner, expecting to see a movie that lived up to its iconic status. I had seen bits and pieces of it and I just wanted to see it in its entirety. It started off OK. But after about a half an hour I LITERALLY fell asleep, and it was no where near bedtime.<br/><br/>I think a my lack of interest was that there was almost no character development. My favorite character was Rachael and I wanted to know more about her before and after the story. But she and the rest of the cast just kinda came into scenes when they were needed and then disappeared like a flash in the pan. Other characters barely get their time in. More than once I asked myself, ""Ok, what happened to that guy?"" The movie just did a bad job of relaying the story.<br/><br/>On the plus side, it had an interesting visual stylization that was probably more impressive when it came out, but now having seen it in 2009, I can compare it to almost any other movie with a vision of a big city in the future. It was also one of those futuristic films where the hair and clothing styles are remarkably similar to the era when the movie was made. IE, in ten years, airbrush body paint and feathered hair flips are coming back! On top of that, a plethora of continuity mistakes made me question how seriously the director and editors were when they made this.<br/><br/>All in all, I felt letdown by the final product. There really wasn't any acting that was worth noting and Harison Ford was the only thing keeping this ship from completely sinking.

","Question - Does this movie truly deserve all the accolades it has received? Breaking with obvious tradition, I would say NOT, and go as far as to suggest that many reviewers are TOO eager with their praise due to the film's solid cult status which was delivered through ground breaking visual effects.<br/><br/>Some may even feel they HAVE to applaud Blade Runner, because to do anything else might cause frenzied bleating within the flock. Lets be clear about this, the gap between cult status and classical status should, and is, as wide as the gaps in this film.<br/><br/>Yes, for 1982 the film had superb, even pioneering photography and visual effects. But so did The Matrix. A truly excellent film has to deliver much more than that. For me anyway. I'm talking about taking the audience on a journey, a common experience that relates a well told story to the viewer. Blade Runner's story telling is confusing at best and at worst, borders on pure laziness.<br/><br/>While the external photography is way ahead of its time, the internal sets are in the main, a blur of darkness where the director takes little time to define any detail whatsoever. The storyline/plot is left SO open to interpretation, that any significant meaning remains undelivered.<br/><br/>Perhaps Scott's numerous arguments with his studio-masters were the root cause of this. His vision of the story clashed with the studio's and many compromises ensued, probably damaging the story and maybe even stalling production time so much that this mess of a film was released prematurely.<br/><br/>Yes, the Director's cut (1991) is marginally better, but that was 9 years later, and re-shoots were not an option. He had little to work with to improve the mess."

"aj0899","3","5","12","11 July 2016"," A lot of positives, but ultimately not very good.
","As a piece of visual art, Blade Runner is very impressive. <br/><br/>The problem is that it never gets around to telling a good story. The story that is there is extremely drawn out, and depressing. It is a slow, boring, melodramatic movie that has very little humanity (which is part of the premise), and nothing for the viewer to care about. It's a pretentious, navel-gazing art house film dressed up as a sci-fi/film noir thriller. <br/><br/>Vangelis's score is sometimes praised, but really not very good. Aside from a few good moments, he's mostly playing weak jazz and blues on synthesizers, or somber piano music. <br/><br/>As science fiction, it's kind of interesting in retrospect to see what predictions it got right, and what it got wrong. In Blade Runner's 2019, smartphones and flat screen TVs have not been invented, but androids and flying cars have. <br/><br/>The Terminator, which came out two years later and had a similar (but crucially different) concept, is a much better movie on almost every front, both as a story and as science fiction, although it had a smaller budget and less impressive visuals.<br/><br/>It's not hard to see why Blade Runner flopped at the box office, despite the pedigree it had. Word of mouth could not have been good. The fact that it's been resurrected in critical estimation is entirely about the visual imagery it created, which was, to be fair, mind-blowing for the time and extremely influential on later films. But that shouldn't mislead people into thinking it was a good movie. It wasn't. Its rating on this site is way, way too high. Be warned.<br/><br/>*POSSIBLE SPOILER*<br/><br/>The entire film is basically the examination of a concept: ""If robots started to develop emotions, what would that be like?"". That's it. It just dwells on that question in excruciating, overwrought, detail for two hours. The plot is paper thin, and an afterthought to the real point of the movie, which seems to have been the visual imagery. The word I used above is how I would sum it up: excruciating. It would probably be a better movie if you watched it with the sound off, and some electronic music playing."

","Plot, Character, Setting, Symbols, Themes: The five components of storytelling, from greatest to least important. Ridley Scott's overemphasis on the last three didn't blind me like so many others to the fact the the plot was limp and the characters were dull. <br/><br/>Sure, Blade Runner's visuals were brilliant and the moody tones in the Vangelis soundtrack enhanced the dystopian future setting, but the plot? It's nothing more than Deckard (Harrison Ford) hunting down androids who want to live past their shut down date. Cool premise, I agree, but It's basically a 45 minute Star Trek episode stretched into a two hour show off of visual effects. <br/><br/>Even as a 9 year old when I first saw this snore fest the only thing I remembered was the female android's nipples and the flying ships. Years later, in my twenties, when I thought my tastes had matured, I sat in a darkened theatre to see Ridley Scott's directors cut, sans supposed ""annoying"" and ""unnecessary"" Harrison Ford voice-over, that's all that kept me awake through the film. <br/><br/>Ford's narration was put into the film by the studio because there was so much dead time between action scenes. Even though a golden rule of writing is to ""Show it-don't tell it,"" the producers wisely realized that without the Ford narration, few audiences members could tolerate the slow pace. The only reason this film made any money was because of Ford's star power and it would have completely bombed were it not for the voice-over.<br/><br/>So by the time we got to Rutger Hauer's end of film, ""should have been Oscar nominated"" soliloquy, I was happy the film was finally almost over. I didn't care about the ""mind blowing"" twist at the end inferring that Ford's character Deckard was a replicant either. I was just happy I could go home and get a sleep in my bed instead of the movie theatre chair.<br/><br/>High ratings on IMDb for Blade Runner a simply because of non-random sampling bias.

"TOMASBBloodhound","5","5","12","14 April 2013"," Sleep-inducing film smothered by its production design.
","I tried. I really did. After all these years, this critic finally forced himself to watch Blade Runner from start to finish. I guess I got the more recent director's cut since I recall Harrison Ford narrating parts of the film I'd previously seen, but alas this time he had very little to say. They should have kept the narration. If nothing else it may have helped the audience understand and care about him a little more. But with such a moody and gloomy picture combined with its snail pace story, I'm really not sure what could have saved this.<br/><br/>The story is interesting enough. Its kind of a police thriller but played out in a futuristic version of Los Angeles. Ford plays some kind of a detective who is assigned to locate and exterminate a handful of ""replicants"". These are androids created to do some type of slave labor on other planets. Apparently they have been deemed too dangerous to be allowed back on earth and must be killed if they are found here. A few scenes show us in graphic detail that they can be capable of psychotic mayhem. Too bad the film isn't even half as interesting as this paragraph makes it sound. Ridley Scott had already struck gold with Alien, but here he tries a much grander kind of science fiction. It just doesn't work.<br/><br/>First off, Harrison Ford is miscast. He himself was critical of this film which failed at the box office at a time when he was on top of the world with his Han Solo and Indiana Jones characters. The star power and energy he brought to those roles could never have been allowed on the set of Blade Runner. The production design is grand, yet dreary. Its always raining, and the L.A. we are introduced to seems to never see the sunshine. The street-level sets are impressively detailed, and populated with some wonderful character-actors. The cast, aside from Ford, is terrific. Hauer is perhaps at his best here. Remember when Sean Young was actually a star? Some of the special effects like wide cityscapes and flying objects are unconvincing to say the least. The giant pyramids look just like the models they were, only filmed at special angles attempting to give them the proper scope. The synthesizer score did little for me. Worse than anything though is the fact that its just boring. This plot could have really been crafted into an exciting thriller. It hardly sounds like the script was faithful to the source material, so why not pump some life into this film? There are plenty of ""cult films"" that I like too, so I can understand some of the positive reviews. I just found Blade Runner neither deep enough intellectually, nor compelling as a thriller. Very little action, either. 5 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."
"Hawkensian","4","5","12","11 September 2012"," Fatally overrated, this film is remarkably dull.
","Blade Runner is nothing more than a visual spectacle, and its special effects are quickly failing the test of time, which means it's swiftly losing the only feature that could be considered somewhat redeeming. The film is remarkably flat, in terms of both its characters and narrative; it is completely unengaging in its entirety. Deckard (Harrison Ford) is assigned to find and kill 'replicants', which are 'biorobots' that have been declared illegal on Earth. The replicants effortlessly blend into society as they look and behave exactly like humans, their cover is blown only through detecting their lack of empathy. <br/><br/>Many people revel in the many different cuts and theories of 'Blade Runner', it's got a prominent cult following. That's fair enough, but on initial viewing I was left bored stiff – when it comes to sinister cybernetic organisms, it doesn't get better than 'The Terminator' (1984)<br/><br/>This clinical, emotionally detached approach is common in many of Ridley Scott's earlier work; the whole crew of 'Alien' were forgettable, much like the cast of 'Blade Runner'. I didn't sympathise with or fear any character, leading to its conventional, tired plot lacking any device to thrill, entertain or ultimately keep me watching. It took an act of will and devotion towards my friend (who is a fan of BR) to endure the whole thing.<br/><br/>I have been aware of the film and its reputation for years, but I had never been that interested in seeing it, despite the looks and utterances of mock outrage I'd always get when I said I hadn't seen it. Well, now I have, and next time I can reply with 'Yes, I have seen it, and it's one of the most overrated films I have ever seen.'<br/><br/>www.hawkensian.com"
"tieman64","Null","5","12","26 September 2007"," A Dick's Lament
","""Blade Runner's"" themes are encapsulated best by a brief scene during which a replicant called Deckard - who doesn't know he's an android - reveals to another replicant that her memories are not her own, but belong to the niece of Tyrell, the head of the corporation that built and programmed her. ""Those aren't your memories,"" Deckard says mournfully. ""They're somebody else's.""<br/><br/>Contemporary materialists echo these sentiments, applying Deckard's cyborg speech to all of humanity. According to the theory of materialism there are now no subjects, there is only subject-matter. Selves are nothing but electronic packets, while private persons are ""simulacra"", Rationalism rejecting the notion that there is some ineffable ""thing"" over the genetic, neurological and social coding that makes us ""us"", maintaining instead that the personal and the biographical are only explicable in machinic and impersonal terms. <br/><br/>The question raised by film-fans – ""Is Deckard a replicant?"" – thus misses the implications of the film completely. The criteria for rating the human above the replicant have been evaporated. Deckard, like man, is a machine that thinks it is what it is not and is certain that it is not what it is. As all identity is construction, everything has been produced and nothing is given. <br/><br/>As man is defended by his own narcissism, Deckard struggles to come to terms with this. Like most subjects faced with this trauma, he oscillates between retreating to either the Symbolic Order (the social world of linguistic communicationof The Law) or The Imaginary Order (the fundamental narcissism by which the human subject creates fantasy images of both himself and his ideal object of desire), both of which are tragic flights.<br/><br/>But, as philosopher Slavoj Zizek argues, the lesson of ""Blade Runner"" (or rather Philip K Dick's lesson) is not only that everything in the personal is in fact the product of impersonal processes of cause and effect, but that it is the very act of delineating the underlying nexus that regulates our lives, that marks our freedom. For this reason, ""Blade Runner's"" replicants are actually the film's only pure subjects precisely because they testify that their ""content"", including their most intimate fantasies, are not their own, but already implanted. i.e, it is only when I acknowledge my replicant status, that I become a truly human subject.<br/><br/>What the film fails to do, however, is recognise that the ""replicant as pure subject"" is itself not an identity, but the product of a machinic process which mis-recognizes itself as the process's final cause. So rather than a subject, we have the continuous production of subjectivity (in which the personal is always the ""sim-personal""; the simulation of the personal by the impersonal). In this algorithm, self-consciousness as pure introspection simultaneous with what it is introspecting, is impossible, as subjective reflection must always exists ""two steps removed"" or ""behind"" the process, consciousness, like memory and habit, always an ""after the fact"" reflection on the unconscious processes which produce it. In this sense, the subject is by definition always nostalgic, a subject of loss.<br/><br/>For this reason, for the pure subject to have reflection is for it to automatically realise, nihilistically, that consciousness is itself nothing. Unless this happens, the replicant remains a ""simpersonator"", able to simulate personalities, but always confusing personality-function with consciousness-as-essence. In other words, unlike Deckard, the pure subject would not go from ""it does not know what it is"" to ""it now knows what it is"", but from ""it does not know what it is"" to ""it knows it cannot know what it is becoming"", which is the kind of morbidly fked up place Cronenberg now resides.<br/><br/>But, philosophically, ""Blade Runner"" doesn't go this extra mile. If the film is about nostalgia and loss, it remains trapped on the level of thinking in terms of ""memories"" and ""death"". IE – whether replicant or human, memories aren't ours and all existence ends in death, as bemoaned by one dying, rain-drenched replicant.<br/><br/>In this regard, the film is a lamentation more in the style of such Westerns as ""Once Upon A Time In The West"", ""Unforgiven"" and ""The Wild Bunch"". Indeed, ""Blade Runner's"" screenwriter, David Peoples, injects many western motifs into the film, borrows heavily from ""High Noon"" (a 1952 western that features a lone bounty hunter tasked with killing four outlaws) and would himself go on to write ""Unforgiven"". Fused with these are director Ridley Scott's motifs – an emphasis on eyes, photographs, pictures etc – (photographs are objects of place, sentiment, history, and memory. Similarly, phrases like ""we get the picture"" or ""world picture"" show that consciousness can be discussed in terms of a picture) all of which stress the recording and capturing of memories.<br/><br/>Of course, stylistically, the film does borrow from the noir genre. Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a trench-coat wearing detective, navigating his way through a future Los Angeles every bit as oppressive as that of classic noirs. The film also deals with noir fate. But rather than the cosmic webs of betrayal so favoured by Chandler, here fate becomes the universality of death (programmed obsolescence) and the ""inescapability"" of the human OS, of source code Homo sapien. <br/><br/>Incidentally, ""Blade Runner's"" ""elevator ending"" references ""The Maltese Falcon's"" ""elevator ending"", another noir which ended with the ""stuff that dreams are made of"". Fittingly, all those involved with the picture, EXCEPT Ridley Scott, believe Deckard to be human. Fancher and Peoples wrote about a human Deckard, Ford played a human Deckard, and yet Ridley Scott continuously states that Deckard is a cyborg. Of course, as director, Ridley Scott becomes the Noir God of the picture. He is the head of the Tyrell Corporation. He is the implanter of memories. He builds the androids, falsifies information, keeps them misinformed and in the dark. The film works precisely because Ford thinks he's playing a human whilst Scott KNOWS he is a machine.<br/><br/>8.9/10 - Worth multiple viewings."

I knew in advance that this film had much praise so I was hoping for some sort glowing conclusion towards the end of the film. It is clear however; that the only reason it has a rating so high is due to the nostalgic sci-fi effects available in its time. Harrison Ford in his prime is the only saving grace to this film. Honorable mentions to the two male Nexus leads; Rutger Hauer and Brion James for the exceptional acting skills in portraying the mostly emotionless Nexus characters.

","I just don't know where to begin. I've watched this movie for the first time yesterday (The final Cut) and my mouth fell open with pure disbelief. How did i waste 2 hours of my life on this piece of drab film noir. Really, it is that bad. I do not have to talk about how beautiful the decors are, or were for that matter (we are 30 years on and it's quite impressive for the time it was shot), and even better looking than some of the earlier CGI movies. But who cares if the movie plot is totally ridiculous and sucks in every way possible. <br/><br/>The reviews i have read here are all completely beyond me. How can people possibly overlook all the gaps in the plot. No character building whatsoever. Bad acting, unbelievable and ridiculous storyline. And it's not mediocre. No it's just all bad. <br/><br/>Deckard's hunt for the replica's? I don't believe him, nor do i believe all of the other characters who feel totally forced into roles and extremely bad writing. It's beyond me how someone can get sucked in to this movie nor the protagonist. There is no hunt. There is no excitement. Nothing is thrilling. And o my god how predictable can a movie be??? Not to mention the agonizingly stupid view on the future. I don't want to play captain hindsight here but the movie is set in 2019. Which makes it even more painful to watch. Flying cars everywhere but then stopping for a payphone?! I could have handled this if the movie was done better. I mean i like Sci-Fi, but not this kind. Everything is dark, the streets should be crowded but are all empty. And the so called 'decors' they look like decors. <br/><br/>Normally i wouldn't write a review because everyone has already done it and there is just not much to add to all the reviews already written. But in this case i want to act as a counterweight to everyone here who rates this movie with a 9 or a 10. Why. Have they been watching the Ultimate Cut which i haven't seen? <br/><br/>I'm sorry for not delving to deep into the details but just believe me. If you are a normal film lover, not sleeping under star trek sheets with a Spock poster above your bed, please let this one be. It's a classic alright. A classic peace of poo...."

"zahrapicasso","3","4","9","15 December 2018"," As shallow as the rain puddles scattered throughout the movie itself.
","This is my first full movie review, probably ever. This will be a record of what I honestly feel about the film following my first ever full viewing of it. Judging from a few I've read, I'm not alone in thinking this film is insanely overrated.<br/><br/>I viewed the Director's Cut on Blu-Ray and I have to say, I don't get it. The scores I mean, and the general positivity surrounding this film. I went in without paying any attention to these things until after the viewing, only really knowing that the film garnered a fairly large cult following years later.<br/><br/>So, to summarise the plot in my own words here, as I know people will likely point to people criticising the film as ""not understanding it's deep and utter complexity"", here we go.<br/><br/>Deckard is a former supposedly high ranking Blade Runner, an individual that is part of law enforcement in the year of 2019, whose purpose is to hunt down rogue ""Replicants"", these being hyper-realistic androids that look, sound and act almost exactly like humans. Replicants are sent off to various locations for slave labour in this universe.<br/><br/>Deckard is forced out of retirement by a higher up, as a handful of dangerous Replicants have managed to escape their slavery and have come back to earth to attempt to find their creator, and extend their lifespan, as Replicants are created to live very short lives.<br/><br/>That's a basic summary, but is really all the film ever tells us about what is happening, ever, there's no evolution beyond this, no twists to keep us hooked. The pacing is so painfully slow that there's few details to divulge at all, aside from this summary. This is the concept and story of the film with a LOT of pointless quiet time splitting things up to extend run time and probably just to keep the budget below a certain threshold. Take it or leave it, love it or hate it.<br/><br/>To get a bit more in depth on what actually transpires, there are a few gripes I have that I'd like to cover, which will be most relevant obviously to those that have seen the film.<br/><br/>Firstly, why in the hell are you sending one man out against multiple dangerous renegade, SUPER strong androids that are on the loose, with little to nothing to go on whatsoever? Well that's not totally true, The chief has digital photographs of what these escaped Replicants look like in his office that he shows to Deckard, and you aren't sending out squadrons of heavily armed officers attempting to capture them? Why not?<br/><br/>Secondly, Deckard is made out to be some ""incredible"" Blade Runner. The higher up/Chief, Bryan, that recruits him for the task, goes as far as to blackmail him into doing so when Deckard initially declines. Bryan apparently does all this because they ""need his magic"".<br/><br/>They kick up so much of a fuss about how incredibly talented of a Blade Runner he is, but in just about every encounter, he's a complete mess, and is more often than not just landing on his back with blood pouring from his mouth. WHY doesn't he have backup with him to locate these Replicants? It's a massive, gaping plot hole that is never addressed or explained in any way, we're just meant to accept that it is this way because ""movie has to happen"", despite it making absolutely no sense.<br/><br/>The actual visuals of this film are by far the best part of it. For a film that's over 30 years old, it looks great. Granted, this is largely remastered for a HD blu-ray release, but the sets, costumes etc. largely stand the test of time. This is about the most generous praise I can give the film.<br/><br/>The Replicants themselves act just as brain dead at times, particularly the primary blonde haired duo, whose names I cannot recall beyond their mention at the very beginning. These two have the goal of tracking down their creator. Eventually they do so whilst manipulating one of their ""lesser designers"", JF Sebastian, forcing him to allow them access to their creator's penthouse.<br/><br/>The blonde haired male, who is pretty much the leader of these renegade replicants, goes alone with Sebastian to speak with his creator, and after requesting that his life be extended, he's basically told ""Yeah, I'm sorry but that can't be done, you're made to last this long and that's that"", then ends up gouging out his eyes, and killing Sebastian, for no reason, off screen.<br/><br/>The male is an absolute joke at the very end, smashing his head into walls basically acting like Jack from The Shining in the most pointlessly drawn out attempt to kill someone I've probably ever seen, even going so far as to strip off his clothes for zero reason to make it even more comical.<br/><br/>The blonde haired female, is given the literal most perfect opportunity to kill Deckard, because let's be honest, it seems like anyone could judging from his ineptitude in this movie, but I guess she decided she hadn't done enough backflips so she decides to let him go to get his gun and blow her guts out. Why?<br/><br/>Not to mention, these are androids. Synthetic beings. Who thought it would be a great idea to have their innards and blood colour be totally indistinguishable from ordinary humans? Something tells me that will just make it harder to narrow down any escapees. Maybe the creator wanted it to be this way, but perhaps regulation should have opposed the idea, or at least create a law that has some mandatory design implementation to where they can be easily identified immediately if they get loose? Doesn't really matter in the end I guess, because nothing about it is ever mentioned or built upon whatsoever.<br/><br/>How on earth is this film deep? It's a collection of non-sensical, illogical events that try so hard to make you think on some kind of deeper level, but they just totally fail. There's no mystery, these are renegade machines that are designed to be as human as possible, but aren't, with an inept agent attempting to capture them, and only succeeding due to pure luck.<br/><br/>If I have more to add I will do so but there's really nothing much more to talk about, it's one of the slowest films I've ever seen that tries to make you think during the periods where nothing is happening, but it more often than not leads nowhere, or it leads into another problem and something else to complain about and just ask, ""why?""<br/><br/>Final score from me is 3/10, mostly on account of how the film looks and its general visual presentation."

Anyway she had never seen this film before so we both sat down and watched it together; afterwards she said exactly what I expected her to say ""how is that, one of the best films of all time?""<br/><br/>I truly can't believe how disappointing it actually is, maybe if it wasn't praised so much, therefore living up to an expectation, we could have enjoyed it more? I don't know. <br/><br/>Harrison Ford was the most boring, uninteresting character I have ever laid my eyes on, there was nothing about him that grabbed me ever. He was just so stiff and generic, one of the dullest performances I've ever seen, and not only that, he basically rapes the replicant Rachael, that was actually very uncomfortable to watch, and made me hate him when I saw how he treated her, basically telling her what to feel, absolutely sick.<br/><br/>Also was Deckard a replicant? I saw the final cut version each time I viewed the movie and it's never really felt to be explained, it's dropped in there slightly but not really touched on? Or was my attention drifting from boredom, I don't know.<br/><br/>I've gotta say, I loved the movie Brazil, The Thing, Matrix, Dark City, 1984, and I felt like this was a bit of a mixture of movies like that, but one with a really lack of story, a lack of a moral message, no social commentary, I just couldn't find anything in it, I'm baffled as to how it's so praised.<br/><br/>I will say the soundtrack was sometimes beautiful, the sets were done very well and are really immersive (especially when you take age into account) and it was certainly different from any other movie of it's sort. Also Ruther Hauer provided a legendary performance, it's a real shame how little of him is actually in the film, same goes for Daryl Hannah and the guy that made the little dummy things. It's for the reasons above I gave it a 6/10 (61/100).<br/><br/>All in all, All the actors and actresses that played replicants, we're superb, especially Rutger.

I was completely torn between giving this movie and ""Good"" and an ""Alright"", but I felt my honest opinion after watching the film was just.. eh.. So in conclusion, Blade Runner looks great, sounds great, and is an alright movie overall. It does lack, however, in some of its pacing and confusing plot design.

","I.m a huge fan of R.Scott's work, i've watched Blade Runner in 82 and almost every year since...like yesterday evening :)<br/><br/>In 79 R. Scott had made Alien the 8th passenger to compete against Star Wars for Fox, both changed Sci-fi movie forever, then he gave us Blade Runner and for me it's his masterpiece.<br/><br/>It's a noir movie, a disappointed cop is hired by the L A metro police in a near future to kill replicant, human AI.<br/><br/>It's raining all the time, no sky, it's really dark, down town LA is a mix of a open market for anything,animals clones and genetics shops, cheap hotels and squats, skyscrapers are huge, the Tyrel corp. looks like a modern over sized pyramid, most of the human beings who are always there, have diseases or have no money and cannot go to the space colonies. <br/><br/>then i must say, the movie is really far better than the book 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' was.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford is superb as all the cast. which is, for some of them, their best movie as of today, I became a fan of Rutger Hauer as well for his portrayal of Roy. do you know that, Roy's last words were a total improvisation of R.Hauer? <br/><br/>the music by Vangelis is perfect. after all these years, it's still one of the best sci-fi movie ever made,<br/><br/>you must see it"
"nojokedog","5","4","9","7 April 2015"," I wanted to like it.
","When I saw the Blade Runner Final Cut DVD sitting on a shelf in a store with the hours upon hours of special features for only five bucks, I jumped at the chance to purchase it. For years I heard about how great this film was and how much people loved it. I was already a huge sci-fi fan, so I was thrilled that I was getting see a sci-fi movie that I wanted to see for a while. Nothing could go wrong! Then I watched it... I was underwhelmed at first. I didn't fully understand everything that was going on. So I watched the features. The documentaries that came with the film. Later on, I watched the film again with the Ridley Scott commentary. I understood the movie now, but other than that nothing had changed. I didn't like it any more or any less than I did before. A few weeks later I try watching again, and nothing. The movie itself may not overrated per se, but I don't what makes it so special.<br/><br/>The music. One of the things I can say I dislike about Blade Runner is its score. It's very noir in its presentation. Which would make perfect sense because the movie is a very noir like film.<br/><br/>Sets and effects. I do like the look of the city, the vehicles, and the interior of the buildings. It's very unique and custom to the film. The inside of Deckard's apartment is one of my favorites. And the cars. The cars are so friggin cool to see hover up into the air or land on the street. Definitely top notch stuff there.<br/><br/>Characters. My absolute favorite thing about Blade Runner - Roy Batty. The film's main antagonist, a replicant, played flawlessly by Rutger Hauer. Terrifying yet fascinating, Roy Batty has steadily climbed my list of favorite villains since my multiple viewings of Blade Runner. Rick Deckard. Not my favorite Harrison Ford character, but far from my least favorite. He's not Indiana Jones or Han Solo, he's something very different, but it works. Pris. Daryl Hanah's replicant character is extremely iconic and the visual of her as Pris is something that always pops in my mind when I think of Blade Runner. Sultry and seductive but always dangerous, Pris is my second favorite character in the movie.<br/><br/>At the end of the day Blade Runner is middle of the road for me. I didn't hate it, but I can't exactly say I liked it either. I've watched it a total six times now, so believe me, I tried. I really tried to like it overall."

","Very good science-fiction film that has some elements of classic detective films (Something that was quite original for the time it was made) Some people say this movie is overrated, but I think that this movie deserves all the praise and good reviews it receives: The visual aspect of this movie was revolutionary and influential for many movies that came later. Also, along with Alien (From the same director of this movie) and Star Wars, this must one of the best classic science fiction films ever made.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford gives here an incredible performance. I really liked all the characters of this movie, all of them were interesting and fascinating.<br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" it is a very good film.

"psyonicshockwave","10","4","9","9 August 2010"," A Masterpiece- But you have to watch it three times!
","Even after watching the film in depth and doing significant research on the movie, im still torn inside whether i like it or not. There is no doubt that the film was an extra-ordinary masterpiece of special effects and philosophical predictions and messages. The aspect of the film im having trouble comprehending is the entertainment value. The slow moving scenes seemed to drag on and on with very little happening. The dialogue was stagnant while the acting wasn't anything extra-ordinary. There were points in the film where i felt bored. Maybe it was because you cannot appreciate fine art by looking at it from a distance. The confusion of the symbolic references and subliminal messages left the viewer trying to comprehend every little detail in the film. Apart from the slow dialogue there was not much else negative about the film. The occasional pointless scene popped up every now and then and the hidden clues left me feeling frustrated at times but the story line and messages the film portrays more than makes up for this. The attention to detail in the film is amazing. The lack of CGI during that time means this film was made by models. This to me is incredible. The graphic quality on the DVD means this film looks by no means outdated. The costumes were excellent. The prediction of the changes in fashion is almost spot on. The language that is spoken is also unique as it is a combination of many different dialects spoken today. Steering away from the graphic and entertainment side of the movie leaves us with meaning of the film. What is the meaning of the film you ask? What is the meaning of existence... So what is the meaning of existence? It is a question that can never be truly answered but this film is a sort of gateway into which the viewer can be taken into and given a reason to think about this question. The film gives very little assistance in this great dilemma but it gives plenty of opportunity to explore this concept through its many sub themes. The creation's triumph over its creator- This was very graphically depicted in the film. As Roy Batty's thumbs penetrated the brain of his creator he effectively eliminated the only thing that had control over him. The reason he killed JS Sebastian in such a brutal way leaves one to question Roy's morals and ethics. If he was truly human, would he have done such a violent act? Maybe thats not such an important fact but it leads to the freedom that Roy had been searching for. Personal Identity- The reason the replicants kill ruthlessly is to find out more about their own identity. The memories they have been given do not adequately fufilll their emotional needs. They have a burning desire to survive and the security of knowing where they come from will aid their mission. So what is life? Blade Runner makes you think about what is the true definition of life. Without a greater being determining what your meaning is, are you not pointless? There is no right or wrong answer but the important thing is that this films saves us from our ignorance and makes our grey matter work. My verdict of the film is... It is a masterpiece. Anyone who disagrees with this may have not grasped the full extent of the film and the subjects it incorporates. If the viewer decides rather to ignore the themes and continues to live in their ignorance, then maybe they are better off watching some B-Grade action flick."
"lurker_from_persia","10","4","9","18 September 2009"," Visually stunning, thought provoking and incredibly moving.
","Blade Runner stands as one of the most beautifully constructed and influential films for many film makers of all time, and after over a quarter of a century and many viewings, that beauty and awe has never faded. On the surface it may seem like an action movie, but when looked into more closely what can be seen is a deeply philosophical allegory on the concept of life. It's a gripping story of 'Blade Runner' detective Rick Deckard, hunting Replicants; robot slaves who have gone AWOL and returned to earth seeking one thing: a longer life after being designed with a four year life span. The setting, a rain soaked, neon hazed futuristic 2019 LA oozes an overpopulated, multi cultured, crime ridden world, thus giving the film a more dangerous and seedy feel. It's a world that looks like it's been lived in for a long long time, and for a film made in 1982 was way ahead of it's time and still looks impressive today. <br/><br/>The casting is pitch perfect, with Ford giving a strong, tough yet vulnerable presence as the uncertain Deckard, torn between killing Replicants yet falling in love with one. Rutger Hauer gives one of the best performances I have ever seen as the violent Roy Batty, who, though may seem frightening, evokes a sense of pity as the audience discover all this man really wants is more life. Rachael, the Replicant Deckard falls for, is played by Sean Young and she both succeeds in being absolutely beautiful yet giving off a robotic aura as she interacts with Deckard. The rest of the cast all put in amazing performances, notable mentions including Edward James Olmos as Gaff, Joe Turkel as Tyrell and the other Replicants.<br/><br/>Vangelis' soundtrack fits perfectly with the setting created in Blade Runner, whether showing swooping dazzling cityscape shots, or dim close-ups inside Deckard's shadowy apartment. It's tones, ranging from mellow, jazzy piano and horns to tender electrical synthesisers complement all the scenes perfectly, evoking the dark urban world on display. <br/><br/>Overall, for many Blade Runner is not only one of the best in science fiction but also one of the best films of all time. Considering it's difficult creation and eventful history, all the cast and crew, particularly director Ridley Scott, excelled themselves to bring us this wonderful piece of film-making that today still makes audiences question what it is to be human. ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe."" Roy's famous quote could indeed be repeated when describing what Blade Runner is and has become."
"PseudoFritz","10","4","9","2 September 2009"," Some Thoughts After Viewing the Final Cut
","Blade Runner in any version is an excellent movie, and I've now seen 4 versions - the original theatrical release, the little-seen ""compromise cut"", the Director's Cut, and now the Final Cut. If you've seen the DC, there's not much in the FC which makes it essential, other than a few digital tweaks and some polishing of continuity.<br/><br/>One reason I'd feared the Final Cut for two years is that I'd heard that Ridley Scott definitively resolved the question of Deckard's own nature (making the movie conform to statements he's made in public), but I prefer to leave the issue ambiguous. I needn't have worried, it seems.<br/><br/>Anyone who has seen the movie and still thinks of Replicants as ""machines"" is repeating Deckard's own mistake from early in the movie. ""More Human Than Human"" is an apt description. They have been engineered, while we in ""real life"" have been assembled haphazardly over millions of years, but they rely on the same physical, biological processes we do. If you prick them, do they not bleed? If you wrong them, do they not revenge? The Tyrell Corp. does not manufacture robots, it creates human life. But instead of our own three-score-and-ten, Replicants are ""born"" and die in only four years.<br/><br/>I've never taken Bryant's explanation of the 4-year lifespan, as he explains it to Deckard, as truth. From Tyrell's meeting with Roy, I believe that HE speaks truth - ""You were made as well as we could make you."" The nature of Homo fabricans, though, is such that it CAN'T live longer than 48 months. So Tyrell took what had been an unavoidable limitation in his creation, and sold it as a Special Design Feature - the fail-safe.<br/><br/>So in the end, it really doesn't matter whether Deckard is or is not a Replicant. Either way, he and Roy are the same, and the end comes when both of them realize that.<br/><br/>If my theory is true, of course, then the happy ending tacked onto the studio release ""Rachael is a special case - no termination date"" is unsupportable. As the couple flee, there's no hope for ""happily ever after"", but there remains the prospect of being together for as long as they both shall live, and of course EITHER of them could get hit by a truck next time they cross the street... ""It's too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?"""

","Blade Runner is an extraordinary science fiction film that not only packs in good action and special effects, but a good plot and storyline. Harrison Ford, who by this time was best known for Han Solo and Indiana Jones, is now a police officer named Rick Deckard, also known as the Blade Runner. We are also introduced to characters like Holden, Leon, Roy Batty, and Sean Young as Rachael.<br/><br/>Based upon the novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" by Phillip K.

It has everything, and although i am not a vivid fan of the genre i certainly became more interested after the thrilling adventure of watching Blade Runner. Ridley Scott, director of classic such as Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven and American Gangster has created an impossible but brilliant alternative universe that one can be washed away to. It leave's you spellbound and amazed. Scott has created a masterpiece of epic proportion but without all the blazing gun fights and modern Hollywood crap that audiences see today. Instead Scott has created worlds packed with life and soul in it. The directing is Scott's main strong point's and show's a true master working at the top of his game.

It is just so rubbish that no matter what version it is that you see you will find that version will be even more useless than the last.<br/><br/>The film is about a cop with scars on his chin. He also has cheap clothes and he looks like a man who had just had his marriage licenses revoked LOL! This man is told by his boss (who has a weird face and walks like he has peanuts in his shoes) that he must chase down nine robots that have escaped from a top secret military base, (which is why everyone eats noodles with either beef or chicken, or sometimes prawns in there).<br/><br/>The rest of the film is equally as rubbish. There are really bad special effects all over the place in this movie and none of them look like real things. I expected there to be more spaceships in a film of this type and one of the reasons the film is so boring is that there are none.

","This movie was so beyond dull and bad. This movie was concentrated too much on effects(eye candy, graphics, design) rather than the quality. There was no plot in this movie. I just found the storyline to be dull, some say it was too VAGUE, some say it didn't make any sense at all since most of the good stuff was on effects. I was just very disapointed by that movie. Come on where are explosions, killing, ground zero, buildings falling down, car chase scenes, heads getting cut off, anything.Total Recall is alot better than that dull film. I can't believe that this has been considered the best sci-fi ever just for a dull film. I don't like dramas, but there were some dramas that didn't make me hate but this one definetly did. I too much make up Darryl Hannah who does the summersault scene. The first time that was used in a movie. Come on, what was so special about it, even a 5 year old kid can do that. It is just like a dog catching a ball making people think<br/><br/>that it was never scene in this world. If you wan't to see a summersault then go see Angelina Jolie in her short shorts in TOMB RAIDER, THAT IS ALOT BETTER. I don't blame Harrison Ford it wasn't your fault it was the movie's fault. Even the Retro styled 80's background music is definetly not going to get this movie out of the abyss. Take RUNNER and you have Blade with Wesley Snipes. This movie deserves to get a bad review and avoid this movie as much as you can this is beyond garbage."

","This is a film that took me at least 3 viewings to fully appreciate (Like most people apparently), now is one of my favorite films of all time. Blade Runner is in every way, a flawed master pieces, a film that has problems that everyone overlooks because of how good the film itself is, the visuals are by far the stand out of the movie, they still look outstanding, so many years later, and the special effects have barely aged for the most part, the environments were definitely something unique for their time and you can see how they became an influence for so many films of the genre that came after it,the world feels alive, real and it's an amazing achievement, the directing by Ridley Scott is one of the best I have seen in his entire career and the musical score by Vangelis is fantastic and the script is excellent, the story while pretty straightforward, there are so many details that requires you to pay attention to fully understand what is happening or in some cases, what might be happening, Harrison Ford also delivers in my opinion one of the best performances of his career, through the entire film i didn't saw Ford, I saw Deckard. The film has flaws that lie mostly in some scenes that do drag a bit too much and some plot elements here and there that could either be shorten or skipped entirely, but like I said, those flaws are overcome by everything the film does right and that's why Blade Runner is to this day considered a master piece."
"o-lugo91","8","3","6","31 January 2012"," WOnerdrful Riddley movie
","This is a film that is so deep, rich, and multi-layered, it may require more than one viewing to fully absorb the brilliance of what you've just seen. At first glance, it can be a bit slow. It's told in a classic film noir fashion, so this is to be expected. Director Ridley Scott seems to want to savor every shot, and an astute audience will be able to sense this.<br/><br/>Now, I say the film is told in a classic Noir style, but this can be misleading. There is no Humphrey Bogart in Blade Runner, snapping off brilliant one-liners once a second. Only hopeless people, in many ways victims of the merciless world of which they are all a part. Deckard is a typically downbeat protagonist, a hard-boiled cynical leading man with a weakness for heavy drinking. The plot is a mystery in name only, as the audience is allowed to know what Roy Batty, Pris and Leon are all up to before Deckard ever finds out. This only lends to the dread and inevitability of the film, lending further to its pervasive gloom. There is no final scene at the end where the bold detective puts all the pieces together and says ""Ah-Ha!"". Instead, we find Rick Deckard questioning his own existence and drinking away his constant doubts, all the while embroiled in a romantic relationship with someone he's sworn to kill.<br/><br/>Blade Runner requires audience participation, particularly in the Director's Cut, which is entirely devoid of some rather necessary exposition provided by the Original Cut's much-maligned voice-over. Certain facts will not be clear even at the end of the film, requiring personal interpretation in order to be appreciated fully. Other facts will be given away in much more subtle ways than in most modern cinema, such as through visual cues and tenuous dialogue."
"eyesour","10","3","6","17 December 2010"," One Marvellous Movie
","Matchless. A magnificent meditation on the reality of death, and life's ultimate lack of meaning. One or two mentally challenged reviewers have complained that ""replicants"" could easily have been created a different colour, say, green; or been given six arms. Why were they made exactly the same as human beings? Answer: because they are exactly the same as human beings. In fact, all human beings are replicants of oneself. They are what one sees with one's own eyes, in the mirror, and all around one. If you follow the film closely. I think it was Ogden Nash who wrote: ""My fellow man I do not care for/ I often ask me what he's there for/ The only answer I can find/ Is reproduction of his kind."" Had he lived a little later, he might have written ""replication of his kind"".<br/><br/>One of the brighter dumb-dumbs points out, in a puzzled way, that there are no children in this vale of tears. Well, there wouldn't be, since replicants are made instead. As well as toys for scientific Sebastian to play with. There's something of him in all of them. What exactly is Tyrell playing at? God knows. Why, exactly, were the pyramids ever built? What was the point of burying everything of material value inside them? I'll tell you about my wrapped-up mummy, you trick-cycling apparatchik. Take a trip to see her for yourself.<br/><br/>Another thing. Without memories we have no identity at all. We only exist because we have learned to walk and talk, and remember how to do it. Who could we possibly be without our collection of mental photographs? Search me. Another thought: could there be a collective subconscious, and was Jung possibly right? Are unicorns part of everyone's folk-memory? <br/><br/>Everything about Blade Runner is fabulous. It soars where the clunky and only semi-literate Kubrick stumbles and fumbles. Even greater than Marienbad, which sadly shot itself in the corporation; or anything by Bergman. The performances are nonpareil. The girl playing Rachael (funny spelling) is perfection itself. But all the players are flawless, anyway. The vision is transcendental. I guess you could say I admire it."

","It is hard to put onto words , how this film appears on the screen when you first see it, to some it is a look at humanity and what it really means to be human to some it about robots being as human as mankind, to me it is a piece of art.<br/><br/>The images, which soar off the screen like a work of art by Van Gogh or Callevaggio seem to show how good Ridley Scott is as a visual artist, The first ten minutes I was blown away by the visual imagery it was bright but so dark at the same time. It looked like Japan, London and LA had a child and it was the foreboding city scape of Blade Runner, every inch referring back to a ancient civilisation, for example the Myan Temple like structure of the Tyral building, It seems like a dream like state but you awake as you sit listening to the narration of Harrison Ford as he driven to his destination, like a knight being taken to Camelot, The dialogue between Harrison Ford and the lieutenant is so taut and full of anger that you are not sure which side Harrison Ford is on.<br/><br/>Brion Jones and Rudgar Hauger were so scary as the menacing replicants he is hunting, as they are looking to become human but Tyrel is the only person they can turn to and he is a robot in human form, This has a great speech and you have to see it once in your life."
"shortyrags","10","3","6","21 July 2008"," One of the Greatest Sci-Fi films of all time...
","Welcome to the future and the future is not bright. Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott, focuses on a stylized, retro-future Los Angeles where everything is not well. This film presents a dramatic landscape of the future with no certain explication on how we got to this point. All that is explained is that human replicants have been born from immense breakthroughs in technology, and that other than their increased strength and intelligence, are indistinguishable from their human counterparts. Rick Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, is a retired member of an elite squad known as Blade Runners, whose purpose is to hunt down rogue replicants and destroy them. And such is the scenario that Scott presents us with as he takes us on a journey to the very core of meaning and existence.<br/><br/>The film's breathtaking imagery and its incredible sound bolster this raw journey as Deckard reluctantly hunts down a group of replicants. We are placed in the context of this world, less knowledgeable than the fictional characters, and we are not pushed to believe that one side is more righteous or more deserving of life. Deckard's pursuit of the wanted replicants takes us through a character study or character studies of not just Deckard but the replicants too, mainly the leader, Roy Batty played by Rutger Hauer. The performances are outstanding by a great cast, additionally including the likes of Sean Young, Daryl Hannah and Edward Olmos. Through the blend of these great performances, we see these characters for what they are and how they truly exist, be they human or replicant. There are a few twists along the way that I do not want to spoil but the film slowly builds to a haunting and powerful climax.<br/><br/>And that is an important part of the experience of viewing Blade Runner: that it is slow. By no means is this an action-packed film like a, shall we say, Terminator: Judgment Day. But this film is so strong and smart in what it presents that the pace of the film is not only unnoticeable but incredibly artistic. And it separates itself from the rest of the sci-fi pack with its phenomenal aesthetic artistry. The retro-future noir style of Los Angeles is captured beautifully and lends greater credibility to the plot and the characters. Through the dark and noir setting, we are given a bleak glimpse into the future, that seems rather plausible and palpable even in our present day.<br/><br/>Let me be honest as I conclude here. When I first saw this film, I didn't really enjoy it. I didn't appreciate it that much and I was left rather disappointed. However, upon my repeated viewings, this film continued to grow on me and presented me with new challenges and questions each time. And that is part of the magic of the enigmatic Blade Runner. It can show us something different every time without us truly understanding it every time. With that said, it has now become one of my favorite films of all time. The film is unquestionably Ridley Scott's masterpiece."

","Blade Runner is a movie that will be remembered as a classic of its genre and even one of the greatest films of all time.<br/><br/>The production design and style are simply phenomenal. It's hard not to see this film's influence on subsequent entries into the sci fi genre and just on films in general. This is such an imaginative, dark, atmospheric and detailed vision of the future, you're pulled in just by the way the movie looks and sounds. The streets are damp, dark, cold and overcrowded The buildings are run down and decaying, but the skys are filled with flying billboards and hover cars. It's a throwback to the old film noir genre in many ways, but fresh and creative at the same time.<br/><br/>The film operates on a number of different philosophical levels as well. This warrants many repeated viewings, if only to better understand how much there is here to be thought about. The film raises a number of questions about what it really means to be human, and leaves a lot open ended for the viewer to ponder.<br/><br/>This is a must for sci fi fans, but also just for anyone interested in incredible movie making. A classic. 10/10."

Aside from the outstanding effects I felt the plot lacked any punch. However I gave it a second look and it grew on me. The third time I was hooked. I now believe it is one of the top two or three science fiction movies ever made. <br/><br/>What I love about this film is that it poses a lot of questions that many of us have as humans. However it doesn't give any real answers just like real life doesn't provide many answers. The cast is universally solid. Harrison Ford to me has always been a fine but inconsistent actor. I don't think he has ever had a role as good as Decker before or since. However it's Rugter Haeur who really stole the show. He delivers some of the best lines in the film. One line in the film in particular struck me.<br/><br/>The direction of Ridley Scott is nothing sort of superb. He creates a perfect blend of flashy effects and a dreary, hopeless atmosphere. The culture is filled with nostilga, technology, and junk. <br/><br/>I strongly recommend this film for someone looking for a movie that mixes effects with a lot of substance.If your looking for a bang-bang shoot'em up sci-fi film like Star Wars or Aleins look else where."

From the giant advertisements hugging the tall buildings to the food outlets to the citizens on cycles, we realise that the superior advancements of the Asian east have finally bled into the west to the extent that it has its feet are fimly under the table. This actually adds to the experience, in my opinion. <br/><br/>The basic premise is that Deckard (Harrison Ford) is summoned and assigned to investigate the hijacking of an aircraft, or airship by a small number of 'skin jobs', or Replicants. It seems that there is no other choice to accept, and so with a reluctance, but eventual determination Decker sets the wheels in motion. <br/><br/>Visually, the film is exemplary; and rather than the visuals, though indeed being special effects, are not blatant to the eye. Not like the recent Star Wars movies where the blue screen green screen is so obvious that although the fans, and non fans can enjoy the film, the suspension of disbelief is not entirely possible.<br/><br/>The acting is flawless throughout. Harrison Ford, James Olmos, and others of a high caliber lose themselves in their characters. Perhaps the award should go to Rutger Hauer; who's character goes from bad guy, to seemingly not so bad character, once his motives and pathology are realised. After all, what, we can ask ourselves, would we ourselves do in such a predicament?<br/><br/>The ending sequence, which I will not give away can perhaps only be described as a thing of beauty and marvel. Hauers monologue and final demise is quite incredible.<br/><br/>Without forgetting what could be considered to be the crowning spice of the film, step forward the score.<br/><br/>Vangellis delivers an operatic masterpiece. A flavour to not only compliment the experience, but transport the senses where even perhaps the visuals may fail. The score, and motifs within help keep this dish in the flavour that it has retained, and will keep retaining even after decades of release. <br/><br/>This film does require an audience of some appreciative mind frame. Those with short attention spans that bring phones into theatres, though I stereotype will more than likely not enjoy this experience. It takes an appreciative eye to savour this for what it is, and that is quite simply . .<br/><br/>An exemplary slice of science fiction."
"RResende","10","3","6","21 December 2006"," Impressionism in dystopic contours
","First of all, Blade Runner is not about a story, it's not about, characters, it's not about being concrete. It's about landscape, it's about city, as reflex of civilization. It's about correcting our present, knowing what happened in the past. And so, the future is used, so the sci-fi mood is brought. Paradoxal it may be, the future tense gives the viewer the necessary distance towards what he is supposed to ""see"". And what you see is in here fundamental, not because of the spectacular sets, not because the astonishing prediction of what city will be in years to come but because it only shows what's already in front of us. Practically every sci-fi film that tries to predict an entirely new city is based on what is ""futuristic"" in the time of its idealization, from visual power masterpieces like Metropolis, to franchised versions of a future world like Demolition Man. Ridley Scott proposes a city that exists already, today, now. We get to the future through present, our present and that links us to it where the future tense gave us distance. Everything is deliberately thrown in a dystopic, chaos like package, that shakes, not because it's dark and rainy, but because it's in a city that exists now, and in buildings older than a century now. Sebastian lives in a neoclassic building from probably end of XIXth century, the routs of everything clearly bad and distorted and perverse in this Scott's future are clearly anchored on our present. Obviously every sci-fi director is before anything else, an earth inhabitant, so his base is his reality as a earthier, but in here, he makes the effort to through that at the viewer.<br/><br/>So, everything is classical, Sean Young, a replicant that doesn't know it, has a classical beauty, the characterization, the way she moves, the way she talks. She plays the piano. She has a memory. She is human, except for the fact she is a replicant, created by men and that's where man is elevated to the category of god in the exact measure that he creates with the same perfection as Him. The camera is Deckard, the camera is the observer and this observer works in the top of the buildings, works above humanity, works on the last floor of Tyrell's Olympus like industrial complex. What is made in here is a change in time scale notion in order to get us, as viewers, down to earth. If god is eternity, and men's life is a second in eternity; what we see here is Men's life becoming the possible eternity and the replicants' 4 years life just a small passage in reality. Whenever replicants are referred in Blade Runner it is in fact me who is being referred. Ultimately, this may be about falling to earth with the notion that time is precious, and 4 years can be a long time, if well used. ""all those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain"", says Rutger Hauer's character.This is about keeping memory for eternity, whatever that is.<br/><br/>Men is reflected on his creation, his imperfections, but also his qualities, show up in what he creates. So, throughout the film, we come to change our view of the replicants, from menace to empathy, from desire to eliminate (as survival instinct) to desire to embrace and consequent emptiness for their disappearance. That's when replicants become men, that's when we know he's not talking about robots, but us. ""petty she won't live, but again, who will?"" this is bottom line, nothing lasts forever, creator or creation. Still, facing the inevitability of death doesn't stop Deckard from running for life, or replicants from trying to live.<br/><br/>Another aspect is that there is no ""soundtrack"", there is no ""music"" in this one, only ""soundscapes"", as dystopic as the city, as dark as this future, as empty as no future. Those sounds are the story of that city, are the story of our past, as told in our present, where there is no memory, where memories are forgotten, or made up as, once more, a survival device. Memory is a pillow for emotions, says Tyrell, he is god, he knows emotions are needed in order to exist, but he also knows he can't perpetuate lies about it, he knows he will die.<br/><br/>Ultimately this may be a film noir anchored sci-fi film which, if well explored, could become a genre in itself. Checking it, you will find practically every aspect of film noir in it. For every aspect I referred, i believe this to be the essential sci-fi film, fulfilling completely the role that sci-fi was always supposed to have, but hardly ever had. Between 1979 with Alien and 1982 with this one, Ridley Scott moved definitely forward in understanding what science fiction is, and how it should leak into film making. Every artist has his limits in innovation and creation, apparently Scott's limit was defined here. His post work never got to be as influential or good as these two films, but, what he gave was more than enough.<br/><br/>No rating needed, what i said should be enough."
"crunchyfroggie","8","3","6","22 January 2006"," Falls short of Philip K. Dick's brilliant novel
","""Blade Runner"" is an enjoyable and 'solid' sci-fi film. However having read Philip K. Dick's novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"", upon which the film is based, I was left somewhat disappointed/wanting more. (Inevitable I guess, given the calibre of Dick's writing.)<br/><br/>I accept that film adaptations of original written works typically sacrifice some plot threads and/or character details in order to produce a coherent film of an appropriate length. However ""Blade Runner"" really would have benefited from a better 'sketch' of the futuristic world in which the characters live (I mean in terms of plot rather than visual detail), and a tad more time spent establishing the background and motivations of Rick Deckard (the bounty hunter) and the androids he pursues.<br/><br/>That said, the film is visually impressive and boasts good performances from Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer and Sean Young."
"Ryan_V","10","3","6","6 October 2005"," Essential Viewing for a Human Being
","It is not often a film warrants 10/10. Bladerunner, spearheaded by Harrison Ford (Rick Deckard) and Rutger Hauer (Roy Batty), delivers both cinematically, with its designer sets and innovative clothing, to its script and acting quality. Based on Philip K. Dick's book, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"", Bladerunner has surpassed beyond what an ideal film is. Often times, for instance, there is double meanings in scenes, that run as deep as the cosmos.<br/><br/>For its visuals alone, it has ingrained itself in history when sci-fi was coming into CGI. CGI, unfortunately, pales hopelessly, even today, in comparison to yesterday's Hollywood models. From the cars to the streets to the VidPhon, the future is so well depicted that nothing has challenged it before neither after. Demolition Man with Sylvestor Stallone was formidable, but it fails in so many other respects that it should not even be considered as a challenge.<br/><br/>Entering Bladerunner, it explores what it means to be a human, and, how important emotions are in shaping who we are. It also exploits other, complex philosophical issues, as Deckard tries to understand ""what"" he is and whether anything is, in fact, ""real."" Sounds like the Matrix, except the correct clause would be: The Matrix sounds like Bladerunner, with the addition of the Matrix being a gross misinterpretation. While the Matrix provides us with a possibility of what reality is, Bladerunner is less ambitious, focusing on and questioning what memories are, how they shape us, and what our ""reality"" means in relation.<br/><br/>It questions our morals; our history; our identities; our entire logically constructed world. As we have a myriad of qualities in common with the Replicants, they only live for 4 years. It teaches us about the importance of understanding, or, at least attempting to understand, life's nature and what that means to ones personal subsistence. With only 4 years to live a life span, the Replicants show us that they have the ability to get wise quickly, rather than the situation with humans: growing old so fast but wise so slow.<br/><br/>Philosophically, this film is significantly accurate. The scene where Batty meets his maker, Tyrell, is compelling and is one of the best scenes in film history. Each scene is a journey, and, together, it completes a fine story - blessed with deep irony and valuable information about how we arrived at our present intellectual states. There is much action, too."
"Lechuguilla","Null","3","6","27 February 2005"," What A Great Film Concept
","Extraterrestrial robots return to earth in search of their ""maker"", in an effort to extend their preset four-year life span. Lots to think about and ponder. Can robots achieve self-awareness? Are humans merely self-aware robots? Are thoughts and feelings programmable?<br/><br/>But ""Blade Runner"", to me, is only partially satisfying. So much of the film, which is generally fast paced, is saturated with unnecessary objects and images that are almost constantly in motion. All of which translates into a kaleidoscope of hubbub and visual overload that I found irritating. Also, the violence, especially in the Rutger Hauer character, is off-putting. Given the film's clever premise, I would have thought the screenwriters could have devised a more futuristic way to express conflict.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the film does a good job of describing a future that is truly bleak. In the year 2019, the rich and powerful have fled earth, leaving only the poor and oppressed to endure a post-apocalyptic urban wasteland of gritty neon, dense atmospheric smog, and constant rain. The film's noirish lighting, combined with its cultural ambiguity, and strange sound effects (especially the use of echoes), effectively convey a mood of despair and helplessness. And the music by Vangelis is both beautiful and chilling, and adds to the overall bleakness.<br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" is based on a really good premise. And some of the dialogue is fairly profound. But the over emphasis on special effects, cinematography, and sets dilutes the film's philosophical import. While most viewers probably prefer the razzle-dazzle visuals, I would have preferred some restraint in production, with a corresponding expansion of the implications inherent in the underlying concept."
"budmassey","10","3","6","18 September 2003"," A dreamland dystopia where humanity has been absorbed by its own disastrous creations.
","This is, quite simply, the best Sci-Fi movie ever made, and one of the finest movies of any genre. Recently a Final Cut was issued on DVD. It restores some scenes that were taken out before to the film's detriment, but suffers also from a softening of one of the greatest lines in history. (When Roy Batty meets Dr. Tyrell, he confronts his maker with the line ""I want more life, f**ker."" This version (and others) softens the line to ""I want more life, father."" indicating the relationship between Roy and Tyrell. I liked it better the other way.)<br/><br/>The story is fraught with allegory, laden with existentialism. If you try to take it too literally, you will be missing the point. It will be hard to digest the themes if you are not familiar with the writings of Descartes, Foucualt, Kierkegaard, or Nietzsche, which probably precludes the vast majority of viewers from fully appreciating the film.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is based on the short story Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, written by the legendary Philip K. Dick, whose visionary plot-twisting epics include Total Recall (I Can Dream That For You Wholesale) and Minority Report, which was, sadly, defiled by being made into a Tom Cruise vehicle. Dick would have rolled over in his grave, since he loathed Hollywood for exactly such reasons. <br/><br/>So why was this movie made? So a generation of lesser films would have a vast and bleak vision to imitate in countless rip-offs, take-offs, and send-ups. But none ever approach the stark and visionary brilliance of Blade Runner.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford plays a Blade Runner, basically, an Android Hunter. A band of marauding androids, called Replicants, have violated Earth law by coming on-world. The year is 2019, and Earth is a post-apocalyptic nightmare cloaked in a perpetual drizzle and darkness. Ford is charged with hunting down the Replicants and destroying them.<br/><br/>Now, there's too much to lay out here, but the Replicants have been preprogrammed by their makers to live only a short time. This prevents them from getting delusions of grandeur. Here is where you lose most casual observers. The Replicants represent Man, and his yearning for immortality is manifested in the angst these creatures feel at their impending doom. Why do we die? Why were we born in the first place? What is the meaning of our lives and our relationship with our creator?<br/><br/>Now imagine that you had the chance to ask God these very things. This is exactly what happens when the lead Replicant, Roy, played by Rutger Hauer in his absolutely finest hour, meets Tyrell, the man who invented Replicants. Let's just say the meeting goes less than swimmingly, and the rage Roy feels afterward is the essence of the human struggle with the meaning and futility of life. In perfect human form, Roy literally dispenses with God and continues to search for meaning to his arbitrarily limited life.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford famously disliked working in this film and with Ridley Scott, whose relentless demand for perfection frustrated Ford. Ford was apparently also dissatisfied with his character, whom he saw as weak. In fact, Deckert is, despite Ford's disdain for playing him, a subtle and nuanced character, fiercely conflicted, who shoots women in the back, drinks too much, and falls in love with his quarry, all the while stalking beings who only want what he wants, to live.<br/><br/>The women in the movie are all breathtaking in their own way. Darryl Hannah is the exotic beauty, a Replicant designed, as her dossier explains, as a pleasure model. In a great example of attention to detail, her character, Pris, has an incept date of February 14, which is what one would expect for a pleasure model. Zora, played by Joanna Cassidy, is described as ""beauty and the beast"" since she is a trained killer. This duality is reflected in her dossier as well, since she is a Gemini, the perfect sign for duality. I could go on, but suffice it to say that there are endless such gems in the details.<br/><br/>The film, with all its allusions, climaxes in the final confrontation between Deckert and Batty. It is confessional, elegiac and powerful. Batty faces his end clutching a white dove, a touch added by Rutger Hauer himself, in much the same way we consider our own souls as we face death, and if by now you haven't fully realized the ultimate allusion of the film, recall that Batty his a nail piercing his hand.<br/><br/>The ultimate question to consider is whether Deckert himself is a Replicant, but you cannot fully weigh that question unless you watch the movie multiple times, and even then you will have to make a judgment call. It would not be characteristic of Dick to reveal any definitive answer to that question, so your answer will have to come from you as you consider your own ideas of life, existence, mortality and immortality, God, and destiny. Goodness. How could we ask more of a movie?<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's direction melds in a miraculous synergy with Vangelis' superb, minimalist score. The result is a thought-provoking classic that raises, but doesn't quite answer, the most elemental questions of existence in a dreamland dystopia where humanity has been absorbed by its own disastrous creations. <br/><br/>If you've never seen this movie, watch the original theatrical release with the extended footage. The commentary makes the story easier to follow, and since Dick will mess your mind like a master, most first time viewers need the commentary. (Indeed, it was added post-production, because Scott feared most viewers wouldn't understand the plot. He was right.)<br/><br/>If you're familiar with Blade Runner, then watch the Director's Cut, or the newer Final Cut. The Sam Spade commentary is gone, and what is left is a desolate but magnificent voyage into the very best that Sci-Fi has to offer."
"chris12345678","10","3","6","20 February 2002"," The most powerful SF movie ever
","This is one of my most favorite movies so don't expect me to be objective. The plot is loosely based on a short story by Philip K Dick, often called Dostoyevski of the SF field. It's about an android hunter who is called back from retirement to track down and kill dangerous runaway androids. As he finds and kills them he becomes more and more aware of their struggle to be human, of their yearning for life that can never be fulfilled. They kill their maker when they learn that they can only live a few short years; that they can never be one of us. In the final scene the hunter (Harrison Ford in one of his best roles) finally understands that in their short lives the androids had become more human than humans; that they value life more than us. That's why he was hired to liquidate them. With this film Ridley Scott proved that he is more than just a skilled moviemaker - he is an artist. Sadly, true art is usually noticed and appreciated only many, many years after its creation and it pays little. The movie has an incredible atmosphere. It may not be for everybody. If you are looking for an action flick with lots of explosions then watch ""Commando"" or other trash like that, or, better still, pour gasoline on your car and set it on fire - there will be a nice explosion and great sound effects (and if that's not enough there is the neighbor's car). This movie is definitely not for people with the IQ lower that that of a frog."

Harrison Ford is to be one of the greatest actors alive who did such amazing movies like Star Wars and The Fugitive, had a wooden performance like a children's toy. I found him to be quite a boring character of Blade Runner. The movie was very dark and the film was just too serious. I also thought the film was bizarre and had tons of weird moments, but I guess that I have to watch the film twice to understand all of it instead of most of it. The positive side is that the film was very stylish and had a lot of cool inventions and nice scenery for a 80's film. But the best side of Blade Runner was Rutger Haurer who really carried the movie as the creepy replicant. He did a fantastic job.

Actually I nearly fell asleep watching BR as well.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in 2019, with an ultra-futuristic and depressing setting. The bleak insight into the future was simply a product of it's time - 1982 saw double-digit unemployment rates, more than 14 percent mortgage rates, and high oil prices.<br/><br/>For a science fiction movie, it certainly moves slowly - though the pacing and rhythm is consistent. They've added a lot of stuff that just didn't fit in - as some have already mentioned, the unicorn in Drecker's dream and the mustached man appearing at the end. The woman who Drecker falls in love with is a distraction as well. The character development was quite poor. I had difficulty rooting for any particular character in this film.<br/><br/>After watching a bad movie the night before, I really wanted to like Blade Runner. Unfortunately, behind all that science fiction action and distraction, is a thin predictable plot. The plot holes and ambiguous scripting doesn't do justice either.

(FYI, I have seen the final cut and the original theatrical cut). The story is undeniably interesting, and Harrison Ford is at the peak of his acting career, but there's something about it that I just haven't been able to grasp. Granted, the second viewing was more rewarding than the first, likely because my expectations were significantly lowered. However, the slow pace and inconsistent tone are still things that plague this sci-fi ""classic"". I re-watched Blade Runner in anticipation for the upcoming Blade Runner 2049, and perhaps that film will enhance my appreciation for the original, but for now, I'm leaving this film as it is. There are certainly some fascinating things touched upon with Ridley Scott's direction, the replicants desires, the technical achievements, and the detective aspect to the feature. It's just not enough for me to get this film to fresh.<br/><br/>5.0/10"

","I will give a simple review and opinion if you thinking to watch it or not.<br/><br/>My opinion : Its up to you whether to watch it or not.<br/><br/>For me, nothing special about the movie and sometime its boring. Yes the idea behind the movie is quite brilliant and Harrison Ford give good performance as always.<br/><br/>The movie most of the part have slow pace. <br/><br/>The Ending is also quite disappointing and I m not sure how the rating is so high<br/><br/>Thats it."
"Filvies144","2","4","10","14 February 2016"," A complete waste of time and effort.
","The most praised movie of 1982 (Along with ET of course) gets a 8.2 average rating on this database you are on right now. How could it be that high? I mean this is a complete garbage film that is so overrated. And heres why: In 2019, Earth has been rebuilt and Los Angeles becomes a dark and depressing area or ""colony"". A group of replicants (robots who look like humans) from outside of Earth steal a spaceship to get to Earth to meet their creator and murder people. Then the police call a retired employee, Deckard a Blade Runner (A person who kills replicants) to kill the replicants. Why is it so moronic? Well, there are a series of plot holes: One plot hole is that there are said to be six replicants at first, but then for some reason even when none have been killed, it is said to be 4 with no explanation. There is also no reason for the replicants to be murdering a bunch of random people. Plus because of reasons that will spoil this film, wouldn't the geniuses that created the replicants build them so that they won't kill people and steal spaceships? This is completely illogical and idiotic. That's not all. The film is also VERY BORING. Even though I watched the whole movie, I lost interest in the first 10 minutes and nearly fell sleep. I mean there's not much action. It's just a bunch of talk 11/12ths of the time. And not interesting talk like the Indiana Jones films. So overall, this is pitiful. It also lacks strong emotion, heart, and development. So overall story of the movie is so depressing, dark, cruel, very boring, and is completely illogical.<br/><br/>There's also the characters. Oh my gosh, this is sad. The replicants in the film (Roy, Leon, etc.). Lemme just say that they have no personality. Sure they're robots, but maybe they shouldn't have been so bland. Y'all may disagree, but I think they should've had a big personality like Bender from Futurama did to make them more interesting. Harrison Ford was wasted because he would underact and sound bored while playing Deckard. Deckard is charmless, and bland. The creator of the Replicants amazes me because of how forgettable he is. Then there's Sebastian. He's actually a 25 year old who do to health problems looks so old, but he does collect toys and show a smile, which is why he is the best character of the movie. So yeah, these characters are so boring, undeveloped, and such that it is just unappealing.<br/><br/>That's your answer. Blade Runner is the steaming pile of crud. The writing is abysmal, and the characters are so bland. It is so boring that I was so close to falling asleep. One of the only redeeming qualities I didn't mention before was a Star Wars reference when you can hear a Chewbacca growl at one part, which is a very small pro but adds a little Star Wars, which is why better than this Atrocity and has everything this doesn't: A well crafted story, memorable characters, a little heart, and lots of charm.<br/><br/>2/10"

","I LOVE Blade Runner! I read the book before seeing the film, and enjoyed it to a sufficient degree, and was excited to see the film but nothing could have prepared me for the beauty and majesty of this film. I will say that I originally saw the Director's Cut, then saw the international, and have seen the beginning of the Final Cut. I can acknowledge the many flaws in this film, but I can look past them to see a film that is a poetic and beautiful film. But I'm very afraid (like being a slave) because I tried to watch Blade Runner with my best friend and my cousin. My best friend couldn't make it past the introduction of Pris. My cousin spent half the film looking at her iPad. When I asked her why she wasn't paying attention, she responded that she was listening. You can't just listen to Blade Runner! The film is a visual masterpiece and if you can't just listen to it! This work of art is being lost on our current generation who can't sit through what makes it so amazing! I give Blade Runner a 9.8/10"
"logicman-legend","9","4","10","7 December 2014"," Harrison Ford is AWESOME!
","As I watched 'The Blade Runner' I was blown away. I realized that how did the science fiction dystopian film started. This neo-noir film is directed by the 'father' of Director's Cut Ridley Scott. It's starred by the phenomenon actor Harrison Ford, Sean Young and Edward James Olmos. The story is intriguing that blows away all my expectations. The acting is much more realistic like the visuals that gives a different feel as if I was watching a film based on the present, not like the typical 80s. True that the 80s were the golden era of great films. The only flaw is the pacing of the movie and the things that pleased me is the acting and its originality."
"denton-ron","4","4","10","8 May 2008"," Nice visuals but loses most of Philip Dick's story
","OK, so this is supposedly this great sci-fi noir classic of our time. Ridley Scott did do well with the visuals for the time, but most of the ""deep"" stuff of Dick's story is gone as well as even the simple slang and feeling that gets you there. So much of the original story is discarded or else traded for cheap skin shots that it really should be remade with some integrity to the great story is supposedly derives from. This is about as close to ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" as the horrible Starship Troopers film is like the book. The whole concept of the pet animals is missing and the reason for the Andys to come to earth is completely wrong. The androids or andys as Dick calls them are trying to find a spiritual experience the way humans flock to Mercerism. Even the excellent idea of the mood organ is gone. Lots of screen time is spent on stupid shots of the probably expensive to construct scenery that could have been used to actually insert more of the original story elements. I recently viewed this again after rereading the book and couldn't wait for this sci-fi shooter to be done. Read the book or listen to the unabridged audio-book and you'll agree."
"sabyu_28","1","14","53","3 April 2005"," Boring
","A line from the original script describes the Asian extras as ""old slant-eyed enders humped over their fuming bowls jabbering and slurping."" Edward James Olmos is in yellowface, with a lame stereotypical Asian accent. His character is described in the shooting script as a ""short Japanese guy with beady eyes and lots of energy."" Clearly a lot of thought has gone into making the Asian characters in this film subhuman and inferior. The movie was bad enough on its own, but the addition of these completely superfluous negative images of Asians really pushes it over the edge and from boring to offensive. Bravo for pathetic stereotypes."

","So this is based of the book ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"", and yet there are not even any electric sheep in it! What happened to all the symbolism? I feel like they just excavated the substance from the book, and just made an empty robot-hunting movie. It was a very clinical approach to a movie which may have otherwise had something to say.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not suggesting you go read the book, which isn't even good, but at least it tried to be about something, unlike this movie, which just doesn't & isn't. Isn't about anything, that is.<br/><br/>It amazes me how this movie can secure such a high rating. My gosh! Oh, well, on second thought, maybe there are sheep in this movie after all.

Ford and the rest of the cast gives adequate performances, but where is the plot in this movie. Nothing happens. I can understand why I fell asleep the first two times.<br/><br/>Rating: 3/10"

","Visually, Blade Runner is a beautiful movie. And I'm a big fan of Harrison Ford. But that's about the only positive things I can say about this movie. The story is just awful and doesn't make any sense at all. The plot holes are way too big to ignore. It's such a mess it's even embarrassing."

""meow meow meow the main cop dude could've been a robot too"" oooh so clever; would never have saw that coming. <br/><br/>Disgusting bogus character development, the love between Harrison Ford and the robot chick was f'ing contrived and out of the blue, the Spanish cop who placed origami pieces everywhere ahahaaha what was up with that... the Tyrell godfather figure had absolutely no security, the robot guy somehow knew the status of the chess game, the stupid eye symbology, the constant appearance of the oriental lady on the advertisement screens XD, the robot chick not killing Harrison Ford and then doing some flips only to get shot XD, cancerous movie with absolutely nothing going for it but the back ground music."
"alexugoku","4","5","14","18 July 2011"," Based on ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?""... really?!
","It's really annoying how someone can say that this movie is based on the exceptionally good book of Philip K. Dick, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"", and yet include so few elements form it - so few i can enumerate them: the names (and only the names) of some characters, the androids, the environment, the Voigt-Kampff test.<br/><br/>Before I continue, i need to say that i understand that a book is different from a movie, even if one is based on the other; but it has to retain the key elements, the plot. Some people complain that the Harry Potter books are better; yes, the books are better, but because of the details, because of the 'filler' you might say, but the key elements are still there.<br/><br/>So, where is the background story? Why are the questions in the Voigt- Kampff test about hurting animals? Where did the androids come from, why were they created? Why are they only available on Mars? Why are androids on Earth, in general, hunted? Why did humans go to Mars, and yet why are there a lot of them still on Earth? These, and a lot, lot more are important parts of the story that aren't explained in depth enough (or aren't present at all) to make the movie interesting. <br/><br/>All of those elements are connected, they don't float around in this futuristic world by their own, like the movie presents itself.<br/><br/>And even if the movie wasn't based on a book, it is still pretty bad. There is no chemistry between the actors, the characters are boring. The plot, the storyline is also boring: some androids (creation) escape slavery to meet their maker, in order to live longer (to make their lives better)... really original, I couldn't think of another movie like that. The only good thing about this movie were the visuals.<br/><br/>What a disappointment."
"Bauer_124","5","5","14","5 November 2009"," Seriously overrated
","The most exciting thing about this movie is the title. Besides it looking quite good for a 1982 movie, it is nothing special. I actually fell asleep during the movie. Deckard is meant to be one of the best Bladerunners but how does he kill the ""dangerous"" replicants? He shoots one is the back was she runs away and another while she's doing back flips. And the other two? One is shot from behind while he's choking Deckard and the other sits down and dies after saving Deckard's life. I would like someone to please tell me why people still use this movie as a benchmark in 2009. It was boring then and still is now. I give it a 5 for the special effects"
"knight_armour","4","5","14","2 December 2005"," Didn't Like It
","Writing a negative review for this movie seems like heresy, but I feel compelled to do it. Also, perhaps I'm not even entitled to write this review because I could only stand to watch the first hour of the movie before deciding to turn it off. Unbelievable? Let me explain why. This movie is perhaps one of the most touted films of all time and I had not seen it despite the movie having been around for over 20 years. So, one day, I finally decided to watch the thing and bore patiently through each boring scene after another. I'm a fan of science fiction but now I realize not in the sense of a connoisseur but just a guy who likes a good blend of action, drama, science, fiction and acting. This movie arguably has all of those things but is achingly slow in presenting them. It cannot escape looking every bit like a 1982 vision of what the future would be like and suffers too much from being implemented from an arty angle. The scenes are too dark for Harrison Ford's charms (he could easily have been replaced with someone else who didn't have Indiana Jones behind him) and the characters are much too deep to bother even trying to understand. The philosophical angle doesn't impress me either. There are many 'big questions' movies can deal with without making the audience itself lie on the couch. I suppose the last 40 minutes or so of the film might have been better and tied up some loose ends but I could not stand to waste any more time watching it. Looking at other movies from the same era which I still find very interesting - Conan The Barbarian, Indiana Jones and Alien - I'm disappointed to say that Blade Runner could have been better. Anyway, I will shoulder part of the blame because I didn't watch it to the end and perhaps because technology is moving at light speed these days, philosophical science fiction movies really look much, much older than they ought to. No offense to those who really loved this movie. To each his own."

Had a love scene with an android?? isn't he hunting them down? Then the end fight scene? what is with that? Maybe back in 1982 this movie may had looked good visually, but if I want a sci-fi from back then I'll watch Alien. This is the most over rated piece of junk ever to be released in the history of cinema.  1.5/10  ( 1.5 for Harrison Ford's acting)"

","I've just seen this movie and I just can't understand why it's in the Top250. The same reason as for the Rocky Horror picture show? Since all people around you find it good or superb is definitely not a reason (it shouldn't be the only reason anyway) to rate it up in your personal point of view.<br/><br/>OK - it's possible that the special effects, the costumes and the music were good in 1982. But what's with the plot? In my point of view the plot is good enough for a short story, but definitely not for a two hour movie.<br/><br/>If you want to do you a favor: don't watch this movie - at least don't buy it before you've seen it..."
"davidturgay","Null","5","14","17 July 2000"," Style over substance - 1:0
","When you watch movies like 'Blade Runner' or 'Alien' you realize how much Ridley Scott was a typical director of the 80's and you wonder how he now became a typical director of the 90's. With these two films I mentioned he directed the two most important science-fiction movies since 'Star Wars' and defined a style which became regular in films like 'Dark City', the other 'Alien'-films, 'Outland' or 'Terminator'. This dark, quiet tone with not too much action, not too much story but a lot of style and atmosphere. Today it seems impossible to make a film like 'Blade Runner'.<br/><br/>Maybe one of the most important differences is the look of the special effects. I like big CG-effects which make you go 'Ah' and 'Oh', but the effects in sci-fi films of the 80's are different and somehow better than today. Most of them are models and matte paintings and this looks somehow more realistic. You see that the big complex the industrial named Tyrell lives in is real. It is standing there. This always amazed me.<br/><br/>But 'Blade Runner' has more than special effects, although they were and are really impressing. I was pretty sure there was more and during watching the film the second time after several years (this time in the Director's Cut) I wondered what. I mean, the story isn't really so complicated and hard to understand. Cop has to find four replicants. Replicants don't want to die. I mean, that's it. The characters all seem to be unhappy and with a lot of secrets but that's nothing new. This hasn't changed pretty much. And you don't get to know so much more about them.<br/><br/>I think the films lives nearly entirely out of his atmosphere. Everything looks so dark and so much full of atmosphere you nearly can feel it. It's always raining (and it does in most dark science-fiction-films, because there are less things that produce more atmosphere) and always dark (the same). The characters are looking more at each other than they talk. They look at each other and into mirrors and in to the dark sky. This is what makes them alive, since you don't know anything about them.<br/><br/>Consider Harrison Ford's character. At the beginning he sits in a Chinese fast-food bar. He says he quit his job as a blade runner and he doesn't want to do it anymore. Why? Why can his former chief (M. Emmet Walsh) so simply put him back into his old job? You see some photos in Ford's apartment but never get to know who the people on it are. But still I think it's his best role ever. It's his only role where he plays a character who isn't simply good. He does a bad job and he knows it.<br/><br/>Still, this a really fascinating movie with lots of neat details like the big elevator at Tyrell's or the puppets at Sebastian's who always run into the same door. And the showdown between Ford and Hauer (who had definitely his best role here) is just fantastic. But does anything of this make real sense? I'm not quite sure. And I'm less sure if I think about the work of the author Philip K. Dick on whose novel the film is based. Dick is a fantastic sci-fi writer and he has always a lot to say. He makes us think. 'Blade Runner' made me think too. But I just didn't get anywhere. Maybe I'm just stupid."
"scott37-1","2","9","31","7 May 2006"," There were no children in this movie
","And that was on the top of my mind the whole time. Are we really to believe LA could be ten times the size and population it is now in just a matter of decades? This film has an impossible view of reality. The truth is, you can't have overpopulation if nobody in the future makes babies. Sounds old fashioned, but that's the grim reality of the 21st century, which in just a few decades will see perhaps the first voluntary decrease of the entire world population. We're just about at our peak, folks. The issues of the coming century will be how to have a stable society in which all its institutions become increasingly evacuated. Liberals who make these sci-fi films just don't get it. The future is not going to be a mechanical, sexy, technological utopia. It will be filled with religious strife as it has for millenia, because it's the pious who procreate more.<br/><br/>Sure, maybe we will one day have androids that look human, maybe even think somewhat human. Maybe we will love them, like we love a pet. But it's absurd to say we will farm them out like slaves. Imagine that. We make these droids in our own likeness with our own emotions and then submit them to slavery. Like humanity could sink so low and still have a working civilization. We could have made them look like machines, but instead we chose our likeness. Riiight.<br/><br/>I think I would have swallowed this stuff when I was a fifteen, but thankfully I've since matured just a little.<br/><br/>I don't care much for special effects anymore, though I'll give the critics the beneift of the doubt that there were breakthroughs in style and technique here...too bad they were wasted."

And once it actually kicked into high speed, it ended within 10 minutes!<br/><br/>The acting was quite good and they did indeed have a very good ensemble of acting performers on the cast list. Harrison Ford, of course, carried the movie phenomenally. And he was joined nicely on the screen by the likes of Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, M.

Ridley Scott delivered an amazing movie a step up from Alien and nothing he has done since will ever be as great as this movie. <br/><br/>A very dark movie, investigating our Humanity with lots of bread crumbs to lead us into many different interpretations of what actually was happening and how the characters are related. <br/><br/>Do yourself a favour and watch this movie if you have not and watch it again if you have."

","Ahh, the 80's, when people could imagine the future as a dark, polluted thing, where people have lost their freedom to corporations. Of course, we now know that this would never happen. *cough*<br/><br/>Philip K. Dick has a difficult writing style, something wild in it that makes it hard to grasp, to control. However a lot of his work molds well to the screen and Blade Runner is no exception. What makes the film exceptional, though, is not the pulp mystery feel of the story or the inspiration of the sets and clothes from mid 19th century US or even the excellent acting. Instead it is the attention to detail that Ridley Scott demonstrated when doing it all. This is clearly the work of an obsessive man who saw the film in his head way before it started to make it. This is rare nowadays due to budgets and to the fact that most of popular cinema is not an art anymore, only a business.<br/><br/>Watch the film and notice how the characters are not really well defined, leaving room for the imagination, while the sets and the props are clearly very detailed and the world in which the story unfolds makes the characters both gain weight and lose focus. The human condition is actually the main character.<br/><br/>Bottom line: a beautifully made film, by a dedicated director, with excellent acting and a story that works on multiple levels at the same time. Rightly considered a masterpiece, you should watch it at least once."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","3","7","24 November 2012"," One of the Best Looking Dark Films Ever Made
","Blade Runner (1982)<br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4) Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is one of the best Blade Runner's in the business. A Blade Runner is a person who is paid to go after illegal replicants and the most recent case has him going after four including the sadistic Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer).<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's BLADE RUNNER was released with minor fans but overtime it grew into what many consider one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made. It's really hard to judge or rate this movie because it's available in so many different versions. This viewing here was actually the third version I've seen and I gotta say that if you have to keep re-editing, adding and altering a movie then I question how good it is to begin with.<br/><br/>I know many people consider BLADE RUNNER to be one of the greatest movies ever made. I honestly get their reaction but I certainly don't share it. The film is certainly one of the most brilliantly looking movies ever made. Visually this film is rather incredible as director Scott has no problem creating the mood of this dark city as well as the rather grim nature. The special effects, costume design, sets and music score are all flawless and perfectly capture a terrific vision.<br/><br/>With that said, I think there's a lot more style than substance here. Not for a second did I ever get totally involved in the ""story"" going on. I thought it was a rather interesting idea but storywise there's nothing great here. I also thought the slow nature was a bit too boring. I know this is a thinking man's approach but it just didn't work with me. With that said, the ending is quite excellent and I thought the scenes between Ford and Hauer were extremely effective.<br/><br/>The performances from the entire cast is another major plus with Ford perfect in the role, which is a throwback to the type of detectives that we'd see in film noir titles of the 40s and 50s. Hauer makes for a great villain and we get nice support from Sean Young, M. Emmet Walsh, Edward James Olmos, William Sanderson, Joe Turkel and Daryl Hannah among others.<br/><br/>Again, I understand why some call BLADE RUNNER one of the greatest films ever made. In my opinion, the original theatrical cut is quite poor. The Director's Cut was certainly an improvement. Having now just watched ""The Final Cut"" it reall didn't improve too much from the director's cut. As is, I'd probably recommend the Director's Cut."
"TheSunnyBoy","Null","3","7","15 January 2012"," An intelligent masterpiece...
","Released in 1982, Blade Runner had continuously been referred to as a must-see movie and thus it had been my intention for quite some time to watch it. The year 2007 saw the release of the 'Final Cut' version of the film, and I felt obliged to watch it for that reason. The first time I watched the movie I felt confused and didn't really get the message it contained. Some time later I revisited the movie, and boy was I amazed! I am not only fully convinced that Blade Runner accounts for the best science fiction film ever produced, I also think it's one of the best movies ever made in any genre. I find it very disturbing that the film's intelligence and superiority hasn't been fully recognized here on IMDb, owing mostly to the fact that so many people who have reviewed this film have neither the patience nor the intelligence to understand what the film really is about.<br/><br/>The film begins by introducing the viewer to the dark future of Los Angeles with a very powerful and visually sublime opening scene. Technology has advanced to the level where it is possible to manufacture human beings so that they cannot be detected from the real ones without a specific test. This test relies on the fact that although these humanoids, referred to as replicants, are highly intelligent and much more agile than real humans, they lack empathy. Because of their violence replicants have been banned from Earth with special police units, blade runners, hunting down and killing those who can be found. One of these blade runners is Rick Deckard, who gets a task of killing a group of replicants who have escaped to Earth from an off-world colony.<br/><br/>The nature of the replicants becomes obvious at the very beginning of the film, when one of them brutally shoots down a blade runner. Throughout the film the replicants show their violent and emotionless behaviour as they advance toward their goal: to meet their maker and gain more life, as they only have a programmed life span of four years. The replicants befriend J. F. Sebastian, a lonely but kind genetic designer who is the one character that gives humanity its true face amid the dark and sinister atmosphere that prevails throughout the film. The brutal murder of Sebastian along with the creator of the replicants truly make the distance between humans and replicants grow tremendously.<br/><br/>The film's philosophical question is the meaning of being a human. Despite the compassionlessness of the replicants the gap of them and human beings is questioned throughout the film. Particularly when Deckard cold-bloodily tells Rachael that she is nothing but a manufactured machine with unauthentic memories in a hauntingly sad scene, the treatment of replicants as nothing but engines becomes morally questionable. The true turning point takes place in the end of film, where the replicant saves Deckard's life. In his powerful last words the replicant makes Deckard aware of the fact that even he has feelings. The undertone that human behaviour of disregarding the replicants is unmissable and really sums up the message of the film. For how can human beings judge the replicants when they themselves can show such hate and monstrousity that even surpasses that of the ones they are hunting down? Especially Rachael shows just how humane even a replicant can be. The astonishingly powerful visuals act as a reminder that the humans have indeed left the very world they are living in scarred and dark. This is emphasized even more when the magical score of Vangelis is played in the background. His use of synth-driven melancholic music succeeds so fantastically well in preserving the gloomy atmosphere of the film.<br/><br/>I urge anyone who have mixed feelings about the film to watch it again within a few months. No doubt your feelings about the film is changed when you are better prepared for the film which demands that the viewer is patient and analyzing - this is no Adam Sandler comedy where the viewer can just sit back and enjoy the show without any brainwork involved. The film is just like the very theme behind it - the more you comprehend humanity the more complex it turns out to be. If more people gave it more thought, this underrated masterpiece would be lifted up where it belongs - right up among the best films ever produced."

","Director: Ridley Scott. Running time: 117 mins (approx). Certification (UK): 15.<br/><br/>Genre: Sci-Fi/Drama/Thriller. UK Release date: 9th September 1982. NOTE: This DVD version hails from 1991.<br/><br/>Watched on DVD Thursday 17th November 2011.<br/><br/>PLEASE NOTE: THERE MAY BE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.<br/><br/>I have spoken to many fans of Science Fiction over the years and the vast majority of them always have something good to say about this film. Now I know there are those among you, mostly deranged people, who might hold a different view, but I am on the side of those who rate this film. I'll even go so far as to say its right up there with the very best sci-fi films (if you ignore the original theatrical cut, which was truly awful). More of my praise after this brief summary.<br/><br/>There is an opening scrolling text on this version of the film that explains the set-up better than I ever could, here it is:<br/><br/>""Early in the 21st Century, THE TYRELL CORPORATION advanced Robot evolution into the NEXUS phase - a being virtually identical to a human - known as a Replicant. <br/><br/>The NEXUS 6 Replicants were superior in strength and agility, and at least equal in intelligence, to the genetic engineers who created them. <br/><br/>Replicants were used Off-World as slave labour, in the hazardous exploration and colonization of other planets. <br/><br/>After a bloody mutiny by a NEXUS 6 combat team in an Off-World colony, Replicants were declared illegal on earth - under penalty of death. <br/><br/>Special police squads - BLADE RUNNER UNITS - had orders to shoot to kill, upon detection, any trespassing Replicant. <br/><br/>This was not called execution. It was called retirement.""<br/><br/>Now you've read that I shall continue Four Replicants have jumped ship, killed the crew and the passengers and made it to Earth. They are; Roy Batty, Pris, Leon Kowalski and Zhora. A retired Blade Runner, Rick Deckard, is brought in to hunt down and 'retire' these Replicants. He is first sent to the Tyrell Corporation where he meets Rachael, a Nexus 6 Replicant. At the time she is unaware of the fact, but Dr. Eldon Tyrell assures Deckard that she's 'special'. Leon had murdered another Blade Runner, Holden, and Deckard goes to Leon's apartment where he finds a clue. Little does he know, the replicants are also trying to find someone Someone high up. I'll leave it there or the Spoiler Police will be calling me in for a Voight-Kampff test (again).<br/><br/>Visually stunning with a beautiful and atmospheric score by Vangelis, this film has a lot going for it (IMO). Great performances all round; Harrison Ford plays the world-weary Deckard to a tee, Rutger Hauer is excellent as the brutal but fragile Roy Batty and Sean Young plays Rachael with just the right amount of fear. Also worthy of note are; Edward James Olmos as Gaff, M. Emmet Walsh as Bryant, Daryl Hannah as Pris, William Sanderson as J.F. Sebastian, Brion James as Leon, Joe Turkel as Dr. Eldon Tyrell and Joanna Cassidy as Zhora.<br/><br/>I have seen this film many times before but this is the first time I realised just how introspective it is. All the action is focused on Deckard and the Replicants without the audience really seeing much outside this group. Yes there are hints; the advertising for the off-world colonies, but apart from that it's very insular. Moving on, I thought the effects were truly stunning, given that there was no CGI back then and the design, the look and the feel of the whole thing is superb. A world is created that the audience could easily imagine Los Angeles 2019 to be like OK, maybe not the flying cop cars, but you know what I mean. Yes, it does tend to drag on a bit towards the end, but I can forgive that for a truly excellent film that, for its day, has never been equalled VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>My Score: 9.5/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 8.3/10 (based on 223,454 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes Score: 92/100 (based on 101 reviews counted at the time of going to press)."

","This film is so deep, meaningful, touching and brilliant in every way.It may seem like a bad, but inevitable omen in the world we all share.There are no families, friends and collective spirit, but only individuals who dwell under the everlasting dark sky. It is raining all the time and humanity has somehow lost in the past. Androids are not some artificial beings, but strong metaphor of the last remains of humanity that left in the people.It is a story of dehumanization final step when all will be forgotten like ""tears in the rain"". The final scene with Ruther Hauer is one of the best i have ever seen on film and it is the very essence of this master-piece. It is the part when Deckard's struggle with himself culminates and when hope for the mankind is reborn. Breathtaking music of Morricone completes this film creating a true magic on the screen."

","I have no doubt in my mind that the decade in which movies look most dated is the 1980's. So how is it that Ridley Scott could make a film 30 years ago and made it look like it could have been made in 2011?<br/><br/>For some reason i have never managed to watch Blade Runner all the way through before. I'm sure i have seen some bits but the entire film seems new to me. I cant get over how stunning this movie looks. Granted , i watched this for the first time on Blue Ray but regardless of the quality of the picture , this film looks so modern. The story is nothing special , it doesn't have to be , but thanks to some amazing performances from Rutger Hauer and Daryl Hannah and some masterfulll direction i can totally see why this has become a cult classic. I don't think Harrison Ford is that that great in the film , he pulls silly faces sporadically and he tries hard but he never puts in a great display of acting.<br/><br/>I plan to see the directors cut at some stage to see how Ridely Scott intended this film to be. Perhaps the ending may have turn out to be a little darker?"

","Blade Runner is a masterpiece, both in terms of visual realization and screenplay. The direction is superb, the lighting atmospheric, many performances sublime. Rutger Hauer as lethal replicant Roy, and delicious Sean Young, as the vulnerable Rachael are particularly memorable. <br/><br/>Neither should we overlook a highly original score, delivered by musical genius Vangelis. His association with Jon Anderson, on the album ""Short Stories"", took synthesized orchestration in new directions during the 1980s. As for Bladerunner, we receive a unique soundtrack few other sci-fi films can equal. <br/><br/>For those with a taste for science fiction, Blade Runner is a nod to those richly drawn, intellectual films that audiences were lucky enough to experience in the late 60s and 70s. (I'm thinking of such incredible cinema as Silent Running, 2001 A Space Odyssey and Barbarella). Alas, Hollywood has opted for more predictable and violent fodder in recent years, leading me to suspect films of Blade Runner's quality will remain rare.<br/><br/>Blade Runner's beauty lies in a commitment to present the audience with a panoramic future, yet still rooted in a world dominated by the fragility of human experience. The characters that inhabit this world are flawed, tragic and meaningful. There's no two-dimensional superheroes here. We're presented with the realities of cruel commerce and technocratic supremacy. However, the technocrats receive their comeuppance. In this way, Blade Runner is also a moral parable, though never preaches.<br/><br/>The replicants seek ""more life"", although it's Rachael and Deckard that illicit our sympathy. Rachael is deceived by the Corporation, while Deckard is a reluctant ""fixer"", charged with ""retiring"" that same organization's mistakes. This is very clever writing. Hampton Fancher's screenplay interweaves plotting and sub-plot with ingenious skill. Such literary craftsmanship is rarely translated so successfully to film. <br/><br/>The script itself is one of the best I can remember in a sci-fi film, including wonderful quotes from such luminaries as William Blake. (I can't remember the last occasion an English Poet was quoted in a Hollywood Movie, though such references add unforgettable texture to an already deeply symbolic piece).<br/><br/>With this in mind, I'll leave you with Roy's moving epilogue: ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time... like tears in rain. Time to die."""

","What a timeless classic movie! I would consider this my number one personal choice of all time. I love everything about it. All of the elements of the movie work together wonderfully. This is a movie that I repeatedly watch and never ever get tired of. The setting, the beautiful music by Vangelis, the atmosphere, the action, and the actors all work together fantastically as far as I'm concerned. It would be interesting if they could make a prequel to this movie as well. I would love to see it. The version I prefer the best of all of them is the ""Final Cut"" version which is done the way Ridley Scott wanted it to be.

"Imdbidia","10","3","7","22 February 2011"," A masterpiece of the science fiction
","An outstanding Sci-fi philosophic and poetic movie embedded in a cop action story, loosely based in the novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" by Philip Dick.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is a film about the possibilities of our near future, about the meaning of being free and of being human, about the relation between natural world and created world, about the redeeming power of loving whomever you want, despite any social constriction, among others themes. These themes, and the depth in which they are presented, are the element that place this movie over most sci-fi movies. If you miss them, you are missing the whole point of the movie.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is also a visionary movie, as many of the gadgets and technical inventions shown there are a reality nowadays or are being developed (video-calls, Photoshop manipulation, biological production of organs, high developed robotics, etc.). The movie also envisions many traits of our 21st century world and society: fusion cuisine, increasing interracial mixing, a globalised technologically-dominated society, the pollution and unsustainability of our cities, among few others.<br/><br/>The acting is superb and believable by all actors, especially by Rutger Hauer (brilliant), Daryl Hannah (in her best role ever), Harrison Ford (ditto) and Sean Young (in one of her best roles).<br/><br/>It is one of those movies that everybody should see, as is one of the best sci-fi movies ever, one of the best movies ever, whose message and themes are still as fresh as they were in the 1980s."
"kay14081963","10","3","7","6 January 2011"," Dark movie with a wonderful message
","To me this is Ridley Scott's best movie and it contains also the best appearance of Harrison Ford in a movie. Ridley Scott has made a movie, that lives from several things. First there is Harrison Ford. Harrison Ford to me is one of the best actors of the last thirty years. Furthermore the story is great photographed by Joran Cronenweth. The other cast also plays at its best. I mean for instance Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Darryl Hannah, and Brion James.<br/><br/>Also the story is great. Six so-called Replicants are coming from the Mars to Earth to to get information how long they can live. I like the dark setup of the movie, that is given by the continuity of rain and so its dark sky, and which underlines the Sci-Fi/End-Time properties of the plot. Also what I like is the mixture of people from all parts in the world that are living in this future world."
"takseng","10","3","7","9 December 2010"," Blade Runner isn't Dick
","Having been recommended the (then) new film of Phillip K Dick's ""Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep,"" I saw and loved Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" when it was new. When I finally read ""Androids"" about two years ago and discovered that Blade Runner is obviously a jumping off point, but it's really a different story. Part ""1984"" and part ""Children of Men,"" ""Androids"" is about a seriously dysfunctional, probably dieing society dominated by a pervasive propaganda effort.<br/><br/>While it's not clear that the world of ""Blade Runner,"" is any less dysfunctional, the political elements seem very ordinary for a big city. Its focus is on the characters, which are very nearly human, as are we all. The focus is not on the times but on the experience of humanity that defines us and fails to draw a clear line between human and ""replicant."" Scott puts the question in the mouth of a replicant, to wonder whether our detective is himself human, at which point we may begin to remember what may be clues about this, but the question is never again raised. But they both seem to pass the tests we would make of their being human.<br/><br/>Where Dick is caught up in his own cynicism, Ridley Scott seems to have given us an anthem, especially with his dark and decadent future LA, but just magnificent, the last great non-CGI set, along with a dense and powerful Vangelis soundtrack."

It's a deeply personal film that touches depths of a human soul and represents true beauty in so many aspects: the everlasting and unbearable beauty of real love, the beauty of our dystopian humanity that never loses hope, the beauty of our creative minds and our capability to cherish our memories. Even the beauty of our selfdestructive nature that we cannot comprehand. When I watched Blade Runner for the first time it was in the early 80's theater and I was overwhelmed as some visitor of Louvre whose tears roll down his cheeks because he cannot handle too much beauty, too much truth about ourselves and our world. The ultimate work of art and labour of love. Thank you, Mr. Scott."

","The scenario for this story is a town, in the future, with more then one hundred million inhabitants, with an atmosphere so polluted that the sun barely shows up and it is taken by a constant acid rain; Los Angeles. At this time, for colonization and exploration of other planets were developed Replicants, genetically engineered humanoids, stronger and faster than a human being and with comparable intelligence. But they were emotionally unstable, had little empathy,aggressive behavior and their life was limited to four years. After a rebellion in a colony outside of earth they were outlawed on earth, under penalty of death. In spite of this a group of six rebel replicants came to earth in search of their creator, and with him try to increase their shelf-life and escape from death that was approaching. They were hunted by police known as ""Blade Runner"", with orders to kill, or rather ""remove"". The persecution of the replicants becomes a harrowing fight for life where no one knew who as hunting or who was hunted, especially after blade-runner meets the latest model of replicant, ""Rachel"", which received the complete memories of ""Tyrell""'s niece, the father of all androids. As they hunted and killed one by one, we perceive ourselves more human characteristics in replicants than in hunters. In the penultimate scene, the hunter's life is in the hands of the last replicant, that even knowing being in his final moments, saves the hunter using only one of his hands. It was raining at the moment when the last replicant looking the terrified hunter, says:<br/><br/>""-I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. -All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in the rain. -Time to die""<br/><br/>then he lowers his head and dies without any furthers movement, under the hunter's stunned gaze.<br/><br/>Our moments will be lost in time, like tears in the rain, it makes us think about the preservation of life and our eternal desire to live forever. It address us to some questions that humans have asked for centuries: What does it mean to be human? what is reality? How does our environment affect us? What are the moral issues we face in the creation of artificial people? <br/><br/>These and many more questions are there in this film for those who wish to examine them.

","Despite being one of the most highly problematic masterpieces of the American cinema, Blade Runner boasts an influence few films have exerted. It may be self-(over) indulgent – but who can blame you when you 're so damn gorgeous looking? – it may be so absorbed with its majestic outer environment that it sometimes forgets the inner substance of its people but, incredibly, it is precisely this artificiality of it that generates emotional responses you'd never expect. 28 years and no less than five editions later (!), Blade Runner is a cinematically stunning biblical narrative about Man's desire to confront his Maker – and, maybe, gouge his eyes out Paced like a 70's movie really, yet dressed up in its sci-fi nines (enter '80s), it demands your attention simply by addressing directly such trivialities as mortality, identity and, to this writer, a love story for the ages. Set decoration, detail and gusto is of orgasmic intensity and brilliance, Cronenweth's photography entails textbook perfection and Vangelis' score is of clear, undisputed divine origin."

","Where can I even start? Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" is as close to science fiction perfection as you can get. The cinematography is absolutely amazing even close to 30 years since it's been released. Rutger Hauer gives a performance for the ages. The movie has a futuristic setting that is grim and gritty, yet breathtaking to look at. It's message of life being so precious is sublime.<br/><br/>The film centers around Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), a Blade Runner, who is given the task of killing or ""retiring"" four android soldiers known as Replicants. Their crime, punishable by death? Wanting to be human. Rutger Hauer gives the performance of a life time as Roy Batty, the leader of the foursome of androids Deckard is assigned to retire. Cold, sinister, evil...and all that is good in the human spirit. Sounds crazy right? Well, you have to witness the performance yourself. Especially the ""tears in rain"" finale.<br/><br/>During the movie and especially at the end, you get the feeling that these androids are more human than the humans themselves. Which is the motto of the corporation that manufactures these synthetic humans, ""More human than human"".<br/><br/>The films settings and noir overtones combined with the constant rain fall set up a dread atmosphere. What's so amazing it that it's still marvelous to look at.<br/><br/>Long story short, ""Blade Runner"" is a sci-fi fans wet dream and just an incredible film in general. The acting is great, the plot is compelling, the cinematography and visuals are stellar and have stood the test of time, the script is marvelous, and it challenges you to think.<br/><br/>One of my all time favorites and easily deserves a 10/10."
"classicalsteve","10","3","7","1 June 2010"," The ""Casablanca"" of Science Fiction Films: Maybe the Deepest of SF Cinema that Birthed the Cyber SF Era
","When ""Blade Runner"" was released in the Summer of 1982, mainstream audiences were not quite ready for this very different vision of the future. And I will even admit, I was among them at the time. I didn't understand the depth of ""Blade Runner"" until I had had subsequent multiple experiences of it. I don't know if you really see Blade Runner as much as become absorbed into it. Although Blade Runner was a box office disappointment upon its release, it had stiff competition in 1982. Spielberg's ""ET"", the sentimental science fiction film, had broken all box office records; Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, was the favorite for pure good guy versus bad guy SF; and other films outside the genre were much more uplifting and linear, such as ""Tootsie"" and ""An Officer and a Gentleman"". (The other under-appreciated masterpiece of that year was ""Sophie's Choice"", although Meryl Streep did deservedly win for Best Actress.) <br/><br/>Despite its mixed critical reception, including a very ambivalent review by Roger Ebert who called it a ""failure as a story"", ""Blade Runner"" has emerged as one the three best films of 1982, the other two being ""Ghandhi"" and ""Sophie's Choice"". My revised list of Best Picture nominees in alphabetical order for 1982: ""Blade Runner"", ""E.T."" ""Ghandhi"", ""Missing"", ""Sophie's Choice"". I would still give top award nods to Ghandhi but only by the slimmest of margins. Blade Runner would be my very close second choice. (""The Verdict"" and ""Tootsie"" are good films but not exactly masterpieces.)<br/><br/>The story concerns relatively new technology: the producing of humanoid cyborgs which have become dangerously close to human life. They are called ""Replicants"". The latest models appear to have feelings and emotions like humans. Now, some renegade Replicants who feel they were treated as slaves on a labor planet have sprung from their ""slavery"" and returned to earth. They wish to confront their creators. Richard ""Rick"" Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a ""blade runner"", a kind of detective/police officer who finds and exterminates renegade Replicants. One of his tools is a series of questions offered a suspected Replicant designed to create responses which tip-off the questioner as to whether or not the participant is human. But then Decker falls for a female Replicant, Rachel (Sean Young) who seems all too human.<br/><br/>In the 1950's and 1960's, a very select group of eclectic readers absorbed and appreciated the work of a somewhat lesser-known science fiction writer, Philip K. Dick. Dick was a maverick of the SF genre, essentially immersing readers into a world much more reminiscent of the works of Raymond Chandler and Dashiel Hammett than Gene Roddenbery or George Lucas. Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade could navigate Blade Runner's darkened and misty streets much more effectively than either James T. Kirk or Luke Skywalker. While the most popular writers of the SF genre were still getting into rocket ships and flying to planets for high adventure, Dick was painting on an entirely new canvas, where urban noir meets future technology. Flying taxis and large plasma screens reside along with overpopulation and dirty streets. And he was writing in the 1950's and 1960's! However, even by 1982, audiences were still craving the likes of heroic science fiction such as Star Trek and Star Wars. Typical audience sensibility was still far behind ""Blade Runner"". <br/><br/>What made ""Blade Runner"" tough on audiences at the time of its release and so appreciated today is that it challenges viewers' perceptions of not only the future but the nature of modern reality itself. Unlike Star Wars and Star Trek, ""Blade Runner"" is a cautionary tale, an updated version of ""Frankenstein: The Modern Prometheus"" and therefore, everything presented in its world is at the very least disconcerting and at the worst quite horrifying. SF has been predominantly about Utopias. ""Blade Runner"" is a story set in a ""Dystopia"". SF most often distinguishes between right and wrong, good and bad. ""Blade Runner"" is about the blurry shades between ethics and justice, where the ones with which we most empathize are outlaws. SF endings are often neat and tidy. ""Blade Runner"" offers a very ambiguous and contemplative ending (and I am not referring to the final coda of the original theatrical release). ""Blade Runner"" deals with themes concerning the larger questions of life and meaning, very uncommon in SF cinema as a whole. And that's why ""Blade Runner"" has become not only an iconic classic of the SF genre, it is one of the reasons that cinema has continued to be a captivating medium. ""Blade Runner"" is in the same company as ""Ghandhi"", ""Citizen Kane"", and ""Casablanca"". Know that SF can sometimes transcend its own genre, and BR inspired a new wave of films, such as ""The Matrix"" and ""Dark City"". ""Blade Runner"" was and is one of the finest examples of watershed ground-breaking cinema."

","Blade Runner is recognized as a sci-fi classic. It addresses one of the great philosophic questions of our time: What does it mean to be human? Blade Runner has inspired numerous other films, some of them great in their own right. Among those are Terminator, AI (admittedly not everyone's cup of tea) and the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica which coincidently stars James Edward Olmos. It has contributed mightily to Phillip K Dick's status as author and cult hero. The film's impact is not diminished by the fact that the idea of machines turning on their makers has become a cliché. Blade Runner sets the standard for what a cinematic realization of the future as a dystopia should look like. This movie is a Ridley Scott masterpiece. If you like your sci fi to be thought provoking, you will love Blade Runner. If you haven't seen Blade Runner before, rent the director's cut version.

"wattcima","8","3","7","9 December 2008"," Never been there. Never done that.
","I don't know why I spent so many years really disliking BLADE RUNNER. <br/><br/>From the first time I saw it back in the summer of 1982 I disliked it. Maybe it was because I'd spent the previous year or so seeing trailers and ""making of"" segments that made it look so good that basically nothing could possibly live up to such expectations (and what could be better than ALIEN?)<br/><br/>Then there were Deckard's square glasses (you can't drink well out of a square glass), all that tedious smoky light drifting through blinds, and that dove being released in slow motion to make us feel just sowhatever.<br/><br/>I guess I do know why I spent so many years disliking it.<br/><br/>Yet, slow motion dove notwithstanding, I find this new cut tremendously entertaining. I never imagined that more explicitly making Deckard a replicant could make it so much more fun. (Okay, here it is for the sceptics: Gaff's origami unicorn tells us he knows Deckard dreams of unicorns. He could only know this if said dreams were implants) <br/><br/>Sure, it was always in the mix that Deckard was potentially a replicant. People suggested as much back in '82. The suspicion is alluded to in the movie – ""Have you ever tried taking that test yourself?""<br/><br/>Now we know for sure. He's a robot and his memory is false. This makes almost everything about the early part of the film wonderfully weird. It opens up the possibility that when Deckard is brought into the police station and speaks with Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh), that this is the first time these two men have ever spoken! <br/><br/>""I need the old magic,"" Bryant tells him. But there is no old magic. Deckard's complicated, perhaps tragic, in any case mysterious, personal history doesn't exist. Bryant has been told to speak to Deckard as if they'd known each other for years. By who? By higher ups. By people at the Tyrell Corp. maybe. In any case, it's made perfectly clear that replicants equipped with memory implants are a new model. Very new, like not even on the market yet. I know a lot of fans buy into the ""Deckard is a replicant"" reading, while at the same time wanting to imagine him as a grizzled old veteran cop, with years of experience under his belt. But I don't think you can have it both ways. If he is a replicant, he is necessarily new. Just off the assembly line, like Rachel must be.<br/><br/>Similarly, when we see Deckard going into his apartment, after his visit to the Tyrell Corporation, this is the first time he has ever entered this apartment. He only knows his way around it, and who the people in his photographs are, because of the memory implants.<br/><br/>Obviously, if you prefer, you can imagine Deckard as a week old replicant, or a month old replicant, but I don't know why you would. There'd be no point in having an expensive replicant drifting through the city reading the want ads for a few weeks, looking for a job his manufacturers know he'll never take. <br/><br/>No. It's much more fascinatingly twisted to watch this character do for the first time things he thinks he's been doing for years. He gives Rachel the VOIGHT-KAMPFF test. He's never given a Voight-Kampff test before. He makes a phone call. He has never made a phone call before. And, of course, he has never killed anyone.<br/><br/>This way of interpreting Deckard's actions is provocative not necessarily because it's so radically different a take on reality from what we're used to, but because it's a play on a dynamic that's so absolutely common. The main character's backstory is fictional in every movie. It's the stuff all screenplays are made of. The first time we catch sight of a character in a movie is, effectively, the first time he or she has ever really existed. Backstory is a thing we the audience believe in to create for ourselves that sense of reality or continuity which narrative so depends on.<br/><br/>For instance, when The Maltese Falcon opens Sam Spade and his partner Miles Archer are sitting around their office. They're partners. They've known and trusted each other for years. They're worked on numerous cases together. <br/><br/>But, of course, they haven't really. They only act like they have. It's just a movie. They don't exist prior to the first scene in it. The concept of Deckard's memory implants merely makes this idea much more literal.<br/><br/>And making abstract, theoretical ideas literal is something the best science fiction has always been good at. Serious SF has the ability to confront a concept that's fuzzy and hard to wrap your head around and recontextualize it, turning it into something immediate and tangible. <br/><br/>One of the proto- Sci-Fi masterpieces, Stephenson's Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde, does this as well as anything. After all, duality within the human soul had been dealt with and analyzed from any number of viewpoints. What Stephenson did was make the abstraction of moral duality more easily viewable by making it a much more real, immediate situation in which his main character experiences the extremes of this duality in clearly distinguishable personalities struggling for control within himself. <br/><br/>False personal backstory isn't the only abstraction BR makes literal.<br/><br/>There's no difference between what the replicants want and what anybody else wants. The conflicts that the replicants are struggling with are the same existential issues everyone confronts: I'm going to die. I don't know when. I don't want to. What's so unusual? But the fact that their problems are so essentially run-of-the-mill doesn't make the film less interesting. It makes it more interesting, as it bundles this familiar angst in a shiny new package and, successfully, freshens it up, letting us experience it as something novel and provocative."

","There is no disputing the fact that this film was visually stunning. The contrast between the rich and poor, the bright lights and the crumbling buildings, the constant rain and darkness; all made for a beautiful picture.<br/><br/>In addition, the music of Vangelis was more than appropriate for the film. It was a treat to the ear.<br/><br/>But, that said, the story itself was a disappointment. There really just didn't seem to be much there that would qualify this film to be considered a classic.<br/><br/>I watched as a tribute to Harrison Ford. He had that same edge that he had in Raiders of the Lost Ark, released the year before. He had a maturity that was missing in Star Wars. He was totally believable in this role.<br/><br/>But that was it. A minute or two of Joanna Cassidy to titillate, a clownish Darryl Hannah, and a conflicted Rutger Hauer did nothing to make this anything more than a showcase for Ford.<br/><br/>It was an enjoyable experience, but still a disappointment."
"MinorityReporter","10","3","7","23 October 2005"," To put it simply: Brilliant, absolutely brilliant!
","Blade Runner is without a doubt one of my favorite science fiction films. It is thematically deep and stunning to look at and the acting is overall very fine. My problem when writing this review is that I don't know where to begin because the film has so many elements which are all essential in understanding the film and the many symbols used in it. My review is mainly directed towards the director's cut version which in my opinion is the superior one.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford plays the main character or the protagonist and he does an excellent job. His character is darker than in both Star Wars and Indiana Jones and it works just as well. Ford delivers every line with confidence and sense of timing and basically produces a well rounded character. The acting isn't all there is to the character, however. If you look at the wardrobe of the character you will find that the long brown coat he wears resembles that of a detective from films in the 30s and 40s. A small thing but it helps define the character and brings some post modernism into the film. The same kind of characterization through wardrobe is used in many places in the film. Rachel (Sean Young) resembles a so-called 'femme fatale' from 30s detective/crime films with her neat hair and dark dresses. Sean Young's acting is impeccable and she delivers a stylized yet effective performance. Rutger Hauer has his (without a doubt) finest performance of his career as the antagonist. He steals every scene and even Harrison Ford has since admitted that he had trouble matching the intensity of Hauer. The supporting cast is good as well so acting wise the film is pretty flawless.<br/><br/>The film is visually stunning as well. Every scene is cramped with atmosphere and tension and even today more than 20 years later the film is still a visual feast. There are some who would say that Blade Runner is an example of style over substance and I am almost inclined to agree because the film really is stunning to look at. Ridley Scott's vision of the future is dystopian at best and as the camera pans over the futuristic landscape of Los Angeles you cannot help but feel a sense of dread at how depressing and ugly the world looks and strangely this is a good thing. The fact that the film makes you feel something is a clear cut sign of how brilliant it really is. Scott's ability to make people feel with nothing but images is quite simply awe inspiring. If the thematic enigmas do not spellbind you then at least marvel at the visual accomplishments. Along with the visual style the sound track of the film is also highly innovative and different. The sound definitely helps in creating the mood of the film.<br/><br/>As previously stated the film is highly philosophical but every person should watch the film and come to their own conclusion about the film. It would be wrong of me to impose my analysis and conclusions upon future viewers because you should definitely see this film with an open mind and you should definitely see it at least twice so as to get all the nuances of the film. Suffice to say there is enough thematic material (including quite a few bible references) to keep a philosophical conversation going for quite some time. If you don't believe me check the film out and find out for yourself.<br/><br/>Blade Runner stands for me as Ridley Scott's finest hour. The film has everything needed to become a classic and it delivers in both style and substance. A deep involving story, a great cast, fabulous visual elements and above all the film makes you think and it raises some interesting (and relevant) issues. Blade Runner is one my all time favorite films and I recommend it to all people with a philosophical vein, those who are not afraid to think and of course fans of science fiction movies. <br/><br/>10/10 - on my top 5 of best films."

","This is an interesting film. Dark- possibly. It's no ""Star Wars"" or ""Indiana Jones"", and I think that so many people were expecting just that in 1982 when released. I was in 5th grade, and it was the first R-rated flick that I saw in a theatre, and I was amazed at what I saw. First, I wasn't expecting the usual bulls***-summer movie, so what was shown was a precursor to what the not-so-distant future had in store. I don't think audiences from the Y generation will much like this with their limited attention-spans. But it's astonishing with how many of Scott's ""future"" premonitions have come true: corporations owning the world; the increase of the Asian population in Los Angeles; flying police cars-- oh, maybe not that one...<br/><br/>I just looked at this last night on DVD, and I miss the original cut. Ford's voice-over wasn't that bad. It was well-written. And I found myself reciting that missing voice-over when watching the scenes that the VO was once present. But without the voice-over, there is a surreal effect to it. It seems more eerie. And the original ending wasn't a ""pat-Hollywood ending""-- just gave it some resolution, that's all. The new ending looks like a foreign film's. Not bad, but not all that good either.<br/><br/>
I think that this movie's got such a tight following because it wasn't real popular and was in fact shunned ny the critics when released. The ingredients of a cult classic! But I do not think that this was a great film, either. For one thing, Scott focuses more on the visuals and the sets rather than character development & story (something that Lucas is obsessed with in the new 'Star Wars' films). But the acting isn't bad-- Rutger Hauer is one weird-ass guy! Brion James is a true stupid replicant thug, and Daryl Hannah is great as the ""little replicant lost"" role. Joanna Cassidy is as smart as Hauer (but not anywhere near as strange) & sexy. Harrison Ford is different in every movie he's in, although he tends to overact (but never over the top) at times. The opening shot even reminds me of the docks at Long Beach at night (what they may look like 20+ years from now).<br/><br/>A ubitiquous film that will always be remembered, and won't be lost like ""tears in rain""..."

","When I first saw this film in the Eighties I remember not liking it, even though everyone I knew thought it was great. Seeing the ""Final Cut"" again reminds me that I was right. Not that there aren't great things in it: The production design of course is justifiably famous, the acting is first-rate (actually any cast that includes M Emmet Walsh, Brion James, and James Hong is pretty impressive,) and the score is terrific. <br/><br/>A film is (or should be) more than a series of cool looking photos. It needs a compelling story. This story seems unfocused and unbalanced. For instance, early on there's a long sequence in which Deckard uses his detective skills to track down Zhora, but later, he is sent by his captain to the building where the remaining replicants are (conveniently) waiting. It seems like an entire reel is missing here. <br/><br/>Also the ending is just uninteresting. On the FAQ page you can read the endings the screenwriters imagined. They're logical and dramatic. It's like Ridley Scott spent all his money on that cool blimp and billboards--and they are pretty cool--and he didn't have enough left over to film a proper ending. To me the ending is the most important part of any work. It's like in gymnastics. You can do a great routine, but the landing is the last thing the judges see. You've got to stick it."
"sachsad","5","4","11","13 August 2003"," no justice whatsoever paid to Philip K. Dick's novel
","It's unfortunate I haven't seen the non-director's cut which didn't omit the voiceover narration.  Because the director's cut is pathetic in terms of the story. The book is a very good book, not one of the best I've read, but very good, and not a difficult book to translate into a film.  The makers of this film achieved the most difficult part about making the book into a movie-the special effects, cinematography/visuals, and recreation of the world from the book.  All that was left was the story, which at least with the director's cut, is completely ignored by Ridley Scott.  The only similarity between the book and movie is a few of the characters and the general premise.  Otherwise everything from the title to the question that lies at the heart of the novel--""What constitutes a human being?""--is neglected. Watching this movie after reading the book was like watching two hours of absolutely nothing happening.  I think it's okay for movies to take creative freedoms from novels, but to neglect as much as in this situation is a horrible idea, and since rather than taking creative freedoms, Ridley Scott just omitted so much action that was already plausible because it had been created in the novel.  But he wanted to make it more boring because he thought his audience needed simplicity, yet I don't know how I would've appreciated or understood completely what was going on in this movie had I not read the book."

","Boiled down to the very basics, Blade Runner is a detective story set in a dystopian alternate-future version of Los Angeles. However, the emphasis of the film is not placed on the setting, nor is it placed on the usual trappings of the sci-fi genre (think galactic dogfights or laser battles), instead the focus of the movie falls squarely on one central theme; the nature of humanity - our emotions, our mortality, and our purpose. These themes are elegantly told through the story of a policeman, Deckard, who is tasked with hunting down a group of Replicants (genetically-engineered humans) and it does so with great success.<br/><br/>The only shortcoming I can think of for this otherwise stellar movie is the comparatively thin plot, it is clear that it was merely a tool, subservient to the greater aims of the director's vision but this is just a nit-pick as the movie's purpose was to communicate deeper questions of humanity, which it did very effectively at the expense of its detective story.<br/><br/>In fact, the plot's subservience to the themes of the movie is what makes this movie stand out, it is well-constructed and inter-connected in almost every aspect. Each facet of the movie's design is in service to the key themes of the movie which keep you intellectually stimulated and emotionally invested throughout the entirety of the runtime, nothing feels superfluous or in need of trimming, the structure of the film was near flawless. The themes were clear, effectively communicated and excellently given voice to by the entire cast, with Rutger Hauer's stand-out performance being particularly haunting, intriguingly sad and profound.<br/><br/>As previously mentioned, this movie doesn't rely on the grandiose spectacle that many sci-fi films are wont to employ, but that isn't to say that the film is not visually stunning. Rather, the bombastic spectacle has been substituted for a far more subtle (and far more effective) approach. Visually, the movie strikes a very unique tone, the dirty, poorly-lit scenes result in a sense of unease and anxious turbulence that underscores the entire film, intensified by the uncanny but brilliant soundtrack by Vangelis which had an eerily spiritual ambiance to it. Blade Runner makes great use of its claustrophobic atmosphere, thriving both in moments of tension and contemplation all with a slow, deliberate pacing that gradually builds momentum until it finally delivers a powerful and chilling climax, leaving the audience to ponder the questions it has posed. The message delivered is not one spoon-fed, it is left to the viewer to piece together of their own accord to then discuss and debate. <br/><br/>Blade Runner is a probing examination of the very nature of humanity, it confidently delves into deep philosophical themes and encourages the audience to consider and debate them. It accomplishes what I believe to be the crowning achievement of any form of art, it pushes the viewer to look at himself and the universe around him, and think."

"andrewnmiller","10","2","4","10 October 2017"," A rare gem in the sci-fi movie genre.
","When I was growing up, Blade Runner was never a sci-fi movie that really interested me as it just bored me to tears but as I got older and watched it more, I began to see it for what it is and it's become one of my favorite movies ever. From it's themes and visuals to it's acting and stellar musical score, Blade Runner is a true gem of a sci-fi movie.<br/><br/>Set in the future of 2019 Los Angeles, the story follows a retried cop or ""blade runner"" named Rick Deckard who is apprehended by a fellow police officer and brought before his former supervisor and is briefed that four androids have appeared on Earth illegally in order to enhance their lives. Following this, Rick goes to the Tyrell Corporation and meets its founder, Eldon Tyrell and his associate Rachael and performs a test on her to see if she is a replicant or not. Events then continue to pan out as Deckard continues to pursue the replicants while the replicants continue to seek out Tyrell to get him to give them more life.<br/><br/>While many critics and film-goers have considered Blade Runner to be one of the best sci-fi films ever put to screen, the movie isn't your typical sci-fi romp and it does call for the viewer to pay close attention to what's going on and to use their brain and have appreciation for what is happening in order to understand what the film is conveying. As Blade Runner is a film that focuses on ideas rather than the familiar sci-fi spacecraft fights, high-tech devices, bizarre aliens or witty dialog, some people will have an issue with those not being in the movie, but it still certifies itself as a science fiction movie in its observation of technology's effects on our civilization, our journey as a species, and the very spirit of mankind itself. These subjects are arranged against an underlying investigation plot that advances nonchalantly but gently builds to a fitting conclusion as the observer is engrossed in the visuals and look of the movie. One complaint I've heard about the movie is that Deckard and the replicants are incredibly weak in terms of character evolution, but as this is a more confined and deep-thinking film, the main individuals are used as tools to reflect the motifs in the movie. Every main lead in the film mirrors a characteristic of humankind and yet they miss other characteristics for each one is shattered in ways that echo the fractured world in which they dwell in and were built. As for the movie's themes, they're some of the best in any sci-fi film like de-humanizing of the population though a culture fashioned by technology and capitalist overkill, the parts of the maker and his design, the shared slavery and character switching, emotion, thought, ambition, passion, malice, prowess over nature and the cosmos, death, demise, individuality, self-realization and the meaning of life itself.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott is a master filmmaker and Blade Runner is the film that shows his directing talents in the best way and like Stanley Kubrick before him, Scott understands just how to illuminate a scene and the usage of fog machines and fans along with anything that alters light is what gives Blade Runner it's noir look and feel while leaving hints throughout the film to the most important question concerning Deckard and wither or not he is a replicant. The visual effects are absolutely outstanding with the incredibly detailed miniatures and matte paintings along with the plumes of fire and the flying cars make the world of Los Angeles come to life and it's clear that the effects people put their time and money into making the visuals and effects look as top-notch as possible and it works a treat. Easily one of the most gorgeous sci-fi movies ever put to screen. Apart from the visual effects, the other outstanding element that makes Blade Runner stand on it's own is the fantastic musical score by Vangelis. The approach he uses when composing is incredibly distinctive and the music is moving is every scene that it's used in. The movie's soundtrack flawlessly adds to the futuristic setting ad even aids in building the vibe of it's world. Some films like Star Wars or Jaws owe some of their achievements to their composers, but with Blade Runner being such a unique movie in terms of visuals and story, it still would have still been an awesome movie even with a contrasting musical score, but all the same, it's certainly one of the finest movie soundtracks ever composed.<br/><br/>When it comes to the acting, it's absolutely flawless and some of the best of any sci-fi movie. Sean Young is wonderful as the experiment replicant Rachel, giving us a conventional yet compelling performance and it's a treat to watch. Daryl Hannah is great as Pris as is Joanna Cassidy as Zhora. Edward James Olmos is fantastic as Officer Gaff as is M. Emmett Walsh as Bryant, but it's Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer who are the stars of the film. Harrison is excellent in Blade Runner, playing a much more somber character than what he played in Star Wars or Indiana Jones, but it still makes for one hell of a performance. Ford speaks every word with a aura of coolness and effectiveness as well as maintaining a hard-edged yet sensitive appearance as Deckard. Rutger Hauer is on top form as the villainous Roy Batty and completely steals all the scenes he's in, especially with his speech at the end which is truly moving.<br/><br/>Now I do have an issue with the movie and it's the romance between Deckard and Rachel, it just comes across as tracked on and weak, but aside form that, Blade Runner is a true sci-fi classic that changed the way we saw sci-fi and what the future could be. Definitely a movie worth watching."

","Blade Runner is a slow-paced, methodical science-fiction mystery about a detective (Harrison Ford) forced out of retirement to hunt down dangerous humanoid ""replicants."" Based on the book by Philip K. Dick, entitled ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,"" ""Blade Runner"" focuses on creating a unique mood and atmosphere of a dirty and grimy future on Earth while exploring complex ideas about humanity.<br/><br/>Upon seeing ""Blade Runner"" for the first time, the story and style might not engage the viewer initially. It's a slow-paced, film-noir style sci-fi that is far from action and plot driven. Ridley Scott makes use of grand camera movement, incredible set pieces, and a beautiful score to paint a special picture of a future. What's presented here is a thorough and intriguing mystery which may confuse some viewers who might be expecting a more violent Star Wars. <br/><br/>Despite ""Blade Runner"" reaching a limited audience and developing a ""cult following,"" the film gets better and stronger with each viewing. Each time something new comes from the unseemingly layered narrative, motifs, and foreshadowing that makes it impossible to digest everything necessary upon the first viewing. <br/><br/>Perhaps the film's strongest aspect is its thought-provoking themes about what it means to be human. If the story's very human replicants can actually feel emotions like humans, who and what are they? Where does the soul come in to play? What does it mean to ""retire,"" meaning execute replicants and how ethical is it? ""Blade Runner"" has the boldness to challenge the viewer about their own existence while still managing to feel optimistic, despite the heavier subject matter. <br/><br/>Visually, ""Blade Runner"" looks incredible; especially the Final Cut version. Every frame of the piece is a work of art due to some wonderful cinematography by Jordan Cronenweth and meticulous production design by Lawrence G. Paul (""Back to the Future,"" Predator 2""). A large reason why ""Blade Runner"" is so well regarded could have something to do with their work in creating a genre of sci-fi that many films have been inspired from (Ghost in the Shell, Dark City, Soldier). <br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" is truly a work of art and should be seen by everyone at least once. It's a layered and satisfying story with excellent visuals and strong performances with memorable music. It's a unique experience and should definitely been seen.

A blend of the old and the new are fused in the gritty Sino-American culture that is ground-level LA, far below the forbidding, soaring towers that house the powerful.<br/><br/>The wonderful cast includes Sean Young, Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy, Edward James Olmos, M. Emmet Walsh and William Sanderson. Their quirks and passions add a vibrancy that is lacking in their environment, though it is rich in detail.<br/><br/>The pace of the film is leisurely, as if Scott wants the camera to linger over every facial expression, every moment, every ephemeral object. It takes us inside Deckard's vulnerabilities, down dark alleyways of decay, and even reveals the hidden reflections of a photograph.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Blade Runner"" is a contemplation of mortality. Adapted from a novel by Philip K. Dick--a model for many other sci-fi films to follow--it immerses the viewer in an alternate world that feels both real and unreal, and cleverly asks more questions than it answers."

","Blade Runner is a 1982 film directed by Ridley Scott and stars Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Rutger Hauer, and Brion James. It is based on the Philip K. Dick short story ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"". The film was distributed by Warner Brothers, being labeled as a Sci-Fi Crime Thriller. I have first seen the film over a year ago and will gladly document my opinions and observations for you.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is set two years from now when androids are being used in off world colonies as workers. Four of them escape to Los Angeles and band together as an effort to increase their 4-year lifespan. It is up to Deckard (Ford) to investigate their whereabouts and confront them and along the way meet Rachael (Young).<br/><br/>Every single character adds a lot to the coldness and darkness in the future world of Los Angeles. It is a serious film, but Roy Batty (Hauer) is both intimidating and charismatic as he always feels like a presence of death in every scene. Almost everyone else for the most part takes their part completely seriously. <br/><br/>I love Blade Runner, plain and simple. The original score by Greek composer Vangelis is marvelous and worth listening to on it's own. The Set Design is gorgeous and completely paved the way cyberpunk media should look. The cinematography is also amazing, miniatures look real, and it subtly captures symbolism of scenes along with great dialogue. <br/><br/>The themes of Blade Runner include Humanity, Philosophy, Genetics, and the Environment. One of the main forces of the film are testing people to see if they are human or replicant with the ""Voight-Kampff Test"". The effect of knowing is shown through Rachael who begins to cry that all her childhood memories are implants. Batty's speech about ""tears in rain"" really brings my emotional side out seeing as it is applicable to humans too and gives the character some redemption as well. <br/><br/>Blade Runner didn't find it's audience in it's infancy, but it became the cult classic it is today. A sequel set in 2049 is coming out in October and I can't wait to go see it. Kids should wait and get older to see it to fully appreciate the film. Teens into film and Sci-Fi should love this and so should adults. This film has stood the test of time extremely well. <br/><br/>Overall, I give Blade Runner a... 10/10"

","I was just watching the Final Cut version of this movie, and I can say, without a doubt, that this is one of the best science fiction movies ever made. It's up there with 2001 in my opinion. The production values, alone, is one of the best assets of the movie. It's one of those movies that, once its grabbed you, it will never leave you. I got to see this movie in the mid 90s when I was about ten. I didn't quite get what was going on, but it was enough that I knew I was watching something great. Looking back now, I'm proud to say that I was smart enough to realize the greatness despite a fundamental lack of knowledge and understanding. This movie, for me, was just like 2001. <br/><br/>When I watched that movie, I knew something important was going on, but I wasn't able to fully grasp just how good it really was. Woody Allen, god rest his perv soul, made a great comment about 2001 that I relate totally with that movie and Blade Runner: the more times you watch it, the more you like it. I could go on and on. I need not write a thesis. With that said and like 2001, this movie would be lost without its soundtrack. Vangelis delivered on this like no other--except, maybe, Stanley Kubrick. Many people don't know this, but Kubrick, at the last minute, pulled his original soundtrack to 2001, and he replaced the orchestrated parts with the Strauss' family work. Both movies would be remiss with the loss of their highly important music"

","Blade Runner revolutionises the dystopian plot-element and ties in brilliantly with its neo-noir influences that help provide the cinematography to a new level of sophistication and encapsulation.<br/><br/>Inspired by the novel, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" by Phillip K. Dick; and can be seen from the off-set of the opening scene. Philosophically a cinematic work of genius that ponders the true meaning of human life. Mise-en-scene is well established and fitting for the scenes that take place and overall character development is progressive and lacking for the characters it should fit that may hinder the audience's views on specific characters but also provides the question could we all not be Androids?"

","This film is about a man who hunts replicants. In the film, first, the man begins to investigate replicants which return to the earth. Second, he gets the information and hunts them one after another. Finally, he fights the boss of the replicants and knows why they return to the earth. I like the concept of this film because it makes us think about the relationship between humans and robots. Robots are often created to help humans, but they don't complaint because they don't have feelings. However, if they have feelings, what would they do? I feel the answer is in this film. I don't like a violent action scene, so I shut my eyes while such a scene is shown in this film. However, in order to show the concept of the film, such a scene is needed. This is because it shows robots' feelings for humans. Robots, which are created to help humans, would be angry for humans if they have feelings. This film makes me think about that deeply. I think this film is a good science fiction."

"bobshankjr-1","Null","2","4","10 December 2008"," 'Blade Runner': a brief study in American history, film noir...and music
","...<br/><br/>Considering the 800+ other comments on this 20th Century-made (and 21st Century 'still enjoyed') Ridley Scott-produced 'future history' story of Philip K. Dick's 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' vision of the future, I stand amazed this was the one chosen for a film adaptation. Asimov, Clarke, Heinlein, Gifford, Patterson...others, have written reams of sci-fi(?) future history stories, any number of which would produce an enjoyable and intellectually-stimulating celluloid. In defense, however, Dick's tight, concise and mentally-graphic storytelling are the product of specific genius. The fact that director Scott and his 3-D, art-directed team 'got' Dick's vision is testament to adaptability from a great story line for film. In truth, a movie version of any of the aforementioned treatises would have forced a monstrous series of film productions instead of a regular, two-hour viewing conducive to a regular movie-going event (with few exceptions, 'series' often fail to produce box-office monies from the original construct).<br/><br/>Having said that, Dick's tough storyline, the resultant and beautiful screen-play, art direction, studio and on-location construction, and Scott's direction, have made 'Blade Runner' a euphoric and time-honored cult classic. The fact that this was Hollywood's last, great effort on an analogue film (no special effects were produced by computer generation - unknown then) bears witness to true 'on-film' making graphical expertise. Cutting-edge, then, and still stands triumphant in spite of its age.<br/><br/>In addition - and strongly in merit - the concept of hearkening a film-noir essence from the 30's to exact the nuances of a distopian future history, tied directly to an American republic past, is pure genius. All the un-loosed ends of our civil problems: overpopulation, corporeal greed, castration of civil rights, global pollution...illegal governmental intravention...illegal aliens...are addressed one way or another in this dark, emotionally-charged but lens-clear vision of the multi-cultered American vision of our global future. It's as if the roots of our fatherhood slowly stood within the movie theatre and silently applauded, reckoning a civil duty. A film, and vision, vastly ahead of its time...<br/><br/>In any movie, the music 'sets the tone' for its ambiance. Audiences as a whole - and individually - identify the theme of a film from its music. Scott was adroit in his choice of 'Vengelis' (Evangelos Odysseas Papathanassiouas) as the film's music author. A Greek music composer and self-taught musician (he has sold over 20 million albums), Vangelis is 65 years old now, and has understood - inimitably - the essence of film thematic music (he is an absolute 'film buff'). When you listen to his efforts to construct the theme music for this film (see, 2nd disc 'Blade Runner - The Final Cut'), you'll understand his pathos for this movie. One of the ultimate decisions to include this film within my 'All Time' favorites is Evangelos' empathetic and counter-point music, deftly underscoring the harsh realities of the film. It helps soften my stern nightmares of our future...<br/><br/>Bob Shank Jr Tucson"

","I find it quite astonishing that some people view this film as dull. All the way through the film Ridley Scott keeps an atmosphere going which both enchants and excites the viewer. Not to mention the rarity of a film having a moral to the story, so to speak. Visually, this movie is as good as they get and at times the film can seem poetic. The soundtrack to this film is brilliant and adds a very ambient tone to the film, as provided by Vangelis. I think those who find it dull need to watch this film again to understand the true brilliance of the films content. Many people say that 2001:a space odyssey is a dull film, but who can disagree that it was a major turning point in film history. The same is true, i think of Blade Runner. In my opinion it is one of the few films that can be considered a masterpiece of film making."

","In 2019, androids are dangerous, incredibly life-like, and banned on Earth. Deckard is a bounty-hunter who specialises in ""retiring"" rogue androids. He is charged with finding four such fugitives, who seem intent on contacting Dr Eldon Tyrell, their designer <br/><br/>There are a handful of movies where I think the filmmaker should be entitled to receive royalties on the style of their film; Blade Runner is one of these select few. You could literally pick almost any TV show or commercial from the last twenty years and they all steal something from Blade Runner; looks, clothes, sets, lighting, makeup. It's an absolute triumph of artistic design - the most interesting-looking science-fiction film ever made - but it's also so much more than that. Its critics accuse it of being all looks and no drama but they've really missed the point; it's also a fantastic story with endlessly fascinating characters and unusual situations. I mean, what other movie ends with the villain saving the hero ? Hampton Fancher and David Peoples' script is a loose but clever adaptation of Philip K. Dick's classic 1968 novel Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep ?, although they stole the title from a more obscure book, The Bladerunner, by Alan E. Nourse. At its core is the concept of the androids' humanity. Deckard tries to rationalise his occupation by referring to them with third person pronouns and cynicism but essentially he's just a killer, and all of the android death scenes are bloody and disturbing. They might not be people, but they live life much more than the rest of the population seem to. Scenes like the one where Deckard teases Rachael with her false memories and she quietly cries at the awfulness of what's been done to her are charged with emotion and tenderness. All of the performances are absolutely first rate in extremely demanding roles; Ford is terrific, Young, Hannah and Olmos are iconic, Turkel hypnotically enigmatic, Sanderson and Cassidy both beautifully tragic, Walsh and Hong are hilariously seedy, and best of all is an unforgettable Hauer as the truly one-of-a-kind Roy Batty. Hauer is Frankenstein's Monster for the modern age, striding through the movie, alternately terrifying, humorous and tragic. His final scene in the rooftop rain is one of the most powerful endings in all cinema, majestically stylised and beautifully acted. Scott is often accused by half-witted detractors of being too focused on the imagery in his films - heaven help us, isn't that what a movie director is supposed to do - tell a story in pictures ? Scott is a genuine, no-apologies, barking-mad genius and this movie is just crammed full of amazing shots - the opening cityscape, the golden Tyrell Building, Deckard's future-noir apartment (which is just about the coolest in any movie), Pris' punk-doll look, the Esper/photo sequence, Roy in the elevator, Roy with the dove, way too many to mention. Movies can be so much more than just talking heads, and when you see one as good as this, I'll be goddamned if it doesn't convince me that Cinema is an Art after all. Add to this an incredibly stylish electronic score by Vangelis which complements the dark, industrial visuals perfectly and you have one of the most imaginative, entertaining and memorable science-fiction films ever made. I'm not going to get into that whole Unicorn dream / replicant Deckard thing because I believe we're free to interpret any movie anyway we want. I do have to say though that I liked the original version with the gumshoe-style narration - I sometimes wish filmmakers wouldn't keep dickering with their work; once it's released, that should be it. Featuring superb photography by Jordan Cronenweth, astounding production design by Lawrence G. Paull (Harlem Nights, Escape From L.A.) and terrific visual effects by Douglas Trumbull, Richard Yuricich and David Dryer, don't miss this fabulous futuristic classic, made with incredible skill and intensity by a truly great filmmaker."
"Islandeye","8","2","4","6 July 2008"," Surprising, exciting, inconsistent: Blade Runner.
","Upon my second viewing of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, I enjoyed and appreciated the film a lot more. The film is successful in its handling of the loaded subject of artificial life, introducing new ideas of false memories and a unique vision of a dystopian future. The core build up is well crafted, performed and shot, however it loses momentum towards the end, causing me to question the films central achievements and consistency.<br/><br/>Blade Runner follows Rick Deckard, an archetypal retired cop coerced into one final job to catch and kill 4 rogue Replicants (Robots forced to do slave labour for humans). The film plays with crime, sci-fi and noir themes, distorting our expectations and forming a unique twist on the conventions found in each genre.<br/><br/>Running through the film are motifs of eyes and Christian symbolism, the former including the intense Voight-Kampff test scene and the above eye shot with the industrialised, dystopian L.A sprawling ahead. The Christian symbolism is a questionable inclusion in a film with no major connection with religion, one flawed example being Roy Batty's hand pierced by a nail during his pursuit of Deckard. Likening Batty to Jesus doesn't fit with his violent, calculating personality shown through the film. The subtext here seems to have been added as an afterthought, it's too sloppy to relate to any ideas the film has already established, and too major a comparison to introduce at such a late stage.<br/><br/>The film is infamous for its long-running debate about whether or not Deckard is a replicant. Both sides have their merits, Deckard being a replicant would lend to the ideas concerning artificial life and the existence of an objective reality, however it would detract from the complex history and social conditions surrounding replicants the film presents - it would be very unlikely that a replicant would be put in a position of power such as a blade runner, even for experimental purposes. This final mystery disregards the emotional crux of the film, both humans and replicants are shown to be emotionally equal, showing balanced levels of thought and feeling. Deckard potentially being one is almost irrelevant to his character, disregarding the obvious irony of him hunting his own kind and not knowing it. The ambiguity revealed in the final moments distracts from the poetic image of a man and replicant in love, fleeing society and breaking all the rules as they go.<br/><br/>Roy Batty's death speech is the highpoint of the film script-wise; his sudden jolt of heroics is shocking and performed well by Rutger Hauer, who makes the insane robot's bout of divine understanding believable and compelling. However when considering the relationship between Batty and Deckard, Deckard having killed Batty's replicant girlfriend Pris, Batty minutes before breaking Deckard's fingers, and the blade runner's numerous attempts to kill him, his final act of kindness seems like a well concealed deus-ex-machina. One argument could be Batty accepts his fate in his dying moments, no longer having a reason to kill Deckard. But earlier Batty finds out he has no chance of life, yet still mercilessly kills J.F Sebastian - despite well deserving of its iconic status, the rooftop sequence doesn't hold up to scrutiny.<br/><br/>The set design and lighting (or lack of) compliments the narratives stylistic twists, the people in their flying cars don't enjoy a luxurious future of economic stability and urban technological perfection, instead spluttering through darkness, drowning in noirish smoke and patronising talking advertisements. J.F Sebastian's decrepit, rainwater filled home is an excellent manifestation of the state of Earth in the future. Abandoned, half-destroyed, and gradually dissolving away as the opportunity of the future slips by, the rain forever dripping into nothingness."

","Blade Runner is one of those films which most people are willing to call a classic. Blade Runner is a great example of how a sci-fi film and despotic vision of the future should be made. It also shows how good a director Ridley Scott is and is Harrison Ford's best performance as an actor (but I do like him in Indiana Jones and Star Wars).<br/><br/>The film is set in Los Andreas in 2019, 37 years into the future when the film was made. Humans had started to colonise space and use clones (called replicants) as slave labour. After a revolution replicants are banned on Earth and are hunted down by Blade Runners if any make to the planet. Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, a top blade runner who had gone into retirement. Five special replicants make it to Los Andreas, all breed to be super strong and able to fight. Deckard is asked by the company who made them to hunt them down. This is a tough task for the blade runner which rises questions within him about whether he is doing the right thing and asks ideas about humanity.<br/><br/>What Blade Runner does is asked a lot of questions to the audience and makes them thing. It is a complex film in that way. It varies from issues of cloning and slavery to issues of environmentalism and over-population. It also shows ideas like two different classes being formed, an rich-upper class and a poor-lower class, possibly influenced by Marxist ideology and other sci-fi and despotic cultural items like 1984, A Clockwork Orange and Metropolis. The film also looks at the character of Deckard as he starts to doubt the task he is doing. A big debate within the fans of Blade Runner is where Deckard is a human or a replicant. I personally favour he is a human, but that is just my interpretation of it. The film is also influenced by film noir and has been called future-noir. It does have that feel to it and is a little like a detective story, showing Deckard's investigation. The music is also fitting for the film, similar to the music to film noir films. The music also reminds me of the first Championship Manager game, which is downloadable from the SI games website (the makes of the Championship Manager and later Football Manager games).<br/><br/>Blade Runner was based on a Philip K. Dick novel, 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'. Philip K. Dick is considered to be a brilliant sci-fi writer, I have only read one of his books, the Man in the High Castle, which was pretty good. His ideas have been converted to films. Some have been very good like Total Recall and Minority Report, but also some bad ones like Next and Paycheck. Blade Runner is easily the best film based on a Philip K. Dick idea. This is because as well as a good story Ridley Scott shows both a very grim version of the future, but at the same time a grand awe-powering version (Speilberg and Verhoeven, took a similar approach).<br/><br/>Blade Runner is a must see film, especially for sci-fi fans."

","There are no words to describe what i feel about this film, so i will describe in sentences.<br/><br/>When i first watched this movie i didn't even finish, this i don't blame on myself, i blame this on the *beep* PREVIEWS!!! The previews of this film make it seem that it is some hardcore, super-action, out-of-this-world, sci-fi adventure. No. Every theory, every scene, every action, every affect is completely plausible. This film is pure Triple Gold, Double Hit, Multi-Platinum...everything. The special effects were unbelievable, in the sense that they were unbelievably believable to what it would really be like in the future.<br/><br/>This story also includes many warnings, such as ""stop smoking"", ""stop littering"" and ""stop polluting"". It sends a warning and shows an example of what we could look forward to if we do keep doing these things.<br/><br/>This movie hides many different messages, stories and moral teachings on many different levels. It contains a love story and a story of trying to answer those unanswered questions -- why am i here? how long have i got? What Philip K. Dick has created, and what Ridley Scott has recreated, is absolutely beautiful. I am glad Ridley Scott went ahead to make a Final Cut of the film. We needed re-mastered visual footage to go along with the strength of the story, we also needed to never hear that annoying Harrison Ford voice-over ever again! For me, personally, it ruined the entire film for me. Wherever there was a scene containing the film's signature dramatic tension, supported by Vangelis, there popped in the crappy macho-voiced voice-over. Note: I watched the theatrical (voice-over version) after watching the final cut for the second time, which i though was the greatest film of all time. I turned off the movie and had to watch the final cut again to redeem myself of the voice-over garbage at the end of the film when Roy Batty's life-span is up and he lets go of the dove in rain which flew over in clear weather (which i actually thought was a beautiful feature) after his famous quote: ""All Those Moments Will Be Lost In Time...Like Tears In Rain"", and then dies. This was ruined by the macho voice-over crap that popped in from Harrison Ford to tell us the obvious of how come Batty let him live.<br/><br/>Anyway, please, if you have watched in once and didn't care for it, watch it again (Final Cut version) and even more times if you have to. And once you have absorbed as much as you can from WATCHING it, then play the movie again and observe its methods and small elements of complex information. Do it, i guarantee you will enjoy this piece of film-making."

","I first saw this film a few years ago and really liked it. I saw it again in the cinema a few weeks ago and was really blown away this time. I have certainly matured and so have a new outlook on the film. Perhaps the remastering of the film adds also to the experience. I went out and bought the DVD which also contains the Dangerous Days documentary.<br/><br/>This is a true cinematic experience - sound, visual, story. Rarely has a world been so vivedly portrayed. The detail and visual beauty is simply astounding. Dangerous Days tells of the work that went into it and I appreciate the film even more as a result. The era before special effects - the ""magic lantern"" (David Lynch) quality that comes from non-computerised effects.<br/><br/>Fascinating story - one of the critics on the Dangeous Days documentary speaks of the message - don't be a slave/replicant who simply follows orders. I get a very different message from the film - wherever there is life (any sort of life) there are feelings. We cannot create something in order to use and manipulate it - everything has feelings and must be respected. Roy Batty has been created to be used selfishly by humans - a fighting machine. at the end we see that everything living has feelings. He feels and clings on to life like we all do! Human selfishness is the theme I get from the film. Humans abusing life! The love scene between Deckard and Rachael seems very contrived to me. His aggressiveness is unappealing and makes no sense to me in the story. The documentary sheds some light on this.<br/><br/>Dangerous Days is very interesting An extraordinary film and achievement. Some of the emotion could be a bit deeper but instead of looking at what the film has not let me remember the outstanding achievement that the film is."

","This is my favorite movie. It's rare that a sci-fi movie ages well, but this one still has the power to awe.<br/><br/>*Possible spoilers* <br/><br/>Like most great movies, this is a film about redemption. Deckard, the ""Bladerunner"" is washed up, compromised, so disgusted with his job (a cop who kills rogue androids) that he has turned his back on it. Under pressure from his old boss, he comes out of retirement for a special assignment: to find and terminate several androids of a new and special type, who have landed illegally on Earth and so far eluded capture.<br/><br/>What happens to him, this time, is that as he finds and kills them, one by one, he is more shocked than ever by how human-like they have become. Introduced to Rachel, one of the new type of androids, by the android-maker, he finds himself struggling not to fall in love with her.<br/><br/>*Definite spoilers* <br/><br/>The movie, soaked in religious references, reaches its climax in Deckard's confrontation with Roy Batty, who except for Rachel (whom Deckard is hiding), is the last surviving android. He is also the most powerful and most deadly of them all. Roy's death, which shows him to have leaped beyond humanity to something above, is portrayed as a redeeming sacrifice, which liberates Deckard. Roy pours out the last remaining seconds of the life he loves so much in an act of pure forgiveness, going so far as to save his persecutor from certain death. <br/><br/>Deckard can no longer do his job; more importantly, he no longer needs to fear or doubt his feelings for the android Rachel, or worry that she isn't really human: in the ways that really matter, in compassion and self-giving, Roy has shown him that the androids have surpassed their makers.<br/><br/>A very powerful and moving film."

It had solid performances from the cast, starting with Harrison Ford as the nonchalant bladerunner who develops some emotions as the movie progresses, and Rutget Hauer with a brilliant villain performance.

The thing about the movie that was very was that there was some romance in this movie that really didn't fit that much and kinda got me out of the mood I was in for the entire movie. All and all this is a classic no doubt and should see this movie at any time you get the chance."

","This contains some plot info that may or may not spoil the movie for you, but learning the plot has never spoiled a movie for me and I hope you get a good feel for this movie by reading this if you've never seen Blade Runner before.<br/><br/>I saw this movie when I was only 12 years old. At the time the action and beautiful post-apocalyptic imagery is what drew my attention. The characters seemed very real to me, having odd ""ticks"" and very real reactions to the situations into which they are locked. Since that time, I joined the military and experienced life and my taste in movies changed.<br/><br/>I came across Blade Runner in a store and bought it up to watch this childhood favorite of mine in a new light. As I expected, the storyline became the focal point for me. Deckard (Harrison Ford) became the battle-weary, hardened veteran faced with difficult choices that I have seen first hand in military service. I could completely relate. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) wasn't the stereotypical replicant (cloned humans used for war) bad guy anymore, either. Now, to me, has become the victim of his own creation fighting against the system to live a life that he deems normal. The problem is that the system won't allow that since, being bred for war, replicants live to fight and kill. Being bred for the sole purpose of fighting wars, the replicants were given short lifespans of about 5 years, which Roy and his replicant gang are trying to overcome through unscrupulous means. Mainly through violence and murder.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Deckard is trying to track Roy down. You get to see clips of replicants receiving psychological evaluations. The purpose for those scenes, I assume, is to see how replicants are fundamentally different than a human being.<br/><br/>The movie has a few surprises and Rutger Hauer's character, Roy, has a great feel and some very quotable lines. I felt tears welt up in my eyes when he gave his parting speech.<br/><br/>One of the most excellent film noir/sci-fi movies ever made and a cast worthy of any great movie. Blade Runner is character depth, story, action and imagery in ample quantities - a grand slam."
"blanbrn","8","2","4","15 July 2007"," Underrated sci-fi classic. Cool and flashy and memorable photography and scenes.
","In 1982 Ridley Scott sure was on fire with this directing and take on showing a future look of Los Angeles. The cinematography and background scenes of this film are flashy, neat, and well done they make the film memorable. Especially when the viewer first glances and sees the streets and skyscrapers of L.A. and the screen of images on the sides of the big buildings. Set in 2019 in Los Angeles you have Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard a blade runner who's assigned to protect the city and future from criminals. This film is more than sci-fi you get to see a romance develop with Ford's character with a female named Rachel(Sean Young in an early role). Also performances from such names as Daryl Hannah, Edward James Olmos, and M. Emmet Walsh are worth a watch. Overall an underrated sci-fi classic good work from Ridley especially in 1982 for trying to show a future L.A. most memorable is the cinematography and flashy images of the background make this film such a classic."

","OMG This is one of the best 10 movies ever made. I don't care who says it, what genre you're into, or what, this movie will make your list, one caveat, not the Director's cut. Mr Scott was a genius and I love him but what he took out of this movie desecrates it. The movie with the narrative and extra scenes adds content and complexity from the book from the incredible mind of Philip Dick. Without the narrative and the bizarre scenes added by Mr. Scott adds confusion and really makes the film more of a ""Disney"" type, entertaining, production rather than a medium to provoke thought and enlightenment as the Non Director's cut. I hope those of you fortunate enough to see both agree, and if you have not seen both Please seek out the other. This is a pivotal movie in our society and the subtleties do carry a lot. Please Please Please, Seek out the original and read the book! But either way the director cut is still a good movie but the non-director's cut is a landmark!"

"pootc","10","2","4","26 December 2005"," A Masterpiece
","Ridley Scott's signature film Blade Runner is a film so profound in its mythology and history it strikes an indelible chord with those who see through its relatively straight-forward narrative. It's a mature film with unique undertones designed to evoke emotion and thought and for some it's a daunting and depressive ride while for others it's a revelation both intellectually and emotionally.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is film that needs to be watched more than once. It's an atmospheric film, both science-fiction and art - a study of dehumanization and environment which reaches a higher plain than most, asking the question what it is to be human and where are we going. The film is striking on so many different levels from its heartfelt performances and characters - and their desperate plight for life. It's ambient and evocative score by Italian composer Vangelis, its amazing set design and nostalgia inducing atmosphere.<br/><br/>Plagued by production troubles since its inception, and a box office failure Blade Runner would be rediscovered on the video market over the years after a chance screening of a work-print cut in Colorado and evolve into a cult hit, and one of the most influential science-fiction film of all-time. The resurrection as also sparked with the release of the 1992 ""Director's Cut"" which was by all accounts a ""rush job"". The version omitted the drowsy voice-over narration by Harrison Ford and the out-of-place, and studio enforced happy ending.<br/><br/>In 2007, The Final Cut arrived and with it closure to the classic film's troubled history as Director, Ridley Scott's vision has finally been realized twenty-five years after the film's initial theatrical release. Whichever version you choose whether it be the Theatrical, Directors Cut, Work-print, European, or the Final Cut Blade Runner is a science fiction masterpiece.<br/><br/>On a personal level it makes me feel lost and long for something more, it makes me long for ""time and place that never really was"" and no other film has stayed with me quite like Blade Runner."
"brsa","10","2","4","16 July 2005"," Many qualities - above all it makes you think
","English is not my first language, so bear with me.<br/><br/>I guess the overall quality of ""Blade Runner"" is intelligence. It is a movie that makes you think and it is made by thinking individuals. It tells you not to trust the surface, and this is always a bold thing to do for a movie - given that it is, by definition, composed of surface only.<br/><br/>The cast is perfect, Rudger Hauer as the leader of a group of ""replicants"" (androids) and Harrison Ford as ""blade runner"" Rick Deckard, charged to hunt them down, above all others.<br/><br/>Daryl Hannah really is her part - a desperate replicant, while Sean Young as Rachael, the female attraction for Harrison Ford played her extremely interesting role well enough, but is still the weakest link in the chain in my opinion. Ford has subsequently played many inferior roles in movies. In this one he is the right character and he's - ever trying to be sure of himself, while being corroded by doubts - brilliant.<br/><br/>What's also special about the movie is the atmosphere. Ridley Scott didn't get to use computer generated special effects back in 1982. Flying cars were not easily put on celluloid. Don't expect an orgy of special effects, that's not the focus of this movie. There is a lot of action going on but it focuses on people, not explosions. In spite of some minor logical glitches Scott manages to compose a credible scenario, a sinister vision of a might-be-future with a few subtle flashes of dark humor. On a side note: you might want to stock up on umbrellas before 2019, according to Ridley Scott we are in for rain.<br/><br/>Of course the movie would not rank among the best movies without the soundtrack by Vangelis, which is a masterpiece by itself. Together photography and music form something exceptional.<br/><br/>Unlike with many inferior sci-fi movies, there is more to ""Blade Runner"" than just atmosphere, special effects and a great sound track. The movie makes you think about some of the big philosophical questions concerning the individual as well as society. What is life? What's special about humans? Why is one life worth more than another? How shall we deal with death? And what's the role of society in all of this?<br/><br/>The movie - especially the director's cut - does not try to answer or appease in the end. All it tells us is that we can't get away from these questions, no matter where we go, be it to an ""off-world colony"" or just ""north"".<br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" is the best film of its kind and one of the best I know overall. This one should not be ""lost in time like tears in the rain"" so quickly."
"jrfranklin01","7","2","4","5 August 2004"," A Manufactured Humanity
","For Deckard (Harrison Ford), going after rogue robots is just part of an ordinary day. Robots have been created that simulate humans (replicants) and are used as slave labor. A new class of replicants, the Omega 6, has been created and replicate humans more than anyone can every imagine. When four of them hijack a ship and head for earth to try and extend their ephemeral lives, Deckard is commissioned to ""retire"" the rogues.<br/><br/>The last time I saw this film was probably twelve years ago or better, so it was pretty hazy. Having watched it just now, it was totally different from what I expected. Ridley Scott (director), rather than create the action flick I expected this to be, instead favored lengthy character development. He did this to show the similarities and marriage between man and the product of his godly labors, the robot. At times this makes the movie seem long and drawn out, but is otherwise necessary to the plot and point of the film. The evolution of the robot mentally to the state of man is excellently depicted in Rutger Hauer's character, Roy, and in Sean Young's character Rachael. They express sadness, anger, love, insanity, kindness, and the innate human quality of self-preservation.<br/><br/>I was confused however in the odd relationship between Deckard and Rachael. It was almost as if he were dictating or instructing, like that of a programmer, a piece of equipment to respond to his amorous advances. This didn't feel quite right in the film even though I am aware Rachael's conscious mind was new to feelings of love or affection.<br/><br/>Also Rutger Hauer's Roy was just a little too outlandish despite being motivated by his desperate attempts at survival. (SPOILER)He is brutally violent and repulsive in killing two humans and then ironically shows Deckard mercy and kindness. I guess this just epitomizes being irrational with no logical thought progression.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a good sci-fi movie from another one of Philip K. Dick's novels. If you want to see a ""today's version"" of this film you should watch ""Screamers"", also written by Philip K. Dick. It details the evolution of the battle of man versus machine, but like this movie, has a surprising twist at the end. 7/10"
"didi-5","7","2","4","15 March 2004"," all hail the director's cut
","Intelligent sci-fi.  Harrison Ford plays Deckard, a replicant exterminator (or is he?); the replicants are Daryl Hannah, Sean Young, Brion James, and best of all, Rutger Hauer - who gets the best closing speech, all that guff about lights and stars.  The other replicants are ok, particularly Hannah with her wild hair and her acrobatic attacks.<br/><br/>Blade Runner looks great in its futuristic, claustrophobic bubble, and even Ford's cardboard acting can't spoil the mix.  The director's cut removes his dull narration and is the better for it.  This movie is reasonably intelligent science fiction, involving and interesting.  It has images which linger long in the memory years after seeing it."
"supertom-3","10","2","4","9 May 2002"," One of the greatest movies ever!!
","The ultimate sci-fi film and pretty much one of the greatest, most visually arresting movies ever made. Blade Runner is a true cinema classic, not a box office success and not taken too well on its original release but it has since become a cult classic, critically acclaimed and in 90 percent of movies buffs top five movies. The film has spawned countless imitations of its dank futuristic world but the imagary has never been bettered, it has also created a debate that has run since it first hit the screens in 82, that debate being `is Deckard a replicant?', this has never been answered and I doubt ever will, Harrison Ford says one thing and Ridley says another. The film itself is pure brilliance, the visuals are striking, this film is certainly before its time and the special effects even now look top draw. The imagery created is exceptional with the futuristic world leaving you tongue protrudingly engrossed. As well as the visuals the plot is quite good too. Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, is a Blade Runner, a sort of cop/bounty hunter who hunts down beings known as replicants and kills them. The replicants were created to serve us but a small group in an outworld colony go bezerk and start killing humans, this means that all Replicants must be destroyed. The story has elements that obviously inspired the Terminator films and while some people call Arnie the ultimate cyborg I have to say for me Rutger Hauer is the ultimate bad guy in the artificial human category. This film launched him to cult status, he steals the show here as he has in other stand out bad guy performances in Nighthawks and the Hitcher. Hauer exudes an evil charisma in this film as the leader of a small group of murderous replicants, Roy Batty. Hauer really is chilling at times and he has an intimidating presence on screen, his lines are classic including the legendary tears in the rain speech at the end, which Hauer himself wrote. The other actors are very good, Harrison Ford is at the top of his form as Deckard and the two gorgeous ladies Daryll Hannah and Sean Young are also good. This is a must see movie, I eagerly await the re-release on DVD as my current copy is dissapointingly bereft of features. Overall I must give this 10/10"

Who are these charecters, why do they do what they do? What is Harrison Ford's character? What makes him such a good Blade Runner? I do however like some things. The set design, costumes, and a super sexy Sean Young are all definite pluses. Maybe I'm not seeing something"

","Yes, it's a good film and I enjoy watching it.  Yes, I have watched it many times and have never gone out of my way to avoid it.  But it only has half the plot of DADOES and misses out an awful lot of Rick Deckard's motivation because of this. One point in its favour is that the title was changed for the film because it really isn't a film of the book."
"rleather","7","2","4","19 September 2001"," A classic.... but then so is Mary Poppins
","Not that I try to draw comparison with the two films, mind.<br/><br/>OK. Fact is, when you watch the film later in life its really not as good as you remember. Sure it looks spectacular, even by todays standards and production value shows in every shot. But the actual plot, portrayal of emotions and script do leave certain aspects to be desired.<br/><br/>Lets take for example, how does a man who is so obviously sensitive to the world get a job essentially killing ('artificial') people. It seems to so contrast with his character. In an early scene he voices (albiet in the over dubbed version) criticism of a police man being racist (the 'skin jobs' comment). Yet we are talking about a man who executes them. Surely I'm the only person to find this rather odd.<br/><br/>But am I nitpicking? Its more of a visual film than truly philosophical and the added 'noir talk over' does nothing but simplify the action for the easy viewing audience.<br/><br/>At least the 'directors' cut went someway to rectify the faults. No happy ending shot (to open car on a strangely clean and pollution free country road....). Plus the re-introduction of the idea that Rick Dekkard is a replicant himself, via the vehicle of the unicorn as dream content, metaphor, and finally, modeled in silver paper.<br/><br/>Having said that, the book wasn't terrific either. So what can you say?<br/><br/>Over rated? Yes.<br/><br/>But still not a bad film in any sense of the word.<br/><br/>The problem is that Science Fiction as a genre has been so badly served by its movie incarnations that people clutch at the better ones and escalate their worth. In my mind, that one truly superb Science fiction film has yet to be made.<br/><br/>Somebody add some thought provoking script to the visuals of Blade Runner and run the film at the speed of ""The Matrix"" and then we'll be talking.<br/><br/>One last rant. In the voice over version he say ""Sushi, that's why my wife calls me. Cold fish"".<br/><br/>Only problem is that Sushi means 'seasoned rice dish' or just 'rise dish'. It's Sashimi that's actually cold fish. You'd have thought he knew this.... woundn't you."

Although it may be slow-moving to some,this is what makes most good movies brilliant.Tension build-up and identification with the main characters is thus fostered.

Ford plays a tired, worn Blade Runner, a person who hunts the replicants down and kills them. Brilliant, dark with a calm that almost makes it a sci-fi drama rather than action.

","Having seen this movie on a small TV, it seems it does the film more justice to say that even in the situation, I was thoroughly blown away. The flying billboards which, you know, if they could, they'd plaster them across the skyline, the constant presecense of rain, all of these set a mood and create an atmosphere so thick you could cut it with a knife. Beyond the special effects...there's not as much as you'd like. Harrison Ford is good as a character you can't feel much for, but he nonetheless does a good job. There's not point in wasting words on giving the plot, there's far too little space to effectively give it away. Points of interest in the movie are the finale (which is like a vivid nightmare), where Rutger Hower truly shines. All and all, an off and on movie which nonetheless keeps you enthralled."
"Stud-12","7","2","4","24 August 1999"," Visually and intellectually stunning.
","I watched this movie for the first time on DVD today, and left the room with mixed emotion. On one hand, there was the visual affect that the movie had. Ridley Scott (of Alien fame, another favorite movie of mine)directed the movie with such brilliance that he belongs in a category usually reserved for Kubrick, or maybe Speilberg. The film also affected me intellectually, and left many unaswered questions, that I still cannot manage to find the answers to. ""Was Deckard REALLY a replicant?"" is the most haunting of all. While the movie is very deep, it is sometimes drawn out and long. I saw the directors' cut, so the narration was deleted. Perhaps that may have added more to my experiance. I give it a 7."

I also love and adore Sean Young as Rachael, she fits the role so perfectly and, you really start to care about her as the movie progresses along, I think it's one her best performances too. Ridley Scott was a master of his craft at the top of his game when he directed this masterpiece, right after directing his other masterpiece that is Alien.

","The rise of science fiction movies in the 1980s, ""Blade Runner"" is one of the most far-reaching films, creating a new film style-cyberpunk. Influenced many later famous movies.<br/><br/>The label of science fiction movies is cool and gorgeous special effects. However, there are not many special effects in Blade Runner, but it has created a unique dark style. Almost all of the film is a night show: crowds of people come and go in the rain, showing the end of the city with the background music.<br/><br/>One of the reasons why this movie is famous is because of its unique theme and style, so that it was too advanced in that era and was considered ""bad film"". It brings us a lot of thinking<br/><br/>There is no complete decent and villain in the movie. The man-made people revolted because they did not want to succumb to their destiny. They had more power and wisdom than humans. They were sent by humans to the universe to survey new homes. It makes no sense. So they want to resist. In fact, the artificial people in the movie are just like the human beings just born, seeing the beauty of the world, and embarking on endless exploration. Nowadays, mankind has become the ""God"" of man-made man, but he is not as kind as the God who created mankind. Mankind has always carried the arrogance of the Creator. Man-made humans have done too much work for humans from birth to death, but humans have not stopped their oppression. In the human world view, man-made humans are slaves. When man-made humans request developers to modify lifespan, they are ruthlessly rejected . However, at certain times, artificial humans are more humane than humans. At the end, Roy's monologue filled the film instantly, and the pigeons he flew seemed to represent that his soul was finally free.<br/><br/>Now that AI technology is developed, there are always some problems: should robots have independent awareness? How should robots serve humans? What is the relationship between humans and robots? ----- ""Blade Runner"" brings us reflection on the Creator."

","That's what makes it so timeless and perhaps this is what Ridley Scott was really going for all along. This is a film that's bigger than you, never tries to explain itself and poses many more questions than it answers; in fact, NONE of the questions it poses are ever answered (and in fact the sequel ""BR 2049"" continues this style of film making, for that matter; insofar as it is a loose sequel to this film, also features the character of Deckard, and again simply ignores the audience's possible desire for answers about the world of ""Blade Runner"".).<br/><br/>Any movie of the ""noir'"" style is inevitably going to leave a large segment of the audience at a loss, and as a result, many people dislike this film - and that's to be expected and exactly how it is supposed to be. I saw this film in 1982 and was completely baffled by it but a later rewatch (in 2019, the year in which this film takes place) had me finding a lot more meaning to it (but still with too many unanswered questions). Anybody who disliked it I would ask to watch this movie again with a more critical eye and ask themselves what questions this movie brings up to them. It goes far beyond the usual philosophy questions such as ""what does it really mean to be human?"", although this movie will never pretend to offer an answer - and today, some 40 years later, this question (with the rise of human-like robots getting closer every day) is probably more relevant than ever."

","Blade Runner, in short, is a futuristic tale about a guy (Harrison Ford) who goes after some rogue pseudo-humans, called replicants, who killed a bunch of people, stole a spaceship, and returned to Earth to find their creator.<br/><br/>Blade Runner, IMHO, has been reviewed ad nauseum since its release in 1982 so there isn't much more I can add to it. I will say, however, that despite this movie's advanced age, I only just recently screened it. So, since I missed the timing boat for reviewing, I'll quickly comment on the film's CGI (Computer Generated Imagery).<br/><br/>I consider myself a little bit of a nerd but I'm not really into the sci-fi genre like many-a-nerd - I enjoy sci-fi as much as any genre; I am a fan of all movies in general. I have seen countless films where CGI is an important part of the story telling, science fiction or not. Seeing Blade Runner less than 36 hours after binge-racing Altered Carbon (2018), the big-budget Netflix series that has been compared to Blade Runner, I noticed the 35-year-old CGI to be (still) quite impressive!<br/><br/>The scenery, the futuristic look and feel, of Blade Runner and Altered Carbon is nearly identical in its presentation (the same can be said for Ghost in the Shell with Scarlett Johansson and, yes, even the new Blade Runner). The only real noticeable differences are the overall length of each scene containing CGI, and its attention to detail (like more flashing lights and moving objects in the background). The reasoning behind this, one can presume, is overall cost and technology advancement. I remember in the early 1990's the price tag for basic CGI ran around $1000 per second of rendered video. I can imagine that in 1982 the cost was even more stupid, thus limiting the amount of time CGI could be used (add to that the cost of optical effects-like credits and other on-screen writing- and you're looking at a hefty bill).<br/><br/>Blade Runner's budget was $28 million in 1982. Based on an annual inflation rate of 2.64% per year, that budget would be something like $71.5 million now, or about $80 million less than the budget for Blade Runner 2049 ($150 million - coincidentally rumored to be Altered Carbon's 10-episode budget). Fast-forward to 2017 and pretty much anyone with a $600 laptop and the right software can create similar CGI if they have the time to invest in modeling and rendering. Can you imagine what Blade Runner would look like with today's CGI? Well, look no further than Blade Runner 2049. I must point out a little irony in that the Blade Runner from 1982 takes place in the futuristic 2019.<br/><br/>My point is, Blade Runner, from a technical stand-point, impressed me as much as Altered Carbon and Blade Runner 2049. Everything is relative, of course. So, one would expect somewhat more of a wow factor out of a new sci-fi release than one that may be older than themselves. Blade Runner (1982) CGI can still hold its own. I can vaguely remember when Blade Runner was first released the talk of Hollywood was the ""special effects"", as it was generally known back then. The movie was nominated for two Academy Awards ®: Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Effects, Visual Effects. Today that's called Best Production Design and Best Visual Effects - two of Blade Runner 2049's five Oscar nominations this year."

","This film is a masterwork of science fiction. It deserves a better 4K presentation than the one produced recently. I got a digital download and was supremely disappointed by the horribly grainy overly polarized bleached out image. I know it is not my equipment because I have other 4K downloads and discs that are stunningly beautiful. This version is on a par with the disastrous Bluray version of The King and I (which includes a gorgeous digital HD download that points out all the flaws of the disc) Wait to buy it when someone actually takes the time to remaster it properly for 4K and not rush it out to coincide with the release of a bad sequel. I also have the five disc, five version set on Bluray. It shows how Scott has trouble knowing what the final version should be. It is advisedly a much better purchase. I remember seeing this film when it first came out and this 4K is a pathetic grainy shadow of the beautiful 70mm print I saw in the early 80s."

","Bladerunner (1982) - Top 10 Sci Fi's of All Time <br/><br/>Bladerunner is one of the most unique experiences i have ever embarked on. Ridley Scott's dystopian view of the future of LA is haunting and visually beautiful. The ruthless, capitalist world is frighteningly feasible. The grim future our world has is brought to reality in this original masterwork by a fantastic director.<br/><br/>The story entails that humans built artificial robot like creatures called replicants which are full blown clones of humans!. The catch is though that they can only live for four years. These replicants have about as much intelligence as their creators. These replicants become out of control and in turn forbidden from earth and forced to work as slaves. To make sure that these replicants stay off earth, Blade Runners are hired. This enchanting story really reveals how the world is leading to self destruction and we are really getting too intelligent for our own good!. Playing God will never work.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford plays a Bladerunner who has to eliminate four replicants that hijacked a space ship and got back to earth. His performance was brilliant, as we would expect from Ford. During his journey he meets a female who doesn't seem to know shes a replicant, this develops into a rather confusing romance story. A replicant and a human in love?<br/><br/>Throughout the film there are bizarre melds of chilling music. Piercing cat howlings are used throughout the film especially in the final showdown between Deckard (Ford) and Roy. This showdown is one of the most intriguing showdowns in cinema. Why is Deckard so scared of Roy?, why do they relate to each other so much? This is a relatively brief film and while I would have preferred it to be longer, it did leave me somewhat awe-strucked by the cliffhanger ending. <br/><br/>Im a great fan of films that provide more questions than answers after all, a film that makes you think is better than any other film.<br/><br/>Perhaps Deckard is a replicant himself? <br/><br/>Ill be thinking about this possibility for days and maybe weeks to come. This entertaining masterpiece is a soaring achievement and Ridley Scott should be praised<br/><br/>8.9/10"

","Best Sci Film ever. Love the noir influences as well: the influences of Raymond Chandler and his famous PI Marlowe ( Bogart)..... Deckard being a similarly hard-bitten and morally ambiguous character, making a living amongst the sleaziest dregs of society.<br/><br/>There is even a scene, I recall in which Deckard plays a gawky fool to gain the trust of an incidental character, his mannerisms and voice identical to those of the impressions performed by Bogart in The Big Sleep.<br/><br/>I love Harrison Ford in any film, but Rutger Hauer was the real revelation, a stalwart of b-movies......<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's approach as well, the design, atmosphere, the storytelling.....<br/><br/>Is Deckard a Replicant? I like to think he's human. I think the story works better that way.<br/><br/>I like to see the film as Deckard's journey to becoming truly human by his interactions with the Replicants. Anyway, the man's journey and all that would center around empathy.<br/><br/>I just think that the story works better if Deckard is a human. He begins as a product of his environment. This hellish Los Angeles of 2019. Look at the world he lives in. Both his city, and his apartment. It's a cocoon. He's like everyone else in the city. Cut off, enclosed. He develops empathy, which is part of what makes us human.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful film that I am appreciating more and more as I delve into it."

","As if directing one genre-defining science fiction film with 1979's ALIEN was not enough, director Ridley Scott returned to the genre a scant three years later and crafted another sci-fi classic that is completely different from that earlier film. Whereas ALIEN was a totally visceral thrill ride, BLADE RUNNER is a much more subdued, cerebral offering. Nominally based on Phillip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, BLADE RUNNER is perhaps best described as futuristic film noir. Although the film is set in the year 2019, and features a vast array of technical marvels, the film's depiction of Los Angels is not drastically different than the world of today, at least in terms of the humanoids that inhabit it.<br/><br/>The cast is a seemingly odd assortment of actors, but they come together as a surprisingly effective ensemble. Harrison Ford was born to be a sci-fi film star as his aloof, tough guy personae never caves under the extravagance of massive production design or heavy special effects. Rutger Hauer and Sean Young give haunting, compelling performances as two replicants who want more, and William Sanderson turns in an endearing portrayal of a perpetual child of sorts. Edward James Olmos, Joanna Cassidy, M. Emmett Walsh, and then-newcomer Daryl Hannah all deliver striking supporting performances that linger on in the memory of the viewer long after the film has ended.<br/><br/>Although justifiably considered a film classic today, BLADE RUNNER was surprisingly a box office failure at the time of its release, seemingly misunderstood by an audience who were expecting the more straightforward thrills and chills of Scott's ALIEN. It seems as if the majority of the film-going public simply was not ready for a sci-fi adventure that was as literate and thought-provoking as this film. Artistic justice was served in 1992 when Warner Brothers allowed Scott to release a ""Director's Cut"" version of BLADE RUNNER, which presents the film in the manner in which Scott originally intended it to be released. The ""Director's Cut"" wisely drops the studio-mandated narration and the tacked-on ""happy"" ending, and was almost immediately embraced as further improvement on this classic film by the majority of viewers."

It also points out how unique we all are in noticing the beauty of it. Probably the most masculine ""chick-flick"" I could think of.. :) It also had an enormous influence on the days Architecture (See Lloyd's building of London by Richard Rogers or basically any of the mid-80's rock stage sets) and culture up to Batman Begins (see the trivia-section of its IMDb-page).

","What does it mean to be a human being?  Likewise, what constitutes a lifetime?   Or the meaning of life?   Few if any movies or literature in general(yes, movies are a form of lit.), ask these questions in such a stunning or potent way.   And unlike most movies dealing with these questions, it provides no simple answers.   The viewer is left to find his or her own answers to those questions.   We see these characters loose in a world that has effectively swallowed the human animal, and made it a function of  the whole, rather than allowing any sort of individuality. Each is trying desparately to define him or herself against a back drop of time and its inexorable flow, against the pressures of  a society rotting from the inside out.   Humans here do everything they can to rise out of the mist, grease and dirt, and yet our characters dig into it, trying to figure out who and what they are, and if, in the long run, it really matters at all.<br/><br/>The movie is visually stunning, both at a human level, and a backdrop level.   Hypnotic and scary, yet strangely familiar. Everyone turns in a top notch performance, although Harrison Ford has said he felt that he did not do much more than provide a center focus for the set pieces.     I have to disagree.   He  was the archtypal  human working towards individuation.    He was the reflection of his world for us.   He provided an fully realized entry point for the viewer into this cacophany so we could understand the questions being asked.   He was everyman.  And that is one of the hardest roles to get right.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see for everyone who has ever sat back and wondered what the meaning of it all might be.    It offers no easy answers, but certainly asks the age old questions in a fantastic way.<br/><br/>quotes:<br/><br/>""Painful to live in fear, isn't it?   Like having an itch you can never scratch.

","There's a lot said here about the visual effects, but something should therefore be equally said about the incredible soundtrack done by Vangelis for this movie. Sure, the synthesizers may sound a bit dated by today's standards, but given the subject matter in this film, it all fits perfectly. It would not be the same without it.<br/><br/>Rarely have I heard so much attention to detail in a soundtrack - especially a sci-fi one. The art of making a good soundtrack is perhaps subtle to some, but Vangelis knew how to create the unconscious effect of suggestion to make his music fit the scene perfectly. This process involves more than picking minors for sad scenes, and majors for happy ones. Then also there is timbre as well as tonal quality to consider.<br/><br/>The music for the opening scene is immediately ear-catching. The big 'THUUUMMMMP' is simply scary and acts as an 'anti-gong'. It is the pronouncement of our future doom. To this day, the Waldorf 'Q' series of synthesizers uses an emulation of this sound as a showcase patch.<br/><br/>Other highlights here include:<br/><br/><ul><li>The 'Blade Runner Blues' theme - Played where a replicant woman is shot in the back and crashes through panes of glass in slow motion. The blues theme is in perfect keeping with the whole 'noir' feel and yet, in keeping with the futuristic setting, the lead is held by a synthesizer, not a saxophone.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>'Rachel's Song' - Although the strings and woman's voice sooth, the constant metallic 'plinking' in the background reminds you that Rachel is a machine.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>'Memories of Green' - This is the music played at the piano scene where Rachel remembers her implanted memories. The heavily detuned piano suggests age, but the electronic sounds in the background remind the listener that this too is not real, even if it seems so to her. This song is very Debussy-like suggesting this is what she remembers playing in her earlier memories. Subtle!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>'Tears in Rain' - It is Roy Batty's last scene and perhaps one of the most poignant ones on film. An uplifting theme to match the releasing of the dove into the sky and signifying the release of a soul.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There are snippets of music played in various scenes that have distinctly Oriental overtones to them. Often, this music is heard echoing across the city or in other public places. This reflects the theme of an  L.A. in 2019 with a meshing of Western and Oriental musical styles.</li></ul><br/><br/>I don't think Vangelis got near his due here and my hat's off to him and to Ridley Scott for having the foresight to choose him. Next time you see this film, pay attention to the musical themes. Try to imagine what those scenes would be like without the music to set you on the path."

","This film excels in nearly every facet and is an example of timeless movie making.  Apart from the hairstyles you'd be hard-pressed to know it was made in 1982.<br/><br/>Story line slow?  Only for people who are addicted to the mindless overdrama that hollywood pumps out these days.  The pauses and deeply atmospheric moments in this film are part of it's overall sombre texture and thoughtful feeling.  Indeed, deep themes of love and death are woven into this film noir tapestry.  It's the only example that I know of a film noir set in the future, with Harrison Ford doing an outstanding job as a Philip Marlow character.<br/><br/>The lingering scenes of the dystopic Los Angelas futurscape are stunning in their detail and verisimilitude, using extensive sets and modeling to give a texture which is all but lost with the advent of computer-generated imagery. This film is almost unparalleled in its confidence, as the long, lingering shots of the city and the buildings pay homage to an entirely imaginary architecture and cityscape which, all at the same time, seems awesome and lamentable.  It's fascinating to see the filmmaker's imagination at work in the commercial aspects portrayed in this futurscape as well.  Coca Cola retains its prominence, but Los Angelas has become dominated by Japanese interests and culture, a clear projection of where Japan seemed to be going in the early 1980's.<br/><br/>Story line simple?  The story line is epoch.  Rutger Hower seeks immortality, or at least more mortality from the ""creator.""  But the modern god is a scientist, a geneticist who has none of the omnipotence that Hower's character needs.  The film weaves in the Greek story of odypeus, which is where I'll stop so as to not give it away.  The movie is full of myth and allusion and has a lot to offer in repeated viewings, both in visual and litterary imagery.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and buy the Blade Runner DVD and play it on a nice TV with a good sound system.  If you can, find a re-issue of it in a theatre. It deserves a big screen and it deserves a lot of credit.  Anybody who goes to the trouble to try to discredit it on the imdb website simply does not know what they are talking about."

","A lot of comments suggest that this is a boring movie, or even just terrible. They mention lack of action, dialogue, or even character development.<br/><br/> I think that these people go to a ballet and find it really boring as well.<br/><br/> This movie is a ballet of visual arts. The character development happens within the incredible cinematography, designs, sets, and everything else around. It is one of those movies you can call ""artsy"" in that respect, where a person doesn't have to answer each question with a ""yes"" or ""no"", but simply with the appropriate look, gesture, or even silence. To those of us who understand what subtlety is, it speaks volumes. To those who rely on effects simply to enhance the story, you're in for a boring ride: go and rent T2 or something.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is beautiful. Like 2001, it has very little dialogue, and like 2001, some people just don't ""get it"". That's fine, but then try to understand what it is you're tearing apart before you do so. Not all visionary things have to have tons of explosions and non stop action. Some of them are very slow paced and force you to think and read between the lines. Like 2001, it doesn't give you the answers, but merely guides you into thinking about them. It creates an entire future to set the appropriate questions so that you can think about them more clearly. Some people think that this might be ""boring"" and really need their hands held a little more often, which is why the overlay dialogue was originally put in. But if you want to see a masterpiece, look at the director's cut.<br/><br/> It becomes less of a movie than a meditation. Yes, it's slow, but it's meant to be slow. I don't see anyone saying that Swan Lake should be performed ""faster"" and that more explanation should be used instead of visual arts. Some people are critical of the ambiguity of Ford's character, but that was meant to be that way for a very good reason. You just have to watch and think carefully about it.<br/><br/> In so many ways, this movie is like a dream about ourselves and our future; if you fidget and try to wake up too soon, you'll miss the entire point."

","BLADE RUNNER ****<br/><br/>This futuristic sci-fi thriller will stand the test of time as a defining moment in the genre.  With cult status firmly behind it, the movie manages to bring together so many strands that it is interesting, thought provoking, entertaining and endearing.  Harrison Ford plays the Blade Runner detective Deckard, who once again takes up his duty to retire Replicants.  Early in the 21st century, the Tyrell company engineered robots that were comparable to humans in all attributes whilst also being more intelligent than us, and used as slave labour in off world colonies.  The work was dangerous and often the information of the colonies would be cloudy, so it was necessary to send in robots as a test.  <br/><br/>When a particular band of robots under the umbrella of the Nexus 6 model rebelled against the humans however, they fled and came to Earth; Los Angeles to be exact.  The year is 2019, and Deckard is sent to find out why the Replicants have come back to Earth and to retire them before they can blend in to the surroundings.  Ford is supreme in this role and commands the stage with presence throughout.  The film addresses many issues, some a little far fetched and others more believable.  <br/><br/>The latest model of Replicant is so advanced that it has started feeling emotions just like a human.  To be more easily controlled, the founder of the Tyrell company implanted a history' into their minds so that they become easier to control.  But the escaped Replicants fear something is wrong through their intuition that they have learned to experience.  From the primary story of Ford's quest to kill these Replicants, are the other stories that blend together brilliantly.  Deckard feels a pain and uneasiness about killing Replicants even if they are solely robotic.  He forges a friendship with a Replicant who works at the Tyrell company and finds it difficult to communicate with her after many truths have been revealed.  <br/><br/>Rutger Hauer plays the leader of the Nexus Six brigade who seems to be on a personal quest to find out what he wants to know with his Replicant friends. Hauer is excellent, capturing the uneasy quality that we associate with anything that looks human but we know is synthetic.  He plays suspense expertly, and along with Daryl Hannah creates a believable story line and triggers feelings of sadness and sorrow at their plight mixed with an uncertainty as to whether they are playing on our emotions.  Ford embarks on his quest trying to fit the pieces of the jigsaw, and his roguish attractive style is perfectly suited to the movie.  <br/><br/>The backdrops are stunning and what we get is a real feel for the place. Los Angeles has become a mixture of nationalities and customs in which it is seemingly dull and dank except for the glimpses of blazing sun that basks its heat over the Tyrell building.  Perhaps Tyrell thinks he has become some sort of God with the blessing of the above.  The city is shrouded in steam from the Chinatown region in which stalls and market places rule.  Overhead are the neon signs and lights that light up the darkened sky and factories spurn out flame after flame for production.  Why would the Replicants come back to this, shouldn't they have escaped to another colony?  Deckard must find out, coming up against his greatest foe yet.  <br/><br/>Armed with a Voigt Kampf testing machine, that measures impulses to decide whether the subject is human or not, and by his own judgement from working the city he must get to the bottom of the mystery.  Ridley Scott has made one of the best sci-fi movies here.  Everything comes together supremely and Hauer's finishing speech is memorable and moving, something which fits the movie as a whole."

It is a dark, yet beautiful film. Rutger Hauer brings a subtle intensity to his role and casting him was a stroke of genius. He has been wasted since this role. His scene at the end is no less than brilliant.     They are both victims. Roy is more human than human, yet built for slave labor and given a 4-year life span. Deckard is the guy hired to clean up the mess when something goes wrong. The question raised is..who is the bad guy here?...can you blame the replicants for trying to extend their lives? The question of whether Deckard is human or replicant is a tease...you decide. The love of life is the real focus.

At the moment they start to grow feelings they need to be killed. For the killíng, government uses this special unit called ""The Blade Runners"". This is actually a story about discriminated bluecollars who try to free themselves from the enslavement of the society. Even though they are machines they have feelings which makes the killing more complicated for the blade runners especially when Harríson falls in love with one of the replicants.

","I recently read a review of ""Daredevil"" (don't bother seeing it) in which the author asserted ""you don't go to a movie like this expecting 'Scarface' or 'The Godfather'""  True, these are in a different genre of film and there really can't be a good comparison.  You can, however compare a scifi or superhero movie to Blade Runner (the director's cut).<br/><br/>
With a scifi film, you have to suspend your disbelief or you can't enjoy it at all.  A good scifi film, though, has its own internal logic and rules, and how well a writer and director manage to do this is the best measure of the quality of a scifi film.  No movie I have seen yet beats Blade Runner.<br/><br/>
The story is deep and rich and has it's own history, the characters, especially the androids, are human.  They struggle with life and mortality, they do what they must to survive.  The atmosphere is a wonderful noir style that has never been equalled by another scifi film.  (Terry Gilliam comes the closest) The plot is subtle enough that the central question of Deckard's humanity is barely mentioned, yet shadows the film 20 years later.<br/><br/>
Whenever I watch a scifi/fanatasy/superhero film, I look for it to be as good as Blade Runner.  It proves that a scifi film can be done well, and shames the crap that so many directors are trying to pass of to us."

","This film has been hailed as one of the best sci-fi films ever made, and I have to agree.  I must make it clear first off that I prefer the original video release version to the Director's Cut.  I was glad that a writer in a film magazine agreed with me that the Director's Cut wasn't that good. I don't care what anyone else says, I stand by my decision!<br/><br/>SPOILER WARNINGS!<br/><br/>The performances are all very good.  Rutger Hauer is a truly tragic character as Replicant leader Roy Batty.  You really feel for him.  His death scene is truly moving.  Harrison Ford is quite good as Deckard as is Sean Young as the Replicant he falls in love with.  The other Replicants aren't developed much, but I'm sure that Brion James, Daryl Hannah and Joanna Cassidy (WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT) fulfilled all that was required of them.  M. Emmet Walsh and Edward James Olmos are good in their roles as the two main cops, but they too are underdeveloped.  The production design has to be the best aspect of the film as the dystopian LA of the future is brought to life excellently.  The film is also brilliantly underscored by Vangelis.<br/><br/>Many people complained about Harrison Ford's voiceover in this picture, but I actually like it as it clears up some plot points and make Deckard's feelings more clear to the audience. And about all that stuff about the Unicorn Dream bit in the DC implying that Deckard may be a Replicant (which Ridley Scott revealed was true a couple of years ago).  Well, it could be true, but it's implied in the original cut as well.  When Sean Young asks Deckard if he ever took one of the 'Voight-Kampff' tests (tests which try to prove if you're a Replicant), he does not answer, because of course he hasn't.  That, for me was an implication.  <br/><br/>I admit that I like happy endings, and the happy ending of BLADE RUNNER makes sense.  Because Rachel believed herself to be human, Tyrell did not program her to terminate after four years, and the same could be said about Deckard.  This, in my opinion makes sense and humanises Tyrell to some degree as it shows that he must have had some compassion for the Replicants after all.  <br/><br/>Well, you decide for yourselves which version you like the most, but I just wanted to state where I stand.  All in all, though, BLADE RUNNER is a must for sci-fi fans!"
"Infofreak","Null","0","0","6 February 2003"," A fascinating and visually stunning film. Still one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made!
","Having been a major fan of the late Philip K. Dick since before this movie was made, I initially had some problems with the movie leaving out some of the major parts of Dick's novel 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?', most notably the total absence of Rick Deckard's wife, and the removal of the sub-plot involving Mercerism. But I have long come to terms with that and now can happily judge 'Blade Runner' as a movie in its own right, without comparing it to the brilliant novel that inspired it. As a movie, 'Blade Runner' is a stunning achievement, and to me it is still one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made. Ridley Scott is a very visually orientated director, and is often only as good as the script he is working with. In this case he was blessed with a very good one, co-written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples (the latter went on to co-write another modern SF classic 'Twelve Monkeys'). Scott and his team manage to conjure up one of the most impressive cityscapes of the future ever seen in a science fiction film.  So impressive that it knocked the socks off William Gibson, the writer who is credited with ""inventing"" virtual reality. 'Blade Runner's look had a definite influence on Gibson's seminal 'Neuromancer', and the movie must therefore be seen as a major contribution to the cyberpunk genre, which is still making waves in pop culture, just look at 'The Matrix' for one. Harrison Ford is perfectly cast as the weary and cynical Deckard, and the supporting ensemble cast are all excellent. Many of these actors (especially Rutger Hauer, cult favourite Brion James, Daryl Hannah) would rarely be given roles as good as this again. Hauer is particularly good in one of his best ever performances, which gives Blatty a depth and humanity not even seen in Dick's original story. Legendary character actor M. Emmet Walsh ('Blood Simple') and Joe Turkel, veteran of three Kubrick movies (one of only two actors to have that honor) are also worth noting, as is the superb score by Greek electronics whizz Vangelis. 'Blade Runner' is a science fiction classic, and a movie which improves with each viewing. Highly recommended, but make sure steer clear of the version originally released in cinemas with the cheesy voice over. The (so-called) Director's Cut is the only one to see."

","I'm not going to give a review of the film because others have already done so and there aren't really that many people who have not seen the film.<br/><br/>I missed this film when it was first released, but subsequently bought it when it came out on video.  Then laserdiscs came along and I was lucky enough to buy a copy of the film by Criterion (which is the uncut European theatrical version).  This version forms part of my treasured collection.<br/><br/>Then, the ""director's cut"" was released and I did make a point of going to see that at the cinema.  I have to say that I was really disappointed with this version on three counts:<br/><br/>1. The deletion of the 'violent' bits.  The film was not that violent in the first place, so why bother?;<br/><br/>2. The insertion of the 'dream sequence' involving a unicorn.  This looked so much like the editor had accidentaly slipped in a scene from 'Legend' that most of the audience burst out laughing.  This was supposed to suggest that Deckard IS a replicant, linking (as it does) with Gaff's origami model that he finds at the end of the film.  But there are already other subtle clues within the film (like the glow in Deckard's eyes), so why put in this gauche signpost?; and<br/><br/>3. The loss of the voice-over.  I, personally, don't mind the Marlowe-esque voice-over.  Not only does it explain certain parts of the storyline, but it adds to the 'replicantness' of Deckard's character.  Without the voice-over, the film becomes confusing (to the uninitiated) and the pace slows.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I didn't bother to buy the ""director's cut"" when it was released on DVD.  I'm still waiting for the original European version to be released on DVD, but this seems increasingly unlikely (Criterion have since lost their licence for this film).  I now read that Ridley Scott is going to revisit his (flawed) sci-fi masterpiece and produce a proper ""director's cut"".  I hope he decides that the original version was okay and simply signs that off for release."

","Ridley Scott seems to have made a classic movie. Very close to a masterpiece. In the not so distant future, man has lost control over his own product, the replicas. First he makes them perfect, now he has to restrict its potentialities to defect. Sometimes our own creation gets out of our control and what happens then?  Who is guilty and who is not? Is the manufacture or the manufacturer to be blamed for the loss of the original purpose of the existence created? What is allowed and what is not? Future is shown so cruel and poetical at the same time. Perhaps each one can find his personal answer in Batty's line: ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die."""

The story combined with special effects is a classic that has a cult following to make it one of the best in it's gene.

When I watch a film and stay until the generic ends reviewing the film in my head, trying to understand the feelings it left me, I can say, ""Wow, this one touched me somewhere"". That's what Blade Runner did to me and still does.<br/><br/>Of course it's dark and a bit depressing. Of course it's far from Dick's novel (but I do not care). Of course it's not Star Wars (That I like for some other reasons). The futurist context is not really important in this film. Added to the Vangelis music, it just brings a darker atmosphere and a context. What's really important and what gives the depth is all the questioning behind. Who I really am? Am I what I think I am? How long will I leave and what will I do with this time left? It's all about life, love and death.<br/><br/>And Sean Young is so beautiful... I could have felt in love with this kind of robot...<br/><br/>When must also remember that this film was made almost 25 years ago. There have been so many sci-fi films since then that it is easy to forget how much Ridley Scott was a genius at this time and how much he influenced the genre.<br/><br/>Just hope they won't do a sequel to break the magic..."

","There are of course two kinds of people in the world- generally speaking. There is one group of people who aren't going to like this film no matter what. So I'm warning you now. If you consider Armageddon one of the best sci-fi flicks of all time then you won't like this movie. Don't say I didn't warn you. Of course I like action flicks like Total Recall as much as the next guy. But I also like thinking films. This is a thinking film.<br/><br/>
 For what it is this movie is simply amazing. Sure it isn't realistic. But I haven't found a sci-fi movie which has ever seemed plausible. Who designs buildings so darkly? Nobody would want to work or live in that. There is a reason why they try to use light colours in office buildings today. But I digress. <br/><br/> The first 45 minutes is quite slow. But pay attention to the dialogue- its important. There isn't a lot of dialogue unfortunately. I would have liked to heard more from Edward James Olmos. But listen to the dialogue! Especially if you are watching the directors cut. You will have to figure things out for yourself. This film will not be liked by lazy thinkers. Did I mention pay attention to the dialogue? I thought so. <br/><br/> If you expend the energy to think about the words and the images the film will simply be amazing. The suspense will be lost if you aren't following the story though. And of course the best scene in the movie is where creation meets his creator. The scene is gripping to say the least.<br/><br/>
 I'm not big on Rutger's speech at the end. It's an average speech at best. But the mood was still there, and it was still an excellent scene. And the ending which I will not spoil is not to be missed. It leaves questions unanswered. I'm sure I mentioned this was a thinking movie. It's up to you to come up with the answers. If you are unwilling to do that then don't watch this movie. You will hate it. But if you are willing to think during and after a movie you will find this one of the best sci-fi movies ever.<br/><br/>

Don't get me wrong I love ""Popcorn"" movies as well as the next guy but man does not live by popcorn alone. Most movies, to use anologies found in the literary world, are akin to pulp novellas, comic books, or just basic fiction, however some movies like some literary works transcend the boundaries of conventionality to a significant enough level of greatness so as to achieve iconic status. These works seem to breathe, live and pulse with a life all their own and they often give no quarter, the viewer/reader must work and read between the lines to gleem the full impact of what is intended, for the artist to plainly state what he/she is trying to say would detract from the overall beauty of the entire work. >>>>Spoiler>>>>> as an example look at one of the last scenes. You don't have to hear Deckard's voice telling you that he beilieves Roy saved him because in his last moment of life, life must have become precious to him, the act itself finaly makes obvious that Roy was never really a simple minded cold blooded killer, he killed only to escape, and then like man, destroy his own creator(s) (I could go on about that but then I'd have to analyze everything and there is just too much to this film to do that at one sitting),once Roy realised death was iminent and nothing further could be gained he allowed his more humane side to do the right thing and in the act possibly transform the real cold blooded killer (Deckard) into a humane being himself. The entire film is loaded to the gils with material such as this. You give them eyes but they cannot see>>> speaking of eyes>>> At certain points in the film every thing identified as a replicant has red eye, I never noticed this because I had always seen it on vhs and it was not always apparant. Then I saw it on the big screen and thought how could such a visual artist and perfectionist like Scott allow that to happen? Then I caught on that it was only replicants. I knew that there was speculation that Deckard himself may be a replicant and there they were in one of the scenes in his apartment:Deckard's Red Eyes although for Harrison Ford the effect was much more subtle but it was still unmistakable. Added to the other evidence, there is no mistaking it, Deckard is a replicant which leads to more thoughtful speculation. Don't say this film sucks just because you don't get it, perhaps you'd be happier watching something else where you can sit, in the words of Frank Zappa in Po'jama people, with ""cozy little footies on your mind"""

Surprisingly, though human emotions are a main theme of this film, very precious few are revealed through the cold, stone faces the characters display throughout the movie, an expression that can be best explained as something between agony and boredom.  Harrison Ford only goes as far as to put on the cocky grin that he is famous for, and the occasional voice-overs that drop in every now and then are both unnecessary and uninspiring (director Ridley Scott was wise enough to cut the voice-overs from the recent Director's Cut version).<br/><br/>Poor acting aside, the film drives itself along solely on its basic premise: that being the questioning of reality.  The story, adapted from classic sci-fi writer Phillip K. Dick, pulls the viewer in through excellent scenes such as where Deckart goes over some fragments of Rachel's memories, thereby revealing to her that she is an android, and the soliloquy delivered beautifully by Roy Batty as he takes his last breath.  One can't help but be moved by the chilling revelation of discovering that a whole lifetime of memories has been a lie, to be aware of your existence as only a machine.<br/><br/>Whereas other science-fiction movies are mostly a combination of action and special effects, BladeRunner goes the extra step to provide the emotional effect which the movie viewer carries with him after the film is over.<br/><br/>I gave it an 8."

Clear your mind, start the movie, and just watch it from beginning to end.  The beauty is in all the details - in the sound the police spinner makes as it whizzes by, in the soft glow of reddish-orange light when Deckard is at the top of the Tyrell building (when every other part of the city seems to be in perpetual darkness), in the noirish yet electronic score.  The plot needs to be taken on its own terms - if you can accept the basic premises of Deckard's job, then you can be drawn into the unfolding story.  Sure it can be slow, because all good Sci-Fi is.  It needs to be slow, so the audience can think about the implications of what's happening.  If you rent this movie because you heard it was like The Matrix, and you expect the instant gratification of violence and a swift plot, you'll be disappointed.

"Baroque","Null","0","0","5 June 1999"," The standard by which others are measured
","I still remember seeing this film in a dark, dingy cinema in New York City's Manhattan borough. It is a facinating dystopian view of the future, all with a single burning question at the forefront: What makes us human?<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's vision of a Los Angeles in 2019 still haunts me. The first time I saw the LA skyline at night driving down Interstate 5, the images of the first frames of this film came to mind, and I nearly wrecked my car!<br/><br/>If you have not seen this film yet, watch the ""original"" version first, complete with running narrative and happy ending (forget the ""extended version"" with gratuitious violence). Then watch (and savor) the letterboxed (widescreen) Director's Cut, and see how a great film was made better. There's less blood and guts, no narration, and, yes, the dream sequence (with the unicorn) plays an important part. Take note as to the origami folding Deckart finds at the end of the film! It answers (as well as asks) many questions that were never mentioned in the original version.<br/><br/>The two most impressive moments for me are Leon Kowalsaki (Brion James)'s classic paradox (""Wake up! Time to die!""), and Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer)'s death speech. Hauer literally stole the scene (the words ""like tears in rain"" were ad-libbed!), and the sylloquy literally moved me to tears. After all these years, and all the times I've seen this film, it still does! All Roy wanted was to be human, and he could only find his humanity in death.<br/><br/>To hell with what Leonard Maltin thinks of this film! For me, it ranks with ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" as one of the most ambitious views of the future without any hype and schlock normally associated with science fiction. Everything has a worn, grimy feel to it, unlike the bright, shiny props in so many films. The colors are unusual. Most of the interior scenes have sepia or tan backgrounds. The camera angles and lighting are incredible, and Harrison Ford's acting is totally believable.<br/><br/>The film isn't perfection, but dammit, it reaches out and touches it!<br/><br/>(Take note as to how many of the gadgets and themes are now commonplace. Retrofitted buildings, laptop computers, digital video, on-board computers in cars, the heavy influence of Asian pop culture and cuisine in the USA, all in a film made in 1982!)"

","An almost completely rewritten script, a perfectionist director, a lead that had rotten relations with cast and crew, producers baying at the door and the author of the original short story didn't like what was being done at all. Isn't it strange that a lot of masterpieces are made in times of such strife (see Apocalypse Now, Easy Rider, The Shining and The Exorcist.)<br/><br/>Yes, I said masterpiece. At first I didn't think it was either. A good film, maybe even a great one, but a masterpiece? Never. The Directors Cut did nothing to change my opinion when it was first released. Now it's easily my favourite science fiction film and quite possibly the finest film that deals with the meaning of identity ever made. Especially the D.C.<br/><br/>The script may have been written and rewritten but lets face it, it was worth the wait. There are so many marvelous lines and wonderful scenes it boggles the mind. Hampton Fanchers original draft was okay but it was never as good as David Peoples re-write. The script also hints at deeper meanings behind the obvious. When Batty says ""Show me what you're made of"" what exactly does he mean? Is it a straight challenge or a reference to Deckards origins?<br/><br/>That's a matter I could never resolve. Is Deckard a replicant? When I watched it the first time there was never a moment I doubted his humanity but after reading other peoples views I find it harder to stick to that. Maybe I'll never know. Maybe Ridley Scott didn't want us to. Scott's touch is undoubtedly the guiding light behind the film. The themes and techniques he used in Alien are exploited here to the full. Syd Mead may have designed that horrible city of the future but Scotts lens never quite manages to damn it. He gives the cold streets a dangerous, foreboding look but finds time for great warmth as well in Deckards apartment. He's helped by Vangelis' marvelous score which fills every scene with such emotion and power it's impossible not to be moved.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford may hate the film, Sean Young may have hated working on it but there's no doubt that they and Rutger Hauer give career best performances. It's such a shame that Young and Hauer went into a career nosedive after this that neither have recovered from. The rest of the cast do their jobs admirably as well but Ford comes up trumps. Forget Witness, the Star Wars' or anything else he's done. This is as good as he's been.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best way to judge a films affect on the industry is to see how many times it's been imitated. How many times has BladeRunners view of the future been ripped off? Too many. How many have looked as good? With the exception of The Matrix (maybe), none of them. BladeRunners most famous aspect is it's cynical view of what the metropolis will look like once we're finished wih it. But it's not its best. It's the way it constantly questions what being human is and what humans are meant to be and humans are meant to do that I love so much. In this film man plays God by creating a being in its own image. Man wants to control the being. The being does not want to be controlled. It retaliates. Is this a moral or a warning? Like the rest of the film Scott doesn't answer, just lets us draw our own conclusions.<br/><br/>Enough. I've gone on far too long. But I could go on forever. Maybe one day I'll right an essay on the film. Or maybe I'll just watch it instead. Yeah, I'll probably just watch it. After all, it is a masterpiece. And the Directors Cut is the best."

","No words can describe this absolutely masterpiece. From the beginning to the end, Scott, Ford, Young and Hauer teach us how words and images can go beyond, beyond the entertainment, beyond the imagination.

","Everyone I know always brags about how Japanimation movies like ""Akira"" and ""Ghost in the Shell"" are so good.  I even heard a television commercial claim ""Akira"" makes ""Blade Runner"" look like Barney.<br/><br/>What kind of crap is that?  Unlike anime, BR shows the foolishness of unnecessary violence rather then exploit it.  The story, which deals with Deckard (Harrison Ford), the special futuristic bounty hunter hired to track down a group of escaped androids is the perfect example of a look at humanity.  The androids are made out to be evil, but in reality it's their creator Tyrell who truly is the wicked one.<br/><br/>This story is excellent, the androids are all sympathetic (remember, the crime they commit is wanting to be more human), and you will feel heartbroken at the end of the movie when you hear Deckard's mental soliloquy concerning the fate of Batty, the lead android.  Ridley Scott really outdid himself with this picture, which is one of my favorite sci-fi flicks along with They Live.<br/><br/>It is a shame that in today's society trashy animated films which rely totally on gore and sex to entertain rather then actual human development are so popular, while films such as this are left to neglect simply because people view it as something Harrison Ford did to kill time between ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Return of the Jedi"".<br/><br/>If you have not seen it, then watch this movie at once.  I recommend the American version, because the European unrated version's ending is too happy to remain consistent with the dark and gloomy setting of the rest of the picture."

For months (years) afterwards I wanted to be Deckard, I wanted to chase androids round that nightmare LA, and most of all I wanted that trenchcoat!<br/><br/>With maturing years I was able to appreciate the finer points of the movie, as well as pick holes in it and give the many critics a little more credence.

","A pivotal movie in my many years of cinematic fascination, I had only seen ""Blade Runner"" for the first time in October, 1998, which meant that I had seen various films inspired from it, such as Luc Besson's ""The Fifth Element"" and even Tim Burton's two ""Batman""'s before I got the chance to lose myself in the elaborately constructed Los Angeles of this film.  Of course I have subjected myself to both versions, and of course the Director's Cut is better, but still this is beside the point. For a film made seventeen years ago and culminating with the kind of visceral fascination and kinetic cinemania that this one inspires is almost unheard of.  We could get into arguments about the relative outdatedness of even the most classic of films (even those nifty hippie-inspired stewardess wardrobes in Kubrick's ""2001"" look hopelessly tacky today); ""Blade Runner"" however, still holds its own.  A beautiful piece of cinema, everything in this film comes together like clockwork.  Jordan Croenworth's cinematography, Douglas Trumbull's special effects, the performances of Harrison Ford (who showed his relative worth as an actor first in this film, not Peter Weir's ""Witness""), Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah and Sean Young at her most soulful, and most notably, Ridley Scott's meticulous direction make this one of the great films.  How could I forget Vangelis's score? Who could dispute the evocative dreaminess of the scene where Young lets her hair down at the piano as Vangelis's electronic palette of eerily beautiful melancholia reaches its crescendo? Or the bluesy overtones of the scene where Ford analyzes a photograph and cries of childhood are subliminally heard in the background? Or in one of the most poignant sequences in cinematic history, at the end on the rooftop, the perfect combination of music, imagery and dialogue. Don't get me wrong, I believe ""2001"" to be a film of enormous versimilitude; it is quite possibly the greatest sci-fi of all time (it is certainly the most ambitious); ""Blade Runner"" though creating a world with as much ingenuity and pizazz as ever before seen in cinema, is a much more subtle work and offers an opposing side as to the haunting effect of cinema; Scott's direction at least deserved an Oscar nomination, as did the film itself, the cinematography, the music, the film editing and the sound (they all failed to resound a single nod in all of the aforementioned categories). The only other sci-fi film I would compare this to as to having the same subtle reach and beautiful realization of cinematic artistry would be Peter Weir's ""The Truman Show"", a film which is, like ""Blade Runner"", less science fiction and more of a foretelling of things to come. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences must not like being reminded of the gloom and doom that the world is apparently headed toward: I don't blame them, for it's nice to think of a world with no conceivable problems.  But their relative lack of any type of cinematic appreciation is unforgivable especially in the past few years: the comforting strains of ""Gandhi"" and ""E.T."" over ""Blade Runner""? This is a great film, no matter what the box-office receipts or Roger Ebert or Leonard Maltin think about it."

","Blade Runner, hailed as one of the great SciFi movies, manages to combine science, action and philosophy into one beautifully made package. The movie makes you wonder- ""What is it that makes you human?"" If it looks human, acts human and (thanks to implanted memories) *thinks* it's human, and has developed free will, is still an android? Based on the novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" the movie adaptation loses a lot of the deeper subtext but still manages to convey the problem with creating artificial humans, if they grow emotionally doesn't that make them human too? One thing I missed that was in the novel was the ""mood organ"" which allowed humans to control their moods artificially, insuring they were happy with their jobs and their lives. If your emotions and mental state are artificial does it make you less human? Still the movie is excellent, I recommend it to all."

","So myriads of people have spoken on Blade Runner - most of whom probably have good ideas and are insightful and so on.  If you love the movie, I'm with you, but the damn thing ALWAYS makes me cry; so after about the tenth time I watched it over a 10 year period (I drink when I watch it) I finally realised that besides the very incredible cast, and the interesting story, there was something else swilling around at the bottom of the movie that inevitably made me blub at the end.  Sean Young is gorgeous of course, but so?  The real message of the movie is this: that Deckard [the protaganist], could fall in love with an android - something pretty much against ALL his training.  By the end of the movie we see that people [you, me, the protagonist] can fall in love with anything, just so long as it is able to capture your heart.  It is THE movie that is totally anti-bigot, that strips taboo down to raw emotion and declares ""if your heart WANTS this, you won't be able to stop it"".  It is a movie about forbidden love, taboo, intrigue, death and life: pretty juicy stuff.  And the unspoken message is simply 'people will give their hearts away to whoever will pay their price, and furthermore, they won't be able to help themselves'.  Because, if you remember, ol' Sean is just a machine - an appliance really, a big, complicated vaccuum cleaner with an incredibly great face, but still a machine; just a machine.  And to prove the point, there he is, the android Roy Batty who in the end loved life so much that he would not even take the life of his would-be killer.  It's THAT message about the individual: that the Nazi can fall in love with the beautiful Jewish chick; that the militant black guy can be transfixed by the innocent white girl; that the boundaries of race or creed or color, or even of flesh and blood, are actually no boundaries at all... that if Deckard can cross them, anybody can. He falls in love with an android, and shows us that no matter how you were trained or raised or brought up, there is the possibility of love... that somewhere in time, even if we are ""sushi"" - even if we are cold fish -  we can love anything, or anyone."

That is a common misunderstanding, which has made me (and probably others who have read the book) think that ""Blade Runner"" is just overrated bad sci-fi.

I personally would recommend the Director's Cut due to its overall atmosphere, but for a basic plot understanding, you may want to see the first cut. This movie is everything science fiction should be, and was intended to be. The questions of self-destruction, human life, and morality are heavily stressed throughout the entire work.

","The Director's Cut of this classic 1982 film is simply masterful. Gone is the cheesy voiceover & ride into the sunset, replaced with moments of brooding silence and a brilliant last minute stroke, that forces the audience to think again about what they have just seen. Harrison Fords low-key performance as the Blade Runner Deckard is, for me anyway, one of his most memorable. An excellent well thought-out cast of characters, add as much depth and detail to the story, as Sid Mead did to the visuals. The unmatched cinematography, and stunning visual presence intertwine perfectly with the multiple layers of philosophical thought & questioning that make up the story. A deserved classic that will remain so to the very end of time, and quite possibly the most profound piece of film ever produced.

","Taken from the novel DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP? by the late, great science fiction writer Phillip K. Dick, BLADE RUNNER must be ranked as one of, if not the, greatest visual achievements in the history of cinema. Directed by Ridley Scott (Alien), the story focuses on Los Angeles, 2019. A film-noir technopunk verisimilitude dominates in this time, as large blimps extoll the virtues of going ""off-world,"" while the majority of people live in pollution and towering pyramid buildings, where strobe lights of various hovercrafts wind across gothic stone gargoyles, where the sun never seems to rise and the torrents of rain never stop.  The culture of Los Angeles seems to naturally grow from our present time; there is a large Asian and Hispanic community and culture.  Deckard (played with a splendidly Marlowean low-key by Harrison Ford) is a ""Blade Runner""- cops specially trained to eliminate illegal off-world worker androids who run amok on earth.  The leader of the ""replicants,"" Roy (Rutger Hauer), seek only a chance to live beyond their pre-determined deaths.  As Deckard descends further and further into the hunt through the seedy streets, he also discovers a most unusual love interest-- a legal android (Sean Young) who refuses to believe her memories are fake. As mentioned before, BLADE RUNNER has a wonderfully unique vision of the future, created by visualist Syd Meier, that every science fiction film from RUNAWAY to THE FIFTH ELEMENT has ""borrowed,"" to put it nicely. However, what truly makes the story compelling is the quest for humanity, and what truly makes us human.  If at all possible, view the Director's Cut: the ending is completely different, more realistic, and ultimately more powerful.  Truly a classic, and four stars out of four."

"csm23","Null","0","0","19 April 2002"," Science fiction as creative mythology
","We've all seen Blade Runner a thousand times.  It's a movie with universal appeal.  But the really intriguing question is, Why?  What makes us want to watch it again and again?  <br/><br/>I think that Blade Runner's universal appeal lies in its ability to tap powerfully into our collective mythological subconscious:  in particular, its reification of two fundamental psychic forces, represented in Greek mythology by Gaia (mother earth) and Ouranos (father sky).  It has the power of a religious truth that bears repeating over and over. <br/><br/>
Consider the warm, dark, moist, dank feel of the film.  Wet and warm and dark, one feels the feminine energy of the womb.  The architecture is massive and heavy, suggesting feminine emotional centeredness, power, and gravity.  In one scene, there are supporting beams of enormous girth, stretching proudly upward from the ground.  But they are literally engulfed by their dark moist surroundings, and the energy of their strength and girth upward thrust seem puny by comparison.  Blade Runner has a distinctly vaginal setting, an amazingly powerful backdrop to all the masculine energy that ensues.  <br/><br/>All the men in Blade Runner interact with artifacts.  None of them is aware of the warm smell of the earth;  nor are they intimately connected to her (the earth) as son to mother.  Instead, they interact with each other, or things.  Men treat other men as things.  They no longer need women for procreation.  They no longer need to relate to their own feminine anima (at least, they think they don't need to):  they need, or they think they need, their toys, their instruments of power and control.  <br/><br/>Notice also that the act of creation has been usurped from women, residing also, perhaps primarily, in men's hands.  In the Hebrew Scriptures, there was always the divine `wisdom' or `Sophia' in the background with Yahweh, identical to the creative impulse of Yahweh.  In the Biblical proverbs, she speaks and says that `when he marked out the foundations of the earth, then I was with him, as a master workman.'  Creation was a feminine impulse.  But while watching Blade Runner, it feels as though men are acting out of envy of women  call it `vaginal envy' as opposed to Freud's `penis envy'  and an impulse both to dominate, and even exceed, women's creative powers.  In Blade Runner, it's a masculine psychosis on a worldwide scale. <br/><br/>
Which is why Blade Runner is such a timely tragedy about the consequences of male phallic dominance.  `Blade' is, of course, a highly phallic symbol. One is reminded of Odysseus's famous encounter with Circe, two polarized representatives of the feminine and masculine, Gaia and Ouranos, wherein they approach each other in a competitive relationship.  One or the other is bound to lose.  In fact, both do:  they remain polarized in their sex roles, and forfeit much of their human potential.  So Hermes, helping he hero dominate and control the woman, gave Odysseus this advice just before his encounter with the seductress:<br/><br/>When she turns cruel, coming near With her long stick to whip you out of doors, Then let your cutting blade appear, Let instant death upon it shine, And she will cower and yield her bed.<br/><br/>A blade is the instrument of Odysseus's domination.  Yet behind this masculine `need' to dominate lay his fear of castration, and his fear of women's creative power.  Man must control the blade, the power, or the evil woman will take away his manhood.  The male fear of castration is, in fact, a powerfully effective undercurrent in the film.  The replicants, who are in many respects superior to their human creators, are nevertheless dissatisfied with the nature that their human creators gave them;  so, they seek to deny mankind their power of creation.  They want to castrate mankind as Saturn castrated Ouranos.  <br/><br/>There isn't a clear ray of sunshine in the entire film.  Why?  Because man is his own sun.  By the light of his own intellect and reason he has seen things that ancient Helios hasn't seen.  Man has eclipsed the sun as Saturn of Greek mythology (father of Zeus) eclipsed his father Ouranos.  As a human audience, we feel the power and hope of such divine power.  We even feel sympathy for the Eldon Tyrell, master replicant designer, when Roy squishes his head between his hands, going straight for the creative genius of his maker, the source of his generative power.  It's a beautiful thing, after all, to have such creative power.<br/><br/>So in Blade Runner, man lives in the shadow of his own image.  Having externalized the creative power of his own feminine anima onto the things he has made, he remains disconnected from himself, existing on a lower moral plane than his own creation, the replicants, who, though dissatisfied with their own nature, at least remain true to it.  In fact, mankind is the aggressor in human-replicant relations, having projected their own dark side onto them, not unlike Yahweh and his faithful servant Job. <br/><br/>
Thus Blade Runner is much more than a science fiction flick.  Jung said that `One doesn't become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.""  Blade Runner brings the darkness of our own phallic assumptions about human progress to light.  And seeing our dark impulses in the light of day, we become enlightened."

","This one has reached a cult status few movies can achieve without the aid of marketing and sequels. It's easy to see why, since I think it keeps getting better with age. Saw the director's cut a few minutes ago and loved it even more than previous times (it was also the first time I saw it on DVD), it brought back a nostalgic sense (it breathes 80's style) and that Vangelis score is simply unbeatable (and we know how many tried to imitate it). This movie unfortunately didn't establish Ridley Scott as a great director and bombed at the box office and at the critics' board (Leonard Maltin gave it a near BOMB rating). But it is clear that it's too good to be left unnoticed. It actually creates that essential thing most moviegoers seek when they enter the theatre - the power to escape from this world and be some place else for about two hours. The work done in cinematography is a triumph and the production design is simply astonishing. Vangelis has also made a remarkable work, which is still today a musical landmark on its own. Thrilling thriller, that's all that I can say, this movie is simply amazing."
"rdowellsprint","Null","0","0","30 March 2002"," Deckard is an Android.
","I'm going to intentionally make this a short review. Since this movie is a visual movie rather than one with heavy dialog you should really just see this movie. Blade Runner is one of my top five favorite movies that range from Casablanca to 2001: A Space Odyssey. The only way to see Blade Runner is in wide screen on DVD. I also turn on the sub titles to most DVDs because many times actors don't have perfect diction or there is just too much background noise. You would be surprised what you pick up this way. Also ignore all but the Director's Cut version of Blade Runner. Just recently Harrison Ford said that his character Rick Deckard is indeed an android. Even Harrison Ford didn't know until almost twenty years later. I love that kind of trivia. I believe that the unicorn dream is almost the only clue in the movie to Deckard being an android. This movie is dark and almost dreary, yet stunning. I get lost in another realm of fantasy when I see this movie - and I see it often. I won't bore you with superlatives or little nuances that make this a winner. Just see this movie. I even had strong empathy for Rutger Hauer's tight character Roy Batty - the villain. Sean Young as Rachel was never lovelier. You can't stop watching this movie the moment Rick hurts Rachel's feelings. Harrison Ford may have been better, but I can't think of when. And that music by Vangelis - it's a one of a kind, almost brutal score. See this movie."

","To my opinion this movie is the best film of ridley scott<br/><br/>A true science fiction story or film is about ideas, not spaceship battles, futuristic gadgets, or weird creatures. ""Blade Runner"" fully qualifies as this in its examination of the impact of technology on human society, existence, and the very nature of humanity itself. These themes are set in a fairly basic detective story that moves slowly but gradually builds power as the viewer is immersed in a dystopian futuristic Los Angeles."
"Aidan McGuinness","Null","0","0","11 March 2002"," All-time great atmospheric sci-fi
","""Blade Runner"" is rightly regarded as one of the greats of the sci-fi genre. It's about a blade runner - someone whose job it is to hunt down rogue replicant (synthetic worker androids), who have circumvented their programming and - due to their enhanced abilities and intelligence - pose a threat when on the loose.<br/><br/>What's most striking about the movie is it's setting. Set in 2019, the movie adopts its own unique ""retro-future"" type look that has been horribly imitated by countless video games and movies since. There's a constant gloominess, dankness, and wetness to the movie, all superbly captured by Jordan Cronenweth. All the buildings, cars, et cetera have a run-down grimy feel to them. The place is so atmospheric, and well done that the setting feels *real*, which adds immensely to the flavour of the movie. The plot is, at it's core, a good guy-chasing-bad-guy but it's done a little better than that. It's nice to see a plot that can move at times without spelling everything out to the audience (as happens nowdays), and be engaging. Some may complain about the pacing, but the slowness of it is in keeping with the drab nature of the future they live in, and the beauty of it prevents you getting bored. The plot builds to a somewhat fizzled out climax, but even the climatic fight can be reconciled with the themes of the movie. The Director's Cut, which I saw, also leaves a question about Deckard, the lead, on your lips that's thought provoking.<br/><br/>The themes of the movie - what it is to be human - are generally well explored. It's interesting that no-one bats an eyelid about gunning down a replicant, who - despite a developed mind - doesn't warrant a right to life. Deckard, in pursuing these people, learns to re-examine his pre-conceptions about replicants and their nature, and where emotions and dreams stem from. The clues left about Deckard, and his own life, further help explore this concept. The acting performances are generally low-key, almost dead-pan, but again it suits the mood of the picture though doesn't necessarily deserve any Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" is a high quality, thought provoking sci-fi movie. It's got a soul because it has something to say. It looks amazing, and still remains undated (an achievement in itself - Ridley Scott did something similar with the grungey future espoused in ""Alien""). It's got a plot and intelligence (the viewers are left with something to question). It's among the very very best of it's genre and it's highly recommended. 9.3/10."

Innocently, Rachael says to Deckard, ""Put your hands on me.""  Roy develops a sense of humor smashing his head through the wall and pretending to get stuck.

","This is an excellent movie all around. This was the era where Harrison Ford was Indiana Jones and Han Solo (those were pretty good movies, though), and it was nice to see a change in pace for the incredibly skilled actor. I thought Harrison Ford did a great job, just because he was an entertaining as well as believable character. <br/><br/>I thought Rutger Haur stole the movie, though. Roy Batty was such an interesting character, and Rutger Haur did a great job in animating him to real life. Batty was also a great character because he had feelings and emotions, even though he is a murderous Nexus 6, which is the most superior model of Replicants. He had an interesting sense of humor (he could be pretty funny at parts), and he also developed strong emotions. The ending was my favorite part for many reasons, but most of all for Roy's final monologue.<br/><br/>Sean Young and Dearl Hannah (especially Dearl Hannah, and her cool face painting)were also very pleasing in Blade Runner. This movie is great for many reasons, for the great action scenes, for the great acting and dialogue, the bleak waste land of what has become Los Angeles in 2019, and also, and probably most importantly, the philosophical message the film provides us with in the end.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is fun for everyone, except people who can't handle even a little violence (it's pretty brief). Ridley Scott usually makes great decisions on movies, which generally turn into hits, and this one is no exception (a great follow up to 'Alien'). Check it out and you won't be let down, unless you want a non stop shoot em' up, because this movie does have a lot of action, but not through out the whole movie.

","This is a masterpiece of science fiction more than the usual sf thriller like Aliens. Science Fiction always deal more with the human side of science and this one not only creatively done that. It was a sociological expose of a dystopian society (the end spectrum of Orwellian '1984' where instead of a regulated dictatorship of big brother, we have the anarchy of the capitalist corporate power above anything else) and where a moral apotheosis was asked: where does humanity lies?<br/><br/>The film is about a group of androids, wanting to prolong their existence they went to Los Angeles, as androids had a redundancy period of four years. But Harisson Ford plays as Rick Deckard a blade runner whose job was to dispose such androids. Thus was the moral dillema: he was a murderer of innocent lives. And he had to live with the fact.<br/><br/>The whole somber atmosphere of the movie was briliant. The production of future Los Angeles seems to me to be better than most modern CGI animated sequences and doesn't have that exageratedness than CGI could produce (like in the new Star Wars movie). The 'simplicity' of depicting a future haunting Los Angeles was the best I've seen in any sf flics. The only other atmosphere that had produced such effect of estrangement I think would be in 'eXistenz'.<br/><br/>The most poignant scene that I would rate in my movie history was when the leader of the Android (played by Rutger Hauer) had saved the live of Deckard and said: 'I've seen the way the sun shines on the gates of Tannenbaum' or something of that order. It was such a deep scene that conveyed to my mind the existence of humanity and a whole human life in his short existence. It was like reading a novel, that scene conjure such a spectable of imagery of another existence. He was telling Deckard how human he was and how he loved life. More than human, more than morose Deckard.<br/><br/>It is a spectacular glympse to another world more so than the epics (like Star Wars) because it only glympse it. Because it allows with in its enigmatic way the possibility of a grand world beyond anyone's dream. Like the above scene, we can only gauged at the scene of the gate of Tannenbaum or the burning of a spaceship. For we've only seen a slice of such a world."

","A down-to-earth movie with such lovely attention to detail and a refusal to sugarcoat anything in anyway only spells great film.  Throw in a very talented cast and a highly complex story and you have a masterpiece.  But that isn't where the real fun begins... this film goes about it with Film-Noir class and style that just works wonders for the story.  With the Director's Cut, you get more involved with the film than in the original when Decard's voice-over did the thinking for you. This is also one of the FEW cases that the book and the movie are comprable. This is due to the fact that Ridley Scott KNEW that he couldn't remake such a wonderful book, so this story acts more as a sequel to the book.  There are obvious exceptions... like the Tyrell's are the Rosen's in the book and the book calls the replicants ""andys"".  This allows Ridley to demonstrate that he knows how to make a good film and is a talented director. The greatest thing that this story does is make you understand the replicants more than just focus on Harrison.  The only down side to this film was the over-acting and cheasyness in the scene where Decard trys to stop Rachael from leaving (the whole ""say 'kiss me'"" bit). Blade Runner is a realistic vision and a movie that makes you think.

The translation to film often makes for a quite different experience, not always a happy one, but I think this is done superbly in this case. One example of where the film missed the point a bit for me is that there is nowhere near the sense of turmoil our 'hero' is going through, and his wife is nowhere to be seen in the movie. I suppose that was a matter of focussing on plot, but the fact she existed adds additional pressure on him with his antisocial job and the feeling of just how out of touch with everything in his world but the replicants he is.<br/><br/>Originally this film had a voice over (Harrison Ford), only much later the director's cut lost that and also adjusted a few scenes making for a slightly shortened film. I actually prefer the voice-over version as again it adds to the mood of the film and gives you further insight into Deckard.<br/><br/>

","To try and comment on one of the greatest films, in my personal opinon, is incredibly hard.  Having watched Blade Runner since I was young, the lines delivered by Rutger Hauer through the chase and on the roof in the penultimate scene have haunted me my whole life.  Watching it again yesterday for the xth time, it was amazing how much detail and points of reference I can see that I never saw before; for me, the hallmark of a masterpiece.  The echoes of a 40s film noir detective thriller are self-evident; the hair, the clothes, the constant darkness and rain, and also the fact that everyone smokes, and when they do they create vast plumes of smoke.  Whether this is intentional I do not know, but is eerily effective.  The film is incredibly well balanced (never seems like 1hour 50mins, does it?), the lighting is superb, the shadows and the strange focusing on the characters all very powerful.  I have always been fascinated with the close-ups on the eyes, even the animals in the film.  The flashes of red burning in the darkness.  But again, this just echoes that which has already been said a thousand times by other critics.  My personal views are that which I would really like to express. In comparison to other great works, such as the Godfather, which shines due to its excellent depiction by the actors concerned, I feel Blade Runner is powerful for the very opposite.  The characters to me are not incredibly strong, indeed Harrison Ford plays down his role throughout, I think.  What is more evocative is the sets, the lighting, the attention to every detail, the bewildering oriental influences, and of course, the mesmorising score by Vangelis.  The plot is essentially very simple, and is never difficult to follow.  In this way, the vast other questions raised by Blade Runner are given a chance to appear.  Humanity, self-preservation, love, desire for life, playing God.  The very questions we ponder now on Cloning and genectics are faced in this film nearly 20 years ago. <br/><br/>The eternal search for the question Why is what I feel most comes from this film.  The death of the Android at the end and his speech to Deckard say to me that that which we strive our whole lives to understand is suddenly clear to this machine at his very moment of death.  His whole purpose for being, although  predestined, was actually his, by breaking away and striving for questions he has in fact found all his answers. This only scratches the surface of this great film, and would recommend anyone who has not done so, to watch it.  Original first to understand  the story better, then the Directors Cut."

","""Blade Runner""is probaly one of the best science fiction movies i ever seen.Harrison Ford does a great performance as Rick Deckard,a futuristic detective on the trail of hunting down ""Replicants""from killing humans so they can be human.The movie gets boring in some scenes,particularly the undirector's cut,which i think is better.The replicants are sinister as they are scary in some cases,Rutger Hauer does most of that,not as much as Brion James,who's the scariest of them,especially in the beginning scene with that test.Daryl Hannah does it fine in her earliest performance as Pris who poses as a hitchiker to William Sanderson.This classic should of been a bigger box-office hit,probaly at least grossed in the $20 or $30 million range.All in all,despite the boring scenes and occassional drag,""Blade Runner""is a landmark science fiction classic film.I give it a 9 of 10."

","Leighton Grist, in his article ""Moving Targets and Black Widows,"" faults Blade Runner for supplanting substance with style. `Hence we are presented with a recognisably noir environment -- dark, rain-soaked, steam-filled, claustrophobic city streets, heavily-shadowed interiors -- which, while visually stunning, does not so much express classic noir's existential angst and oppression as the fact that the film-makers were well versed in genre stylization.' This argument has a fundamental problem. It presumes that whatever noir is, it results when a certain number of elements are present, when a critical mass is reached. Because Blade Runner lacks `existential angst' (if, indeed, it does), it is incomplete. If we play this argument out, however, we can charge that Mildred Pierce is not film noir because it generally lacks dark interiors, rainy streets, high-contrast lighting, and other traditional noir traits. Mildred Pierce, though, is noir. Why? Because it suggests despair, shows the influence of psychoanalysis, and draws its momentum from tragic irony. Moreover, Mildred Pierce is noir because it was shot at the end of the Second War, by a European expatriate, when existentialism (of the Sartre variety) enjoyed a vogue. It reflects the historical and ideological temperament of the time when it was made. Blade Runner, on the other hand, appeared toward the end of the Cold War -- in a world tremendously different from 1945: a time when questions about living prosperously seemed more important that questions about life's meaning and absurdity. The crisis facing mankind, directors, and movie audiences 35 years after Hiroshima just wasn't the same -- we were not gripped in horrendous doubt and fear. If anything, we were gripped by technology; and if a popular negative philosophy existed, it was oriented around things like computers and artificial hearts, and how their inclusion in our world could eventually undermine our importance as going concerns. This philosophy certainly preoccupies Blade Runner, with its Lang-ian paranoia about machine intruders. So: the film is not existential for the same reason that Mildred Pierce is not tech. Both films reflect the fears and troubles afflicting the times in which they were made. I do not argue, however, that Scott's film is noir. Rather, I attack the claim that because it is not as noir as other films it is trash. It is of its time. Real Noir is of its time. Thus Blade Runner is an adventure movie with noir traits.<br/><br/>It also has science fiction traits, as it creates a world that might be ours in the future. Its credulity -- like Things to Come, The Blob, and Invasion of the Body Snatchers -- forces us to look at ourselves. Strong sci-fi, after all, depicts an imagined future that is usually a projection, a magnification, of what we already know. This vision of the future is anything but optimistic, and because of this, it possesses a quasi-moralistic tone, a warning. In the future, the movie suggests, mankind will have destroyed its environment. Have the seeds of this destruction been planted? Yes. (No Nukes, Three Mile Island, Save The Whales....Environmental activism thrived during the late 70s/early 80s because fears of environmental degradation thrived.) By extension, all the other worst case scenarios shown in the film -- homelessness, corporate might, xenophobia, racism, misogyny -- are condemnations of contemporaneous social problems And this reasoning gets me thinking. In a world as fouled as the one depicted in the movie, lousy treatment of women seems like a behavior which would be normal. I'm not convinced, as some critics are, that the depiction of misogyny is a celebration of it. After all, aren't there numerous instances in Scott's films (Thelma And Louis, Alien, and GI Jane), when women are depicted as heroes and saviors? Finally, I have the feeling that Blade Runner is an important movie in the history of cinema. It is a Hollywood blockbuster -- an over-the-top extravaganza -- of the sort Star Wars and Jaws precipitated. Those films, however, were genre films on steroids (like Scott's Gladiator, in fact). Blade Runner isn't a genre film, however. It is hydra-headed: film noir, samurai, science fiction, dystopia, comic book, and horror. Because of this -- this attempt to be everything past in the brand new Hollywood of 1982 -- it may be categorized as homage, a farewell to Flash Gordon, Sam Spade, Soylent Green, and Frankenstein - to mass produced genre films. And because of this, it is a film about film -- about the separation of the new Hollywood from the old one, a hash of dead dreams and copies.<br/><br/>

","There are few films which have genuinely had an impact on my life & the way I think. Bladerunner is THE main one. I first saw the film in 1984, (ironic ?), and was literally blown away. As a film it operates in it's own believeable environment. Deckard, Rachel, Rory, Tyrell, Sebastian, all form empathic, believeable characters, all of them have they own rational desires & genuine motivations. Rory wants life, but in the end understands that it is such a precious commodity that even in his quest he cannot deny it of others. The themes of the film are worthy of Chaucer, or Shakespeare, and it's to Scotts' credit that he explores these in the film in the same way that Chaucer or Shakespeare would have done. In cinematic terms NO film since has managed to impart the same pathos, though a viewing of 'Hannibal' will show that Ridley has lost none of his art. I feel that 'Bladerunner' has had the same effect on it's generation as 'Citizen Kane', or 'Apocolypse Now' must have had on their's. Look at all of these works and the common theme is human frailty. In real life the outcome of events is rarely black & white. In real life there is rarely a happy ending, the loose ends are never neatly wrapped up. At the possibility of offending some people, I would say that Hollywood produces it's best work when it allows original directors, a large proportion of which appear to be European/South American/Asian directors to make truely original films. In fifty years time no-one will remember 'Deep Impact', except perhaps for Morgan Freeman buffs ;), but EVERYONE will remember 'Citizen Kane', 'The Maltese Falcon', & 'Bladerunner'. What more could a film ask for ?"

","Blade Runner is probably director Ridley Scott's most engaging, artistic, thought-provoking film.  It is the future and world is in ruins.  Not by war, but by the extreme separation of classes and exploration of ""outer colonies"".  This film version is based on the Philip K. Dick novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"".  I think this one of the very few instances, that the movie has outdone the book.  Los Angeles in 2019 is a dreary, rain-riddled ghetto where the poor workers live and breath the oppression of the police and big corporations.  This fact is deeply emphasized in the novel, but the screen version clearly paints a disturbing picture of hopelesness, fear and low-class slavery to those too weak to fend for themselves.  This is a society that immorally creates androids to explore dangerous colonies, and worse - implants emotions and memories into their synthetic minds.  Harrison Ford gives a great performance as Deckard, a man reluctantly drawn back into action as a Blade Runner: a special police unit designated to terminate or ""retire"" stray humanoid robots called ""replicants"".  When an angry band of replicants seek revenge on their greedy creators, its Deckard who must seek and destroy.  The film touches on though-provoking aspects of human morality, and poses the question: Should man be allowed to create robots with real emotions.  The consequences of playing god turn out to be desasterous when Deckard realizes the murderous nature of his profession.  This is a complicated film that has a twisted emotional climax when Deckard comes face to face with the most lethal of his robotic targets.  One of the best science fiction films of all time.  Final Rating = 8.1/10"

Just that play on words ""RETIRE"" sends chills down my back. Thinking that killing sentience can be given such a corporate label.<br/><br/>Douglas Thurmbal makes outstanding visual effects that where revolutionary in 82 and can still seem seamless today.<br/><br/>Every person who participated in this film should be patted on the back for making a movie that bombed at the Box-offices in 82 because it was light years of it time and only today we seem capable of having the sensibilities to understand it."

While important not only for its groundbreaking effects and genre twisting conceptual design, the film is much more than a pretty face.<br/><br/>As we tumble further into the century of the film's setting, Blade Runner gains more relevance with each step we find ourselves inexplicably taking. If you haven't yet seen the film, do. If you have, see it again. Upon the film's release in 1982, Ridley Scott's 2019 Los Angeles seemed strange...more fantastic than prophetic. In 2001, we find ourselves in the great dawn of Scott's vision.<br/><br/>While this is hardly the proper forum for discussion of the film, it is important to note that Blade Runner is much more than a well made science fiction motion picture. It is that and much more. My greatest wish is that the film would be re-released in theatres next year, on its 20th anniversary. In a time when scientists are racing to create the first perfect clone (just as their great grandfathers raced to create the atomic bomb), Blade Runner stands out as a prophetic warning not only to the hundreds of scientists working under veils of secrecy, but as a warning to each and every one of us as human beings."

If ever there was a realistic film with fantastic F/X, great acting and style, and a story with a thousand facets to it, Blade Runner is that film. The scenario is something very new.  Harrison Ford portrays a futuristic detective/bounty hunter on the trail of 4 murderous androids in an awe-inspiring 2019 Los Angeles setting.  The entire movie is a profound mood piece of flying police vehicles, monolithic towers, a web of neon endorsement, and the questioning of what exactly makes us human.  The future as seen in Blade Runner is a very real one and can even be applied to today's enviroment, a future that is the pure product of the Cyberpunk Movement.  But Blade Runner should be appreciated for more than its superb vision and effects.  The plot is a thought-provoking one with thousands of possiblities to the questions that may arise.

Phillip K Dick and Riddley Scott had the same intent. <br/><br/>Excellent acting done by Harrison Ford and the replicants (Sean young, Rutgar Hauer, Daryl hannah, Joanna Cassidy, and the deceased Brion James.) They're acting is good enough to provoke a sensitive look on what the intent of the story was. Excellent lighting to form a gritty look on the future in 2019. Skyscraping buildings portray an excellent set decoration that should have won the oscar in 1982. <br/><br/>Perfection by Art decoration in the urban streets of LA 2019. This movie also shows how much pollution the world has left behind. Constant acid rain, garbage, smoke etc. It depicts very well how careless humans can be to the minds of others. Who knows maybe we will suck up every resource on this earth and have to move to another planet to colonize.<br/><br/>Excellent director Ridley Scott who brought you Alien, Thelma and Louise, and Gladiator. This Movie is derived from the novel ""Do androids dream of electric sheep."" It sounds kind of off ended but you will know what it means after seeing this movie. Very good plot and visual effects that should have wiped out E.T. in the oscars but before 1991 Blade Runner was stuck with a voice over narration by Harrison Ford which removed its dark noir inquiry.<br/><br/>When you watch the movie you can tell how even the replicants can have biological ""FAKE"" emotions.But the question you must ask yourself is, is it moral to the humain protocal. When they are being retired they hang on to their life as much as we do. Their struggle till their last drop of sweat is out of their blood and they mearily colapse to the powerful impact of a 38. magnum. Should creations we make ourself that initiate to environment we collapse to their knee's and receive enforcement. <br/><br/>The movie is the best portrayer of that senario only in a dark un-narrated fashion. Adement reactions is what Gadhi had although in this futuristic sci-fi noir the only possetion is a story to tell. The damask rose and oragami figures are the symbols that personify the reactions and co-essence of humans and their genetic creations. <br/><br/>The only way to understand is to try and interpret Blade Runner Or ""do androids dream of electric sheep"" by Phillip K.

Questions still arise and vivid deciphering of what the novel meant is still oblivious to us.<br/><br/>The Directing, set direction/art direction, and music by Vangelis vives a perfect atmosphere for this movie.

A good D.P. is important in both genres to get the mood across and Cronenweth definitely raises the standards drastically here (yes I am considering Star Wars). Some people even say that The Matrix (1999) was the first S.F. that did that next. I'm not one of them, but Blade Runner will always be one of MY favorites. I don't think it matters very much whether you see the dir's cut or the other version.<br/><br/>It's hard to compare this film with anything else: not even the actors have comparable performances. I think this is the best film by any of them: Rutger Hauer, Harrison Ford, Daryl Hannah, Sean Young etc. Look at it this way: if you don't like any of the cast it's still safe to go and see the film! Together with Alien (1979) this is the only intellectual work and the only S.F. Ridley Scott ever did. I'm still hoping Scott will make another S.F.<br/><br/>Be sure to see this film with a good sound system, because the quality of the sound and music (Vangelis) is crucial in this film.

","It is an amazing cohesive film that brings together so many themes and issues.  And it manages to do this while seamlessly intermeshing the old with the new, which highlights the importance of the past on the present and the future.<br/><br/>Some of the themes presented are of slavery, religion, metaphysics of the soul, capitalism, police power, corruption, biotechnology, linguistics, socioeconomics, genetic and cultural drift, corporations, overpopulation, and the repetition of history because of humanities shortsightedness.  And this is just off the top of my head.<br/><br/>With all these themes and many more, Blade Runner forces us to think, to question ourselves.  It examines our humanity, which is not comfortable nor is it easy to comprehend, and something many people are not expecting from a movie thanks to the reality of the industry.  And as a post-modern movie it critiques film-noir itself.<br/><br/>As a result, Blade Runner is something that requires repeated viewing to appreciate, and an inquisitive effort to interpret.  Blade Runner isn't for everyone, but it has so much to offer anybody who wants to inquire and learn about themselves and the world they live in.<br/><br/>As a result Blade Runner is undoubtedly a work of art ahead of its time, and will be a masterpiece for the ages.  A testament to this is that Blade Runner is more popular than ever, it has survived the test of time and is becoming more accepted as its brilliance is recognized by more people. Also, as we progress into the future, the world is looking more and more like the Los Angeles of 2019 in Blade Runner.

What might be the possible future impact from environmental pollution, urban decay, overpopulation, multi-racial societies, mass advertising, law enforcement methods - and most of all the moral and ethical question of what separates human clones from human beings. And at the end, the final unresolved question to ponder - was Decker himself a replicant???"

","What I love about Blade Runner is that it takes its time telling the story. It doesn't rush around at a frenetic pace, with bad guys flying everywhere. It moves on its own time, and lets us take in the brutal experience of what it must be like to live in L.A. 2019. The opening shots are astounding, and every other shot showing the massive corporate towers belching flames and smog into the dark sky are equally impressive. Blade Runner is, quite simply, a triumph. The story takes a backseat to the visuals, but that is certainly not a fatal flaw. Blade Runner is a great example of original filmmaking, and anyone who appreciates something with style should see it."

"davisong","Null","0","0","28 May 2001"," An amazing look at the question, ""What makes us human""?
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** The Sci-Fi/Film Noir epic Blade Runner is based on Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electronic Sheep (a second edition of the book came out with the movie called Blade Runner: Do Androids Dream of Electronic Sheep, it's the same book).<br/><br/>Set in the near future of Los Angeles, the world is dark, amorality is rampant, and humanity is a foreign concept. The Tyrell Corp. manufactures replicants, artificial humans that are stronger, faster, smarter, and only live four years before their entire genetic code craps out on them.<br/><br/>Due to a violent replicant rebellion on one of the Off-World colonies, the replicants have been forbidden to ever come to earth under penalty of death or ""retirement"" as the act of killing a renegade replicant is called. The police department has its own unit that is assigned to the act of retiring these replicants. They are called Blade Runners. However, you, the viewer, never get to see Off-World. It really isn't so much an important location as it is a concept. It is a paradise. If you are physically fit and smart you can go. You don't have to work, you have replicant slaves to do it for you. It represents the elusive garden of Eden, however if you want to get in, you need to pass the standards.<br/><br/>The movie is about Deckard Cain (Harrison Ford) as he is charged with the job of hunting down five replicants. Batty ""Roy"" (Rutger Hauer) is the leader of this group and is enigmatic as he is violent. Is he really to blame for his struggle for the survival of his family? Is he really to blame for his violent actions? After all, he only has four years of experience for in which to mentally develop. A four year old with a body superior to most all humans. A body with the capability to easily crush bone. Is he in his own way, more human than the apathetic creatures walking down the L.A. sidewalks? Not even turning their heads when someone knocks them to the side while running after a fleeing women with a gun in their hands? Others in the group include  Pris"" the acrobat, ""Zhora"" the snake dancer, and ""Leon"" the simple one. The fifth replicant is only mentioned in the scene where Deckard is briefed on the aforementioned group. Even then, it is not said who it is. That is for the viewer to decide.<br/><br/>Sean Young plays Rachael. Rachael is a replicant. A prototype. A new idea in the testing phase. The concept? A problem needs fixing: the replicants have not got enough time to build up the necessary experiences to develop emotionally. This results in child-like behavior. The solution? Memory implants. But much like Roy, she is an passionate individual, she loves, longs to be loved, loves life, and works for Tyrell. Oh ya, and she doesn't know she is a replicant.<br/><br/>Then there is the tragic figure of J.F. Sebastion. Sebastion does genetic work for the Tyrell corporation. He is a lonely individual who lives in a very large building that would have been condemned by today's standards. His only friends are a few little robot things that bumble around his place. He is so desperate for a friend, he takes in a homeless girl from off the street to crash for a few days. He asks her what her name is. Her reply? ""Pris.""<br/><br/>These characters mingle on and off with others in a mighty game of cat-and-mouse. But who is the hunter? And who is really the hunted? And in the end is John Q. Public the real monster?"

","When I first viewed this film in a theater I was overwhelmed by the visual mastery.  The opening tracking shot of Los Angeles in the future establishes the mood of the film, but what happens to the main character Deckard is revelatory. In one of Harrison Ford's best portrayals, Deckard is caught up in an intriguing pursuit and a bizarre romance that can only come from the pen of Philip K. Dick.  The author has explored the prospects of artificial humans to the depth that Isaac Azimov has explored the world of robots. There is a philosophical overtone about the transitory nature of life that never becomes maudlin and is essential to the theme and the climax of the story. <br/><br/>
The use of the Bradbury Building, an existing famous building in Los Angeles, with the forbidding edifice of the Tyrell Corporation creates a feeling of the timelessness of a city.  There is enough atmosphere for three films and it permeates the action with purpose.  <br/><br/>Is this a warning about the future absorbing of our souls into technology to the point of even making life seem arbitrary?  I comprehend that and only science fiction has been able expose that so well, before in ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""  <br/><br/>The artistic merits of the film are peerless with an inventive and haunting score by Vangelis and the exploration of cinematic effects that are crucial to the story.  It is one of my favorite films and always will be.  Nothing is handed to you verbatim in this film.  I requires one to think and interpret and that is entertaining in itself."

","Blade Runner is a surprise, a delight, an enigma, and a triumph of will. Having read a book on the making of blade runner, I found out how hard it was to actually get this film made.  Like other Philip Dick adaptions, this movie preserves his interesting premises on artificial intelligence (although it completely reverses them, Dick is not a dogmatic or ideological sci-fi writer like Stanislaw Lem or Arthur Clarke, both esteemed but inferior writers next to Dick) while pasting them on a superficial action story.  Where Blade Runner becomes a great film is in the many layers of meaning contained in the film, some of which are surely unintentional to writers, director and definately actors.  This film has an A-list of fabulous character actors, many of whom are still with us:  Joanna Cassidy, Joe Turkel, J. Emmett Walsh, Edward James Olmos, and William Sanderson among others.  Daryl Hannah is only competent but the real reason Harrison Ford hates this movie (publicly) is because Rutger Hauer completely stole it from him.  Hauer's performance turns villainy inside-out, and I only wish they had given some kind of reason for his more sadistic moments -- i guess we're supposed to accept his childlike attitude about life extends to violence as well.  I think there are many facets of the relationships between the characters (particularly Ford's and Young's) that are not spelled out, so many viewers may think that the superficial action yarn is all that's going on (I remember the first time I saw it thinking it was absolutely awful). The movie's plot is pretty disjointed, but I think in this way it mirrors other successful noirs like ""The Big Sleep.""  The music is excellent, Vangelis' best work, and I can hear its influence in much of the electronic music of the 90s.  This movie is almost single-handedly responsible for the surge in widescreen format presentations on video and television, and I think for that we should all be very grateful to an all-time cult classic that gets better every year."

The atmosphere is so noir and oppressive but at the same time cool, you pray that the future is (or in some cases, is not) before your eyes. Ridley has never been better.(Gladiator be damned.)Character so rich with life that they long to exist beyond the film. Though there are flaws within the film, its effect on the viewer is not hindered. All I have to say is see it. No giving the plot away to those who haven't."

"Anonymous_Maxine","9","0","0","2 April 2001"," Dated, but still a classic.
","Blade Runner is one of Ridley Scott's earlier films, which, being science fiction, takes place in the future and deals with the common theme of man vs. machine. It seems that there are cyborgs (called `replicants') mixed in with society that resemble humans in every way (they are, in fact, `more human than human,' a statement that all White Zombie fans are sure to notice), and, because they have turned against their makers, they need to be exterminated Â– or `retired,' as it is eloquently called. Clearly, the influence on the Terminator films is unmistakable. <br/><br/>Blade Runner was made in 1982, back when Harrison Ford was working more in sci-fi than anything else, and even though the technology in the film is badly dated, the effect is still impressive. While it's setting is no longer in the distant future (2019), the film is still effective, despite the fact that with each passing year, it becomes less and less likely that the year 2019 will look like that. Besides its obvious influence on the Terminator, Blade Runner also pays subtle homage to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, in a scene where a video phone call charge is $1.25, the exact same charge as a video phone call in 2001 from the space station back to earth.<br/><br/>
(spoilers) One of the best features of this film, besides Ford's always-excellent performance, is the skilled direction of Ridley Scott. Also, the special effects were also very impressive, both in creating the futuristic atmosphere and in other areas, such as some very impressive and amazingly violent replicant deaths. Pris' death, in particular, was incredibly convincing.  The conflict in this film stems form the fact that Ford's character develops emotional feelings for one of the replicants, and he has to face the reality that she must be destroyed. Clearly, there are numerous scenes in this film that verify the fact that the replicants do, in fact, experience emotion, and this is not shown only by the replicant that Harrison falls for. The nazi looking replicant pushes Pris' tongue back into her mouth with his own tongue after her violent death, which left her tongue protruding slightly. Sure, that's not a real appealing sight, but it makes a pretty strong point.<br/><br/>Blade Runner very much deserves the classic status that it has achieved. It is a very well thought out and very involved science fiction story, and it reflects influences from earlier classic science fiction films like 2001 and even, from the distant past, Metropolis. Harrison Ford delivers a better performance than he did in any of the Star Wars films, and Ridley Scott returns from his brilliant direction of Alien to once again prove his skills as a filmmaker."

","The first couple times I saw it, I missed much of the plot, symbolism, and deep meanings of the story.  Was it directed poorly?  I don't think so.  The movie just takes a bit of 'paying attention' to it.  Like many other people, I just didn't like at first because it didn't fullfill my expectations that it would be an action-packed science fiction adventure with another Han Solo-esque hero.  This movie was different.  Han Solo wasn't Han Solo at all.  Harrison Ford, is a Blade Runner; he's this depressed alcholic kind-of-guy and he's not even a hero really: he's kind of a creep.  He's a bounty hunter who ruthlessly hunts down these poor replicants (who were enslaved by humans to work in horrible conditions on outer planet colonys) who wanted freedom.  But since Replicants are not human, they are fair game to kill.  Or are they human?<br/><br/>I think the movie was released at a bad time, with a bad ending.  The director's cut helped that little glitch.  The scenery is beyond amazing, and the realism of a futuristic city here is probably the most convincing I have seen.  But just to warn you if you havn't seen this movie: you will either like this film or hate it.  I've seen people walk out on this movie, yet I've also seen people really enjoy it.  It may make you sit back and think a little...  Or it will make you want more action.  The movie is slow. Pace-wise.  But so what?

I'd seen a little bit of it back when I was a kid, chopped up on TV by some stupid telethon, but this is the first time that I've seen it all the way through (with the letterboxed director's cut, thankfully; never trust a studio to edit a film right).<br/><br/>Once I got over my annoyance at no onscreen credit for the writers (at least for the opening credits and the tape case; like most people, I don't stick around for the end credits), I realized how much I actually enjoyed this movie. I look at this L. A. in a 2019 that I hope never comes and I see a world that is the logical updating of Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"": dehumanized, dreary, and rotting from the inside. There can be no better representation of this world than the replicants, synthetic human beings who surpass the average human in intelligience, speed, and agility, but who only have four years to enjoy them however they can. Is it truly any wonder, therefore, that the Nexus 6 models rebelled the way they did? Four years isn't very long, so what's the point of toiling under masters you can live without? No wonder the corporations want them dead.<br/><br/>Deckard (as played by Harrison Ford) has been called many things: a 21st century Sam Spade, an anti-Han Solo, and even a replicant himself. To me, the true answer is none of the above. Deckard is Deckard, that is all. Unlike Sam Spade, he doesn't enjoy the job he has to do or really even tolerates it. It's obvious that it makes him sick to have to gun down people whose only crime is wanting to choose their own destiny. Deckard doesn't have that luxury and every downed replicant seems to kill another piece of his soul.<br/><br/>From this, it's been suggested that Deckard is a replicant himself. Again, I don't think so. Such an assertion is too easy an answer for Deckard's revulsion for the profession he quit once already. Besides, infiltration is something that his employers have undoubtably considered and so probably make a point of screening potential candidates. Add all this to the fact that Deckard can't roll with the replicant's superpowered punchs any better than the rest of the general population and all you have left is a man who is deeply troubled by the trap his life has become.<br/><br/>Rutger Haeur's Roy is no less complicated himself. Granted, thanks to the lack of emotional maturity that he was engineered with, he has no qualms about such things as wantonly taking life and serious injury. Yet, for all that, all he truly wants is to live a little longer than what's already been built into him. The whole point of the final cat-and-mouse chase through the Bradbury (also used for ""The Outer Limits"" episode, ""Demon With A Glass Hand"", and the TV movie, ""The Night Strangler"") was not so much kill or be killed as it was to make Deckard understand what it feels like to be a replicant.<br/><br/>While there is no denying Scott's impeccable style on display here (any lover of German Expressionism or film noir would appreciate it), the story development involved is not given nearly enough credit. It's almost as if the public wants to forget that someone (in this case, the legendary Phillip K. Dick, who wrote the film's basis, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" and Hampton Fancher, who adapted it to screen) had to actually sit down, plot things out, and bang the story into shape. But without the efforts of Messers. Dick and Fancher, there would be no ""Blade Runner"" or if there were, it would not be nearly as good. Not even a director of Scott's obvious ability can make up for such a fundamental component (don't believe me? Try watching ""1492"" without falling asleep or throwing up). So, in spite of the efforts of whoever decided to omit the writing credits, kindly remember the aforementioned gentlemen who did the job. Because of them, ""Blade Runner"" will still be talked about another twenty years, I think."

","I have recently seen both the original version of ""Blade Runner"" and the Director's Cut. I must say that I found the latter to be rather disappointing. I have seen other Director's Cuts and Special Editions, (i.e. ""The Abyss"" and the ""Star Wars"" Trilogy) and found them far superior and more enjoyable than the originals, and I expected such to be the case with B.R., but it wasn't.<br/><br/>I disagree with those who didn't favour the narration voiceover. I didn't think it was ""hoaky"" at all. Deckard's monologue explained several points to us that we wouldn't have known without it. I also liked the lighter, so-called ""contrived"" ending better than the abrupt cut-off of the D.C. I was glad to see that Deckard and Rachael found a refuge to live out the rest of their lives together. (Those of you who think this is too ""fairy tale,"" remind me how it is that sci-fi movies are supposed to end. Is it to always be an apocalyptic doom for our heroes?)<br/><br/>The one thing that I was overjoyed to see in the D.C. and was very disappointed it didn't make it to the first version is the unicorn vision, which suggests that Deckard himself may be a Replicant. This is the only thing that really makes the Director's Cut worthwhile for me. Now I recognise the extra significance of the paper unicorn at the end. (Gaff is saying to Deckard: ""I know what is in your dreams, what is in your memories,"" revealing Deckard to himself just as he did to Rachael earlier in the film.)<br/><br/>I do wish that this 12 second scene had been included in the original, because it just adds all that much more depth to the film, but I do however prefer the original to the re-release."

","When most people see this film it is the Director's cut version that they have seen. The original version had narration to it (probably Boris Karloff) and had a happier and certainly more contrived ending. This is also the film that made the career of Harrison Ford (okay if your not counting the Star Wars trilogy but what the hell!) He stars as reactivated Blade Runner Rik Deccard (A Blade Runner is someone who ""retires"" Replicants, the genetically engineered humanoids who led a bloody revolt somewhere and are now illegal) He is forced out of retirement to trace the arrival of four replicants on Earth (one of which ""Leon"" having shot the Blade Runner who tested him to determine whether he was replicant) The four are Leon (obviously), Pris (Darryl Hannah), Zhora and Roy Batty (The dutch Rutger Hauer), Roy Batty is the leader of this gang. Anyway enough of the plotline, the scenary and atmosphere of Blade Runner is awe inspiring with terrific set pieces with a haunting background music score. Harrison Ford is superb as Deccard choosing to underplay the role in many areas, also good is Hauer as Roy Batty coming across as the sensitive pyscopath and his death comes across as quite emotive. I would suggest you watch this film twice, just to make sure you get the appropriate (new) ending to the film...but i'll leave it to you to interpret the ending for yourself."

","A leap of fantasy into the future: a lone voyager observes astonished the dark rainy skies of a futuristic LA brilliantly represented as China Town in NY. Difficult to summarize the inspiration behind Harrison Ford's character Blade Runner: perhaps Michelangelo, Joyce, and Homer. After the movie is over, a few things stay with you: the doubtful, puzzled expression of Harrison Ford, Homerun hero plunged into the future; dozens of open-ended expressions and quotes from the movie; the gothic atmosphere; the Michelangeaolesque glowing astonishingly enormous Geishas made of pixels waving from above the dark skies. And the lovely replicants, sensible souls captured in synthetic yet perfect and beautiful bodies. If you grew up in the eighties, you will recognize Siouxie in one of them. The movie is a prism, and the story is enrapturing. It takes concentration, and a mature, sober mind. I personally watched it the first time while I was a stoned 14 years old, and couldn't understand anything about it. I had to watch it again and again before slapping my forehead for not having understood before what a masterpiece it is. Harrison Ford is the reluctant agent chosen to capture 5 replicants escaped from a far away colony, where they were sent to conquer land for the swarming terrestrials. The replicants are perfect imitation of humans, and are programmed to last only a number of years. But these have decided to rebel to their programmed destiny. As Harrison Ford begins to inquire further and deeper, he understands that the fear of these replicants is in fact human. Living in fear. What an atrocious destiny that of the replicants. The dramatic final is perfectly cathartic in that salvation and optimism lies in one established uncontroversial  truth: technology."

","In the year 2019, Los Angeles is threatened by a gang of renegade replicants.  A replicant is a robot which so closely approximates humanity that it is almost impossible to distinguish it from the real thing.  Even the replicant itself may fail to realise that it is merely a machine.  The robots are programmed with a maximum lifespan of four years, a safety device intended to prevent them becoming too knowledgeable, and therefore a threat to human beings.  Furthermore, each replicant is provided with software which contains a fictitious but credible personal history, so it 'remembers' its own childhood.<br/><br/>     The breakaway band of replicants poses a threat to Los Angeles. Usually, combat androids such as these spend their working lives in space, stuck on labour colonies orbiting the earth.  Mutinies are usually contained locally but this gang has made its way back to earth because its leader, Roy Batty, wants to force the humans to extend his lifespan.  Blade runners are essentially police officers who specialise in 'retiring' (that is, destroying) apostate robots.  Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a blade runner and he is given the task of hunting down the four surviving members of the replicant band.  What follows is a rather mundane cops-and-bad-guys movie in a quirkily futuristic setting.<br/><br/>     And what of this future world?  Cops patrol the city in black-and-white squad cars, just like in 1982, but now the cars can hover in the air.  The depiction of downtown architecture is visually impressive, but unfortunately it is patent nonsense.  Urban traffic and the science of robotics will not be like this in 2019.  This science fiction is so much science baloney.<br/><br/>     ""Watch out for water,"" says J.F. Sebastian as he shows Priss to his apartment, and it is a warning that should be standard in every Ridley Scott film.  Why does Ridley always conceive of the future in terms of steam gouts, dripping ceilings and restless searchlights?  And why, for that matter, must a man in a fez always be devious and cowardly?<br/><br/>     Rutger Hauer makes a terrific villain, mixing suavete with chilling ruthlessness.  Daryl Hannah and Brion James are interesting casting choices as the replicants Priss and Leon, and Harrison Ford is Harrison Ford.  The character of Rachel (played by Sean Young) adds intellectual depth to an otherwise pedestrian shoot-'em-up.  Her moment of tragic self-comprehension is the best thing in the film.<br/><br/>     I for one fail to see why this film is slavered over and hailed a cult masterpiece.  The storyline is dull and no character, with the possible exception of Rachel, has any internal life.  The final symbol of mortality is attractive enough, but why was Batty holding a dove in the first place?"

That said, there is sufficient gem quality material here to last a life time.

","This is probably my second favorite science fiction film, after 2001: A Space Oddyssey.<br/><br/>I can see how it may have gotten knocked around critically because it probably went against expectations for Harrison Ford fans, and for sci-fi lovers who prefer the adventure of Star Wars to the introspection of something like this.  It doesn't always seem to try to be ""entertaining"" so much as ""enveloping"" or ""involving.""  Not much ""ride 'em cowboy"" stuff here save a few combative scenes.<br/><br/>But I *was* completely enveloped, and I savored this film even the first time I saw it in the late 1980's (on HBO or something like that.)  I've seen it several times since and I still love it (even with its occasional editing flaws.)  I'll never forget Rutger Hauer's performance, which I think was one of his better ones (or, at least he seemed perfectly suited as the ""Roy Batty"" character.)<br/><br/>Besides the excellent atmosphere, the film handles its premises regarding aspects of being, consciousness, humanity and mortality quite well.  It seeps into your pores as you become involved in the suffocating, oppressive and fascinating landscape.  I think this is what film is for, as opposed to simply reading a book.  It comes across non-verbally as well as verbally.<br/><br/>I really got a lot out of the interactions between Deckard and Rachel.  I also was convinced by Roy Batty's (Rutger Hauer) transformation and his place as the defining throughline of the movie.  Although I don't see why the ""God of Biomechanics,"" Tyrell (Joe Turkel) would have such low security so as to be killed by one of what he must know are potentially dangerous creations of his, I was able to suspend disbelief and was very much affected by all of that and it still haunts me from time to time to this day.  In a way, there is a side to many of us that might wish to ask the same questions of God (if you think he/she/it exists).  ""What a thing it is to meet your maker,"" says Batty.<br/><br/>Appropriately, the most defining scene for me was Batty's monologue near the end: ""..all these moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.""  Hard to believe one could shed tears over science fiction, but I did.  Then again, I'm prone to think about such things, but I'm sure this is what the movie was intended to do.<br/><br/>So, this film carefully treads territory that few sci-fi films have or could. Almost all are either adventures or horror movies.  This was a dramatic and introspective sci-fi film and although the premises have been dealt with before it handled them with great aplomb.  Hey, I like a good adventure like the next person, and I'm a Star Wars fan, too.  But you have to know when to shift gears and evaluate something on its own merits.  Trying to shove this film into some pre-defined sci-fi box just isn't very fair or very insightful practice.  It is a fairly unique effort, and needs to stand alone and apart.<br/><br/>All in all, I thoroughly respect this multilayered, artful, thoughtful and interesting anti-utopian experience.<br/><br/>By the way, the ""director's cut"" is clearly superior to the ""dumbed-down"" original version where the studio thought that everything ought to be ""explained"" to the audience, among other things (like the ""happy ending."") They were probably worried that the average (ticket buying) sci-fi fan would need spoon-feeding for such a langorous and contemplative movie.  Judging by some of the comments here, they might have been right.  But, thankfully, people have come around (maybe the sci-fi fans have grown up?) and we have not only more respect for this film but the director's original vision to enjoy.<br/><br/>I give it 9/10."

Without this story, Bladerunner would still have been a good sci-fi film, but with it, it moves into the realm of philosophy, and commands a much greater impact.<br/><br/>It is basically a story about what it is to be human, and like most good philosophical works asks more questions than it answers. The oft-discussed question of whether Deckard is or is not human himself is, to a degree, irrelevant - the significant point is not _what_ he is, but _who_ he is, and whether his origins matter more than his actions. This question is asked of every major character in the film - Deckard, Batty, and Rachel, and mirrored in many of the minor characters. While we know which characters are biologically Human, which of them are most human-natured is much more ambiguous, and the final question (amongst many others) asked by the film is not 'What are they?'

I have no use for the director's cut, except the satisfaction of curiosity. (It is, after all, a movie adaptation of Philip K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"". Besides, the director's cut lacks Harrison Ford's narrative, which is like the Mona Lisa lacking her smile.)

","It's remarkable how this film, like Kubrick's 2001, seems not to age a bit.

Dick' mastery), an intelligent adaptation, a very original treatment, a great sense of suspense, an extraordinary sobriety contrasting with its imaginary richness, and a luxurious and visionary visual splendor makes this film one of my all-time favorites, in both its versions.<br/><br/>Only one flaw to my sense, and it's a matter of taste: Vangelis' pompous music (I'm allergic).<br/><br/>I wonder sometimes how Scott, who was able to make ""The Duellists"", ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien"", could later on give us crap like ""1492""... Well, since I saw the disappointing ""Mission to mars"", ""The Frighteners"" and ""Alien: resurrection"" from my beloved De Palma, Jackson and Jeunet, I'll have to consider that being a great director can't lead everyone to be Stanley Kubrick in terms of consistency...

","I've owned Blade Runner for quite a while and watched it enough, to be sure. However, I recently read an article about robotics in Wired Magazine that really drilled the point of Blade Runner home: What happens when machines are indistinguishable from human beings?<br/><br/>Blade Runner offers two simple answers: the human emotion element, which is prejudice, fear and surprise; and the artificial intelligence aspect, which is that these robots are SO human that they will stop at nothing to get answers from their creator.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford plays a cop chasing down some renegade ""replicants"" (cyborgs). The dark, futuristic setting blends well with the detective/film noir tone of the film.<br/><br/>And, while in 1982 the average person would not necessarily feel that the scenario presented could happen in his lifetime (at the time it was likely easier to believe that Atari would be taking out huge lighted add space on the sides of buildings), lately Blade Runner has gained a whole new poignancy.<br/><br/>One more thing: Dark City could be considered this film's cousin.

","Great sci-fi movie.... one of the best.  Everybody should see it.   The movie was only confusing to en masse hollywood audiences, where it tested poorly and received a ""happy"" ending (film-lover's bit:  the footage of sweeping hills of grains were lifted from outtakes from the credit sequence of Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"").  And don't believe the all-too-obvious interpretation of the unicorn dream.   There are many layers to this movie. I think most of the extra layers come from the fact that the characters' relationships are never what they appear to be.  Scott manages to surprise the audience a lot, and turn around our notions of what good and evil may be.  But as for this ""see the non-director's version"", forget it.  The dialogue a la 50s noir movie is CHEEZY!  It also gets in the way of the music in several key parts of the movie, early on, where the hokey monologue breaks into what should be simply breathtaking views of LA underscored by Vangelis.<br/><br/>Anyway, great movie, see the director's version, love it, live it, see it more than once before you judge of it.

"jordandw","Null","0","0","29 May 2000"," One of the watershed SF movies
","There are a handful of SF flix that, when they hit the theaters, raised the bar for science fiction in cinema against which all others had to be measured: From the Earth to the Moon, Metropolis, King Kong, The Day the Earth Stood Still, 2001: A Space Odyssey (my vote getter for all time most influential and visionary) and Star Wars (begrudgingly said, but has to be acknowledged).  I certainly count Blade Runner (and Alien, the predecessor Ridley Scott opus that has to be compared and contrasted) among them.<br/><br/>FTETTM gave us science fiction, Metropolis gave us special effects, King Kong gave us a grand scale, TDTESS gave us a conscience, and 2001 gave us mysticism and a vision beyond our world.  Alien gave us one hell of a scare, and Blade Runner gave us alternative art and mystery in so many media.  The marriage of film noir and a bleak and grimy FUTURE was a masterstroke, and, I believe, undeniably changed the look and feel of science fiction in all that followed.<br/><br/>Elsewhere the comment is made how Blade Runner is ""blown away"" by The Matrix.  IMHO, The Matrix is a special effects masterpiece that unfortunately fails in most other respects.  I also contend that The Matrix never would have been made if it weren't for the vision provided by Ridley Scott in BR.<br/><br/>The ability to marry set design with story line has NEVER been demonstrated better than in BR.  The story is so well supported by the setting that it is developed without the need for action or dialog (although both are done superbly).  The bleak emptiness of the human condition is magnificently reflected in the cloying closeness of urban decay contracted with the huge empty living spaces occupied by the Tyrell Corporation and the ruined apartment building of the penultimate scenes.  That the only true longing for life and beauty is evidenced by androids gives the ultimate expression of the effete condition to which mankind has fallen.<br/><br/>Hey folks, this is art.  It ain't pretty, and it ain't what you're used to (or at least what we weren't used to back in '82).  But it is a compelling statement which demands a response.  Ignore it if you think you can, but I guarantee you it was not ignored by the generation of SF cinema storytellers who have followed.<br/><br/>[Not to belabor the point: but has anyone noticed the eerily similar juxtaposition of movies between Kubrick and Scott that is evident.  Kubrick did 2001, A Clockwork Orange, and Barry Lyndon in order, while Scott did The Duellists, Alien and Blade Runner.  Coincidence?  Probably.  But worth a comment, I thought.]"

","Millions of people have seen BladeRunner and all have mixed feelings about it.  Classic or FX mayhem?  Some critics tore it to shreds some lifted it up to God and said, "" Look, Ridley made you a gift!"".<br/><br/>After watching BladeRunner too many times to remember through a love of the movie I have also studied it indepth for a college class, which opened up BladeRunner to me than ever before.  It has underlying meanings in it even if Ridley Scott did not put them there intentionally they are there.  It brings moral questions of can life be ended even if it was man made?  These are questions that are irrelevant to us now concerning synthetic humans but BladeRunner gives us insight to what may come of our world, it shows a bleak and dark world covered in mist, all created by visualist Miede, combined with incredible music by Vangelis, together they combine to show us a world that does not seem too flavorful.  The people that are left on the BladeRunners world are the outcasts, people who are forbidden or cannot afford to go ""Off World"".  In the novel by the great Philip K Dick these people are called Chickenheads.  People aimlesly walking around with no real purpose anymore.<br/><br/>The performances in BladeRunner are excellent, even though there was little friendship between some of the actors and to the director none of it shows on the screen.  For example, Harrison Ford and Sean Young detest each other in life but on screen they have a great chemistry as star crossed lovers. Ford didn`t completely get along with Scott Either.  And still to this day Ford says that this was never his best work but enjoyed it none the less. Possibly this is Rutget Hauers best performance as to date, it took him less than 1 minute to be directly cast as Roy Batty as he walked into interview room clad in a leather coat and ready bleached blond hair.<br/><br/>If you have never seen this movie before you must, but maybe for the less enthusiatic Sci-Fi watcher the general release version would be better with the voice over helping to explain the plot, but for the experienced and open minded watcher should watch the directors cut, the letterbox edition is beautiful  and shows exactly how Scott wanted you to see it. In my eyes it is a true classic, but judge for yourself, and wonder if the haunting world of the BladeRunner is the future of our world.  And for the watchers of the Directors Cut...

","This movie stunned me-- I had to watch it several times, not only to absorb it all, but because it is so disturbing. I don't usually like futuristic themes that are dark and violent, but in this case, the violence has something to say-- although curiously bloody (most of the deaths involve Replicants) it's not gratuitous, but part of an unfolding mystery that shocks you at the end (in the same way that the film ""Sixth Sense"" does). The acting is fantastic, with some great performances by the main characters, including tough Harrison Ford, beautiful Sean Young, and the charismatic Rutger Hauer (who delivers a ""hammy"" performance which is strangely, both entertaining and believable).  The supporting actors are great too.<br/><br/>Many film critics have already gone into depth about the meaning of the over-the-top symbolism. Much of that symbolism enters the right brain, not the left, and you just feel something without knowing why.  I would call that manipulative, but interestingly, the lasting impressions aren't dependent on the imagery, as spectacular as the visuals are.  Even with all the great camera angles and special effects, the experience is more emotional than visual.<br/><br/>To me, the film is about consciousness, and what defines it.  Is it our emotions, our mentality, or some undefined spiritual quality?  And most important, does it have to be organically based?  If consciousness is self-awareness, the ability to understand time, the ability to feel, to learn, the ability to love-- then what if an android, who is more machine than human, has all those qualities... what then?  Is it still murder to kill one?  Is it still okay to use them as slaves? And what about animals?<br/><br/>
The first time I watched this film, at the end, I wanted Harrison Ford's character to go over the edge of the building.  When I watched it a second time, I understood why he did not, and I was shocked.  Believe or not, I did not get it-- the twist-- until the second viewing.  That scene, with Rutger Hauer in the rain, is so profound and sad. Really listen to what his character says... because in the end, when we die, isn't it the sum total of our experiences-- our memories, our feelings-- that makes us who we are? Isn't it the uniqueness of those experiences that makes individual consciousness precious, that makes us define human life as something worth preserving in a moral sense?  Another thought provoking question: is consciousness lost when we die-- for humans, non-humans, and animals?  The film offers so many subtle clues, but you don't have to pick up on any of them to be moved.<br/><br/>This film is incredibly thought provoking, a unique mix of haunting music (Vangelis), dark, smoky visuals, and intricate details. Focus on what the film says, how it makes you feel.  The majority of movies are forgetable-- this one is not."

Pleasure androids that show more loyalty and humanity than any human, robotic engineers that can show love for their creations, and warrior androids that care so much about life that they would risk everything for longevity, and in the end let their hated hunter live just for the sake of life itself, ""More Human Than Human"".

The many interesting characters are portrayed brilliantly by the actors/actresses, especially Hauer in easily his best role and film. The set design is incredible, and this is highlighted by the fact that it still looks convincing today. The Atari advertisements are an unfortunate burden though. Vangelis' music permeates the movie and is a vital ingredient in the capturing of mood, it almost seems the music sets the pace of the story. It's one of the great scores, infinitely better than Chariots of Fire which Vangelis himself described as ''simple music for a simple film''. The score deserves the large mention.<br/><br/>The high level of mystery, style and invention has been untouched since the film was made. Bladerunner is close to a masterpiece, yet, I feel, it needed a few more scenes to clarify Deckards investigative actions, thus allowing the viewer to concentrate more on the more profound elements of the dialogue.<br/><br/>Bladerunner is one of the rare films which transports you to where the film is set, only through the combination of all consistently brilliant elements (direction, set design, acting, visual effects, music etc.) can this be achieved."

The studio bosses wanted a more upbeat ending and thought audiences wouldn't ""get it."" Maybe they were right, but in any case, I thought it was a wonderful atmospheric film about a rather pessimistic, some say realistic, look into the future. The Los Angeles of 2019 is dark and depressing, with requisite technical advances, but a society that is fragmented and marginalized. Ridley Scott is great at affecting these atmospheric moods in his films. With Blade Runner he outdoes himself. Harrison Ford is a sort of bounty hunter of renegade androids, and he must hunt down 4 Replicants at large in LA who have come to seek extended life. The reason I like this one is because it pulls the viewer in to its world, and the characters and performances hold you there. Especially Rutger Hauer who steals the show."

I do have a desire to see them make a 2nd.  I would do something like this. The Heart of the movie (message) wise should revolve around the problem that could comes from Genetic engineering (which WILL be possible in the future).  The Genetic engineering which spawned replicants has been used to enhance the general population.  The degrees of Genetic manipulation has created a Class system.  The Genetic classes have evolved into 4 genetic classes with the Genetic elite taking the position of royalty.  The genetic advancement of each class level has been regulated and monitored.  The Blade Runners of the highest elite class, had the job of hunting down the once rare now destined to be extinct 5th class normal humans. The elite class is vastly stronger, more agile and intelligent then the once normal humans. Only the elite class has the extra abilty none of the other 3 classes has, psycic ability.  A Blade Runner could identifiy normal humans on sight.<br/><br/>My synopsis would go something like this: A genetic elite blade runner(early 30ish female played by  Sandra Bullock or Famke Janssen ect) having seen the elimination of rouge humans from the outer colonies and now home planet,has succumbed to guilt and dispair from her career-long envolvement.  To make amends, she decides to save one of the last remaining ""normal"" humans.

The opening theme is just incredible, and sets the scene perfectly. The rest of the music, especially the Love Theme, are all wonderful, dreamy and add so much to the scenes. The performances are all very good, none more so than Rutger Hauer's, who looks like he's having a lot of fun as the leader of the Replicants. Also, the director's cut is better than the original, as the ending felt like it was just added on to please audiences, whilst Harrison Ford's voice over blocked out some of the excellent music. The new cut is the best version, by far. Blade Runner is quite overwhelming on its first viewing but the more you watch it, the more you get out of it. A classic, and probably the best film of the eighties."

","....at the beginning of this film why did Holden bother to use that gadget when all the replicants were clearly registered on a visual data base as shown in the scene in the police station? And they were actually AT the Tyrell Corporation. Why did Deckard go to all that trouble of getting a blurred, half picture of Zhora off a photo when he could have shown a perfectly clear picture of her off the same data base? And why didn't he just arrest her instead of posing as an investigater from the committee of moral abuses? He knew who she was. How did Roy Batty know Deckards name? They'd never met and Leon was too far away in noisy traffic to hear Deckard talking to his chief after he shot Zhora. Why, if Replicants were illegal on earth by penalty of death was Rachel allowed to wander the streets? Why would Deckard go in alone against two superhuman androids? In real life they'd call a SWAT team, throw in gas cannisters and storm the place. Instead he goes in and gets his arse kicked. Why did Pris run the full length of a room, thus giving Deckard time to get hold of his gun and shoot her? Would America, which fought a bitter civil war over slavery and is so obsessed with personal freedom that it allows it's own citizens to blow each other away with assault rifles; allow a sudden return to slavery of intelligent, lifelike androids? It's all terribly silly.<br/><br/>And this business of Deckard being a replicant. How does that enhance the story? Replicants are illegal on earth, so they're unlikely to let him wander about even BEFORE he quit. And aren't replicants superhuman? Wouldn't he have noticed that hot water doesn't scald him? Daft.<br/><br/>But it all works because of brilliant performances, art design and Ridley Scott's direction. After this you'd think he'd become one of the great auters but instead he ended up making routine fare like 'White Squal' with it's embarrassing court scenes. It always puzzled me that straight after Blade Runner he took the least interesting bit with some dwarfs and made a film around them.<br/><br/>Apparently Ford didn't like the film but I suspect this was because Hauer stole the film from under him with a rivetting performance. It is unusual that the cop was the unsympathetic assassin and it's also unusual for the lead to disappear for a large section of a movie. I think a remake would be pointless as it couldn't top old Rutger's speech on the roof. Scott is said to be a fan of Tarkovsky's Solaris and I see a certain influence. The slow direction with a lot of action happening in real time rather than dictated by rapid cutting and pounding music. This slow pace lulled you into the brutal final confrontation unawares. Also the relationship with Rachel and the meditations on memory were reminiscent of Tarkovsky's film.<br/><br/>I remember when I first saw this at the flicks everyone was taken aback at the brutal head crushing scene and were immediately on edge at what was going to hit them for the rest of the film. We left wondering why it had arrived in the UK so unheralded. Funny how some of the best films make the least money."

","What can be said about Blade Runner that has not been said before? It is, quite simply, the best - not because of special effects or fast paced action scenes, but because it has genuine depth. I own the letterboxed Director's Cut on DVD (my first) and have watched it many times, noticing more every time I see it - everything is open to interpretation and re-evaluation, and the most subtle nuance can put events in an entirely different perspective. The acting is superb, although Rutger Hauer steals the spotlight as Roy, giving a fantastically multifaceted performance. The visuals, acting, sound and music mesh perfectly to make Blade Runner a fantastic and deeply moving experience. If you haven't seen it, get it, NOW! And if you have, see it again anyway.

"artdoag-2","Null","0","0","2 January 2000"," An unappealing, but realistic view of the future.
","The opening sequence of Blade Runner still haunts me every time. The eye, gazed upon the skyline of a futuristic L.A., views erupting fireballs from factories, a hazy, clouded horizon, and structures of cathedral-like architecture. To me, this summarizes the idea of the film: a future where technology has gotten the best of us and our future is muddled with uncertainty. Perhaps we are approaching such a time when images like this will be commonplace.<br/><br/>I saw Blade Runner years ago on television, and I must have been nine or ten. It moved pretty slow, and I figured that because it had Harrison Ford in it, that I was in for a roller coaster ride. Not quite. I was asleep in minutes. However, in 1996 I read a captivating article about it in Entertainment Weekly, and I drove to the mall to get it. Since I love the widescreen format, I purchased that particular version. I pumped it in the VCR and was HYPNOTIZED. The very idea of technology going out of control, like creating artificial beings in our likeness to perform hazardous and undesirable tasks, and having it backfire in our faces was unique. A vision of American society, 37 years hence (from 1982, when the movie was created), with hovercars, architecture having evolved to unreasonable limits, androids working alongside humans, distant space colonies, videophones, with hairstyles, clothes, weapons, and television sets of the 20th century creates a strangely beautiful depiction of where we just might be headed. I apologize for the extremely long sentence! However, the sometimes dated special effects, corny looking cars, the stoic, robotic delivery of some dialogue (""It's too bad she won't live... but then again, who does?"") notwithstanding, this all works in favor of the film. This is why Blade Runner is a noir-ish sci-fi film, like The Matrix and Demolition Man are, that not everyone will enjoy. Is it exciting to watch? Not neccesarily. Will you be glued to the chair, pulse pounding? Probably not. The underlying idea runs much deeper than the average future-based flick (like Freejack!) and correctly earns its cult status.<br/><br/>The soundtrack and score is entrancing, particularly the opening ""eye"" scene and the credits music. You can order it from any music store. It is typical of most Ridley Scott movies to incorporate a memorable, ear pleasing score, like Alien or Legend.<br/><br/>The stark, sad view of 2019, in all likelyhood, may not be what this century will digress into. But it makes a good film!"

"BB-15","10","0","0","5 November 1999"," Blade Runner (Director's Cut), My Favorite Sci-fi Film
","This review is about the Director's Cut version of Blade Runner which is superior to the original release with its muddled narration and fake ending. The Director's Cut transforms a good movie into a great one.<br/><br/>
What are the most popular Sci-fi movies these days, Blade or The Matrix? You notice the trench coats, the dark sets and the hunting for the bad guys plot lines? In many ways these movies are pale imitations of Blade Runner. Movie fans are all excited about virtual reality plots with super intelligent machines. It's all in Blade Runner but in a much more serious way.<br/><br/>
Underneath a classic police manhunt/detective story lies visions of the future from author Phillip K. Dick. The super intelligent future machines will be our slaves not our masters. They will be genetically based, created and sold by huge powerful corporations. The wealthy will live in luxury while most people live in dirty, over populated cities in a polluted environment. These are the basic premises of Blade Runner and frankly I think most people have trouble dealing with it because it is likely to happen. Matrix fans talk about sinister forces being in control of the world. Blade Runner makes it clear who these controllers will be.<br/><br/>And the film goes deeper. To create synthetic human beings the creators must be able to program the ""replicant's"" minds, that is control their reality. What is real or programming? The replicant does not know. It is virtual reality not in the arcade game world of The Matrix. Blade Runner predicts that science will be able to alter memories and thus reality. If a Corporation can alter a replicant's memories why not those of a naturally born human being? This issue is powerfully shown in Harrison Ford's scene at the piano which is covered in family photos, the symbol of memories.<br/><br/>And the film goes deeper still. If ""machines"" are at least as smart as us, have feelings and are self aware, do they not deserve our respect and have rights? The tortured lives of two replicants illustrate this; Roy, the leader of the small slave revolt and Rachel, the pathetic female who does not know what she is and is later emotionally crushed by the truth.<br/><br/>
Blade Runner is more than a collection of ideas or a sharply accurate prediction of the future. It is a technical tour de force. These are the best sets (along with the many costumed extras) I have seen in a movie which truly create another world. The special effects, which are used to make this future more real, are very good. And the ""realism"" continues; How many typical Sci-fi heroes get hurt? In the typical Schwazenegger and now Matrix tradition the hero can get shot at by ten thousand bullets and not get a scratch. Blade Runner rightfully ignores this nonsense. Harrison Ford has to hunt down 3 very dangerous creatures and he gets hurt doing it! What a concept!  <br/><br/>It has been said that science fiction is mostly not about science but about fantasy. Blade Runner ignores this trend. It is very real and is masterfully crafted to create this reality and future. It is a grim prediction and is why this movie has never been a big hit, too much reality probably. I wouldn't have it any other way. Blade Runner is a brilliant film that has the depth to keep me coming back to it again and again."

Besides fantastic direction, cinematography and production design, the story is pretty straight-foreword yet tackles a huge subject. Who has rights? What is life? How do we determine how something is judged to be alive or not? Directors cut is definitely the best version for this.

","In this movie Riddley Scott gives a lesson in futuristic film-noir genre. The first open sequence of the city is breathtaking, the flames, the buildings, specially Tyrell Corporation, all of this, brilliantly conducted by Vangelis soundtrack. To talk about this movie is to talk about the 3 essencial questions that the Human Being asks himself: ""Where do I come from? Where will I go? How long have I got left?"". This gives the movie it's philosofical perspective. The artifial world and the human specie are placed in this movie to show how dangerous it can get to ""play God"". The ""replicants"" are, supposedly, emocionally inexperient, flaw that is only possible to fix by memory implants. The end lines for Rutger Hauer brilliant performance prooves his humanity, perhaps this is the true theme of the movie: humanity, where does it starts, where does it ends, what boundries surround it and defines the human being? ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe"", this is one of the most powerful moments of the entire film, the memories as builders of his emotions, his love for life...where is the boundry? The boundry that separates us from ""replicants"". Maybe life is just a constant quest for answers, those wich would reveal the meaning of life, death and our dawn. ""Blade Runner"" represents all of this brilliantly, and at the same time shows us a future, a dark and destructed future. Harrison Ford is excelent in the part of detective Deckard, a man in search of answers to his own questions, seeking those who threaten the human specie. During the movie he talks severall times about how ""blade runners"" musn't feel anything for the non-humans, but what better diplay of humanity than the one given by Rutger Hauer (Roy)? This is my 2nd favourite Sci-Fi movie of all time, being ""2001, A Space Odyssey"" the first.<br/><br/>

","Director Ridley Scott's list of movies is a catalogue of some of the most visually innovative and emotive films in the Hollywood mainstream. Blade Runner, as one might expect, is no exception. The darkling monolithic near-future vision is comprehensively evoked and consistent.<br/><br/>Performances from the strong cast are immersive and involving. It is the over-riding theme, though, which makes Blade Runner one of my favourite movies ever; that of mortality, lust for life, the transitory nature of one's being, the tragedy of self-awareness and love - it is all so fleeting.<br/><br/>Though the movie tracks Deckard (Harrison Ford) pursuit and progressive execution of a group of rogue replicants (synthetic but fully feeling androids typically used as off-world slaves) that have escaped onto Earth, sympathy rests not with him but with the replicants themselves. Cursed with a three year lifespan and desperately trying to extend it by confronting their makers (the Tyrrell Corporation on Earth), their ebbing life (being hunted or simply expiring), the implicit vigour and understanding of the beauty of living is heart-wrenching. Note that the general release version is entirely different to the Director's Cut and grossly inferior. The Director's Cut does not have the misplaced bright Hollywood ending but rather an entirely different and more profound resolution. Watch it, be washed along with the gravity of the movie's theme and vista, and bear in mind: the life that burns twice as bright burns twice as fast, and Deckard dreams of unicorns."

","For me to comment on how great this film is and why I love it so much would require two sets of hands and another lifetime, which ironically is one of the major themes of ""Blade Runner"".<br/><br/>Let's start by saying it revolutionized sci-fi. What ""Star Wars"" did for the genre ""Blade Runner"" undid. It shows a dirty, ugly future much closer to the one we are approaching than any idealized version of the 21st century. Go to any major city street and it will look a lot more like ""Blade Runner"" Los Angeles than any other cityscape presented in sci-fi.<br/><br/>Rutger Hauer gives the performance of a lifetime as Roy Batty. He is one of the greatest villains the movies have presented, right up there with Hopper in ""Blue Velvet"", Fonda in ""Once Upon a Time in The West"", or Darth Vader. The difference is Roy Batty is a sympathetic character who we as the audience come to realize is not really the bad guy. His intentions are completely understandable, even if the means to his end are not justifiable. His speech at the end of the film is the most memorable moment in the movie.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott, the director, is a genius. That's all I'll say about that.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford comes out of his superhero mode right after ""Raiders"" and ""Empire"" and plays a character he has rarely touched on before or since. Deckard is so unlike the usual Harrison Ford character, but he winds up being one of his best performances (though I'm partial to Indy in ""Raiders"", my other favorite movie). The important thing about Deckard is his sense of morality, or lack there of. You will see a metamorphosis unlike you may have thought Harrison Ford capable of.<br/><br/>Warning: When the movie is over, remember to pick your jaw up off the floor, cause if you have any appreciation of movie genius, that's where your jaw will wind up. The film is breathtaking in it's visual beauty and mind boggling in it's commentary on humanity. I could explain it, but there is not enough time in the world.<br/><br/>Please be sure to pick up the Director's Cut. It is literally a different movie than the one you may have seen prior to 1994. Not only different, but better by leaps and bounds.<br/><br/>If I haven't said it already, I'll say it again: This is my favorite movie and one of the all time greatest!

"Colonel Ted","10","0","0","9 September 1999"," The ultimate vision of the future!
","What can I say about this remarkable and brilliant film that hasn't already been said a million times before? Well, here we go anyway. Blade Runner is ultimate downer when it comes to visions of what the future. So many films have copied its style and imagery of a city drenched in a non-stop rain torrent illuminated by massive neon billboards its inhabitants most beyond redemption. (Terminator, Highlander, Robocop, The Fifth Element, and even Seven, the list is endless). It is ironic then that these films have enjoyed far more commercial success on first release than the film that inspired it. Ridley Scott can then smile that while most of these films, Highlander, Terminator and Robocop especially, have significantly dated, Blade Runner remains as fresh and original as it always was. The special effects, all done with models and matte work too, haven't changed. CGI is uncalled for; air brushing would nothing for a Monet. Ford is superb as Deckard, the embittered cop assigned without much choice to track down 4 rogue replicants. Ford hates the film, partly because he was almost killed in shooting and because he claims he played ""a detective who does no detecting and who just gives focus to Scott's sets"". This is untrue, the plot is compelling as Scott and the scriptwriters, David Peoples and Hampton Fancher transposed a Marlowe case in a dire future. However the plot takes second place to mood and atmosphere. Over the course of two hours we sniff great gulps of a hopeless future and mmmm! It tastes good! The film's countless sub-texts too are more prominent than the plot. The story is littered with clues as whether Deckard is a human or replicant and asks important questions such as who we are, what we're here for. Hauer, too is brilliant as Batty, the desperate replicant leader. It's a tragedy he never found a role that came anywhere close. Supporting players, Young, Sanderson and Hannah are superb to. But its Ridley Scott who takes all the glory. As well from having one of the coolest names in cinema, this is arguable his finest hour. His subtle direction HINTS at all the themes that he covers with no overt moralising and his awe inspiring visual genius and eye for detail was repeated in the brilliant, though criminally underrated 1492: Conquest of Paradise. One is hopeful that his dark vision will be repeated in Gladiator to be released next year."

In that series, Jack Webb, the actor who starred as the long-suffering hero ""Sergeant Joe Friday,"" also narrated the show's action.  There was something very appealing and reassuring about his voice, and Ford, playing a rather different -- yet not so different -- policeman of the future in Blade Runner, brought back the memory of another good-guy cop from another time and place.<br/><br/>Based (albeit somewhat loosely) on Philip Dick's  Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?  Blade Runner also owes some of its wonderful creativity to William S. Burroughs who, if I remember correctly, had some input into the writing of the screenplay.<br/><br/>A film worth every second put into watching it."

","Bladerunner starts out with a breathtaking scene that makes me cringe at the thought of our cities getting that bloated in the future. From this first scene, the whole movie sets up a great atmosphere that is not broken throughout the whole film. I sat enraptured, my eyes not moving from the screen for fear that I would miss something on screen. Okay, well, I admit that the first time I saw this movie I thought it was boring. Well, I was stupid and young. Now that it is out on DVD, I can enjoy it in all its film noir/sci-fi glory. By the way, this review is to the Director's Cut, which is the way it should be seen.<br/><br/>It is 2019 and the technology of replicants has had some unexpected backfires. They look like humans; however, they are physically superior, if not mentally equal. A special police unit of Bladerunners has been created to combat this problem if they ever come to Earth. Deckard (Harrison Ford), is a retired Bladerunner who is brought back to track down and ""retire"" four replicants who sneaked into Earth. As he tracks the lead replicant (Rutger Hauer) and begins a love affair with a female experimental replicant, he begins to acquire clues that show him he may not be who he thinks he is..<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is very good. Any movie with ""the man"" Harrison Ford seems to be good. Most of the emotional qualities of the characters seem flat, but that is what I would expect from the future that they live in. Harrison Ford is great as the Bladerunner Deckard, and Sean Young does well by playing his love interest Rachael. But Rutger Hauer does a really great job as a replicant who is desperate to survive.<br/><br/>Let me just say that the special effects for this movie are really realistic, and they help get the feeling of an overblown gothic 50's city. The rest of the movie really does seem like it is during the post WWII years, but in a science fiction future. This movie is original and has the same qualities that make movies like The Matrix great. Any lover of science fiction should like this movie, but I know that it is not everyone's cup of tea. It is violent and it is slow moving, but it is beautifully shot, each scene done with care. I recommend it, and it is one of my favorite science fiction movies. Make sure you see the director's cut, and not the other one, with the dumb producer/Hollywood movie ending.<br/><br/>****1/2 stars (out of *****)."
"Chronus","10","0","0","20 August 1999"," Do today´s directors dream of making a masterpiece like this?
","Yes, they do. A science-fiction writer-critic once complained that Blade Runner is one of the most over-rated movies, arguing that it quite doesn´t live up to the book written by Philip K. Dick. Well, yes, it´s not as complex as the book itself, but I beg to differ. Blade Runner is one of the most UNDER-RATED movies ever. Only science-fiction fans talk about it, thus the movie is looked upon with arrogance by other genre´s fans and critics.<br/><br/>Blade Runner tries, -and accomplishes it-, to be sober, realistic and ironic. Mixing action with calm, steady exposition, it brings the viewer the full view of a post-apocalyptic society, ranging from the high classes to the street level lives of some characters.<br/><br/>You get slowly into the movie, experiencing a strange and cold environment, full of hightech gadgets (TV scanners, Videophones, hover-cars, androids, artificial animals, lie-emotion detectors, etc), and watch a detective-mistery-action-love story develop under a very firm and knowledgeable hand (Ridley Scott´s). The mistery and menace portraid by the androids (one of the focus of the film) remains throughout, gripping the viewer until the very end.<br/><br/>The characters are well developed, the plot is complex and has interesting twists. Sometimes you want the detective to finish his job in a determined way, eliminating the cold threats he has in front; at other times, you can´t help but feel strangely sad as the detective becomes the predator against the threat (namely, against the first android woman, as she runs for her life).<br/><br/>The action may be a little slow, but one knows that when something out of the ordinary flow of events happens, then the screen becomes the place for something thrilling. Whatever happens, Blade Runner never gets too violent; it portrays a possible reality. Having many layers of plot and great depth only emphasizes the greatness of this movie, rendering it realistic, dense and thought-provoking. Emphasis is given to the universal quest of finding out who we are, and when does reality, -life-, terminate.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, from a ""I´m forced to do this"" attitude by Harrison Ford, to the ultra-sophistication of Sean Young. Rugter Hauer has one of his best performances ever, in this movie.<br/><br/>The visual effects are good, even by today´s standards, making certain that the movie stays within ""realism"" boundaries.<br/><br/>It´s an intriguing, hypnotic movie. It does not offend the book, albeit being different from it. It´s worth seeing again and again, and, if you think of all the sequels happening with some movies (not referring to Star Wars, of course), well worth some kind of continuation (meaning, of course, sequel...). But I doubt this will ever happen. Maybe it´s best this way, who knows? Anyway, this movie is part of my big and wonderful movies constelation: Star Wars, Alien, Dark City, The Matrix. And for me, that´s all, folks!"

"hellcat","10","0","0","18 August 1999"," The Greatest Film Of All Time!!
","I believe that Blade Runner is easily the best film ever made. It was originally a novel called ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" written by Phillp K. Dick in 1968. Blade Runner was released theatrically in 1982, it only made around $31 Million, and costed more then $39 to make. After all those years, Blade Runner the directors cut was released in 1992. Blade Runner eventually became a sci-fi classic after all that time, and is still not reconized by many people. Upon multiple viewings Blade Runner has proven to be the biggest sci-fi acheivement in Sci-Fi history of this century. Ridley Scott is was the genius behind this film, for once I actually liked a movie better then it's novel. The novel ""DaDoES"" was also great, but it was very different from the movie, it takes place in a different time, 2021 AD to be exact. Every moment in this film is just great, the speech was brilliant. The acting was superb, especailly Ruther Hauer, who did an outstanding job. Lots of other sci-fi films come close, such as 2001, Alien, Ghost In The Shell, Akira, Metropolis, Star Wars, The Matrix, but Blade Runner has proven to the best. Here's why I think Blade Runner is the best film ever made.<br/><br/>First off, the set designs we're great! Syd Mead is genius to come up with such amazing ideas. Ridley Scott's world just looks brillant! I guess Ridley Scott wanted to show how the world will look in 2019. He made it look great, it looks great to us, but to the people there, it wouldn't be so great after all. The movie is generally dark and has a spooky atmosphere to it. The backgrounds we're very nicely done, not only the background, hell the people even looked great in the backgrounds! We get to see a few scenes where we can see very strange types of people walking around the rainy metropolis, a good example is the one where Deckard is chasing Zhora and jumpiong from building to building, car to car. This can't be seen in too many other movies, actually this was the first time it was ever shown. I was so amazed by the set designs and cinematography, I couldn't believe it was made in 1982. First time I saw this movie I was only 11 (im 15 at the moment), and I wasn't watching it carefully, I was more paying attention to the backgrounds. I was so amazed and dazzled at how great they looked, especially at scene in the Tyrell Building. The spinner scenes also looked amazing, the spinners looked *really* real, except you could tell that they we're computer generated at part where Gaff and Deckard are going to the Tyrell Corporation. Another great example was the scene when Leon and Batty are about the enter Chew's Eye Works, notice the background, and the how those oriental people come riding on there bikes, I found that pretty cool. The scene where Gaff and Deckard are going to the Police Headquarters was one of the best! The effects looked so real, and to top it off, it had great music. Animod Row looked great, lots of strange people in the backgrounds as well. The Tyrell Building was looked so cool, I could almost swear it was real. I've never seen such great Cinematography and Set Designs, and I don't suppose I ever will, until there is a Blade Runner 2.<br/><br/>The music used in Blade Runner was easily the best I've heard in a movie. I don't know where to begin telling you how great it was. Every scene in Blade Runner just had amazing music, and it wasn't the same one used over and over (aka. Star Wars, Ghost In The Shell). The intro track is really good, it gives Los Angeles 2019 a great feel, it's also used in the scene where Deckard and Gaff are going to the Tyrell Corporation. Then the music in the scene where Deckard and Gaff fly to the Police Headquarters is amazing! It's less then two mins. but still it was *really* good. Another good track was Blade Runner Blues, which was used in the scene where Pris first comes in the movie, that's probably the best music though out the movie. Memories of Green was really really good!! It was used at the scene where Deckard picks up Rachael's picture that she throws on the floor after finding out that she is a replicant herself. I enjoyed the track Love Theme which was played in Deckard's apartment after Leon attacks Deckard in the ally. End Titles was just amazing, it was the track played at the end of the movie, during the credits. I also enjoyed On Trail of A Nexus 6, which plays in the background when Deckard is chasing Leon. A track that didn't make it to the cd, was the one which plays when Deckard is about to perform a Voight-Kampff test on Rachael, that's too bad since that music sounded great.<br/><br/>The character in Blade Runner were really well put together, I don't care what anyone says. Harrison Ford played Rick Deckard, the main character of the movie. His character was great! His acting was superb, his face expressions we're really good. Deckard was shown to be a not-so-great man overall. His wife and child had even left him, but those we're just his memories if he was a replicant, which I believe he was. Ruther Hauer was easily the best actor of the film. Not did he only do a good job of acting, he looked pretty damned cool, especially at the scene at Chew's Eye Works. He played Roy Batty, one of the escaped Replicants lurking the streets of LA 2019. He did an academy winning performance, from the start of the movie, all the way to the end. His end line was just amazing, I don't know anyone else who could have played a better Roy Batty. Sean Young who played Rachael, did a damn good job. Her acting was great, and she always didn't seem human at times, I don't know how they did that. The rest of the cast did a great job, Edward James Olmos who played Gaff did an outstanding job, he didn't have much lines, but still he was just great in that role. Joe Turkel who played Eldon Tyrell did a real good job, who was shown like he was pratically playing god. Brion James who played Leon, didn't really have a big part of the film, but he did great. He did a good job at the start of the movie where Holden is questioning him, he acting like he was confused, and it was brillant. William Sanderson played J.F Sebastian, who did an alright job of acting though out the movie, could have been better, but some parts of his were great, especially the scene where he says that his glands grow old too fast. Robert Okazak who passed away a few years ago played the sushi master at the resturant at the start of the movie, for some reason I found him to be one of the greatest actors in the movie, espeically when he said that wonderful line ""He Say Your Brade Runna"", that was just amazing acting. The rest of the cast who had minor roles did a good/excellent job of acting, which isn't seen too often in Sci-Fi movies (aka. The 13th Floor, Total Recall, Star Wars).<br/><br/>I found Blade Runner to be the most amazing movie ever made. Almost everything about it was perfect, except for the few flaws. Even today's effects can't match Blade Runner's, no not even Star Wars, sure they look more ""cool"", but do they look real? Hellno. Similar backgrounds from Blade Runner are used in many Sci-Fi movies and shows around these days (aka. Akira, Total Recall 2070), but they will never match Blade Runner. Ridley Scott and Syd Mead did something which no one else can ever replica. Blade Runner was nominated for best special effects, but didn't win, but it went on to win 3 UK Academy Awards. Blade Runner was also mentioned at the 1999 Academy's when they were showing the best films, it showed a spinner fly by LA 2019. I can't wait to see the sequel if there is one, which there should be around 2002, if they are making one. Blade Runner has the deepest impact ever, and it's easily the best motion picture ever made, an excellent work of art."

","Blade runner is a classic of sci-fi for sure.<br/><br/>First of all, the story is damn cool.  In a near future, there are robots called Replicants that are illegal on Earth and there are those Blade runners who are trying to track them and kill them for money.  In the movie, Harrison Ford is an ancient blade runner who's being forced by his ex-boss to investigate about a small group of fugitives replicants.<br/><br/>Now, the great things about the movie are the realisator's job and the music.  Scott created a cool work who always seems dark and it's always raining...  The music score by Vangelis is fantastic: it's hard to imagine any other music for this music.<br/><br/>Another thing is that this movie doesn't gets old.  What I mean is that there are not a lot of special effects like lasers.  So this movie could actually have been made just a few years ago. But the movie is a bit slow and almost poetic in some scenes... Anyway, if you like sci-fi and detective stuff, you should love this flick.<br/><br/>I give it a 9/10"
"dennis-77","Null","0","0","16 August 1999"," Wow!!
","I first saw this on the recommendation of my Uncle who is always saying you should watch this that or another film.  This one I thank him for.  Ridley Scott might not have meant it but he has created a brilliant film about humanity, life, love and friendship.  Because everyone had told me the replicants were the bad guys I kept a special eye on them and in the beginning you can see that while Pris and Batty's time was up the other two still had two years.  They came out of friendship and the same with J F Sebastian.  Like everyone else I have to say this is a great film and the acting is brilliant especially the Replicants, wether or not thins extends to Harrison Ford is something that has to be puzzled over.  Rutger Hauer is fantastic in this and I am never going to forget the scene on the roof."
"Jaime N. Christley","Null","0","0","15 August 1999"," Good to look at, not much fun
","The staggering cult popularity of this film, even seventeen years after its release, is easy to understand.  It's a visual masterpiece, a film with a look all its own (most sci-fi fans prefer this to ""Dark City"").  It has a plentitude of theological and philosophical subtexts, so fans can wax literate about all the ""meaning"" that it has.  It's ""2001"" for action fans.<br/><br/>The plot (skip to the next paragraph if you don't want spoilers) goes like this:  synthetic people called replicants, stationed on the ""off-world,"" are upset with their second-banana position in society and their limited life spans (apparently they were becoming too human), and rebel.  They kill a bunch of their human supervisors -- by the way, all this happens before the story begins -- and head to L.A. to meet their maker (get it?), to ask him to extend their life spans past four years.  Rick Deckard (sourpuss Harrison Ford), once a champion hunter of replicants, is called back from his retirement to go out and take them down.  Along the way he falls in love with a replicant named Rachel (Sean Young -- one of the rebels?  we're never really told), but still pursues his quarry.  In the end he kills all but one replicant (Rutger Hauer, who's very good here).  That replicant has killed the orignal replicant designer, but saves Deckard's life.  After this, he (the replicant) expires and shuts down.  Deckard returns to his apartment to see if Rachel is still alive.  The ambiguous ending tells us that the couple may or may not be hunted by Gaff (Edward James Olmos, playing the Claude Rains role).<br/><br/>For those who find the Greater Meanings to messy, inconsistent, disorganized and overcooked (like me) can still enjoy those primo visuals, and maybe even the Vangelis score, but they probably won't have much fun otherwise. There isn't much in the way of action sequences, though Ridley Scott does include plenty of shooting, bone breaking, skull crushing and eye gouging, and the story is pretty illogical (part of that can be blamed on the altering of some of Philip K. Dick's original ideas).  Even for those people, however, ""Blade Runner"" definitely remains worth a look."
"peter-209","10","0","0","6 August 1999"," a powerful positive message
","I like it when an artist has enough skill, knowledge and power to create a world. A world that is connected with that of ours by occasional worm-hole links, but otherwise is fully independent - with its own history, logic, technology, psychology, ethics, and esthetics, all described in minute details. Borges, Dick and Lem come to the mind as examples... and now, Ridley Scott.<br/><br/>Despite the outlandishness of the Blade Runner's world, there is one very strong link that connects it to our world, and it is its humanity. With all its violence and horror, the end of the film transmits a powerful positive message: we only can attain freedom through compassion and understanding.<br/><br/>Together with 2001:Space Odyssey, I consider this THE best science-fiction film and one of the best films, period."
"LF-3","10","0","0","4 August 1999"," I've seen things you wouldn't believe
","Blade Runner persists, 17 years on, as the shining example of all that a sci-fi film could be. Taking the example of the better sci-fi written material (personally I thought that ""Do androids dream..."" was OK but not special) the basic storyline is not science dependent; it could be the tale of (for example) someone hunting runaway slaves in colonial america.<br/><br/>The film excels in three ways:<br/><br/>Firstly, the Imagery is absolutely superb. The scene where Deckhard flies into the police headquarters has a sense of Odyssey, a feel of a visionary perspective into a possible future, that makes the film not just an audio-visual experience, but a true journey of discovery into a very different world.<br/><br/>Secondly, the (Vangelis) soundtrack is incredible. Words fail to express the quality of the soundtrack, which beautifully adds to the ""immenseness"" of the visuals. When the film shows you a ""big"" scene, the music also touches you with a sense of the emotions underlying the scene; it doesn't let you avoid it.<br/><br/>Finally, the acting is great. Neither Harrison Ford nor Rutger Hauer ever portrayed parts with such sincerity of character."

Be forewarned that the movie is long (director's cut, 117 mins), so you must watch and listen to this movie. But it's worth it. The directors cut is the one to see, as well. The voice over in the theatrical release is unnecesary and the ""happy ending"" that the studio had tacked on has been cut. Also there is the odd question raised on the  back of the movie cover that Deckard may himself be a replicant. Something to do with the unicorn dream. As for the performances, all the actors are excellent, especially Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer who incidentally is grossly under-rated as an actor. The man is great in Blade Runner. Also the Vangelis soundtrack is strangely compelling. Once you hear it, you want to own it. If you only buy one movie, ever in your lifetime, buy Blade Runner. It's infinitely watchable."

Is it ethical to have them murdered when they rebel? But these questions are never addressed.

Add to that the most anti-climactic ending in existence and you've got a real ""Wha?"" film. OK, so it's not what I was expecting. Well, the whole style of the movie - the music, the setting, the characters - everything oozes film noir. If you expect that, I guess you won't be too disappointed. But do you get sixty minutes of atmospheric shots spliced in between twenty five minutes of conversation that seems to leading up to something (but surprise! never does) and five minutes of two confusing fight scenes. I'll give Blade Runner credit, though: the setting is visionary, convincing and appropriately claustrophobic. I had no problem getting absorbed into the retro sci-fi setting, but maybe that's just me. The acting is just good as well, but Harrison Ford's narration is dry and robotic for some reason. Seems out of place in a film where he acts perfectly fine everywhere else. But the bottom line is this film toys with your mind. It makes you think each event is leading up to something when nothing ever does. <br/><br/>******SPOILER ALERT****** And the scene in the apartment? Is Ford trying to rape the female replicant? It's really hard to understand what's going on there. He gets hot over her, tries to make a move, she tries to escape, he stops her and makes her say she wants it. And at the end of the movie they ride off in the sunset like lovers. Strange behavior for a hero character, I must say. ******SPOILER ALERT END******<br/><br/>Well, that's it.

Special effects, flying machines, settings, weird little creatures and aliens were totally stolen from the original Star Wars. There was a pretty good story in there but it was hard to sift through all the annoying distractions to get to it. Rutger Hauer was the only actor who projected any kind of meaning into his character. Of course, there's always the possibility that was part of the director's intent.

I must say that I really didn't feel any sympathy for the replicants, I felt the idea that Harrisson Ford's character might be a replicant was way underdeveloped, and the fact that they just let him keep the replicant in the end didn't make sense. I thought this film in general, and Harrison Ford's character in particular, as just not going anywhere. Some people say that it is a bleak insight to the future, but in that case, can't you give us a little insight into the characters of the replicants, instead of making them all typecast?

They simply try too hard to make the movie 'look ' futuristic, and fail miserably. The effects were poor, obviously, as a person spoiled by the effects to be found in movies nowadays. The fights are poorly choreographed, with more emphasis on the witty quips and dialogue instead of the fight going on.<br/><br/>The acting is also very poor. The dialogue is very unstable, the conversations between two characters feeling like both have a bad stuttering problem. I have seen Harrison Ford make good movies, and this is not one of them.

","This is a review of the DIRECTOR'S CUT or EXTENDED CUT of this film. I have not seen the theatrical release.<br/><br/>Let me first say, I REALLY wanted to like this movie. I love films that take time to build mood and atmosphere, I love the ""cyberpunk"" setting (which I understand this film was a pioneer of in many respects, so to that, I give it credit), and I love films that aren't afraid to dive into deeper philosophical waters. So why did I walk away so bitterly disappointed?<br/><br/>The film starts out promising - the world that serves as the backdrop for this story is beautifully crafted and visually stunning, and the soundtrack only adds to its shadowy intrigue. We are introduced to Replicants, A.I. that are essentially on par with humans as far as intelligence and appearance, as well as the Blade Runners that hunt them when they ""go rogue"". We are also introduced to the film's most interesting character, Rachel, a Replicant who has had false memories programmed into her and believes herself to be human. Unfortunately, although Rachel and Deckard's interactions comprise the most interesting parts of the movie, they take up very little screen time.<br/><br/>INSTEAD, the film follows Deckard around as he orders food, looks disgruntled while sitting in a bar, questions people, and finally tracks down four different rogue replicants. This is where I realized the film wasn't going anywhere: there's a shortage of compelling or realistic characters. Each character in this film felt either uninspired or REALLY hammy. The first replicant Deckard finds is posing as an exotic dancer (got to keep your audience's attention somehow, right?) and after a brief chase is shot down. It's a scene that I'm sure was supposed to make me question Deckard's morality as well as the humanity of replicants, but because I was so uninvested in both of the characters I really didn't care and found the whole scene as a gimmicky attempt to try to elicit audience emotion.<br/><br/>Another replicant who is equally uninteresting runs around with all the nuance of a WWE performer until he's prompty shot, while the other two replicants who take up much of the remaining screen time are god-awful. There's a former hooker android who convinces a Tyrell employee to take her home and then proceeds to dress up like a coked out David Bowie who got lost in a Hot Topic. Of course, the house she hides in is littered with ""creepy"" dolls and clown robots - there's even robots dressed up as militarized clowns who welcome them at the door. It felt like a really uninspired and silly attempt to try to create something unsettling or distinct. The hooker goth replicant eventually changes up her style and dresses up like a doll to try to trick Deckard (who could have seen THAT coming?!) and then backflips around the room like a lunatic before she's unceremonious shot a bunch of times. It was hilarious.<br/><br/>The final replicant felt like a waste. His story has so much potential - an android who's trying to locate his creator in order to override his cruelly truncated lifespan - but NOPE, forget subtlety, lets dress him like a 40-year-old who's trying out for an Alternative Rock band and have him deliver his lines like a caricature of a Hollywood villain. The ending was laughably bad. The replicant is running around like a melodramatic weirdo, chasing Deckard around, shoving his head through walls with no purpose other than to deliver ridiculous dialogue, jumping around the rooftop in just a pair of jean-shorts- and it all culminates in the laziest attempt at symbolism I've seen in a long time: he literally shoves a nail through one hand and grabs a wild dove in the other, then proceeds to run around like that (yes, dove in hand like a g-dd-amm werido) for the last 5 minutes of his scenes until he dies. Yup. SO LONG, DOVE WIELDING ROOF-JUMPING EYELINER GUY, YOU'VE BEEN GREAT.<br/><br/>Overall I was really disappointed. I felt like this movie had an amazing premise and source material to draw from, fantastic visuals, lighting, soundtrack, etc, - but BOY did they miss the mark with what actually mattered. Maybe I would have gotten more out of it if I had watched it 10, maybe 15 years ago when the idea of A.I. consciousness was a lot more novel, but unfortunately, I doubt even that would have saved it. What a bummer."

","I'm in 2 minds about this movie. Firstly, it is visually stunning. The detail, the grit, the imagination of this film are all brilliant. I watched this movie for the first time in 2017, and watching it through modern eyes, I can say that the visual image of this movie has not aged. It still looks like a movie that could've been made today.<br/><br/>I love the universe. I think its a great setting for some great story telling, and there could be so many more stories told in this universe. The context of the movie is great. A lawman, who hunts robots who looks like humans. I think this movie could've quite possibly influenced one of my all time favourite movies, The Terminator. <br/><br/>The problem I have with this movie though, is in the story-telling. As great and imaginative as the universe and the context are, it was just a poorly written story. I get that it was 1982, and the version I watched was the Directors Cut, not the theatrical release, but even the 70s had well told stories. The movie started out strong, with Harrison being given a mission, and explaining how the test works. But about 25 minutes into the movie, it just gets really boring, and doesn't really pick up again until the last 25 minutes. Sure, there are some moments in the movie that make you sit up and pay attention again, like that weird guy who makes his ""friends"", and the part where Harrison Ford rapes a robot, and it falls in love with him, while looking oddly like he just drown, then came back life, with his blue lips and a wincing looking on his face.<br/><br/>Over all, I don't think its a bad movie, it just has a boring story. I could watch it again, and maybe next time I'll watch the theatrical release, to see if some of the bullsh*t is cut out. I'm now looking forward to the remake, and hope it stays true to this universe, just with a better story."
"SquigglyCrunch","7","3","8","22 March 2017"," The World it Builds is Timeless, but the Script Sure as Heck Ain't
","Blade Runner is set in a futuristic world where robots have advanced to the point of being almost identical to humans. When they decided to act against humans, people called blade runners were hired to hunt down and destroy them. Rick Deckard, a former blade runner, is called back into action to take down a few robots before they can kill anyone else. <br/><br/>The movie manages to pull off some fantastic practical effects. Everything looks real and unique, reason being it is. And it's awesome. I've always loved practical effects more than CGI, and here is no exception. <br/><br/>The set designs are fantastic too. The world the movie builds looks great and feels authentic to an extent. It's immersive and interesting, and it's one I can't wait to continue to explore in Blade Runner 2049. <br/><br/>Other than those technicalities, this movie sucks. For starters, the writing is terrible. The dialogue is generic and uninteresting, and the characters are the same. The first hour of the movie is consumed by literally nothing. I don't remember a single thing that happened. Deckard wasn't even looking for the robots, he was just kind of wandering around while the robots did the same. Then the last hour is just a rushed, forced, jumbled mess where so little intrigues that it almost gets boring. And to top it off, two characters end up in a relationship that is built around intimidation and two meet- ups, whereupon by the end we as the audience are expected to believe that they are in love. It just doesn't make sense. <br/><br/>The climax is particularly bad. It seems to resemble Japanese anime in how completely weird and nonsensical it is. We've all seen it, live action anime doesn't work. 9/10 times anyway, and here isn't an exception. And even when it reaches it's end, there's no tension, no excitement, nothing. In fact, the movie becomes incredibly boring, and every second couldn't be longer. <br/><br/>As a whole the movie is just super generic. The way in which Deckard ends up in this job is generic, the romantic aspect is generic. There's nothing new here. <br/><br/>Overall Blade Runner is a huge disappointment. Sure, it looked pretty, but the first hour is literally nothing, the writing is uninteresting and the movie as a whole proves to be the same. I'm pretty sure there was even a plot hole in there, but maybe that was lost in the lack of anything in the first half. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie."
"Tss5078","4","3","8","26 September 2015"," The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
","Blade Runner is widely considered to be the best Science Fiction movie ever made. It is on almost every top 100 list, and that's why I am reviewing it. To tell you why it is one of the most overrated films of all time. Science Fiction is my favorite genre, and the author of Blade Runner, Philip K. Dick is one of my favorite authors, but Blade Runner is far from his best work. I would go as far as saying that Blade Runner isn't even in his top ten, and if it wasn't for Ridley Scott, it wouldn't have been the first film adaptation of Dick's work. At the time, the special effects were innovative and exciting, but they fail to live up to today's standards. With that being said, all that's left over is a simple story that follows a futuristic police chase and a very cheesy, awkward, love story. In a futuristic Los Angeles, android technology has been perfected. These replicants are used for labor an odd jobs, but occasionally, they become aware and try to run for their freedom. That is when the blade runners are called in to eliminate them. The best Blade Runner around is Deckard (Harrison Ford), a man who doesn't love his job, but always gives one hundred and ten percent. After three replicants escape from the moon, Deckard is called in to track them down and this is the whole premise of the movie. There isn't much of a side story and the rare breaks in the action, rarely prove to be substantive. The film is just you're typical chase with some very weird elements. For example, why does Rutger Hauer take off all his cloths before he fights Harrison Ford, and for that matter, what the hell is he talking about the whole time? How about the talking toys, can you tell me they weren't just a bit creepy and out of character for the rest of the film? Finally, we're in Los Angeles, why is everything Chinese? The story is just a very strange chase through a futuristic nightmare scenario for Los Angeles. Yes, Harrison Ford was terrific, and yes, it must of been the hardest thing Ridley Scott ever had to direct, but the film and story itself are very simplistic and certainly not worthy of legendary status. I love Philip K. Dick and I am obsessed with Science Fiction, but watching Blade Runner for the third time, I was still just as bored and confused as I was the other two times I saw it. How can anything that makes a person feel that way be considered legendary?"
"avik-basu1889","10","3","8","7 August 2015"," A definitive work of art in the genre of Science Fiction !!!
","This review is for the 'Final Cut' version of 'Blade Runner'.<br/><br/>Science Fiction can never be just about cool gadgets, big spaceships, flying cars, laser swords, weird creatures, etc. Science Fiction works the best when it deals with profound issues and themes that are relevant in the current world and society. Science Fiction should be about analysing theories and philosophies, maybe in a futuristic or other-worldly environment, and in my opinion, 'Blade Runner' is second to none in epitomising every aspect of deep Science Fiction that I have mentioned.<br/><br/>The film is loosely based on a novel written by Philip K. Dick named 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'. The screenplay was written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, of course in collaboration with the master filmmaker Ridley Scott who directed this film. It is set in the Los Angeles of 2019. This dystopian,futuristic L.A. is almost disturbingly dark, bleak, overpopulated and there is distinct contrast between the world of the haves and the world of the have- nots. The rich upper class reside in giant skyscrapers, while the lower to the lower-middle class live in dirty living conditions in the rumbling, overpopulated streets. We are told that Replicants were robots created by human beings. The Nexus 6 model of Replicants look like humans and are stronger and equally intelligent as the scientists who created them. But the only thing that they are supposed to look is emotion and empathy for others. These Replicants were used for slave labor, mainly to acquire Off-world territories for expansion. But the Replicants revolted and the they were subsequently deemed illegal and officers by the name of Blade Runners were employed to not execute, but 'retire' them.<br/><br/>'Blade Runner' is one of the most thematically deep films I have ever seen. There are a whole array of ideas that are explored in the film. I think the primary theme running through the film is the quest for your own identity. Most of us are assigned this identity by society and we are supposed to look, act and talk in a manner which will be deemed appropriate for our identity. But in reality we spend our entire lives searching for our true identity as a person to give our lives a meaning. In a very similar way, in the world of Blade Runner, Replicants who were created by humans are rejected and deemed illegal when they revolt and demand human treatment instead of slave treatment as in the eyes of society, they are not humans. So, there is also clearly an element of equality or the lack of it which is explored in the script along with the existence of discrimination based on someone's identity in the society as a whole. The film deals with existential issues about what it means to be human. The Replicants are supposed to be devoid of emotions, which is the one thing that sets them apart from human beings, but ironically we see human beings show very little empathy during the film while the Replicants display genuine love and care for each other. The film can also be seen from a standpoint of religion. The relationship between the Replicants and their human creators can be seen as an allegory for the relationship between Man and God. Some people have certain expectations from God, the creator and when these expectations don't get met, they gradually stray away from God and abandon him/her. Death plays a huge part to underline the allegorical element. <br/><br/>The production design is absolutely fantastic. Ridley Scott along with his collaborators gives us a living, breathing, bustling version of Scott's almost noir-ish vision of futuristic world. The attention to detail is so convincing that the viewer will feel like a part of the world depicted in the film. Ridley Scott's direction makes the world and the characters completely believable and his style always prevents 'Blade Runner' from becoming a commercial action film. The relationship between Deckard the Blade Runner played by Harrison Ford and the city reminded me of Travis Bickle's relationship with the city of New York. The New York in 'Taxi Driver' and the futuristic L.A. in 'Blade Runner' are both dark, dirty and dangerous, but still, they have a strange seductive beauty about them. Deckard, like Bickle wanders around the streets (as a Blade Runner trying to catch Replicants) and then wallows in his solitude and loneliness in the confines of his home. This is one of Harrison Ford's best performances. I think so because Deckard is a far more complex character than the characters which are more famous like Han Solo or Indiana Jones. This is because Deckard is not a stereotypical handsome, bad-ass who cracks witty one-liners and exudes machismo. This man is someone who is struggling with his identity and his loneliness and in a way the whole film revolves around this character's arc. The story moves ahead with Deckard's self realisations and changes in his opinions and Ford comes up with an understated and nuanced performance. Rutger Hauer's performance as the Replicant Roy Batty is just amazing. Instead of being a standard villain, the brilliant writing allows Roy to be more than a villain, as his motivations and opinions are very understandable and relateable. Hauer's perfect gestures and line delivery makes his character layered and worthy of empathy. Sean Young as Rachael also is great. Her performance is controlled and she beautifully adjusts her acting with the gradual psychological changes that her character undergoes. <br/><br/>'Blade Runner' is an existential masterpiece set in a dystopian future which never backs away from tackling very profound themes and issues. The characters are all real and the world instead of being comic bookish, is very symbolic and allegorical. Blade Runner is also one of the most influential films ever and it is deemed to be one of the few works of art which pioneered the birth of the genre of Cyberpunk. Every film lover should watch this film."
"abcdefghmnzx-352-513890","5","3","8","24 April 2012"," Little disappointed after all these years.
","This film has lost its touch. Perhaps that's why don't watch old films.<br/><br/>Blade Runner was a big disappointment for me. The film is indeed a huge fan base and is celebrated as a cult film. I personally find him long winded and the story does not really offer much. I had the whole film the feeling that the story actually has very good ideas, but they are not performed consistently enough. The only character you can really open up the Blade Runner, played by Harrison Ford Much more interesting, a more detailed representation of the android had been leader of the Rutger Hauer darstellt.Diese perspective is IMHO the film is far too short. Ridley Scott's terms of visual appearance, however, what a masterpiece succeeded. The dark sci fi landscapes, which he created for this film still influence the look of films like ""The 5th Element"", ""Judge Dredd"", ""AI"" and much more.!"
"rkj-3","5","3","8","15 December 2008"," Beautiful - but very overrated movie
","Maybe i have just not seen this movie enough times (as many reviewers here suggest one should do) to appreciate it. I saw it for the first time around 1988 on VHS and thought it was a boring story. And I was slightly surprised  since I had thought it to be a completely different kind of movie. More action to be precise. And there is a good reason for that. The title ""Blade Runner""  It just don't sound like a ""deep"" and ""philosophical"" movie. Secondly, the poster looks like it's a fast action movie  with Deckard looking alert holding his gun up. 20 years later the final cut is released and I must say that this last version is beautiful. The flyovers and panorama views through the film are astounding, taking to account it was made in 1982. And there is still that ever present feeling of emptiness. But still those are nearly the only things i like about it. The acting is too cartoonish. The replicants look so robot-like that a device for detecting them seems unnecessary. Then there are several examples of things that are changed to look futuristic - like the neon umbrellas. They look so ridiculous it makes my toes curl. Plastic coats (seems like a bad idea in a humid environment like that) etc. etc. The pace of the story is mostly so dragging slow. And that is not because we need to admire the settings, no the story is just not good enough for a full movie. Deckard needs to find 4 replicants and kill them. That he does, one at a time, without any interesting storytelling. He falls in love with a (girl) replicant. And then it ends. It is just too simple to be interesting. This movie tries to be both a thriller and a philosophical sci-fi movie .. and that is the key to why I don't like it. It just doesn't work."
"mercuryix-1","6","3","8","15 January 2008"," The Best of the Almost Great Movies
","There are so many comments regarding this movie that I doubt anything I write will be seen as relevant. Obviously it's affected a lot of people, because of all the comments here. I saw this movie when it first came out, then I saw it again when they thankfully removed Harrison Ford's voiceovers from it (which he himself didn't think was appropriate for the film.) This film has apparently been re-edited several times, but no matter how many times they do, it will never be completely satisfying. What it needed was one more rewrite at the beginning, with development of one tiny element: the characters. <br/><br/>We don't care about the replicants enough; because we don't know enough about them. We don't care about Harrison Ford's character enough, because he kills too soullessly, ""just doing his job"", and doesn't give it a second thought. Which brings me to the movie's biggest deficit: He has no character arc. He doesn't grow or change throughout the movie. Phillip K. Dick mentioned in a rare interview I'm glad I got to read, that he intended the replicants and the character of Deckard to undergo a reversal: the replicants become more human, with a conscience, by the end of the film, and Deckard becomes less and less human because of his actions, until their characters have completely switched. This would have given a satisfying and complete meaning to the film. All the replicants wanted to do was live, not be slaves and to be left alone for the remainder of their brief lives. All Deckard wanted to do was kill them, get paid and go home. No thought given to his actions afterwards. <br/><br/>We learn nothing of the replicants' inner feelings except the main one, and then only peripherally. If they had been allowed to emote and to feel pain, we would have empathized with them and had a problem with Deckard killing them. So there really is no-one to empathize with, certainly not Ford, who plays a futuristic Charles Bronson character out of Deathwish, who killed muggers and punks with no emotion whatsoever. <br/><br/>Possible Spoiler: <br/><br/>One major quibble I have is with the murder of Sebastian, the one (and only) empathetic character out of the whole film. He acts as the unwilling host for two of the replicants, he comes to like them and they seem to like him, but after the head replicant kills Tyrell, the genius who bioengineered the replicants, he goes after Sebastian, and we hear later that the replicant killed him too. Why? This completely undermines the evolution of the replicant towards humanity. We can see why the replicant would kill his creator who created him to be a disposable slave who will die after four years, but a man who had helped him? It was a senseless contradiction and brought us back to square one about caring about the replicants. (Even with Darth Vader, the audience empathized with him a little, being scarred up and a victim of his destiny. He didn't just kill people randomly.) <br/><br/>So, there we have it. The reason why, in my opinion, the movie will never be as great as it could be, because nothing changes, and we have no-one (and nothing) to really care about. At the end we're left with a film that creates a sense of mood, and not a moral or meaningful statement. That's too bad; it could have done all of that, with one more rewrite and ten minutes more of developing (i.e., evolving) the characters. Rutger Hauer's ""tears in the rain"" speech at the end unfortunately is not enough to accomplish that by itself. <br/><br/>However, I doubt that Ridley Scott cares about any of that, as he endlessly re-edits the visuals in his film......"
"cubem","5","3","8","26 April 2002"," I couldn't wait for it all to be over
","And I didn't care at all how it was going to end (nor did I care for any of the characters). I admit the visual effects are exceptional, considering when it was made, but the story is, to put it in a nutshell, boring. A lot of people here commented on the film's rich theme, which kind of fell flat if you ask me. The movie could have gone much further and dealt with certain issues. Instead, we just end up following a handsome guy (Ford, not one of his best performances) who's on a mission to kill a bunch of designer humans. I think this is one of the more overrated movies."
"bob the moo","Null","3","8","17 October 2001"," Visionary - but voiceover spoils audience involvement
","Ridley Scott's horrific future-vision of Alien was a landmark in cinema. Blade Runner keeps his trademark bleak city vision and opens it up with questions of existence in a detective thriller.<br/><br/>The visuals and the score in the film are excellent and for me make the whole thing work.  Ford and Young are good in their roles, but Rutger Haur is excellent as the lead android making this one of his best performances - who doesn't know his final speech almost verbatim by now?!  The film's weakness is that it is difficult to go deeper into the story beyond the detective story because Ford's voiceover points us in a clear direction that stops you reading it yourself.<br/><br/>The film is flawed due to the voiceover treating us like fools and not allowing us to read the film ourselves.  Ford and Young's wooden acting styles fit in fine with the film, but in this version the bleak vision of the future is the true star.  Skip this and watch the Director's Cut instead, it frees you up to follow the story yourself, and additional scenes tell you what the film is really about."

It lost me the minute I saw all those chimneys belching fire into the sky over the city where I live. My opinion is Philip K. Dick wrote a fantastic script, but I think he needs to see a shrink, along with all those who consider the film to be ""genius"". So many of the people who wrote comments seem to think it was a huge box-office success at its original release - PBS's host tells the truth: Scott and Harrison Ford (""Rick Decark"") hated the stuff he was forced to add to it by the people who REALLY put-up the money.......the loan-sharks, who took-over the rights to it before it was released. Smart folk, they knew it would eventually become fabulously successful and recognized as a masterpiece. I saw the director's cut.<br/><br/>I still don't like it.

"harryplinkett14","2","3","9","2 April 2019"," Utter failure
","To sum up: this film is 100% style over story. Stylistically, this is a masterpiece that is almost impossible to match. The visuals are amazing, the world the film creates, however unrealistic, comes across as very complex and persuasive. Attention to detail is astounding, costumes are great, sets are impressive, lighting is just beautiful, music is haunting and unforgettable. It's an artistic effort that truly impresses. BUT: where is the story? I have watched this film many times, and I could never get immersed in the story, especially the moral message. It is all so superficial and useless. What really irritated me is that the film never develops the love story it starts. The love story should have been the emotional and intellectual core of the film. All the issues a 'replicant' can face, regarding their identity, purpose, or attitude towards death, could have been explored through the love story. Hell, you didn't even need Rutger Hauer and his gang of weirdos who go around killing people. The climax of the film should have involved Harrison Ford and his love interest. If Hauer was to be in the climax, he should have tried to kill the girl and not Ford. That would have been far more satisfying. Instead, the women disappears from the plot as soon as the love story starts, and we watch Hauer go on his vendetta. I did not want to see him and I didn't need to see all those action scenes. This film never should have been an action film to begin with, but rather a detective love story in the film noir style. The action just ruined it all, as far as I'm concerned. Also, this film is such a masterpiece in terms of style, and screams 'A movie', yet Hauer, as likable as he is, is an icon of B movies. This didn't sit too well with me. I felt like I was watching two films: one a B movie with Hauer wreaking havoc, and the other a detective film noir with a doomed love story. And the two don't fit well together.<br/><br/>I give this film two stars: one for the visuals, and one for the soundtrack. But I hate the plot. And it is Ridley Scott's failure that he focused entirely on style, and didn't care about the plot itself. Scott is in general obsessed with visuals in his films, but he needs a great script in order to make a great film. Blade Runner has a weak plot, and that is the film's undoing."

","***Review contains no plot summary or spoilers*** ""Blade Runner"" is an oppressively dark and sad Sci-Fi noir dystopian film, but undeniably gorgeous and genius in its craft. An outstanding, wonderful classic that has endured time and criticism. Ridley Scott has never reached this pinnacle in his career since, which is so unfortunate. He has a remarkable filmmaking talent like the greats of Stanley Kubrick and Orson Welles. Upon first full viewing of the film, I was drawn in by the visual effects and the narrative. As the credits rolled, I thought with teary eyes how could humanity be so cruel. The film leaves ambiguous questions that may or may not have answers; allowing philosophical speculation. Many films today give you answers, even if the answers are stupid. There is a book called ""Eyes Wide Open"", and in the book the author asks Kubrick what he thought about Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" and the Holocaust. Kubrick replied, ""Schindler's List was about success. The Holocaust was about failure."" ""Blade Runner"" does not romanticize the mainstream Hollywood formula of happy endings (or at least the Final/Directors Cut) and individuals, but instead focuses on major aspects of the society portrayed in the film. The acting in ""Blade Runner"" is superb, especially from the wonderful Rutger Hauer. Los Angeles is stunning thanks to visual effects designer Syd Mead and direction by Ridley Scott. Greatest use lighting ever used in film. A true landmark in the history of art. 10/10"
"Style_is_Substance","10","3","9","31 May 2016"," Philosophical Analysis (abridged class paper)
","This philosophical analysis of the film Blade Runner is an abridged version of a school paper I wrote during my first semester at college. Upon evaluation, I feel there is much more I could add to this.<br/><br/>This is my personal subjective and analysis of the film and the philosophical writings of Turing and Hume referenced below. Alan Turing gave his answer to the question of whether or not machines could ever be capable of thinking like a human being as a 'yes.' Many philosophers and great thinkers of history stated the answer would be, ""no."" While it is often agreed that computers can think in certain but not all ways, it raises the question, ""how would we even know if a computer is thinking like a human being or not?"" Turing stated that it is polite to assume everybody thinks as the only person one can know positively thinks is one's self. With this in mind, it can be concluded that machines can one day be assumed to have human thought just as validly as any person besides one's self does. Turing looked at a party imitation game as an inspiration to develop the Turing Test, a game in which a judge must decipher if he is speaking to a computer or a person and if the computer can be mistaken to be human, it can be concluded to possibly have human-like thought. <br/><br/>In the film, four bio-engineered humanoids – known as replicants – come to Earth illegally and become targets for execution. The process of replicant execution is referred to as retirement, perhaps because the layman would look at replicants as not humans, therefore their executions would not be considered genuine deaths. The film utilizes the fictional Voight-Kampff Test – a test parallel to the Turing Test designed to determine if someone is a replicant or not by asking a series of questions and looking closely at iris dilations and pupil fluctuations to decipher if their emotional response is not human. Towards the beginning of the film, the replicant character Leon is given the test with suspicion of him being a replicant. Before murdering the questionnaire, Leon responds to several questions in an evasive and curious human-like way easily, thus passing the Turing Test before the Voight-Kampff Test really began. The character Rachael believes herself to be human but is then given a the test by Deckard and is then discovered to be a replicant. The line between artificial intelligence and human intelligence becomes blurred, so much that only the slightest details would give away the difference. According to the film, artificial intelligent beings are in fact able to pass the Turing Test and therefore are able to think for themselves. <br/><br/>With this in mind, mankind ever does create a machine that claims to be able to think and potentially turn away from initial programming, I believe we should not automatically assume they do not genuinely think, and possibly treat such a machine as a living organism. David Hume once wrote: ""As a memory alone acquaints us with the continuance and extent of this succession of perceptions, 'tis to be considered, upon that account chiefly, as the source of personal identity. Had we no memory, we never shou'd have any notion of causation, nor onsequently the identity of our persons beyond our memory . . ."" and "". . . memory does not so much produce as discover personal identity, by shewing us the relation of cause and effect among our different perceptions."" I interpret and summarize Hume's writings as stating memory is not what makes somebody a person as other philosophers may believe, but rather helps one know their personal identity. <br/><br/>The character Racheal learns she not only is a replicant destined to die within a short amount of time, but that her memories had been programmed by her creator, Tyrell. Racheal essentially loses nearly all understanding of her personal identity but as she exists, she does not lose her personal identity altogether. <br/><br/>While not officially stating it, the film hints that Deckard, is not only assigned to retire replicants, but also a replicant himself. This is further explored in The Final Cut in which Deckard dreams about a unicorn and at the end of the film finds an origami unicorn on the floor presumably left by his work partner, Gaff, who had previously been shown with an origami match-stick man. Towards the end of the film, Gaff tells Deckard that he has done a man's job while before treating him more unfairly, further suggesting Deckard may be a replicant. With this in mind, it appears Gaff not only knows Deckard's basic whereabouts and thoughts, but possibly created Deckard with programmed memories that may belong to Gaff. If this theory is true, Deckard's understanding of his personal identity is false, but his actual personal identity is not, as memories do not create personal identities but helps people understand their personal identity. The character Roy Batty, moments before death, says the following lines to Deckard: <br/><br/>""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time like tears in the rain Time to die..."" <br/><br/>One could conclude with Hume's writings that Batty's memories are not what makes him a person but helps him understand his personal identity. With his memories gone, his understanding of personal identity would cease to exist, but by saving Deckard's life and sharing his memories, he allows his personal identity to continue existing as Deckard would remember him. As Batty dies, a dove he was holding is released and then flies into the air, suggesting his soul left his body and makes its way to Heaven. As his personal identity lives on and despite being artificial, he is in fact a person."

"williampsamuel","10","3","9","6 December 2014"," A Deep and Atmospheric Sci-fi Masterpiece for All Time
","In the annals of cinema, Blade Runner stands out as something unique. True, many have tried to imitate it, and in the thirty odd years since its release it has influenced countless movies, TV series, anime and video games to one degree or another. Yet while all of these have copied elements of it, none of them have ever captured its exact balance of sci-fi, noir, and philosophy, or replicated its unique atmosphere and otherworldly feel. And none of them had Harrison Ford in the lead and Ridley Scott in the director's chair.<br/><br/>For those few not familiar with the story, Ford plays Rick Deckard, a detective tasked with tracking and eliminating replicants, genetic constructs made to perfectly mimic the humans they serve. Since an incident years before, replicants have been banned from earth, upon penalty of death. But now four of them have taken that risk, leaving a wake of death behind them as they search for the key to their very existence. And it's up to Deckard to find them and stop them before they strike again.<br/><br/>Their leader, Roy, is easily one of the most menacing villains ever to grace the screen. He is so perfect it's unsettling. Gifted with the looks of a professional model and the body and athleticism of a champion quarterback, his every word and expression exudes keen intelligence- and unmistakable madness. He is the kind of being who knows exactly what he wants and how to get it, and he is not the type to let anything or anyone get in his way. Nor is he the only thing Deckard has to worry about <br/><br/>We don't see enough of Leon or Zhora to get much of an impression of them, beyond the fact that they too are desperate and dangerous. Priss however we see very much of; in more ways than one. Beautiful, alluring, and manipulative, she's like a deadly exotic flower, drawing you in to suffocate you in her poison. And then there's Rachel, the replicant who doesn't know she's a replicant. Her demeanor, clothing, and her ever present cigarette remind one of a down and out moll in an old detective movie. Though she barely knows who she really is, she could be a useful ally to Deckard, or possibly something much more.<br/><br/>One of the things that sticks with you the most about this movie is the incredible atmosphere that pervades it. Like any good dystopian sci-fi or hard-boiled detective movie, everything here is dark, heavy, and more than a little threatening. The LA of 2019 is crowded, dirty, and run down. Chinese writing and noodle stands are everywhere, as if Chinatown has overrun all LA. Hover cars fly over decaying apartment blocks and flashing theater matinées out of pre Giuliani Manhattan while fantastic monads and pyramids loom over the horizon like a latter day Babylon. Inside the futuristic and the antiquated vie as well in rooms filled with computer screens and electrical tubing alongside candelabras and crumbling plasterwork. And endless rain comes down in sheets over it all, running down every crevice and drenching any who brave the streets. <br/><br/>Everywhere neon signs, industrial flares, and searchlights illuminate the cityscape, yet nowhere is it enough to hold back the shadows which bathe the streets. For it's the shadows- both physical and metaphorical- that make the world within the film. The director and cinematographers do as many things with these shadows as the best expressionist filmmaker. They use them to alternately obscure and draw attention to faces and scenery, to heighten the sense of danger and mystery, to create harsh contrasts with the blinding strobes and searchlights. And they remind us that everything that's happening is happening within the shadows of society, the dirty underbelly unseen by the good folks safe in their homes. <br/><br/>And just as well that it is. For this is a world filled with violence and corruption not fit for innocent eyes, and the filmmaker's don't let you forget it for a moment, especially not in the action scenes. With slow motion and bluesy synth music, Zhara's death is as stylized and artificial as anything in Blade Runner's world. Yet at the same time it's drawn out, bloody, even traumatic. The editing and camera work aren't trying to make it look cool, they're emphasizing the fact that a desperate frightened woman is dying alone on a rainy sidewalk. To paraphrase the film's most famous line, the report may read ""routine retirement of a replicant"", but it won't make Deckard feel any better about shooting a woman in the back. <br/><br/>Yet for all its impact this scene doesn't even begin to compare with the finale. Deckard's final showdown with Roy is mesmerizing in its beauty and brutality; a demented fever dream hunt, like Most Dangerous Game blended with Olympia and German expressionist horror. Even out of his mind and with his body betraying him, Roy is the superior combatant to Deckard in every way. In a strait on fight to the finish it would all be over in an instant. But what we get instead is so much more violent, intriguing, and spellbinding. And in the end it leaves us with so many questions to ponder; about memory, morality, and what it truly means to be human."

","Just saw Blade Runner (The Final Cut) on my 119 cm LG TV. Wow, doesn't it look great, even 'just' on DVD! Blade Runner I have seen many, many times. I consider it a great scifi classic, but I know that some of the criticism I had when I first saw it in the cinema back in 1983 still exists. <br/><br/>For instance, no replicant on the move will agree to participate in the Voight-Kampff-test that the Blade Runners perform. They know that when their true nature is revealed, the Blade Runner will kill them. So why cooperate? And why does it take so long for the Voight-Kampff machine to get results? Wouldn't it be more logical if Blade Runners got a gadget that can recognize a replicant in 5 seconds? For instance by body temperature? Isn't it a little bit silly when you say: ""Okay, I suspect that you're not human but a renegade replicant. Would you mind sitting down with me for 15 minutes so I can investigate whether my suspicions are false or indeed correct?""<br/><br/>Another thing that's still hard to swallow: Deckard maybe being a replicant himself. Before the Directors Cut there was no Unicorn dream sequence. Therefor there weren't any indications that Deckard might be a machine. So why think of the idea? If Ridley Scott truly wanted to tell a tale of replicant chasing replicant he should have been more clear on that subject. <br/><br/>Last but not least. If you think of Deckard being fully human (instead of being a replicant) I think the love story between him and Rachel is also difficult to believe. Why should a human fall in love with an android, even if she's so beautiful as Rachel? Isn't that... immoral? Wrong? Sick?<br/><br/>Okay, it's not my goal to burn down Blade Runner, because I still think it's one of the 30 best films ever made. Rutger Hauer is impressive and Harrison Ford's part of Deckard is a more daring one than the one in Witness. As 'a hero' he only succeeds in killing two replicants... and they're both female. And of course the city itself looks stunning. Even in this age of CGI the images of LA and the flying cars are unsurpassed.

","The absolutely ONLY thing that this film has going for it - is that the director didn't succumb to the normal futuristic movie mistake (and particularly American penchant) of making everything clean.
I dont know what it is, perhaps just the way the Hollywood sets and costumes are used in so many things - but if you watch even modern day episodes of Star trek - then a distant alien village of poor humanoids will still manage an immaculate village - and it will look as though people who have just come from the hairdressers have been handed a designer sack cloth which has just come from the dry cleaners.
So blade runner is a completely run of the mill story which has been done a million times before - which has been placed in a gritty realistic dirty future.
Star wars also sort of managed this a little - with ships and vehicles at least looking dirty and worm - but then spoilt it with aliens out of the muppets.<br/><br/>So Blade runner after having a fantastic dirty realistic looking future - then spoils it not with the muppets, but by making everyone wander around in some sort of miserable haze. There's not a single spark of normal human emotion in the entire movie - which just drags itself from long silence to long silence, and standing in the rain.<br/><br/>So it must be that people are just fixated on that stylization. <br/><br/>Because apart from that dirty future - maybe the music is pretty cool. or at least it fits in.

He's involved in a deep mystery regarding some of them who infiltrated among the humans' earth, proving to have a hard time eliminating them.<br/><br/>It's a movie which presents a dark and gritty world, full of odd characters but also human replicas who are wanted by the police. Tasked with locating and killing the visitors, the main character's skills will be put to the test in his attempt to solve the task but also the mystery surrounding them. Although it sounds like an interesting premise, you'll soon find out that the execution falls way behind. The main character is pretty dull and unsympathetic, making his adventure a lot less interesting than it should have been. The story also lacks in terms of complexity, generating a truly unpleasant sensation of complete boredom.<br/><br/>You have the impression that you know what is going to happen, but you have to wait a great amount of time for it to happen, which almost seems like a filler, unnecessary overextended. The even sadder part is that you were right all along, making it incredibly predictable, thus spoiling everything that could have generated even a bit of emotion or drama. You're left with a very unsatisfying story, with a very disappointing finale (which leaves plenty of room for a sequel) and a couple of characters who simply cannot grab your attention, let alone feelings regarding their situation. I have to note though that it looks stunning! The special effects and the cinematic way are a big plus for this movie, but I'm sad to say that it is the only upside when it comes to this film.<br/><br/>It's not as bad as it sounds, but overall it fails to deliver anything above mediocrity, except for the visuals of course, leaving the viewer with a lot to wish for, especially considering its very high rating."

","Boring and pretentious, the original ""Blade Runner"" is an overlong slog that was just isn't worth the trip. There's a reason this movie bombed when it was released in 1982, and no amount of fanboy revionist history can overcome its basic flaws.<br/><br/>Yes, the dystopian vision of the future was groundbreaking some 35 years ago, but now we've seen it over and over again, and usually done better; you can give Ridley Scott an A- for originality since he got there early, but only a C for execution. The synthesizer soundtrack may have sounded futuristic and innovative at the time (though it was likely more of a concession to budgetary realities than an artistic choice) but now it's just a bit grating. Similarly, he visual effects were not even cutting edge at the time (compare them to ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture,"" made five and three years earlier, respectively: both look much better.) Harrison Ford, who can turn in a fine performance when he wants to, just phoned this one in, and seems as bored as the audience for most of the film, especially during his monotone narration; Sean Young (though quite decorative) was similarly wooden. The dialog is stilted, the pacing stodgy, the story overstuffed, and the editing insufficient.<br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" can be most appreciated for its contribution to the ""feel"" of many later films.

","In preparation for the new blade runner film coming out I decided I had to watch the original blade runner and there are things I do like about this film but I will admit that I think it is probably one of the most overrated movies ever. The premise of the film sees a special police officer on the hunt for a group of replicants that want to find there creator. Harrison ford plays deckard and I thought he was great in this film, a truly different performance from the others he was doing at the time such as han solo and Indiana Jones. He is dark, dangerous and deadly, you buy the journey he Gordon throughout this film as he learns more about these replicants and in turn himself. The supporting cast is a mixed bag, I really liked the replicants leader, I thought he was a good villain especially as the film progresses and you see more of his motivations and more of character. The character of Rachel is a tough one because I like the idea of her character I just feel like her performance was very wooden and there isn't enough of her character for you to really care. There are also some really bizarre side characters that I didn't care about and they really felt like a way to pad out this film and progress the plot. The story of this film deals with a lot of heavy themes and they are treated pretty well throughout the film especially involving deckard and his journey. However, the first hour of the film is pretty meandering and I didn't particularly find it interesting till the last act. The script is pretty poor, there is no humour in this film which does make sense considering the film given but even though this is the case absolutely none of the dramatic dialogue is particularly memorable either. The style of the film is fantastic though, the dark grimy back ally's really work and some of the CGI is great especially considering how old this film is. When they happen the action scenes are well done and especially towards the ending I really was gripped into watching them. Overall I think blade runner is an okay film but I think it could have been a lot more and I hope blade runner 2049 really delivers on that potential."

","Is there a movie that explores the definition of what it means to be human and ""otherness"" better than Blade Runner? The Tyrell Corporation's motto, ""more human than human,"" serves as the basis for exploring this experience through true humans and created humans, or Replicants. Symbolism of the meaning of humanity in contrast with ""otherness"" are woven throughout the film, relying largely on biblical metaphors. The movie presents us with types of angels, demons, Heaven and God as the creator as well as illusions to Christ, much like the theme and symbolisms use in the film The Life of Pi.<br/><br/>The replicants represent the fallen angels in the Bible, or demons. Numerous passages relate the angels as servants to the followers of God, but these angels/replicants fell from grace when they mutinied against their creators. Likewise, the demons of the Bible are angels that fell from God's grace and were cast out of Heaven when they rebelled against God's authority. A powerful symbol that recurs throughout the movie is that of the eye. The Bible uses the illustration of the eyes many times to show its importance as a gate to the soul. Jesus says in the Gospel of Matthew, ""The light of the body is the eye."" <br/><br/>Retired cop, Rick Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, is forced out of retirement to resume his position as a Blade Runner. His mission is to ""retire"" or eliminate the four Replicants that have escaped from off-world colonies and have made their way to earth to meet the man who created them and to find the answer to every lasting life. The Replicants or ""skin-jobs"" are androids/humanoids were banned from earth and used as slave labor on earth colonies. Due to their intelligence, they are programed to breakdown or ""die"" after four years to prevent them from developing human emotions or feelings.<br/><br/>Deckard must battle and destroy the four replicants: Leon Kolwalski (Brion James); Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) the snake lady; Roy Batty( Rutger Hauer) and Roy's girlfriend, Pris (Daryl Hannah). Eldon Tyrell, the creator of the Replicants, asks Deckard to demonstrate the effectiveness of a machine that is used to identify if someone is a replicant or a human. He is asked to perform the test on Tyrell's employee, Rachel. It takes 100 questions before Deckard determines that she is indeed a replicant. She plays a major role in saving Deckard's life during an altercation with Leon Kolwalski. <br/><br/>The special effects in Blade Runner are paramount, since they were created by camera and not computer-generated images. The lighting throughout the film, along with the voice-over narration by Deckard, and the shapely, form fitted dresses worn by Rachel, gives us the impression of a dark futuristic film that is reminiscent of a 1940s black and white movie. This effect is well played and lends a bit of mystique to the picture. The opening scene of the Los Angeles skyline reflecting off the iris of an eye is breathing taking and symbolic of God's view of his earthly creation."

Its designs are still influential. I love the hard-boiled noir genre being married to a sci-fi movie. It does move slowly in the middle but I accept that flaw. It is meticulous and detailed visually. The Philip K. Dick story is compelling. It remains an important sign post in the sci-fi genre."

","When I first saw Blade Runner I was unsure if I actually enjoyed it. It left me unsettled. The slower pace and moody content weren't what I was used to. It isn't a regular Hollywood blockbuster film. Then I let it sink in, and I realised that it was phenomenal, and I had to watch it again, and again, and again.<br/><br/>The first version that I watched was the one featuring Deckard's voice-over, Rick Deckard being the world-weary detective played by a smooth Harrison Ford, which is not favoured by film purists, but works for me as it links it to the film noir genre. The version without the voice-over is just as good, but it does fill in some richer details and lends the proceedings more of a hard-boiled feel.<br/><br/>Mention must be made of the scintillating Vangelis soundtrack, the use of the electronic instruments clashing with the natural orchestral score mirroring the struggle between natural and synthetic life in the film.<br/><br/>The look of Blade Runner is magnificent, owing a large debt to graphic artist Moebius and to the Futurist artistic movement. Blade Runner contains a stunning depiction of a living, breathing near-future - but is any of it real? We know early on that Rachael, the cool Sean Young, is not human, but a Replicant, or synthesised robotic cyborg, known as skin jobs to the less than sensitive police clientele. Yet are the Replicants, who witness things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion¦ C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time¦ like tears in rain¦, which is one of the most beautiful speeches in the history of cinema, are they perhaps more real than the seedy cops who live in squalid hovels and question suspects in smoky offices? Blade Runner gives us a near perfect vision of a dystopian future that has not been bettered. From the flashing, pixellated advertising billboards, through the neon sign-decked side streets, with their market stalls selling ersatz animals and vat-grown human organs as created by the Tyrell Corporation, up to the skies filled with flying vehicles and flaming smokestacks, each enthralling element is skilfully crafted and put on display for us to gawp wild-eyed and open-mouthed at.<br/><br/>As Deckard tracks down four rebel Replicants, their leader Roy Batty, given an exuberant performance by Rutger Hauer, he becomes uncertain about the task he has been handed, but has to see it through, or die in the process.<br/><br/>The film, in its Directors Cut, also manages to achieve the astounding feat of turning reality inside out in your head, flipping the world on its axis in a highly disorientating way. This film will change the way that you view the world."

Which is exactly why I return to it again and again. It's a beautiful audio/visual bath of future noir. Unique in it's sophistication and unparalleled in it's execution.<br/><br/>I don't like genres and nor does Blade Runner. Dancing between Sci-Fi, Noir, Detective, drama with ease. <br/><br/>What you get is a superbly made spectacle of what it means to be human in a world full of technology. At least 40 years ahead of it's time. <br/><br/>The influence of Blade Runner is only starting now...look out the window...go into the city...what do you see?

"Sonic_Ocean","10","2","5","22 February 2013"," Along with 2001, the most unique science fiction film of all time. Coupled with film noir and dystopian elements, this is a film that stimulates the imagination.
","One of my favorite films of all time. Before I get into the details of this classic, I cannot stress how much the final cut is the definitive version of this film. If you plan on purchasing this film, that is the best version to buy, hands down. I also cannot stress how much the visuals in Blade Runner make today's high budget CGI movies look like a joke, which they are in my opinion. This is a film noir story spliced with science fiction and the result is something that is unique and still is. A lot of films try so hard to be gritty and dark, and Blade Runner, in my opinion, achieves that in the highest caliber. With it's dystopian setting and bleak story, the movie is very dreamlike.<br/><br/>And what this movie achieves in doing is telling a very simple story, but with so much to say. Not a lot happens in the movie, but every scene is vital in progressing the story, without any unnecessary moments of filler. What I love about the film is that it has an ebb and flow to it which feels very intrinsic. When many films do so much and try so hard only to end up failing, Blade Runner easily succeeds by being very subtle.<br/><br/>What is very captivating to me is that Ridley Scott created a world that is one of a great imagination. Through the visuals, it has the looks of a world that is very different from our own, but one that is living and breathing, a world that feels run down and claustrophobic to give a feeling of urban alienation, one that exists within our society. The immersiveness of this film is very strong and it takes a great storyteller to pull off a feat as great as that.<br/><br/>While Blade Runner is a science fiction film, it hits the heart with its sense of humanity and to me, I think that is what it achieves in being such a sentimental film to me. Whenever I want to watch a film to escape, I will put on Blade Runner."
"brent_or","10","2","5","5 February 2013"," Tremendously Impressing, Mesmerizing Sci-Fi Noir
","I just watched Blade Runner for the first time. Considering that I am nearly 30 years old and a lifelong science fiction fan, it seems odd that I waited this long. Anyway, the version that I watched is the Director's Cut, so I cannot speak to the differences present in the Original Version, the Final Cut, etc. But I came away quite impressed with this film, for its restraint and strange otherness as much as for any of the more obvious, overt virtues that most sci-fi films possess.<br/><br/>The visual look of the film is very dark and ultimately bleak in concept, but the images of a future Los Angeles are incredibly executed and often beautiful in a strange, unsettling way. I am not sure how many films I have ever seen that have managed to capture a comparable sort of frightening futuristic realism. It still looks incredible in 2013. There is such a transportative depth to it. What an achievement for a filmmaker in the early 80s.<br/><br/>I think that the cast is great, especially Rutger Hauer and Sean Young, but really everyone. (Edward James Olmos, yes.) The musical score by Vangelis is a very effective fit. It reminds me, in a way, of the music from Twin Peaks in the way that it is very slowly, hypnotically emotional. Dialogue is fairly minimal relative to most films; this one uses images, physical emotionality and a haunting, aching used of dark and selective light to tell the story.<br/><br/>And it definitely requires the viewer to pay close attention and do a lot of thinking. Even at that, some things are left to question. I love a film that does that. This is the antithesis of a film that spoon-feeds every idea and point. I know that the Original Version had voice-over narration that explained things more clearly, but I enjoyed the subtlety of the Director's Cut. From the haunting first aerial view of Los Angeles to the wonderfully artistic, perfectly played final scene, this was an incredible experience for me as a viewer. How could I give it anything but a 10? There really should be more films like this."

","Two of Ridley Scott's science fiction films make it up there on my ""All Time Favourites"" list, Alien and this.<br/><br/>Having not seen any other version (of which there are several), all of the various differences do not concern me, it is simply a review of the Director's Cut that I shall be writing here.<br/><br/>This film is an utter masterpiece. Pure and simple.<br/><br/>The visuals of the theme are fantastic, from the godlike Tyrell corporation's temple-designed room to the neon glow of street level and the influences of Chinese culture on the world Scott envisioned. This entire film is nasty and enclosed and dark and horrible. The world Scott created in this film is a retro-fitted slum essentially and a vision of a really quite nasty future. Each house and building has searchlights peering in, giving an impression of an all-knowing police force.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford is the Blade Runner of the title, a flawed ex-police given a job. Ford gives the best performance I've ever seen of him, an unsettlingly volatile man. But the real star lies with (one of my favourite actors) Rutger Hauer as replicant Roy Batty, a seething, intelligent, violent creation seeking out his creator to solve one of the most human problems of all. <br/><br/>His final soliloquy on a roof top to Harrison Ford's Deckard is one of the MOST beautiful series of words ever uttered on film. You'd have to be a cold hearted person to watch that scene and not feel at least a strong emotional tug.<br/><br/>Actually having remarkably little in common with the novel it's based on 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' works in the film's favour as the book is far too complex and confusing to turn into a feature film of any appreciable length. Instead, by taking a simple narrative idea and framing it in the world with some of the characters from the novel, you end up with an incredibly strong story that never seeks to confuse or confound you, with a 'bad guy' so compelling and human it crosses into anti-hero and anti-villain.<br/><br/>A fantastic film and one I will willingly watch again, a lot.<br/><br/>Read more at: http://thegiff.typepad.com/film_flare/"

","This movie is as dark and foreboding as Ridley's earlier ""Alien"" - Naturally, because Syd Mead also did a lot of the production design. And he used everything he could get his hands on to build an eerie cityscape - Including, ironically, the Millennium Falcon spaceship from Star Wars, which was star Harrison Ford's ride in the SW Original Trilogy.<br/><br/>I've heard many Philip K Dick purists pound this film, because it changes some things from the Book ""Do Androids Dream of Dlectric Sheep"" on which this film is based. - But what those people probably don't know, is that Philip K Dick himself approved of the film-Especially the dark look which he claimed was exactly what he was going for. Philip himself understood that written works rarely can be filmed as written, from Gone with the Wind to Lord of the Rings, filmmakers are constrained for time. To tell a 500 page book in 2 hours running time is difficult.<br/><br/>So even as Ridley Scott changed some of the science and mechanics regarding ""replicants"" and altered a bit of the character interaction, he did maintain the spirit of the novel - Which is, Do things we create, which appear Human, actually become valid living beings - Do they have souls, and more important, do they have a Spirit? This is explored in this film.<br/><br/>""I Think, therefore I am."" Eventually, mankind will build a computer capable of passing the Turing Test, and when that happens, will we treat that invention as a slave? Do I treat my Home Computer as a kind of Slave? Actually they way I see it, my home computer always takes on characteristics of myself. So in a way, my home Desktop and my Laptops, are living breathing beings.<br/><br/>I loved the Narrated version - Mostly cos thats the way I saw it originally, and the removal of the narration track, kind of ruins it for me, it's not the same without it.<br/><br/>Maybe if I had seen it without the narration, but all my information about the movie and what is going on, is IN that deleted narrative.<br/><br/>As much as I like the extended cuts and the ""Final Cut"" - I feel sort of betrayed that there was no ""Final Cut"" with the option to have the narration running if I wanted to.<br/><br/>There are also several scenes that are different, in the US Theatrical version versus the International version. For instance, when Rutger Hauer kills his ""God"" Dr Tyrell, in the version I originally saw, it's a more gruesome. Later, Hauer shoves a long nail through his hand, thats also missing in the extended/final cut.<br/><br/>Other than that, the two versions are pretty close.<br/><br/>And I do like both versions, or, all versions. I have seen about 6 different cuts of this, each with slight differences.<br/><br/>Mainly, when I first saw this, it was with the Narration, which gives good exposition on what is happening. Without it, there are a number of things left unexplained. The Narration track explains pretty much what is going on, also the nature of Ford's character and the characters of Bryant and Gaff. Also some of the motivations of the Replicants.<br/><br/>When Ford is hanging from the top of the Bradbury Building by two broken fingers, in the rain, I was sweating bullets. That scene has the same effect on me in all versions.<br/><br/>I'm so glad I was able to find a version with the Narration, it had been 30 years since I had seen that version. It was refreshing."

One thing I enjoyed was that run down futuristic LA ridley created, with the crazy slang he created by combining all the different languages. That was so cool and interesting to me. Another thing I enjoyed was watching a movie where Harrison Ford is the main character but not the best actor, that I feel goes to Rutger Hauer. Rutger was absolutely amazing, his ending monologue almost brought tears to my eyes. If you are a science fiction nut a must see but even if your not big on science fiction you can still find things to enjoy. P.S.

","Funny thing about this movie is the first few times I watched part of it I didn't get it, it just seemed bleak and obscure. It has grown on me a little since then and I try to get at least a piece of it each time it's on. Since I've never seen this from top to bottom in one sitting forgive me for errors in the plot, but it goes something like this: Ford is savvy, gritty future cop with an ability to take a punch and trained to spot replicants (robots who appear to be human), called back to duty when a few replicants turn bad. The replicants are on what turns out to be a deadly mission of their own. Along the way Ford hooks up with Young, together they make the movie. I find most fascinating the relationship between Ford and Young and the bleak look at the future, the plot to me is sort of routine and immaterial except as a backdrop to the good stuff. Hard to understand but rewarding in its own strange way."
"Whiskeyjack88","10","2","5","9 September 2011"," A Sci-Fi Masterpiece!
","As a heads up, this review is based on the Director's cut of this film and will contain spoilers.<br/><br/>I just recently re-watched Blade Runner (for the second time only), and found it much better than the first time around. On my first viewing, I did think that it was a good movie, but not great. Years later, I have a much greater appreciation for the film.<br/><br/>The story focuses on Deckard, who is a retired Blade Runner asked to ""retire"" a series of humanoids called replicants. Deckard will go through an emotional journey throughout the film, and will question himself at several occasions.<br/><br/>The movie opens with flames shooting up in the sky from tall buildings, giving us our first glimpse at this bleak vision of the future. The intro music that accompanies these visuals is very fitting and really sets the tone for a cold, atmospheric experience. I always feel that the first five minutes of every film is extremely important and needs to set the tone for what's to come. A prime example of this is the intro for Vertigo; it is an extremely mesmerising intro, and gives a great taste of what the film has to offer.<br/><br/>This great intro is followed by Leon's test. I feel that this scene has great dialog worthy of a Tarantino film (and I'm not implying that Tarantino is a better director; I think they are both amazing). The smoke and the alarm going off, as well as the fan overhead give great imagery and sound to fit the feel of the movie with still a cold atmosphere.<br/><br/>Scott creates a highly stylized, convincing world of lies and deceit, and sucks us right in to the story and world which Deckard inhabits. It is dark, bleak and cruel. Most humans are living in the ""colonies,"" and the poor and ""different"" are left in this underworld that is now Earth. In a scene where Deckard chases the replicant Salome, the busy sounds of the city are replaced by soft mood music, gunfire and a beating heart; this works very well in film's context of what is real and what is not. This combination of sounds creates the soundtrack to Salome's death.<br/><br/>The movie climaxes with a confrontation scene between Deckard and Roy. Scott plays very well with the lighting during this scene; it adds an eerie feeling to the movie. Every shot is thoughtfully set up with light outside of the building creeping in, removing the need from internal lighting to follow the characters. Roy's insanity is brought to the edge in this scene, and mixes very well with the lighting.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is beautifully shot, and brings back, some ways, the film noir genre. It is a very enjoyable sci-fi that goes beyond the spaceship and aliens we normally see. It questions what it means to be human and brings to mind a lot of questions, more than it gives answers.<br/><br/>""It's too bad she won't live, but then again who does?"" This combined with the unicorn, suggesting Deckard is a replicant, gives the argument that we are given a happy ending and that he will lives the rest of his short life with Rachael.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Cedric_Catsuits","Null","2","5","25 July 2011"," Disappointing
","I'm a huge fan of Ridley Scott, many of whose titles reside in my top 50 all-time greats, but this film is a mess. Maybe it's because I saw the 2007 cut, though that was supposedly clearer and better. It's nicely shot, with beautiful images of a creative and realistic future world, and as well directed as I would expect. But what exactly is it trying to tell us about humanity? I have no idea.<br/><br/>Ford gives a decent performance, but the rest are disappointing. Hauer in particular under-performs, being nowhere near as menacing as he later proved he can be. Nobody else stands out as especially good or bad, an illustration of banality that pervades what could have been a classic movie."

The crazy life shortened Replicants going mad and seeking longer life made for a great storyline and makes you think about the future ""us vs them"". Rutger Hauer's performance shines along with Harrison Fords back in their prime as they face off against each other. Rachael(Sean Young) was especially hot once she let her hair down. I loved the ending when Rachael and Deckard ride off together into the sunset. I've watched this movie more then Star Wars and I intend to watch it again."

He ushered in a new genre of science fiction film noir with this film as well as with 'Alien', both characterized by a new formulation of visual atmospherics that was dubbed ""psychoytronic"". Blade Runner: Theatrical Cut; 1982. <br/><br/>Xtra: Ridley On History I have liked Ridley Scott since Blade Runner and I remember him saying that he liked to ""reimagine"" history wherever there were gaps in the historic record or in the story myth (as in the case with Robin Hood). He did it admirably in 'Kingdom of Heaven', in '1492: Conquest of Paradise' and most notably in 'Gladiator'. Ridley likes history but he's not timid about filling in gaps on the storyboard with his own imagination. I don't mind and I especially liked Robin Hood because of it."

","When discussing the works of Ripley Scott, it is extremely difficult at best not to use such cerebrally intimidating terms such as ""eclectic"", ""noir"", and ""dazzling technology"". As such, this review will attempt to keep such terms to a minimum.<br/><br/>In 1979 Ridley Scotts second film that he ever made, ""Alien"", was a smash hit. (His first film ever was ""The Duelist"" in 1977, in case you were wondering). The movie ""Alien"" was hailed as a masterpiece in which he mixed visceral horror with science fiction. Its no surprise then, that Scott's third movie, he mixed film noir and science fiction in much the same way to make the technically astonishing movie ""Blade Runner"" based on the 1968 classic by Phillip Dick called ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"". Although it did not do well at the box office, is another stroke of genius. As the movie starts off, there is a virtual tour of futuristic Los Angeles. The movie watcher is made to feel as if they have awoken from a cryogenic chamber and are observing the changes that have taken place.: The weather and environmental color is drab, there are gigantic animated billboards offering goods and services(something that didn't exist in 1982 but already exists now), and that Coke is still around. Even though the scenes were constructed using 1982 technology, they are still breathless and when viewed on a flat screen TV are close to three dimensional. Next is the introduction to the melancholic Deckard (played by Harrison Ford) who in contrast of the Replicants that he chases, appears to take life for granted. The philosophical themes in this picture are endless. One popular philosophy is that Deckard himself is a Replicant this theory is doubtful as Replicants appear to be superior in strength and maybe even intelligence to humans. Deckard is only able to bring Replicants down to retirement by relying on the one edge that humans have over Replicants: experience. Since Replicants can only live for four years, they do not have as much experience at anything as their human counterparts. In addition to the movies in depth philosophy, Blade Runner makes several realistic predictions: (1) Los Angeles/California is predicted as being culturally isolated and diverse to the point of mayhem. This forecast is even more probable today, than it was in 1982. California and especially Los Angeles has already become extremely diverse culturally. Caucasians no longer represent the majority of the population. Additionally, each ethnic group tends to isolate from the other ethnic groups. There is Chinatown, Korea Town, Olvera Street, and Watts. Each neighborhood has its own cultures and languages that are not only spoken, but seen on Billboards and even street signs. Select cultures are even pandered to by the government. Even though it is currently the law to be a US Citizen to vote and to have a driver's license, and even though it is a requirement to read English to become a US citizen, Drivers License exams and ballots are written in Spanish and many of the Asian languages. There is no need or incentive for an immigrant to assimilate into one uniform society. (2) Technology continues to advance at a prolific rate. From 1982 to 2010, technology has grown tremendously. No one in 1982 would have dreamed of DVDs, flat screen TVs, GPS systems, iPods, or cell phones that do just about everything would be in wide use in 2010. Flying cars may not be far off. It would appear that the only thing that might prevent Replicants from ever being built would be a possible ethical/political dilemma much like the one that surrounds cloning. (3) The weather and environment appears to be drearier. As global warming theories and oil and other toxic spills become more prevalent, this event is quite possible. (4) Big Corporations still exist and exert their influence. From the Coke billboards to the billboards offering a better life on a space colony, consumers are still being told that their life is inadequate but could be made better if they purchased certain products or moved to a ""better"" location. Watching the movie leaves one with the feeling of awe. The realism of situations and special effects only serve to enhance this effect. This movie is a much watch for any fan of science fiction, or to anyone who wants to get a look into the future."

The best part is the realistic make believe storytelling, with the special effects and decent performances. It was good to see Harrison Ford in quite a different role, a more serious one, in contrast to his roles in Star Wars and Indiana Jones.

"gigan-92","10","2","5","22 November 2010"," The Perfection Rarely Seen On-Screen
","Many ideas and theories have come from viewers after watching this movie. It came in 1982, long before I was born, a whole decade in fact. And so, I had the pleasure of viewing the ""Final Cut"" of the film. Ridley Scott's greatest achievement I'll admit. A beautifully dark sci-fi spectacle that works on many levels and provokes so many thoughts you'll find several reasons to love it.<br/><br/>I'll start with the cast, who is incredible. Now that it's been out for a while, many of the actors are now quite well known. Harrison Ford surprised me honestly, being so different from the type of character he usually lays. My favorite role he's ever done. I love Sean Young in the movie, as well as Daryl Hannah. These actors portrayed their characters so excellently I could quite possibly never get tired of it. The list is nearly endless; Edward James Olmos, James Hong, and Rutager Hayer as Roy, my favorite character in it all. The way the story flows, it starts us off believing the Replicants are devious and cold hearted machines, as you might discern in that opening murder scene. But as the story continues you will realize that is far from the actual plot at all. By the time it's over; don't be surprised if you feel Deckard is the actual antagonist instead of the initial speculation. This is not the lone-cop, gun-slinger, film, by far.<br/><br/>And the look of the film, it's just remarkable. The lighting creates a very dark and gloomy atmosphere. That's one aspect in itself for which many like myself can love it. The cinematography is just exhilarating, a dirty world populated with silhouettes and a rather dystopia-like vision of our future. And the very stirring part of it all that is wasn't all that fictional of a world to envision. That story took place in 2019, and it's now in 2010, and yet watching it I felt like it was a future Earth might is still very susceptible too. Themes of pollution, over-population, among so many other things within these magnificent shots, it probably prompts most the loss of humanity that the advent of technology brings. There's just no way to watch ""Blade Runner"" and receive no feeling from it. My first viewing of it lead me to believe it was simply a well told story. But it will do more after each view, so with that said definitely see the ""the Final Cut""."

","""It's too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?""<br/><br/>(This review is for the Final Cut version of Blade Runner.) It took me two viewings to really appreciate Blade Runner, but once it hit me, it me hit me like a ton of bricks.<br/><br/>Out of all the movies that Ridley Scott has done, this is the one that proves without a doubt that he deserves his place as one of the great directors. This is one of the most fully-realized and technically and artistically impressive worlds that I've ever seen created on film. The backgrounds and sets are wonderful. The cinematography is outstanding. Nearly every single shot is visually striking in some manner. Blade Runner's setting is a wildly imaginative glimpse of the future, yet grounded in a gritty reality that's appealing and fits the tone of the movie perfectly. As does the music. <br/><br/>As for the story, it's intelligent, engrossing, and perfectly paced. One that you don't have to be a huge fan of sci-fi or noir to enjoy. In broad terms, it's about an ex-police officer who specializes in eliminating artificial humans (replicants), and his efforts to track down four who have illegally come to earth. There's more to it than that, of course, but watching the story unfold and letting it draw you into this alternate future is a pleasure that I wouldn't want to rob from anyone reading this. Just trust me, there are deep themes that are explored here, but the movie is thoroughly entertaining even if you aim to enjoy it on only its most superficial levels. <br/><br/>As you may have guessed, this is my favorite Scott film, as well as my favorite Harrison Ford role. It stands out for its memorable and three dimensional characters like the elegant and haunting replicant Rachael and the kind (but creepy) Sebastian. The use of light and shadows throughout the movie gives it a timeless, classic quality. Sci-fi (heck, movies in general) doesn't get much better than this one. Beyond it's own undeniable quality, the genre as a whole has benefited from Blade Runner's influence."

","Blade Runner is a richly detailed and visually overwhelming trip to 2019 which sticks with you like a recurrent nightmare. In a futuristic Chinatown district of Los Angeles, an ex-cop (Harrison Ford) with carte blanche to kill is charged with tracking down and eliminating a group of androids, who escaped from a remote colony, hijacked a space shuttle and made their way to Earth.<br/><br/>It's a film with a cult following that has gradually grown since it opened to distinctly mixed reviews and moderate box-office success. A huge influence of subsequent attempts to re-create science-fiction on film; its production design, all urban grunge and slick, acid-rainy streets, was widely copied, not least by director Ridley Scott himself. Its story is just the right combination of coherent but elusive to inspire multiple readings; the film's appeal to successive generations seems limitless."
"johnnyboyz","7","2","5","13 April 2010"," Visually appealing; narratively challenging and with an eye on many-a film making aspects makes Blade Runner somewhat of a success.
","Blade Runner will eventually see its two lead characters, or its protagonist and his ultimate goal in tracking something down in the form of another character, share a memorable scene on a roof top of a distant Los Angeles, far into the future. After all of what's gone on and after all the venturing and the talking and the process of investigation, it boils down to one 'evil' character, who's a machine, and one 'just' character, a human-being, interacting; at which point we realise the human-being was a genre archetype and a plain old character following orders given to him by a larger force whereas the robot was a wandering, free spirit whom dared to dream and craved more out of life. The human comes across as more machine-like than the machine, with the machine coming across as more emotional and feeling-filled than the member of the human species. Such is the richness of Blade Runner that tn a lesser film, this exchange wouldn't have taken place and the character of Roy might've been a homicidal robot with a mindless agenda.<br/><br/>Born into a slavery; used and then put through a grinder of negative emotions, Roy revolts and breaks out, consequently freeing himself and allowing himself the ability to explore things at his own pace, opening up his mind and allowing him to explore; learn; love and want to harm those that destroyed what he loved after being an assistant to the system. Blade Runner is like that, an eye on spectacle and scope for its location just as much as it has a spot of affection for its characters in what they think, feel and desire; if indeed they're even interested in anything more than grey trench-coats; glum expressions and order following .<br/><br/>The lead is a certain ex-police officer named Rick Deckard (Ford), a man occupying a glum and gloomy, rain-sodden Los Angeles in 2019; a man of whom trudges through damp, wet streets with many others in a doomy looking; steamy and enclosed Chinatown area as large blimps hover above the mere mortals scrambling around in their squaller advertising breaks away to more tropical, more Utopian places. Director Ridley Scott opens his film with an establishing shot of the entire city, flying cars and the impressive canopy layer of some skyscrapers capturing the beauty and sheer awe within as an accompanying instrumental musical track emphasises both these traits. This is interestingly interjecting with random bursts of flames from vents of some kind, the likes that instill sudden senses of danger and risk of harm; perfectly capturing the world he's about to take us into as the camera very slowly creeps towards the city.<br/><br/>The film gives its lead, Deckard, a mission in the grand tradition of noir in the sense it is his job to find something for someone. In days of old; be it The Maltese Falcon or Murder, My Sweet; noir leads have usually looked for an item or a person. Blade Runner, in all its hybridising glory, has fun with this particular premise in having its lead look for a sort of combination of both: a man/machine hybrid named a Replicant. The chief Replicants in the story, who've gone rouge and are seeking an extension of life, are Pris (Hannah), the film's femme fatale archetype whose birthday the film teasingly places on Valentine's Day; Zhora (Cassidy); Leon Kowalski (James) and the somewhat deranged and equally disturbing in his persistent state of calmness, Roy Batty (Hauer).<br/><br/>Scott gets across a sense of futuristic scope in the film by setting a sequence at the slimiest, seediest and nastiest of run down night spots than you can, but a place that actually comes with advanced video phone technology in the back, suggesting that a sense of technological advancement has reached even these sorts of God-forsaken places. The film's meshing of classical noir with more contemporary science fiction is a given; but the film's hybridising of genres is perhaps best highlighted in a scene involving two characters, a toy manufacturer named Seb (Sanderson) and the aforementioned Pris, whom walk down a hallway of an apartment block towards Seb's home. Lights from outside systematically light up and make dimmer again the hallway, in doing so, casting expressionistic shadows across the walls and floors rendering the location one of both horror and noir as this strange looking woman with an agenda attempts to infiltrate her way in. The sequence is given an added sense of horror when we enter the man's apartment and observe the uncanny array of odd looking moving toys he has made over the years. This strange imagery combines with Pris' overall look in creating something quite terrifying, something the film acknowledges when it has Pris disguise herself as one of these toys later on in another sequence, suggesting a certain 'at one-ness' she shares with the items. The lighting lights the location the whole time with sudden glares and then total darkness, suggesting a sense of light or life that'll shortly come to an end, like an average house light strobing before it dies out.<br/><br/>The film places Deckard on a strand of the detective ilk, he visits places and garners clues to everything which along the way leads him to the character of Rachel (Young), but the film is not an exercise in narrative as much as it is an exercise in technicality and mise-en-scene. Its grim view on man and machine being unable to co-exist in a world full of modernity and technological advancements is highlighted in an early scene involving Leon and a test of some description, as well as later on when Roy essentially kills off his creator, is counter-balanced with Deckard's ability to connect with Replicant Rachel. Blade Runner is an interesting film; a wonderful combining of a maker with a keen eye on the visual and love for one or more genres with complex items and ideas explored accordingly."

","This movie is made after Philip K. Dick novel, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"". Seek reference on wikipedia if you want to fill the background info of the movie.<br/><br/>I was familiar with Philip K. Dick writings, but I missed this one. First I saw the movie and after I did read the book, and as far I am concerned , the movie is better and doesn't follow close the book.<br/><br/>At it's release , was a commercial failure, Harrison Ford hate it and there are several version. I got to watch two of them. First one , on a VHS tape, with Deckard (Harrison Ford) voice over and now a director cut on DVD without the voice. Although other disagree , I liked the voice over version. It gives a good insight, goes well with the scenery and music.<br/><br/>Since the movie was made in early 80's , it has a retro style and visual effects might seem outdated by today standards. Remember, personal computers, flat screens, were in incipient state back then. Despite that, Blade Runner has a beautiful, dark, unique image and feeling . The score from Vangelis is one of the best if not the best movie score, at least for me (I love Vangelis's music).<br/><br/>It is a sad , cold icy on the spine movie, for retrospective kind of people. You will enjoy the cast (Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Edward James Olmos and his origami, ... ), the plot (despite some logic holes), the way it raise questions and of course, the final; one of the most symbolic and best movie endings. <br/><br/>I had the opportunity to first watch it several years after release, when it was just another case on a shelve of a rent store. It was a joy to discover it. I tried to recommend it to other peoples, but it seems , when hyped, doesn't have the same effect.<br/><br/>I still watch this movie , from time to time, when I want to get a cold shiver on my back.

","This is one of my favourite films. Although it was made almost thirty years ago it does not show any signs of being dated. For me it is two hours of superb entertainment and like a few other films it was a ground breaking creation when it was released. I am so glad this film was made because fortunately the care and attention it received from the cast and crew was first rate and there are times during the film when I am so captivated that time seemed to stop. Its disturbing, exciting, thought provoking, visually stunning, violent and the acting is extremely good all round. I have watched this film many times and I still cannot see how it can have been improved upon. It would be completely pointless remaking this film because the original is so good. The storyline is strong and the feel of the film is magical at times. I would highly recommend this film to anybody. It is a beautiful masterpiece and hopefully the new viewer will react positively to the experience."

","Oh, now I see! I was only two when this came out so by the time I was old enough to appreciate it the quality of the print had deteriorated somewhat(see the 1999 DVD release). With The Final Cut it's been restored to it's former glory & the exquisite elegance of the directors vision shines through. It's dark, it's gritty, well acted, the effects are brilliant (and so beautiful) and I love, love, love the soundtrack. You can tell the makers of this film really cared about it and wanted it perfect. The only part which I have to ignore when watching this film is the slightly badly developed romance, apart from that I love it - a real masterpiece."

","A thrilling-grungy-emotional somewhat misunderstood sci-Fi movie. It is just so cool. One thing that makes it kind of sad though is the fact it was a failure on it's original release. While it is a misconception that it was a box-office failure (it's gross of $32 million was over it's $28 million budget) but critics hated it. It was also a disastrous production, I won't go in to details because it would take to long. All these elements (plus the 27 cuts of it) make this a truly great movie. While it my lack action it makes up for it in dazzling effects (look for the Millennium Falcoln and a kitchen sink in the city shots) and emotional intenseness. Probably the most emotional scene is the conversation between Tyrell and Roy about life and bio-mechianics... which becomes Tyrell's death scene. Bottom line: It's just a cool movie."
"dancingtubas","10","2","5","21 July 2009"," Unlike any other sci-fi
","I have to admit, the first time I saw Blade Runner a few years ago, it completely went over my head. Mostly, I was just confused by it. I didn't think it was bad, but then again, I really didn't know what to think.<br/><br/>I saw it again a few days ago, and it completely changed my mind. I'd rate it as one of my favorite sci-fi movies now. Seeing it again made me understand it in a way I hadn't before.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the movie is engrossing. The Los Angeles of the future is nearly constantly rainy, dark, and swirling with fog. People walk away down streets with black umbrellas and a self-preserving, alienated kind of hurry. Lighted billboards for Coca Cola and Atari cut through the darkness (which oddly doesn't feel out of place). It definitely resonates film noir in a way rarely seen in movies today. The almost surreal visuals are a perfect match for the soundtrack by Vangelis. The mixture of synthesizer and saxophone definitely augments the futuristic '40s feel.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford as Deckard is actually really good. It seems like an odd role for him measured against Star Wars and Indiana Jones, but I think his understated presence in this is welcome vs. the action-star-going-in-shooting feel of some of his other roles.<br/><br/>Sean Young as Rachael does very well also. Her femme fatale character wouldn't have looked out of place in the Maltese Falcon, in my opinion. Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty had one of the most haunting monologues I've ever heard in a movie. Really. Watch it for yourself. It's unbelievable.<br/><br/>As for the two versions of the movie, the voice-over and non-voice-over version, I've seen both and don't really have a preference. I think both stand up well on their own merits. The voice-over version, even if Harrison Ford delivered it somewhat lamely, does fill in the cracks usefully and keeps to the detective-on-the-case format. The non-voice-over version is like 2001: A Space Odyssey in that it leaves more up to imagination and interpretation.<br/><br/>I'll watch this movie many more times and still never figure it out. It's got a mystique, a certain something that its viewers will never be able to put their fingers on. Rent it. Buy it. See it somehow. You won't regret it."

"kgprophet","8","2","5","9 December 2007"," Blade Runner Redux 2007 - Zhora Fires First! (just kidding)
","**This Review contains many spoilers - beware!** This is a review of the Blade Runner - Final Cut released in fall 2007. Ridley Scott has tinkered for the third time with his original work. In the 90s, his director's cut gave justice to the original piece, with no dopey narration by Harrison Ford, and a snappier ending. This time, it's just fixing famous gaffes and cleaning up the famous visual effects. I had the pleasure of seeing a showing of the ""Final Cut"" at the same theatre I saw the film throughout the 80's - the Uptown Theater in Minneapolis. I believe this is the fourth time I have viewed the film there. One thing you will be very impressed with is the quality of the print. This shall no doubt be obvious on the upcoming DVD release, as the colours are beautifully digitally enhanced. The visual effects also look very clean, and hold up very well. The cleaning up is primarily on the flying cars, they no longer have telltale black matte lines around them.<br/><br/>A couple changes caused me to laugh out loud, however. First and foremost, is the infamous Snakemaker scene, where Deckard confronts the snakemaker in his shop. In all previous versions, you could easily tell that the dialogue did not match what was shot. Now, Harrison's CGI mouth magically is saying the correct dialogue, along with the Snakemaker. Another is the scene where Deckard kills Zhora, where previously it was obvious that it was a stunt woman crashing through the windows. Now she has the CGI face of Joanna Cassidy. Then there is a change in dialogue when Roy confronts Tyrell, instead of saying ""I want Life, f*cker"", he now says a more politically correct ""I want life, father"". Sure, it fits, but why bother when everyone knows that line so well by now? That scene also has additional gore as Roy stuffs his thumbs into Tyrell's eyes. Also fixed is the annoying shot as Roy releases the bird at the end, when originally the sky changed from dark and rainy to sunny and clear. Now the bird flaps away into a dark industrial CGI sky. <br/><br/>The ""Final Cut"" thankfully has no drastic changes from the Director's Cut that came out in the 90's. Same beginning, same ending, same famous Unicorn question and same moody score (one of the best movie scores ever made). If you have the opportunity to see this print, do so. It was fascinating picking out details in the background, and scrutinising the visual effects (coolest looking scenery ever). For those who have never seen this film, please ignore some the clunky dialogue, and the ploddy pace. This movie is not a ""Terminator"" type of Sci- Fi thriller, it is a mood piece, dripping (literally) with atmosphere. For the uninitiated, the production design (conceived by Scott along with Syd Mead) inspired a new generation of Sci-Fi Grunge, where the future had a retro look to it, and had a noir quality. Christopher Nolan admitted that he based the look of the new ""Batman Begins"" franchise on Blade Runner. <br/><br/>This movie still rates about an 8 out of a 10. Even after viewing it about 15 times."
"fedor8","Null","2","5","9 August 2007"," Not for the brain-dead.
","Possibly the best sci-fi movie of all time, and one of the very best in any genre. From whichever angle one looks at it, it is almost flawless. The mood created here by the sublime soundtrack (that fits to this film like a child-molestation lawsuit to Michael Jackson), the sets, and the photography, presented something utterly new when the movie came out, and the film hasn't been rivaled since. Like Scott's previous sci-fi hit, ""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"" has been often copied with pathetic results. There is a certain melancholy about the movie that is hard to describe, in spite of being a sci-fi thriller. The cast is terrific, especially Rutger Hauer who is just perfect as the short-lived android. The scene at the end between Ford and Hauer, when the latter spares the former's life, is one of the most powerful ever filmed. (Anyone who has seen the film and yet doesn't understand what I mean by this can't be helped.) The story is intelligent, thought-provoking just as true science fiction should be. And yet, the movie is based on a book by an overrated writer, Philip K.Dick! It's a bit ironic, but a similar thing happened when Kubrick turned King's trashy novel ""Shining"" into a brilliant horror film. Yes, movies can turn crap into gold, don't ask me how. Kubrick and Scott are some sort of alchemists...<br/><br/>The Director's Cut I haven't seen yet. It lacks the narration and has a more ambiguous ending."

","I have heard quite a bit about Blade Runner lately, from a friend, on TV, my movie book, and my mom, so I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, so I rented it and just watched it tonite and I have to say that this was a very strange and disturbingly beautiful film. My only problem with it, is that it was just the more expensive Terminator in some ways. But I did enjoy the story, despite how weird it was, it is a film I haven't really seen. I loved the effects, it just amazes me how realistic they were compared to today's technology, not to mention the moral of the story still needs to be recognized in today's society.<br/><br/>In the year 2019, we have created a type of machine, looks and acts like a human, only they are stronger and smarter, they are called Replicants. But due to a violent act they are forbidden from entering planet Earth; 4 replicants have made it to Earth and want their lives expanded from 4 years to so many more. Rick Deckard, a retired Blade Runner, rejoins the force to stop these replicants, but ends up realizing who might be the true enemy.<br/><br/>It's very interesting and very visually stunning, but I wasn't incredibly impressed, at least with all the hype I heard with it. I can understand why, because it was a huge break through for the time, but still for me, I enjoy the Terminator films when it comes to a futuristic robot film. But I would never not recommend this movie, just for the sake that you can say you saw it, and you never know, I think you'll give it a proud 10, but I'm going to stick with my rating.<br/><br/>7/10"

","(ATTENTION: SPOILERS) Blade Runner is a good film; I gave it 7/10. If I was around in 1982, I probably would have been blown away and thought it was the best thing I'd ever seen. But since I'm pretty young, I've been jaded by many other sci-fi masterpieces. I saw Blade Runner for the first time only a few years ago.<br/><br/>Here are the positives: Brilliant cinematography, thought-provoking subject matter, great special effects (for 1982), a haunting score (the scene where Deckard shoots the chick replicant in the clear raincoat is seared in my memory), rich set design, and adequate acting.<br/><br/>Here are some negatives: Very slow pace (yes, I have been too affected today's films), completely unbelievable scientific advancements (especially for 2019), and bad sound effects. I had a hard time buying into the whole interrogation of replicants. If they're man-made ""organisms,"" there has to be an easier way to distinguish them (maybe a DNA test or something). I also had a hard time believing that Deckard and Rachel were in love. That part of the story was lacking.<br/><br/>Other films since Blade Runner (like Bicentennial Man and A.I.) have dealt with the same philosophical questions about the meaning of life and at what point does a ""robot"" become a person. I'm not saying that the two films I mentioned were better (cuz I'd get torn a new one) but I saw them before I saw Blade Runner and thus had already been exposed to the ""cyberpunk"" world and its philosophical questions.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's my abridged opinion."

","I rented this at Blockbuster after thinking about it for a very, very long time. A friend of mine had recommended to check this out, and that I should go for the Director's Cut version. So naturally I got quite excited when I found this in said rental store and noticed that it was indeed the Director's Cut. When I finally sat down to watch it, I was immediately engrossed in the action. Not long after it starts, something happens. Then the movie kind of slows down... a lot. It keeps that slow pace for a very long time... and then something happens again... and it returns to the slow pace. The whole movie is like that... mostly slow, with a burst of action here and there. I don't know if this was on purpose or not... but as a result, I found the movie mostly dull. Just for the record, I wasn't expecting a huge action-packed sci-fi shoot-everything-you-see extravaganza. The plot is pretty good, just very oddly paced. The acting is pretty much flawless. The actors playing Replicants have to portray a adult characters with the emotional maturity of a young child... and they pull it off perfectly. The special effects are amazing; quite an accomplishment for the time the film was made.<br/><br/>*MINOR SPOILERS*<br/><br/>One of my biggest problems with this film is that the investigative portion of the film doesn't seem to hold water... Deckard pretty much runs into each of the Replicants casually, rather than figure out where they are, or where they will go.<br/><br/>*END SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Now, what I found great about this film(and the main reason everyone loves it, I would suspect) is the great theological and ethical questions it asks. Chief of them would probably be: If we actually created Artificial Intelligence(A.I.), would it be right to consider them lesser creatures... as opposed to equals? It also demonstrates how everything we create are for our own use, not for the greater good. And how everything we create, we exploit and use. The film holds many truths about human nature and much food for thought, stuff that will create discussions between you and your friends... but not enough. Having watched this so close to my second viewing of Abre Los Ojos, I can't help but compare... and this just loses right away. In the end, this is a very good sci-fi film with astounding visuals and some depth, but I fail to see how it's the best sci-fi film of all time. I recommend this to fans of science fiction, particularly of the works of Philip K. Dick(since apparently this is a very accurate representation of his novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep... one I have yet to find and read). Be prepared for a oddly paced and somewhat slow film, though. 8/10"

Acting is on the same level. One shot characters chat, another one goes to sleep ignoring everything, then cuts to something else. Seriously? Also acting is just plain wrong, I don't know if they have seen themselves in it. It's like a bad rehearsal. I can only give it 4 out of 10, just because of the hype, actors (their caliper more than anything else), props and effects. I can see there was some effort put in but... I don't know what everyone else is raving about. It is mediocre in terms of cinematography, acting, plot, everything.

","Well, I guess I must have totally missed the point again... I did not see a Sci-Fi masterpiece with astonishingly progressive visual effects and a flawlessly adapted screenplay, but an over-ambitious and difficult to digest drama epic with a lack of action. But hey, ""Blade Runner"" is ranked pretty high in the IMDb top 250 and all the professional reviews are singing praise, so my humble opinion is probably something you shouldn't bother to read. Although, for the record, the only version I've seen is the original theatrical version and  supposedly  only the 1992 director's cut version is a genuine masterpiece. Unquestionably terrific is Ridley Scott's portrayal of our world by the year 2019, when the cities look exactly like predicted in Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" with immense 300-storey skyscrapers and pure decay down below on the streets. The future is ugly and petrifying and it looks like nobody can smile anymore. In this sad and unappealing universe, Rick Deckard is an early retired ""Blade Runner"" whose duty was to eliminate android fugitives, called Replicants, that escaped from extraterrestrial colonies. Deckard is called back because four of the most dangerous Replicants are on an earthly mission to increase their miserable life-span of only four years. The film's biggest disappointment  other than the tiresome voice over by Ford and the dreadful jazzy soundtrack  are the characterizations of these android Replicants. Supposedly they're relentless villains that already made over 30 casualties on their way over to earth, yet when they're face to face with their enemies  humans  they don't look the least bit menacing or dangerous at all! Neither do they evoke feeling of understanding or sympathy, they just behave like philosophical talkers; especially the ""leader"" Roy Batty. The love-story sequences between Ford and robotic beauty Sean Young feel like pure melodramatic padding whereas sublime actors in intriguing supportive roles (M.

","Many people say you won't enjoy this film on your first viewing, hell will freeze over before i watch this again!The initial synopsis was good but it was poorly converted into a well-rounded story, to the extent that you will ask yourself a billion questions afterwards.The acting was generally terrible and the characters felt 2d. My rating is only justified by the art direction and special effects which gave the film a unique atmosphere, sadly they didn't improve the story. This film has weathered in time and should be kept locked away as it just disappoints many people. My advice to any potential viewers is to just re-watch terminator or star wars, you will enjoy it more."

","I have to say, I ama big fan of PKD's novel ""Do Andrpids Dream of Electric Sheep"" which this film was a retelling of.<br/><br/>It might as well not be. Every single philosophical theme from the novel was excluded and instead replaced by long, dull scenes where nothing happens.<br/><br/>No character from this movie was ever examined, no motivations were given and no character progression happened. The whole subplot with religion and mood organs was excluded. Those were the things that actually mattered.<br/><br/>The replicants aren't supposed to be murdering machines. That's not the point, In the novel there's a clear motive behind why they need to be killed and we can sympathize with them. Here, they're just regular bad guys.<br/><br/>The biggest offender, that actually made me turn the movie off, was the Luba Luft assassintion scene. Or whatever she was called in the movie. The whole android police force part was ommited from the story as well as development of the android. Instead , all we got was a nude scene, followed by a chase scene and Deckard killing her mercilessly in a minute. Then it was like it never happened.<br/><br/>I don't know what happened after that and I frankly don't want to. I don't want to see the novel butchered completely."

"hunter-friesen","6","2","6","1 October 2017"," A technical masterpiece that makes you think, but isn't that exciting to watch.
","Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is a dark science fiction film that doesn't follow the usual narrative you would expect. It takes its time to play out and brings up many philosophical questions. Blade Runner is a visual and technical masterpiece but is not a very lively film that keeps you engaged and drags from beginning to end. <br/><br/>The plot follows Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) as a blade runner in 2019. Blade runners are the police that specialize in hunting and eliminating android look-alikes of humans known as Replicants. Four replicants have escaped from an off-world colony and have come back to Earth and Deckard is tasked with eliminating them. Since replicants are perfect copies of humans, hunting them down is a very difficult process. This makes the audience question which characters are human and which are replicant. The film follows a police mystery narrative where the protagonist has to track down the bad guys using evidence and intellect. We follow Deckard along as he travels around 2019 Los Angeles trying to find each individual replicant. <br/><br/>The biggest problem with the film is its pacing. It is very slow at setting up the story and keeping the mystery alive. It feels much longer than its 117-minute runtime. The film speeds to a medium pace once Deckard finds his first Replicant, but it's too little too late. Having a slow film allows Scott to build a world around Deckard's story. Every detail and supporting fact has its own backstory and is open to more exploration. I expect Denis Villeneuve's sequel to dive further and revisit the same questions. <br/><br/>The most important element of the film is its ability to raise valuable and complex questions about humanity. We know exactly which characters are replicants, but we never know the background stories of the human characters. We just assume they're human, but never really know who they are and their motivations. <br/><br/>Having these questions distances the film from other sci-fi films of the 80's. It feels that this film was intended for people tired of the usual sci-fi films that follow Star Wars model where the characters are either good or evil and the audience is kept entertained with action and adventure. Scott has taken that trope and flipped it the other way around, creating a dark, dystopian film where every character has different questionable personal motives and isn't labeled as good or evil. <br/><br/>The biggest aspect of the film is the technical work behind the scenes that make the world feel more real and lively. The visual effects are masterful for the time period and still look quite good thirty-five years later. The large urban setting completely surrounds the small characters and enhances the dystopian setting. <br/><br/>Another minor problem with the film is the acting. Harrison Ford does an alright job as the hard and almost lifeless cop Rick Deckard. Rutger Hauer is the only highlight as the lead replicant, Roy. His character is never made into a clear villain and we end up feeling sorry for him as he searches for purpose in his short life. There is nothing special or memorable about the other characters.<br/><br/>With the sequel, Blade Runner 2049, arriving next week, moviegoers should make it a mission to watch this to get a feel for what to expect. This is not the usual sci-fi action film that you most likely grew up on and I expect the sequel to follow that same trend. You'll most likely get more enjoyment researching this film and thinking about it rather than actually watching it."
"PredragReviews","10","2","6","13 May 2016"," ""All those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain""
","""Blade Runner"" is one of the ultimate sci-fi/cult movies of all time and right up there as one of my very favorite films. The atmosphere is wonderfully consistent and really draws you in. As with Ridley Scott films in general the camera work and visuals are superb (the scene where Deckard runs a VoidCom test on Sean Young's replicant, and the window gradually turns opaque springs to mind). The effects still look great, remarkable considering the film is now more than twenty years old.<br/><br/>The film looks better than ever here, with the re-mastered picture and sound quality and the very subtle use of CGI to clear up things like out-of-sync dialog, support wires on the spinners and the obvious stunt-double for Joanna Cassidy's character Zhora; all helping to maintain the endless feeling of plausibility that the world of Blade Runner presents. The only new addition that seemed slightly strange to me was in clearing up the original confusion as to how many replicants were actually missing. Much of the film's mystique revolves around the central question as to whether or not Deckard is, in fact, a replicant; a theory that initially came about due to a dubbing error during Deckard's briefing with Captain Bryant. Given that Scott has been one of the most vocal supporters of this theory, it seems odd to me that he would correct this line of dialog in such a way that destroys any real mystery surrounding the ""Deckard as replicant"" debate. There are so many layers to Blade Runner and so many things that can be said from the brilliant look of the newly restored cut, the awesome remixed sound, the Original Score by Vangelis, and the story itself. Without question, Blade Runner is a significant work of science-fiction cinema that manages to overcome any such flaws in character or narrative to take us on a trip into a world far beyond anything we've ever seen before.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 10 out of 10."

Harrison Ford plays a futuristic cop named rick deckard whose job is to hunt down replicants (robots with human skin) and assassinate them. they call these special cops Blade Runners.

Every frame is Epic. This is the best interpretation of a character by Harrison Ford. No other artist could play a soundtrack of this grandeur like Papathanassiou did. In my opinion, the best soundtrack of all. The scenarios are majestic, the pace is the right one, the mood is incredible and the story still touches me. Visually this movie is absolutely stunning.

"irma-95","8","2","6","16 May 2014"," Blade runner is not a perfect movie but it has its merits..
","What I have noticed throughout the reviews is that Blade Runner is highly rated or poorly rated. Some say that it is a recognized spectacular science-based movie and others say that it is just a poor adaptation of the book by Philip K Dick ""Do androids dream of electronic sheep"". I find myself in between these two types of critiques.<br/><br/>I feel that this movie is useful for film directors as it enhance the use of some techniques that were rarely seen at the time Blade Runner came out (1982) . But other than beautifully made special effects (for example to create the LA of the future) and Vangelis's soundtrack I don't personally like the story's narration. The approach to the year 2019 is poorly explained, we are immersed in a future that is foreign to us and have little description to understand it. The Replicants are robots created to help humans but inevitably end up showing some emotions (as Rachel) and the blade runner (Harrison Ford) tries to catch a glimpse of this humanity in them because astonished by it. In close ups it is shown how actors perfectly control their face expressions; their performance is excellent throughout the movie. The problem remains that when the audience comes at the end of the movie some questions are left unanswered. In the movie Pris tells Sebastian: ""is that why you are still on Earth?"" humans are in this Off-World place.. but since when? and why? We don't get any deep description of any action or any character. There is a restricted narrative because the audience in 1982 is mesmerized by this future, science-fiction movies always have this power to amaze with their special effects and with their frequent jump cuts. <br/><br/>This movie has to be deeply analyzed and frequently watched to understand it completely. I feel that the people that rate it really low haven't watched this movie enough. But to give it a 10 I would disagree for the reasons discussed earlier."

","Dark, deep, uncertain, unsettling – imagine the most beautiful nightmare you've ever had – this is Blade Runner (1982).<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is a brilliantly crafted science fiction film that not only touches upon, but bravely plunges into deep philosophical questions, making it simply ten times more important than any film of its genre. I love it not only for the initial feeling it gives, but because of its perseverance – none of the visuals, themes or technology feel dated but as deep, gripping and current as ever. It is timeless beauty with huge doses of emotion.<br/><br/>Set in 2019 Los Angeles, Blade Runner zooms in on the eerily-lit, urban streets of the city and follows Richard Deckard – superbly played by Harrison Ford who brings an exquisite moral ambiguity to his character – a special policeman who tracks down and terminates artificially-created humans called replicants, who have escaped from an Off-World colony and made their way to earth and need to be stopped. The things Deckard encounters on his detective journey raise many philosophical questions like: Who is really a replicant? Are replicants really bad? If replicants are bad, when why did we go to such lengths with our technology to create them? Are replicants really humans? Is Deckard a hero? This truly is a film that demands subsequent discussion and its ambiguous ending leave a haunting and eerie feeling.<br/><br/>In spite of a rich glaze of science fiction and futurism coating this adventure, there are distinct film noir elements present – primarily in the bluish haze that the film is seen through and its gritty urban atmosphere. Whoever thought of this combination is a genius. Since it is all about technology, it fits then that Blade Runner features a ridiculous amount of product placement, especially from Atari. In any other film, this would have felt out-of-place but here it is simply perfect. The score by Vangelis is strangely gripping when combined with the striking cinematography of the film.<br/><br/>Blade Runner deserves credit, celebration and remembrance for it is simply an excellent film.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 (and I don't just throw this grade out like SOME people)"
"sme_no_densetsu","8","2","6","21 June 2013"," Fascinating but flawed
","Recently, I re-watched ""Blade Runner"" after having read the source novel for the first time. I had previously seen both the 1992 Director's Cut and the 2007 Final Cut, neither of which made much of an impression on me. Nevertheless, I decided to give the film yet another chance and I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>This time I dove into the exhaustive Four-Disc Collector's Edition DVD from 2007. Starting with the international theatrical cut, I moved onto the director's cut and, finally, the 'final' cut. Watching three versions of the film in as many days allowed me to appreciate the fine detail and to better assimilate the movie's intellectual content.<br/><br/>For those unfamiliar with the story, it concerns a police officer (Harrison Ford) who is tasked with hunting down a group of replicants (read: androids). His job is complicated by the fact that these replicants look and act almost exactly like humans. This is the setup that propels the film's action but it also opens up the film to some serious metaphysical speculation.<br/><br/>The acting is surprisingly impressive for a science fiction movie. Harrison Ford is pretty dependable throughout even though he's overshadowed by both Sean Young & Rutger Hauer. Meanwhile, the supporting cast is populated with several talented actors including Daryl Hannah, Edward James Olmos & James Hong, to name just a few.<br/><br/>Perhaps the strongest aspect of the film is the visuals, though. Ridley Scott's direction is impeccable and the cinematography of Jordan Cronenweth is exquisite. Even the now thirty-year-old special effects still look good, if not as seamless as today's best efforts. The finely detailed production design also deserves special mention.<br/><br/>Musically, the film benefits greatly from a score by Vangelis. I wouldn't call it timeless by any stretch of the imagination but it nevertheless feels perfectly suited to the film.<br/><br/>If the movie has a weak link, it's the script. The theatrical cut is routinely derided for its voice-over and compromised ending but the fact is that they were added for a reason. The narrative is obscure at times and I'm not completely satisfied with the movie's preferred ending. That being said, the story's depth is impressive, even though not all of its ideas are presented with equal effectiveness.<br/><br/>In the end, I've arrived at the conclusion that the film is something of a flawed masterpiece. No version of the film that I've seen strikes me as 100% successful. And if you're expecting a relatively faithful adaptation of the book, you certainly won't find it here. I think that reading the novel and seeing the theatrical cut certainly helped me to appreciate the movie more but not everyone has the time or patience for that. Personally, I feel that this is one of those movies that merits watching and re-watching but, when you come down to it, ""Blade Runner"" certainly isn't for everyone."
"patryk-czekaj","9","2","6","7 June 2012"," Ridley Scott's breathtaking look into the future
","First of all, I must mention that I strongly urge you to watch Blade Runner Director's Cut, as it doesn't include the distracting and unnecessary narration, and offers a truly great ending, one that's in adequate correlation with the tone and character of the whole picture. <br/><br/>I have always admired Ridley Scott's uncanny abilities that allow him to create an intangible idea of a distant universe in his own mind and then recreate it as a directorial masterpiece. Even though that the world presented in Alien and the one shown in Blade Runner are different, they connect in an apparent manner, which instantly makes the viewer realize that this is precisely Scott's outstanding creation.<br/><br/>After a spectacular introduction to a cyber-punk Los Angeles of the 2019, the viewer is quickly drawn into a fantastic sci-fi plot, made up of the smallest, most gripping details. The beauty of this film lies in the fact that it's mainly the intelligent idea that builds up this thrilling story, not spectacular battles, special effects, or unreal creatures.<br/><br/>Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is forced to start a dangerous mission, which involves hunting replicants, human clones that got out of control somewhere in the process and must be terminated immediately (a nice swap for the word 'kill', I must say). As the viewer roams around the city with Deckard, he is introduced to some of the most brilliant minds, and some of the most devious characters, that combine to make an utterly impetuous mix of views and prospects. Deckard is able to hunt down all of the four clones that are running on the city's territory, but before he is be able to finally get rid of them he is taken on a tantalizing ride of a lifetime, one that will change his opinion about the situation of the entire human kind. And the viewer comes along, able to enjoy the magnificent landscape of LA of the future (note, it's not hard to notice the resemblance pictured in The Fifth Element).<br/><br/>Harrison Ford definitely in one of his best roles, as a seemingly lifeless man, who somehow manages to change his attitude during the assignment and realize that not only is he about to become a sort of redemption for the town and its community, but also that he may find true love along the way.<br/><br/>The whole meaning and complexity of the storyline is implicated with various philosophical references and penetrating implementations of scary visions, which may actually come to life one day. All of this is strengthen with the masterful play on vividly sombre tone, visual experiences, eerie background music, and characteristic atmosphere that surrounds us all the time. And paradoxically, the slow sequences that emerge sometimes are actually only increasing the pace.<br/><br/>The final confrontation between Rick and Roy (Rutger Hauer), the strongest and most intelligent of the replicants bunch, is just a cherry on top, so to say. It's definitely one of the best duels in the history of movies (the moment, when he breaks Rick's fingers in an act of revenge - probably one of the most memorable scenes ever). At the right moment, we discover that even Roy is capable of developing some human emotions, which leads to a very interesting and surprising conclusion.<br/><br/>All in all, it's safe to say that Blade Runner is one of the most magnificent and clever science- fiction movies ever created. It's deep message, fascinating cinematography, and strong storyline will astound everyone. I highly recommend it."

","...I didn't really get it. I recall I had tried watching the Director's Cut years ago on VHS but for one reason or another never bothered to get to the end of the film. I've only just watched it (Dec 2009) in full for the first time, and was yawning most of the way through.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this and enjoyed the atmosphere of many of the scenes. But the plot was just slow and a bit dull. It didn't seem clear whether or not Deckard may or may not be a replicant, which is something I particularly hate - I like things to be clearcut, not open and vague and left to ""interpretation"". I'm not stupid either, whatever you may think.<br/><br/>I get the impression that lovers of Ridley Scott, Film Noir, Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer could not imagine that anyone could slag off this film, and I don't mean to disappoint. But I have to be honest, this film just didn't do it for me.<br/><br/>Maybe, other versions of the film make things clearer."

"Rautus","10","2","6","18 February 2008"," A unique Sci-fi movie
","Legendary writer Philip K Dick wrote the classic novel Do Andriods Dream of Electric Sheep? It was then adapted into a film titled Blade Runner. The film is a memorable sci-fi movie and very unique, when I first watched this I wasn't quite sure how to take it. It was good but I didn't quite understand it fully but after a second viewing it became a lot more clear for me and I enjoyed it more. I found Blade Runner to be a compelling and moving Si-fi movie, it has some really outstanding effects that still look great today. The shots of the City is breathtaking and amazing to look at, Ridley Scott does a great job directing Blade Runner. The acting is great, Rutger Hauer does a powerful performance as the Replicant Roy Batty. The scene at the end where Roy talks about about Tears in the rain is really moving and makes you feel sad for the character since he's only trying to continue living in this world, Harrison Ford does a great job as the Blade Runner Deckard.<br/><br/>Blade Runner has five different versions which have there similarities and differences, when Blade Runner was released Ridley Scott was slightly disappointed with the Theatrical version Cut and calls it his least favourite version of the film, the International version is near identical to the Theatrical version version except there's more violence shown, the 1992 Directors Cut version has a few added things including the Unicorn scene which people thought was just taken from the movie Legend (Also directed by Ridley Scott) to add something new but Ridley Scott said that the Unicorn scene was filmed for Blade Runner is not footage taken from Legend, the Workprint version was the first version of Blade Runner and features many differences compared to the later versions such has a different opening title sequence, different music and an alternate narration by Deckard, the 2007 Final Cut is the definitive version of Blade Runner and is stared to be Ridley Scott's favourite since it's how he wanted to Blade Runner to be like, Blade Runner's been digitally remastered for the Final Cut so it has better picture quality, better sound and edited scenes like the scene were Deckard speaks to the owner of the store is now in sync when before it wasn't.<br/><br/>The film sees a group of human copies known has Replicants going renegade. Deckard is asked to become a Blade Runner again and find these Replicants then Retire them, in the future the world has two types of people, humans and Replicants. A Replicant is a copy of a human and has a four year life span which was created as a fail safe device if ever they tried to rebel against humans, a Blade Runner is a cop who hunts Replicants that's gone rebellious and then Retire them. This Replicant group is lead by a Replicant named Roy Batty are trying to find away to prolong there life before it runs out and will stop at nothing until the get it. Deckard meets a female Replicant named Rachael who starts to help him on his case, meanwhile one of the Replicants befriends a man who helped create them and try and use him meet the creator of the Replicants to find out how to make themselves live longer before there life span is over meanwhile Deckard starts to get closer to Retiring the group of Replicants but Roy Batty won't give up without a fight and Deckard may be facing his most dangerous Replicant. <br/><br/>People expecting a action packed Sci-fi movie may be disappointed since Blade Runner focuses more on dialogue and intense dramatic scenes, it does have some action but that's not the main theme for Blade Runner.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is a unique and classic Science fiction movie that should be seen. Check this out. 10/10"
"henry-girling","7","2","6","3 November 2003"," Lovely to look at....that's it.
","'Blade Runner' may be the most over rated film of 1982. It is lovely to look at, and all without the use of CGI. The Tyrell Building is a real eye opener. The rain washed streets, the colours and shadows, the flying cars and the floating advertisement craft, the light lancing through broken rooves, the smashing of glass and so forth. It all looks great. It is a truly realised environment.<br/><br/>Within this is a story as thin as a blade but without any bite. The director's cut without the noir-ish voice over is hardly any better. Harrison Ford is an ordinary actor and his performance here is dull. He is overwhelmed by the scenery. It is Han Solo re-cycled and doesn't convince for a minute.<br/><br/>There are excellent actors in it but have very underdeveloped roles. Interesting actors like Edward James Olmos. M Emmet Walsh, Joanna Cassidy and Joe Turkel are wasted. Rutger Hauer is splendid however and gives a powerful and oddly touching performance. To see his film decline the way it did was sad to see. Good roles like this one came to him too infrequently.<br/><br/>The film is the usual Ridley Scott product. Lovely to look at and that's it. I can't imagine why some people rave about it as they do."

","I trying hard to understand why Ridley Scott's 1982 ""classic"" BLADE RUNNER has such a lofty reputation.  True, the special effects were outstanding for 1982.  Okay, I'll admit it, the effects were even good by today's standards. Harrison Ford and the rest of the cast give good performances.  There were quite a few things to like.  Unfortunately this movie suffers because it basically has 45 minutes of plot stretched out into two hours.  There are LONG gaps between dialogue.  Quite a bit of screen time is given just looking at the scenery (which, while impressive, gets tiresome after you've seen the same thing 3 or 4 times).  The grim future depicted in this film has served as a visual inspiration to many science fiction movies released in the last 20 years (The Fifth Element, A.I., and Star Wars: Attack of the Clones come to mind), but that alone is not enough reason to declare the film a classic."

"Dello_","7","1","2","12 February 2020"," I will trigger the hardcore fans
","I'm going to say it immediately: I didn't particularly like the overall design of the futuristic Los Angeles. Ok, I've said it, I've said it. Now I'll articulate better what I think about this movie. As I said I wasn't fond of the design but not because it's ugly or what, it's just my personal taste. Indeed if we consider the time when it came out (1982), the work done is remarkable and the instances where you think: ""this has aged badly"" are like two or three and it's pretty impressive. But it wasn't for me. Even with the plot I had some problems but I liked a lot other things. The story is simple and linear and there wasn't an unexpected moment but it's instead prevedibile in a lot of ways. On the other hand I was on board because of the charismatic protagonist and the memorable villain, that steals the show every time he is on the screen. But most importantly what I liked more is the mysterious sense about some plot points. In fact, despite a linear story, there are some elements here and there that makes you wonder about the real nature of some characters and the film does not answer to these questions. And I personally like when a movie leaves you with some thinking about what's the right interpretation even if there's no a clear one.
And so overall I liked ""Blade Runner"" (the final cut) but, even if I recognised the enormous importance it has on the history of cinema, I don't think it's the masterpiece a lot of people claims this movie to be."

I think everything that can possibly be said about this Masterpiece of Cinema has already been written & discussed about for years & years now!!!<br/><br/>I will just say that this is still my favourite HARRISON FORD movie & it's Director Ridley Scott's Masterpiece of Cinema, also the late great RUTGER HAUER was magnificent in his iconic role & he's cemented in the Hollywood Hall of Fame & a piece of Cinema History for his performance here!!!
The legendary Harrison Ford is also iconic & excellent here as Replicant Hunter Detective ""Deckard"" & he is amazing on screen & created probably the most famous movie Detective of all time as he investigates deeper in to the dark Noir infused, smokey & rain drenched streets of the futuristic Los City, the cinematography & look of this film are unmatched by anything else in the sci-fi genre since!!! All aspects of this production are flawless, the special effects are still breathtakingly beautiful as is the truly beautiful, haunting & emotional soundtrack by Vengelis, that soundtrack album is a Masterpiece in itself!!!
The performance from Ford is fantastic as he's a tough Detective but is also clearly lost & seems to not know his place in this dark future he's in & he plays it perfectly.
I adore ""Blade Runner"" & it's one of my all time favourite movies, it's still exciting every single time i rewatch this Classic.
The dark themes of a lost world & the ever changing times & our reliance on technology is always more & more relevant each day.
Blade Runner is a timeless classic.<br/><br/>But put aside all the relevance stuff & hidden meanings, themes & messages, as this is still a great futuristic Detective Thriller with some Amazing scenes & stunning set pieces, a wonderful movie of the highest quality.

","I had never seen Blade Runner until very recently but I had always heard great things about it and have always had it recommended to me but for some reason I just never got around to watching it then in December 2019 I finally sit down and watched it on Blu Ray and discovered the movie takes place in November 2019 kind of a weird but perfect coincidence.<br/><br/>The movie follows Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) a Blade Runner who's job it is to hunt down and kill Replicants advanced Synthetic androids who look, sound and act human and even bleed like a human the only way to tell them apart is by an advanced polygraph test that is designed to provoke an emotional response and monitor reactions of pupil dilations to measure a correct emotional response. Deckard is tasked with bringing down four Replicants to do so he must follow a trail of almost impossible bread crumbs that will lead him to his targets before they can track down the one person that can extend their lifespan and make them whole their father and creator who designed them.<br/><br/>The amazing cinematography in this movie is mind blowing and really does stand out with it's unique and cool Noir style and with Harrison Ford as the badass and cool futuristic detective Deckard this movie is a unique and visually stylish science fiction masterpeice that tells a unique and interesting story that takes it's time building suspence that leads up to an amazing third act where the hunter becomes the hunted.<br/><br/>The supporting cast and Co star's do an amazing job and includes Daryl Hannah as the beautiful looking but deadly replicant (Pris) and Rutgar Hauer as the lead replicant (Roy Batty) who only wants one thing to extend his life and be a free replicant and will go to any lengths to make that happen.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this science fiction masterpeice I urge you to give it a watch it took me over 20 years to finally watch it and I wish I had watched it sooner as it is now one of my favourite science fiction movies."

","I am not entirely sure how it has taken me all my life until this point in time to finally watch Blade Runner. I treated myself to the final cut, and within minutes I was completely enthralled in this dystopian world. Unfortunately, I watched this on my phone at 1am, so will be purchasing a Blu Ray copy of it in the future, I should think.<br/><br/>Everything about this is just so perfect in every way; Vangelis' score, the cinematography, the atmosphere and the crushing parallels to real-life 2019. It is enough to bring one to tears, speaking so freely, the gorgeous and terrifying world is so enthralling. A new favourite of mine."

","Blade Runner is stunning. It is one of the most beautiful films ever made. It has a great story, great performances, terrific action and eventually leaves a solid impact. I have seen the final cut, and I really liked it. Despite the very slow pace, I could actually enjoy the film and get amazed at this high-quality filmmaking.<br/><br/>This film isn't fast-paced and doesn't simply jump to the main story within minutes. The first half sets up the characters and conflict, eventually followed by well-executed action sequences and intriguing character drama along with some really good twists. The rainy weather seemed to work for me. Most of the film happens at night, thus creating its own stylish atmosphere.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford plays his part brilliantly and so does Rutger Hauer.<br/><br/>There's a good amount of intensity that makes it a very intriguing watch. Blade Runner is undoubtedly one of the best sci-fi action movies of all time, also because it portrays 2019 in a realistic way. I now need to check out other versions and its sequel soon."

","The number one movie I always say when someone asks me which movie is my number one favorite movie of all time.<br/><br/>I am a film director and always avoid answering which movie is my 'number one favorite of all time' when my friends ask me.
The answer is complicated because I started to appreciate more and more movies out of different reasons, and it is not a competition. It would be insincere to choose only one, so you can always make a list of movies that inspired you out of different reasons, and from different perspectives.
Maybe the best answers would be the movies you love from your childhood.
Blade Runner survives all the filters and for me it became an easy answer.
The number one favorite movie of all time for me in fact is Blade Runner and I will never change that answer, without any further explanation.<br/><br/>Blade Runner inspires me and the favorite scene and quote unquestionably is:
I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the TannhÃ¤user Gate.

"carpenterbee-99254","10","1","2","20 December 2019"," The Best Sci Fi Film Ever Made!! (RIP Rutger Hauer)
","Blade Runner (Directors Cut and Final Cut) is simply the best sci film I've ever scene it captures everything I want from a sci fi, the characters, the dialogue, the atmosphere, the quirkiness, the great villain (antagonist). The list goes on and on...<br/><br/>Harrison Ford who plays Rick Deckard his most subtle and his most overshadowed role of his career in my opinion. He is subtle and complex. Not like his other famous roles. He plays a very different character who is more flawed so more human and relatable. Harrison Ford is simply perfect in this role.<br/><br/>Sean Young who plays Rachael is simply fantastic. She is one of my favourite female side characters in film. She is a beautiful yet tragic character who you just feel for emotionally the most in the entire film.<br/><br/>Rutger Hauer who plays Roy Batty is simply the shinning Actor of the film and the most underrated character in cinema easily and so is Rutger Hauer who is simply does one of the best and moving movie performances ever. Rutger also wrote the iconic lines for the most iconic scene in the film ""Tears in Rain"" which is fantasticly written by Rutger and Ridley. He is the best character in this movie. And the clear character standout who isnt talked about enough.
RIP Rutger Hauer Thank You!!<br/><br/>This film has the best soundtrack I've ever heard in the film quite possibly and that's almost impossible to decide but this ones definitely up there. Its Vangelis's Magum Opus. The soundtrack makes the film perfect.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott the writer and Director of Blade Runner made a cinematic masterpiece that will stick with me forever and is a film everyone should watch. But may take a few viewing to fully appreciate it and becomes more and more flawless and perfect with each watch.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched it and you read through my review I hope I have convinced you to go watch and thank you for reading my opinion :)"
"fredroyer","8","1","2","18 December 2019"," Manufactured Memories
","This is an amazing movie. Even all these years later, other directors are still staging climatic battles in the rain, in decrepit buildings or on the rooftop. I think Last Action Hero is the most blatant ripoff. Even Batman V Superman had the titular battle in the rain, starting on the roof then proceeding into the decrepit building - at least they reversed it.<br/><br/>This movie is about a manufactured being who is unaware he may be manufactured, and that his memories might be fake. So Harrison Ford is a natural for the lead.<br/><br/>It's also remarkable for the massive interference foisted on the film by the financiers. Most people, when watching this for the first time, can sense there is something deeper on the surface.<br/><br/>Since the story is about events that may or may not be colored, complete with characters who not only make the memories, but make the body parts for other manufactured beings. The implication is noir - an implied narrator who is coloring the world. The studio forced a voice over narration on the film, thus destroying that narrative. Most audiences hate to be hit over the head with exposition, so the film was flop, naturally. The later version would restore the original vision.<br/><br/>I consider this the last hurrah of the old school optical visual effects movie. They did everything they could do with the technology of that time, and since the camera can't move, the perspectives are all borrowed from Olson Welles, especially his Macbeth movie. You have to appreciate the artistry, because those are optically composited images. The combination of production design and visual effects was intended to inform you of the world you are visiting - that you didn't need to have anything explained to you.<br/><br/>You should see Ridley's ""The Duellists"". There is little to no exposition."
"orobuciuks","8","1","2","28 November 2019"," Visually astounding
","The athmosphere, created by Blade Runner is like no other. It not only immerses, but also creates a realistic world, which is strange to write, because I watched this movie in 2019.
I love, that it didn't explain the world too much, showed only the detail absolutely necessery for the story.
Visually this movie is 10 in my books - I'm a sucker for those (that's why Space Odyssey is my favorite move of all time).
However, performances lack. Rutger Hauer gave the best one - he is amazing, especially at the end. But others - not so much. The performances at times are strange, not following the characters. But from that side, overall, they don't take you ot off movie.
Also, the characters, their motivations, some actions or feelings they ""show"" (sometimes they don't show any at all) are without any actual justifiable reason. That's why I give it an 8. Because of some ordinary performances and rare bad writing. Probably would give it less, but ohhhh the world they build - it's gorgeous....."

"ShanTeaTime","6","1","2","2 November 2019"," The Film That Started The Question ""What Makes Us Human?""
","A 1982 Science-Fiction film set in the year 2019 Los Angeles. Here, synthetic humans known as replicants are bio-engineered by the powerful Tyrell Corporation to work on off-world colonies. When a fugitive group of Nexus-6 replicants led by Roy Batty escapes back to Earth, burnt-out cop Rick Deckard reluctantly agrees to hunt them down.<br/><br/>This was yet another film I had to watch for my Filmic Text class that I had never seen before. I know it's regarded as one of the ""greatest science-fiction films of all time"", but I'm going to argue that Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" is a far superior film. That's not to say ""Blade Runner"" was a bad film, it's not but I have my gripes with it. Let's start off with the positives though. The clear argument about humanity, more specifically what makes us human is very interesting to me. Also the replicants themselves have enough depth to them where they were interesting as well, and how it's determined if they are replicants is quite cool. The futuristic sets that mix futuristic los angeles and asian culture was a really stellar idea, though it's borders on racist at times. We really didn't need to cut to a geisha billboard throughout the film. Moving onto one of the negatives, the pacing. It felt dragged down at parts, without tension like shown in ""Alien"" this kind of pacing is felt amongst viewers.<br/><br/>Rachael's character I could relate to the most, but seeing how important her character really is to the plot she should've been present more. Also the argument of ""that scene"" between Deckard and Rachael in his apartment is not justified because of the year this was made. It's ironic how a film like this could have a scene like that that's supposed to be set in 2019 whereas its that year now and that would not fly in the slightest nowadays! It's way too sexual assaulty for me to be comfortable watching it, when clearly it's intended to be ""romantic"" by the choice of jazz music and lighting. This is the one scene that I agreed with my class that felt completely out of place and against Deckard's character thus far.<br/><br/>No I have not seen all versions of the film and I'm not going to. It's a little asinine to me when people claim that you ""have to watch all versions"" in order to grasp the full concept of the film. No I'm pretty sure I got the idea from whatever version I saw, its Harrison Ford running around being Harrison Ford. With cool visuals and relevant concept, even more so in current day than when it was released. But it has quite a few problems and I hope these were fixed in the sequel."

"dudemisra","10","1","2","29 October 2019"," Must watch more than once
","I've only viewed Blade Runner twice, the second time being last night at 12am viewing the theatrical cut and the first time viewing the director's cut. One commonality I have had with my viewings of this film is that I ALWAYS aim to watch them in the nighttime, preferable between 10pm-12am where everyone but me is asleep.<br/><br/>I recommend you to do the same. It is unreal, if the film hasn't numbed you with how lonely our existence is, these viewing requirements should enhance the experience. This film is absolutely beautiful for its time, the cinematography, lighting and scores of Vangelis all combined can make the viewing experience orgasmic for many viewers. 24 hour nighttime days, constant rain, bustling side-stores, traffic congestions and a mass of people everywhere sporting dystopian fashion. Most of us probably have not found ourselves under these circumstances all at the same time, but the film does a great job of transporting us these on the streets of chaotic, bleak Los Angeles in 2019.<br/><br/>The lovely thing about this film is that no matters how many times you view it, twice, thrice, ten times etc... There is always an idea, detail or theory you can formulate during or after the film. It rubs off you, not maybe the first time but the second time you will start to feel it. I definitely did not know what was going on the first time I viewed this film, sure the plot was simple and straightforward on paper, but the real fun comes from experiencing and observing the process and completing the plot.<br/><br/>Some of us will ""get it"" in the first viewing, that is cool. Some of us will not ""get it"" in the first viewing, that is also cool. Blade Runner is a film to be patient with, the aim of the film is to show the depressing and hopeless paradox of a technologically dominated society. This idea is magnified by observing the small details: little to no natural flora and fauna makes for a total urbanised city with no goal but to make it little by little every single day, trash littered across the city, large masses of homeless people, lights constantly surveying the city scapes and streets and the buildings all providing light making up for the lack of clear skies.<br/><br/>I can say right now that I still do not fully ""get it"", the film has characters commiting multiple actions with dual meanings which deserves another review for more explaining but I'd rather let you watch it for yourself to experience this pioneer of the sc-fi, dystopian neo-noir genre.<br/><br/>It is a film that you should not compel yourself to watch, this film is not for everyone but do not hold yourself back if uncertain because it is worth it. I has taken me a year to bring myself to watch this second viewing, but coming back, I'm glad I took my time with this, and so should you."
"rdhceo","10","1","2","26 October 2019"," One of the top Sci Fi films of all time.
","After watching the sequel to this film - went back to watch the original again just to wash the bad taste off of my palate. Denis Villeneuve directed the sequel as well as ""The Arrival"" - which is somehow even worse than the Blade Runner sequel - it was insulting to watch. Willing to bet that many of the people who left the poor reviews for the original Blade Runner - went on to watch the sequel and say it was great. Casting Gosling to lead that film pretty much destroyed it right out of the box. The only thing that could of been worse would of been to put DiCaprio in the lead - which makes me even more nauseous. If they make another sequel - I wouldn't watch it if it was the last new movie to ever be made.<br/><br/>Anyone who requires needs an explanation as to why this film is superior.- is beyond help. This film is not Star Wars, Avengers or Alien. It is NOT a story regarding flying about in space ships and chasing aliens and interacting with comical robots. This story is about relationships and was very well crafted.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of this film, the music, photography, story line, acting, etc. make it a science fiction classic that will never be reproduced."

","Philip K. Dick was probably the most Wildly imaginative & enigmatically-Creative (some might aptly say 'warped' - but in the absolute Best sense of that word of course) Science Fiction/ Speculative Fiction writer ever to grace our humble little Planet Earth! And Ridley Scott is one of the finest Cinematic Artists around (i.e. truly bringing to vital & vibrant artistic 'Life' those elusive but fascinating pictures-words/ sights & sounds!)<br/><br/>Put these two uniquely exemplary Artists together and you get an authentically superlative (and even mind-blowing) result like the original 'Blade Runner' (first released circa 1982 - but still more than slightly ahead of our Time, circa2019!)<br/><br/>Blade Runner's reputation has been significantly enhanced in the years after its initial Box office run in 1982 - initially, audiences were probably expecting (from a SciFi film with a futuristic setting) either the exhilarating sense of wonderment of Star Wars or forward-looking optimism inherent to Star Trek - or perhaps the futuristic terror of 'Alien' but instead they got a complex/multi-faceted and 'realistic' scenario of a possible near-future full of moral ambiguities = presenting many more questions than answers, and a genuinely 'uneasy' feeling about possible things to come (i.e. perhaps not the bright future we were all hoping for?)<br/><br/>But that uneasy/ tenuous atmosphere is exactly where this film generates its real power = this is based on Philip K. Dick after all, and his futures are filled with paranoid (or at least uncertain-enigmatic/ constantly shape-shifting) visions in which things are almost always Not what they first appear to be - and where concepts like 'good & evil' and even our individual identities become irrelevant or interchangeable.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott perfectly conceptualizes the Dystopian ambiguity inherent to P.K.Dick - and considerably broadens the visual Scope of the original source-book 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' ==> by spectacularly re-imagining/ updating Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' inspired City-scapes, although in much darker shades (and even enhancing said scenery with more than a bit of spectacular Japanese-Asian flair & futuristically eye-popping aesthetics!)<br/><br/>In any event, Blade Runner does what Speculative Fiction has always done Best = force us to think about our possible futures and contemplate the true meaning of 'identity' 'empathy' and even 'humanity' = not bad for a Movie classified in the humble little 'genre' of futuristic film noir."

","Blade Runner has to be one of the most impressive films ever made for being an 80s film hands down. The cinematography for this film for when the film was made is insane. The sound and special effects for this film were shot extremely well.<br/><br/>The music and sound are very crucial to this movie in my opinion. If you were to remove some of the music from certain scenes the whole scene would be ruined and would not make much sense. The soundtrack for this film is what makes this film flow so well. The music gives the movie a certain feeling in a way. The music was very electronic, slow paced, and just overall mysterious. It sort of set the mood for the film in a way. It kind of made think of smooth jazz. The dialogue and music fit insanely well together in my opinion, the film wouldn't make feel the same if you replaced the music that is in the film or took out the music all together. It just blends so well together. There is a particular scene in the film where there are bells and it sort of symbolizes or foreshadows something that is going to happen next in the movie and when that thing happens the sounds and visuals used make the scene that much better. It's just perfect in a way. If those bells weren't in that scene and the music and sounds weren't used in that scene it would not have made it that meaningful. It gave the scene so much meaning. That also goes for so many scenes in this movies as well, but that scene in particular stood out to me the most.<br/><br/>The special effects and visuals for this movie were also very important and very well shot in my opinion as well too. Especially for being done in the 1980s it is beyond what I would have hoped for. All the cars and landscapes in the film felt so realistic and natural in a way. It gave the film such a futuristic feel with the flying cars, not to mention that all of the visuals and special effects were done with props, models, and art. The amount of work that was put in to make this film so beautiful can be very much acknowledged by watching it. The way some of the camera angles were shot are very important to this film especially because it wasn't so digital back then. The lighting for this film was extremely important as well too because it gave the movie that futuristic/mysterious feel to it as well. If some of these camera angles were shot any different than what they are it would throw some of the audience off and I feel as if they did a good job filming this movie.<br/><br/>For as old as this movie is, it is probably one of the best movies when it comes to blending music and visuals together. It probably changed the way sci fi movies were made with special effects and soundtracks. Maybe even revolutionary ."

Although when Ridley Scott came out with a director's cut years later, this masterpiece was seen in an entirely new light. It's defiantly not a film for everybody, simply due to the fact that it doesn't contain much that will please the audience. The film noir, confronting plot and dystopian setting creates uneasy emotions while viewing. Although this is the underlying purpose of the film. I love how this movie challenges humanity. It really makes you question society and where it's headed. This uncomfortable movie experience is crucial in providing caution and warning for our future. I truly believe that Blade Runner is more than a film. Substantial research can take place after your viewing. There are so many metaphors, symbols and deep messages which are thoughtfully arranged by the film makers. Blade Runner is insanely complex.

","Enough cannot be said about the virtues of this movie, both visually and thematically. It's one of Ridley Scott's finest efforts behind the camera and a sci-fi benchmark that created a legacy that still permeates everything that it's related to futuristic and technogical landscapes.
From the very first shot, the movie will grab you by the scruff of the neck and take you on a visually stunning journey where there is even room for philosophical ruminations about the very nature of what it means to be human. But not all of it is fantasy and wonder. The movie is flawed in that it depicts its main characters in a very unrelatable and detached manner. This is also its worst pitfall. Scott was way more concerned about creating a futuristic setting than he was in delving into his characters' psyches. Actors were left to their own devices when trying to gleam into their characters reasons for being. Most of what can be seen on the screen, acting wise, was due to the actors commitment to their respective roles, e.g; Rutger Hauer's compelling performance of an android who only wants for his kind and his own, that which mankind has always taken for granted, the possibility of living longer and free, must surely be the outstanding performance of the movie.
Nitpicks aside, the movie is still to this day a remarkable cinematographic achievement and one that gains with repeated viewing. Amazing production design, photography and state of the art special effects has made it stand the test of time. Along with viewing it in its final cut version, which is the best of its five cuts, a viewing of the documentary; '' Dangerous Days'' in which we, the audience, are given the chance to dive right into the laborious and painstaking process of creating such a cinematic marvel, is not only advisable, but mandatory. Feast your eyes on it."

","This week I watched Blade Runner (1982), The Final Cut. To my surprise and as a result of my limited time to research, I discovered that this was the only one of the seven versions that I could find available for streaming. Prior to this I had never seen this movie and had been curious as to what all the excitement was about. It was an interesting experience to sit down and watch this film understanding that it a product of the 80s. According to this film we will have wiped out most natural landscape and wildlife from the planet and will have advanced Android technology and flying cars by next November. Many of the ideas of ""the future"" from Scott Ridley's 1980's mind was interesting to see and to try to dissect. Other than the 80s synth soundtrack the movie and questionable hair and outfit choices, this movie has a timeless visual. Having watched the Final Cut I would like to go back and see the Director's Cut and compare the differences. No matter which cut is viewed, it's iconic artistry and vision is something that every fan of cinema can enjoy. The art direction was ahead of its time and watching the movie and knowing it was produced in the 80s seems impressive. Of course reading up on the films history and the choices made during filming are interesting as well. All in all I would say that I enjoyed this film and am interested in seeing the other versions."
"hicks-46862","9","1","2","27 July 2018"," Blade Runner is deserving of its reputation.
","Blade Runner is a classic Ridley Scott sci-fi film that follows Rick Deckard as he pursues fugitive androids in the city of Los Angeles. The film gets its title from the job title Deckard uses. Those that hunt these androids are called Blade Runners, and they aren't seeking to arrest the androids, but to gun them down. Deckard is played by Harrison Ford in the prime of his career. He pursues four androids with the most prominent being Roy Batty, played by Rutger Hauer, and Pris, played by Daryl Hannah. Deckard also develops a romantic relationship with a woman named Rachael, played by Sean Young. <br/><br/>The theme of Blade Runner intends to cause us to question the morality of building machines with the capacity to feel and think as a person would. It's difficult to argue that some of the androids in this film aren't persons. I think the film does an excellent job establishing that with the relationships we witness the androids build and the feelings they demonstrate. One of the motifs the film uses is a repeated line that equates living in fear to living as a slave. This excellently scripted line establishes the androids' personhood because they show an understanding of emotion and remind us of the immorality of the literal slavery the androids are born into
. 
The most distinct part of Blade Runner is probably the setting which demands impressive special effects, lighting and most importantly set design. As Blade Runner is a futuristic sci-fi story set in a major city, the film must show an advanced metropolitan landscape. Blade Runner uses some special effect heavy aerial shots to do this. These shots show flying cars, skyscrapers, flame billowing industrial towers, and large futuristic moving advertisements. This shows us a city that looks far more advanced than our real world, but also very believable. <br/><br/>The lighting in this film is also well done. As Deckard and the androids traverse the city the grim and dank lighting of the sets tell the viewer that this city is far from a utopia. For the little people, the city is an unpleasant place to live despite the prosperity of business. The lighting differs for different environments. In Deckard's meeting with the Tyrell corporation, the lighting is low-key and primarily a golden hue. This worked well to suggest the prosperity and shadiness of the corporation. In another setting, the apartment of an eccentric genetic engineer, the lighting makes the engineer seem strange and lonely. The bizarreness of the robots that roam is home is only enhanced when they're casting their shadows. <br/><br/>The set design in this film is great. The set for the high-rise meeting room at the corporation is beautiful and exudes wealth and style while it overlooks the futuristic city. The street level sets the tone of the movie as a noir film with frequently foggy and wet sets. The use of water has an extra benefit of reflecting the futuristic city's lights. My favorite set design is the genetic engineer's apartment. This set uses strange mannequins, puppets, and costumed actors to set up a strange environment. The difference between this apartment and the businessman's apartment work well to show the income disparity and their different personalities. <br/><br/>Although the film presents its themes well and has great world design, it does have some small issues. One problem is that it's paced pretty slowly. I think this is because the director really wanted to immerse the viewer in the world, but this causes some unnecessary downtime. A good example is when Deckard is investigating the snake scale he finds. This scene is uninteresting and too long. It has poor dialog audio during Deckard's confrontation of the snake seller. These scenes probably could have been edited down without taking much from the film.<br/><br/>In closing, I enjoyed this film and how all the parts work together. It presents its themes very well through characters and their dialog. The special effects are appropriate and never overdone or distracting. The lighting adds to every scene and helps the viewer immerse themselves in this setting. The sets are expertly done and feel like they could be real places with real people living in them. It does have some issues, but the film overcomes them with the quality of everything else. I think this film deserves its reputation."

","""Blade Runner"" is an innovator of the Sci-Fi genre. The artisty and world-building completely changed the game. And the only way to watch it is by seeing the ""Final Cut.""<br/><br/>-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The world of Blade Runner is one that feels authentic and rich. While the story may have a few minor hiccups, these can be forgiven because of the brilliance of the universe that is the world of Blade Runner. A young Ridley Scott reveals his genius in the way he brought Blade Runner to screen. The film is a slow drama/noir with incredible beauty in bleakness. It is a film in which not much happens but that is what makes it feel so effective. The reality of the world comes to the forefront through the lack of major events. *Cinematography/Editing: The visuals are a marvel to behold. The brooding atmosphere of Blade Runner is one that is not easy to forget. Jordan Cronenweth captures the beauty and horror of Blade Runner in masterful fashion. His work is an integral part of the world building. The editing is the definition of Sci-Fi as it is known today. The cutaways to beautiful yet bleak city-scapes is one that feels incredibly Sci-Fi at its core. Seeing the world around Deckard is what helps to make the world feel so real. *Dialogue/Acting: The exchanges between characters is brilliant and authentic. It doesn't feel forced or unneeded. It is just enough and nothing more. The performances are incredible for the most part. Rutger Hauer feels a bit over-the-top early on in the film, but his final scene is one of the greatest in film history. Harrison Ford delivers one of the best performances of his career. Sean Young is mesmerizing in her role as Rachael. Joe Turkel perfectly delivers in his role as the cruel mastermind of the Tyrell Corporation, Dr. Eldon Tyrell. *Music/Sound Design: Once again, the world of Blade Runner feels so complete. It just would not be the same if it did not have the music score it has. It is melancholy and gorgeous. Instantly recognizable, it is one of the most iconic and grand film scores in any Sci-Fi film. The sound design is just as magnificent. From the firing of the handguns each Blade Runner has to the soft falling of the rain, it is all breathtaking. *Production Design/Special Effects: The set design and costume choices are futuristic, yet feel like they belong in the world we live in. It does not fall into the trap of being too futuristic that they become corny or ridiculous. The props are also incredibly detailed and seem real. The special effects are beyond impressive. They make the film seem as if it is from many years later than it really was released. Many of the effects still hold up today, and I suspect they will hold up for many years to come.<br/><br/>*Conclusion: ""Blade Runner"" is a truly unforgettable film that has forever changed the Sci-Fi genre. It will always be remembered as a true pioneer and one of the most influential films ever put to screen."

","""Do androids dream of electric sheep"" is much deeper and introspective. There are also a lot of important and essential events and characters that are missing from the movie; also, the book is cold... very cold.
On the other hand, the movie offers a different perspective; it's more emotional, more dramatic. Looks like this is another example where both the movie and the book are good in different ways, both are essential. It doesn't matter if you read the book before or after the movie; in fact, the movie motivated me to read the book!
In the book, you progressively get the general idea and philosophy; the movie is rushing everything towards the end - and this way, it feels more dramatic.
The eyes are the most prominent symbol in the movie (in my opinion)... ""just eyes"".
In conclusion, I like the fact that the movie is so much different from the book!
Oh, and holy crap, the soundtrack!
Also, Rutger Hauer is the key character in the movie; great performance!"

","Not much to say that probably hasn't been said about the film already, but just wanted to throw a quick two cents and a quick review at one of my very favorite all-time titles. This is ""film noir meets the thinking man's science fiction"". It's largely a classic detective film noir set in a dystopian future. Extremely heavy on visual style, the film truly demonstrates the degree to which film can be considered art, capturing emotion and wonder with visuals that take their time, poised and patient enough to give the mind and emotions ample opportunity to lose themselves within, not to mention one of the most appropriately moving scores to ever accompany a film. This is Ford at his very best. This is Rutger Hauer in his finest form (his performance herein likely only equaled by that in Ladyhawke). This is Sean Young presenting a classic model of the vulnerable female lead from a fresh perspective. The patient, deliberate method with which Ridley Scott presents to you each and every scene captures the very essence of visual storytelling. This is one of the very best presentations of the theme of what it means to be human in a crowded world of machines. Most importantly, this is a film that will inspire generations to become film-makers. Thank you so very much for your glorious vision and immeasurable body of work Ridley Scott."

"micahbundy","7","1","2","23 December 2017"," Could of been more.... but still good
","Blade Runner is directed by Ridley Scott. No doubt, Scott is a visionary director. That is certainly on display in this film. Scott builds a world that is stunning and immersive. The film boasts great effects and is truly a visual masterpiece that is complimented by Vangelis' excellent soundtrack.<br/><br/>This film is ambitious and certainly is ahead of its time. While the film has ambitions, some of the scenes fall flat due to inconsistent acting and undeveloped concepts. Some of the acting is great in this film. Harrison Ford as Deckard and Rutger Hauer as Roy give great performances. While both of these actors give us these great performances, it's the actors that play the Replicants who make good scenes feel dry and certainly don't do Ford and Hauer's characters justice. While there are heart-pumping moments in this movie, some of the scenes are just flat-out boring and feel like they're missing something that would make for an intriguing scene. Despite the negatives, the plot advances smoothly and makes for a memorable story. <br/><br/>This movie is definitely a classic though, but because of the visuals and effects, rather than the content of the film. I like this film, I don't love it and that's why my overall score is: 7.8/10"
"moshomaniac","10","1","2","18 December 2017"," A Dystopian Masterpiece that stands up 30 years after its original release.
","Based (very loosely) on Philip K Dick's novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"", Blade Runner concerns Rick Deckard(Harrison Ford), a retired cop who is yanked out of retirement when 6 rogue androids, called replicants, make it from an off-world colony into 21st Century Los Angelos. Their crime: wanting to be human. 
So much about this film is iconic: the dystopian cityscapes, the score by Vangelis, the 'tears in the rain' speech, adlibbed by Rutger Hauer, who plays Roy Batty, the leader of the band of Replicants who tries to go to the Tyrell Corporation(the company that makes Replicants) in a desperate gamble to prolong their life-span, the list goes on and on. Blade Runner, though a commercial failure during its initial release, was re-evaluated and rightfully proclaimed one of the all-time greatest Sci-fi movies. The film is extremely slow-moving, but never boring and uninvolving, and the story, while a tad scarce makes up for it in atmosphere and character development. Very rarely has a movie been made with such skill, and the sets of 2019 L.A. are a collaborative knockout. Blade Runner has become one of the most influential movies in the last 3 decades, inspiring movies, writers, and videogames alike, and in 1993, it was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress' national film registry. Though Philip K. Dick has been gone since 1986, his legacy continues to this very day, and Blade Runner is definitely one of the prime reasons for that."
"dionisie-straticiuc","10","1","2","15 December 2017"," The best fusion of music, script, visual, directing and acting that I ever seen
","It's not by accident that I put first the music. Vangelis artistry is so amazing that the cinema seems to revolve around his score. Try imagine watching it without the music and you will understand what I mean.
It's surprising and well beyond the normal variation of taste to see how polarising the rating is. It's a love or hate. Much more love than hate, true. Same thing on the Metascore: all but praise and than bam! 38%. Some critic from Christian Science Monitor. No coincidence, Christian and Science don't go along too well these days.
I'm not a cultist of any sort, but this movie is a ""cult film"" in all the meanings. It's a cultural masterpiece as well as a magnet for fandoms. It's so hauntingly beautiful that I can replay it in my mind. Music and all.
Ignore the ""best of the SF genre"" - it has it's well deserved place in any top best movies of all times."

","Blade Runner is aesthetically impeccable. The ominously simple music, the dark designs, and some of the best uses and excuses for product placement ever.

Pretentiously cold and, at times, frankly boring, it's a fairly rudimentary and somewhat confused study of ""where's the line between robot and human?"" that I merely likeÂ…which, to many people, seems to mean I hate it."

","A milestone in sci-fi film history, Scott's ""Blade Runner"" (1982) has aged well, but it is technically impressive rather than heartfelt.<br/><br/>The now-classic music by Vangelis competes with the great production design by Lawrence G. Paull, art direction by David L. Snyder and costume design by Michael Kaplan and Charles Knode about the title of most memorable feature of this production. However, the writing doesn't reach the same level and the film never lets the viewer close enough to really care what happens."
"DrChristers","9","1","2","7 October 2017"," A SciFi classic - more for the aesthetic than the plot...
","We watched the ""Final Cut"". I thoroughly enjoyed every minute. It was also great to watch a film which, unlike modern films (I hear Bladerunner 2049 is 2.5 hours long), didn't feel the need to turn into a bum numbing epic!<br/><br/>The special effects were excellent despite this film being from 1982. As with others of the genre (Alien, Aliens), I think animation special effects were just hitting the top of the curve prior to digital effects taking over. Interestingly the quality of the special effects mean that this film does not look dated, just like Alien and Aliens. <br/><br/>All the scifi tropes were here (hover cars, evil tech overlord, sky scrapers with giant advertising, awesome synth soundtrack, odd futuristic clothing, the nerdy tech guy...) but the difference is that this film almost invented them inspiring many later films. The cars look quite outdated compared to cars nowadays, which made me laugh, especially as the film is set in 2019 and we're nowhere near that technology. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is almost hypnotic, especially when Deckard is walking the streets, for example the ""cross, don't cross"" sign. Ford plays his role fantastically - he is best as the embittered rebel with a sense of humour. Rutger Hauer munches the scenery as always but maybe when you're playing a psychotic replicant who has stolen a ship to find your maker and extend your life then it's allowed. <br/><br/>I felt genuinely sad for Rachel as she works through realising she is a replicant, her memories are implanted and her lifetime is limited. Although, the seduction scene made me slightly uncomfortable as it feels a little bit too on the non-consensual side. I had to look away when Roy crushes Tyrell's skull and presses in his eyes - that crunch is nasty.<br/><br/>It's also interesting to read that Ford and Scott could never agree whether Deckard is a replicant. His dream sequence with the unicorn and his fellow blade runner making a unicorn out of paper seems to imply that his dreams may be implanted. Also, I had not before noticed the significance of him not answering Rachel's question about him having taken the test. Though it seems if Blade Runner 2049 is set 30 years after the original then Deckard must be human or he would have expired....<br/><br/>This film does not have an overly complex plot but is a masterpiece nonetheless. I first watched it 20 years ago and it was every minute as good as I remembered."

The acting was of a good standard and I found all of the characters to be completely believable. The main thing that I enjoyed about this movie was the overall visual and audio style.

","In 2019, Los Angeles has become a decaying and primarily Asian location. Rick Deckard is a ""blade runner"". Blade runners are hired to assassinate automatons known as ""replicants"". Rick Deckard is assigned to hunt and assassinate four replicants for their crimes. While on this hunt, Rick Deckard is confronted by a female replicant that makes him question himself. Nearing the end of Rick Deckard's journey of tracking down replicants, his perception is changing towards the autonomous beings and finds himself questioning humanity. <br/><br/>The main theme of this film is texture/style. The futuristic Los Angeles in 2019 is portrayed as dystopian. There is a dark atmosphere that contrasts with vibrant colors and neon lights. The city is constantly raining and there is filth everywhere. Light is often beaming into darkness to make scenes more dynamic. Actor Harrison Ford is Rick Deckard, a retired cop that gets assigned to be a blade runner. Actor Sean Young is the replicant named Rachael that is a love interest for Rick Deckard and makes him question his views about the replicants. Rick Deckard and Rachael are two main characters that have an interesting relationship that evolves as the film goes on. Concepts about humans and engineered automatons made to resemble humans are expressed in the film. The concept of the autonomous replicants becoming so advanced that they are nearly indistinguishable from actual humans. At what point can the replicants live normal lives among humans and not be made to work for humans with a predetermined life span?<br/><br/>The film is styled as a noir film with science fiction elements. Rick Deckard is doing detective work to find his suspects. In the beginning, there is an establishing shot overlooking the dark futuristic Los Angeles and a transition to an eye to symbolize the ever watch-full eye that gives the viewer a sense of the film. Lighting techniques are used to create the illuminated pupil's motif that is used often on replicants. Rain is another motif that continuously occurs throughout the film. Many medium close-up shots and close-up shots are used to display the actor's emotions or capturing the actor in dense areas of people. Like Star Wars, Blade Runner immerses you into a highly convincing world that brings out our imagination. The world of Blade Runner is created through mostly practical effects with little computer-generated imagery. For anybody looking to watch a film that is retro futuristic and has much depth to explore, this is a highly crafted film that is a technical masterpiece."

"chaos-rampant","Null","1","2","25 November 2012"," Origamis
","Much more so than any other film, this is going to be remembered long after many of its betters are forgotten. There's a reason why a significant number of viewers report that they eventually liked this on their second or third rewatch. Something compels you to come back. I believe this effect has nothing to do with Deckard's situation, though that seems to be the majority opinion. <br/><br/>Let's get right into it. The story is by all admission poor, though it has ambition and that is good. The theme of manufactured memory is weighty (and dear to me), just not the exploration in the noir direction. What does this mean? Film noir in the old days was all about a narrator succumbing to hallucination. (watch Out of the Past again)<br/><br/>Usually caused by the woman, this had the uncanny effect of manifesting as strange and suspicious perturbations in the investigated story, often noted by viewers as fate pulling the strings. Everything else was only incidental, the murder, fashions and hardboiled lingo. The first thing that greets you here as noir is the detective plot and retro fashions, and of course most viewers rest there.<br/><br/>There's more to it, though. There is an origami in the outer story, proof or not of fabricated memory, an excellent device. Something has to map to that in the world of dreams, an inner vision. Indeed, there is a corresponding scene of Deckard (as per noir rules) dreaming/hallucinating on his desk. There is a previous scene (part of the same sequence), where Deckard using impossible technology delves into and reconstructs a photograph for clues.<br/><br/>What is amazing is that this exactly the same process by which Deckard (anyone when dreaming/remembering) reconstructs his memory, by moving walls around in the mind of the original image, until we arrive at the subconsciously desired 'truth'. The setup of these two scenes is superb, one of the best in film, and the best explication of noir. <br/><br/>It smartly points to the fact that each and every memory is a constructed hallucination, a continuously shifting impression of a room, the furniture never in the same place twice. It is among other things how films are put together, in line with other metaphors in the film (toymaker, artificial eyes).<br/><br/>Scott in my view destroys this because he has set up a powerful mechanism, but also wants to swim inside Deckard's head. And he was simply not a psychonaut, never could be as a Kubrick adherent. Tarkovsky was, and that is a whole different school, one of inner-seeing and ecstatic time.<br/><br/>And what is Deckard's vision according to Scott? A unicorn running through a glade. In slow- motion. Eegad.<br/><br/>Nevermind the blunt action story of eye-gouging and heads through walls, though the contrast with above all but kills the film. This one image right there mars everything else, visual perfume. <br/><br/>So why do we come back to it, myself included? I have seen this four times, more than any of my favorites. The world of the film, a mixture of LA horizons, vertical Hong Kong, and a crowded Casbah. It is the most organic depiction of the future to this day. It breathes, feels at dusk like an entire world is coming home from work. So, though this particular story is pulp, you can almost hear sounds of people moving furniture in the room next to you, dreaming something else."

This film was okay by modern standards but I find it really hard to see what is so spectacular about it, I completely take into account the time that this film was made and how these kind of effects are revolutionary for this time, yet still I found the storyline a little fragmented and a little more just all over the place.<br/><br/>That being said I really enjoyed this world and how it was established, and how it didn't spend all of its time showing us this world and instead it was much more focused on the storyline, which was a pleasant surprise. However a vast amount of the acting was kind of rigid and I didn't really feel there were any break away performances, I do take into account that the characters are supposed to not show emotion but still I found that it wasn't that interesting to watch.<br/><br/>My highlight of the film is the simple ending, Rutger Hauer's line about teardrops in the rain, sums up the mentality of his kind in this film, and how they just want to live as they are essentially humans, and they just want more time. The part I disliked the most was how these robot like creatures were developing emotions towards the end of the film which goes against the point in the film and how they were finding them in the first place. The very end was also open ended which was welcome instead of another half an hour to forty-five minutes of film that would have answered some of the questions but not all.<br/><br/>All in all I liked this film and the way it is portrayed and it was truly revolutionary, but now it is too outdated especially considering all the events were supposed to be happening in the year 2019!

"badajoz-1","Null","1","2","26 August 2011"," Final Cut - much better
","This is without doubt Ridley Scott's finest hour - not many of his other films come within hailing distance. It is a visual treat of incredible production design, conceptual brilliance of a dystopian future, and a triumph of pre-CGI cinematography! I would score it higher but the story and characters are firmly locked into Marlowesque territory. The scifi element is dealt with merely in the short interview between Roy and Tyrrell, and a few descriptions of off-world activity. It is obvious watching the film now that so many films have lazily copied (but not really equalled) Scott's vision. The Final Cut was better than the original cinema release (middling), but the fuss about the meaning and the ending of the movie is way way overplayed. Let's face it, it is 'Frankenstein' with Roy (The Monster) pursuing the Robot manufacturer Tyrrell (the Baron) while Deckart (Philip Marlowe) tries to track the creature down and kill it. If Deckart is a replicant, as Scott later suggest, then much of the plot, set up, and action becomes flawed and unbelievable, and the film is a ridiculous hoax. They could have left out the Unicorn symbol (rubbish) and I presume it is only in to nod at the original Dick story title. Stick to the visual element and the final redemption of Roy as he rescues Deckart at the end to prove that robots have developed their own sense of humanity. That is the payoff, not naff unicorn origamis! The acting is okay, with Ford not really able to do much (outside of Han Solo and Indiana Jones, he has looked awfully overparted with a range that would not challenge Arnie Schwartzenegger!) but grimace, and everyone else in fairly deliberate robotic mode (so you don't guess the replicants). But then Ridley Scott and actors/characterisation do not mix well, as we all know now 20 years later!"

","9.2<br/><br/>I have a sort of love/hate relationship with Blade Runner. On one hand, I love the atmosphere, costumes, scenery and mood of the entire film. On the other hand, I hate it for its falling short of greatness (in my opinion), and obscure plot.<br/><br/>This is the second time I've seen this movie. The first time, I nearly fell asleep. However, I generally enjoyed it, but didn't capture much of the plot. The first time I saw the director's cut. The second time was the final cut. This time around, I found myself thinking halfway into the movie, ""Wait... what the hell is going on here? I don't know where this movie started, and how far I'm into it. Is this a good thing?"" I think the reason for my confusion is that Blade Runner is a very sophisticated film. The entire time, I had this feeling that there is much more going on in scenes than there seems to be. This is Blade Runner's greatest strength, and at the same time, it's greatest weakness.<br/><br/>It's no wonder either, considering that the theatrical release was dumbed down, for fear that audiences wouldn't respond to it well. Narration was added, and certain scenes were taken out (which contradicts the point of the entire film). Also, a happier ending was used. I haven't seen the theatrical release, but from what I hear, it's not the original vision. If you're going to see it, you might as well see the post release versions. In terms of storytelling, the final cut is not too different from the director's cut.<br/><br/>If you go into this film not knowing anything, and come out apathetic towards the plot, chances are you didn't like it too much. But if you go into it aware of the questions it poses (there aren't really any answers), or you come out of it with many questions, chances are you enjoyed it. The film doesn't do much to pose the questions, even the big question, regarding the main character. There is so much going on in the scenes, but like the film's choice of dark environments, it's very difficult to see.<br/><br/>It's hard to discuss Blade Runner and avoid spoilers. There are elements like atmosphere and tone that are much easier to discuss. And this is an area where the film has no problems. The 1982 film's vision of the future is impressive, to say the least. It is easy to see that many works of fiction were inspired by Blade Runner. The neo-metropolitan cityscape, the grim street life and polluted air paint a grim picture. But it's so pretty. I wasn't particularly a fan of the type of atmosphere. I like my pictures with clear, blue skies. Or at least grey skies. But Blade Runner's biggest strength is its success in its setting going from the collective imagination of the people who created the film, to the end result that we see. This is the only area of the film that is outstanding.<br/><br/>This is a film where audiences will be very divided. I can see a lot of people saying that it is a bore. They might say that it has no plot, or a dull execution of it. They might say that it moves too slow, or that they expected more emotional satisfaction. ""Where is the humanity in this film?"", they might ask. The film is asking you, ""what is humanity?"" If you care to see what is going on deeper in the scenes, you will end up with a very interesting film, whose bigger questions remain unanswered even today. Either way, however deep you choose to look into the plot and scenes, you must admit, atmospherically, visually, and in terms of tone, this film is a classic."

","The artwork by futurist and designer Syd Mead is this movie. Many of the drawings that were used to create the sets in this film are available on the web and I think they are worth looking at as Syd Mead has got good talent when it comes to creating interesting looking futuristic panoramas. I thought the script of the film was middling to very weak, and the end sequences were not very enjoyable to watch, taking the film down a kind of black hole, compared to the interesting scenes in the beginning and in the middle of the film. I was surprised to see multiple versions released a few years ago in a sort of pricey box set, as the versions differ only slightly. I did some research and learnt that Sir Run Run Shaw, credited in the film, is a Chinese media mogul, who must have been around 90 when the film Blade Runner was made. I have read a not bad sequel, but there seems to be no interest in creating a movie sequel based on the book sequel, which I think is kind of sad, because despite the often dim witted script, the film had interesting visuals. People who think this is the best thing ever made visually should explore more SF art, particularly the work of Jim Burns. With a better script this would be an easy ten, but as it stands it sounds like fifth rate detective fiction from the 1940s, so I gave it a seven, not a four."
"varundelpiero","8","1","2","30 November 2008"," One of the most influential sci-fi movies ever made...
","BLADE RUNNER is, in a nutshell, an intelligent and thought-provoking futuristic science-fiction film noir. Those expecting to see a typical Harrison Ford save-the-world-and-rescue-his-family film, or a typical sci-fi special effects blockbuster will be surprised, as they will not be prepared for a film with such dark and brooding undertones. For at the heart of this futuristic sci-fi thriller is a bleak and complex film exploring the darkest and most sombre elements of humanity, and questioning what exactly comprises humanity.<br/><br/>BLADE RUNNER exudes atmosphere. Ridley Scott infuses his film with a brooding atmosphere, from the ever-crowded streets, to the giant electronic billboards, to the huge and haunting apartment complexes. The atmosphere effectively sets the tone for this Motion Picture. Cinematography and set design are almost impeccable. Even 26 years after its release, one will still be astounded by Ridley Scott's vision of the future. The electronic score, done exclusively by Vangelis, also goes to great lengths to setting the overall mood for the film.<br/><br/>The story itself is a profound and compelling one, but it is the ending that propels this from good to great, and makes this film one of the most widely discussed and debated sci-fi movies of all time. I will not mention the questions that will be posed at the end of the film, for the sake of potential viewers (and due to my spoiler-free nature), but all I will say here is that the film is worth watching at least once, as it is a truly cerebral and rewarding experience; one which no single review can ever truly encompass.<br/><br/>On a final note, the acting in this movie is mixed, as the cast (as an ensemble) delivers a rather varied performance. Harrison Ford is as reliable as ever, though he seems a bit out of place in a film of this nature. Rutger Hauer and Darly Hannah (neither of whom I am a fan) deliver perhaps their best ever performances in this film. The rest of the cast is mediocre to poor and not really worth mentioning.<br/><br/>Overall, the film deserves a solid 8/10 and 3.5 stars (out of 4). Will enter my Top 200 at #195 or so. Highly recommended."

","My kudos to John who had a similar experience with this movie. I had just been stationed to NAS Key West in the summer of 1982, and felt like I was on the dark side of the moon. The isolation, the loneliness was reflected back upon me like a sledgehammer when I went to see ""Blade Runner"" the first time. I was impressed by it, but not really moved. In retrospect, I believe the movie was so layered and textured that it overwhelmed me. Months later, I watched it again on video, and this, I believe, allowed me to get more into the story, theme and characters. I then thought it was the greatest movie of all time.<br/><br/>Like a lot of hidden masterpieces, ""Blade Runner"" went from disaster to masterpiece without ever having been a success. I believe it is so richly constructed that it takes most people a couple of viewings before they begin to realize how much depth is there.<br/><br/>This phenomenon, not the ""Director's Cut"", or the lack of narration, or the -Deckard- is- a- replicant question is what really occurs when people walk out of a second viewing thinking, ""That was a great movie!"" Basically, everyone, especially critics who panned it originally, can't admit to anyone (even themselves) that they didn't ""get it"" the first time around. So, instead they say, ""Wow, those changes made all the difference!"" Wrong, moron, you just weren't able to appreciate a challenging piece of art with just one viewing. I, at least, can admit that. And I'm grateful to all who made and supported this movie.<br/><br/>It isn't perfect and I have a lot more to say about it, but I'll leave it at this for now.

"Science_Fantasy_Guy","Null","1","2","11 October 2008"," The best sci-fi movie ever made? I think so.
","Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, for me, is the be all and end all of science-fiction pictures. Adapted from Phillip K. Dick's 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Blade Runner's history is one of a legendarily troubled shoot, and egregious financial disappointment. However, like some other films that experienced such stressful and humble beginnings and ultimately grew in importance and popularity with each passing decade (like Citizen Kane, The Shawshank Redemption, The Wizard of Oz and It's a Wonderful Life), Blade Runner's esteem now with film critics and audiences alike shows that in 1982 it was simply a movie that was decades ahead of its time.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is as visually awe-inspiring a movie as you will ever see. Justifiably celebrated for its mesmerizing production design, Scott and his crew, also putting to work visual effects that don't show 26 years, paint a wrenching but no less aesthetically pleasing portrait of what maybe 2019 Los Angeles will look like: dystopic, polluted and brimming with corruption and corporate greed. You could only hope to see such amazing eye-candy from a director who is arguably one of the last true visionary directors (that now being a term which, it seems, is thrown around nearly as much these days in Hollywood circles as ""You'll never work in this town again!"").<br/><br/>But therein does not lie that magic ingredient that makes Blade Runner the seminal masterpiece of science-fiction film-making – that is in two other aspects of the story. The first of those is its ocean-deep and universal themes. Blade Runner is a movie that challenges the viewer to ponder not only what it means to be human, but WHY we are human. Through the central characters of Deckard (the central male whom we know more about than he knows of himself), played by Harrison Ford, Rachael (the female replicant and love interest of Deckard's who is the most advanced of her kind but still knows only mortality), played by Sean Young, and Roy Batty (the revengeful replicant who wages war on both Deckard and his own maker), played by Rutger Hauer, Blade Runner is a timeless, universal and marvelous analysis and deconstruction of the human condition in all its dimensions. And the characterizations by Ford, Young and most notably Hauer all leave indelible impressions.<br/><br/>Also broadening the narrative scope of the film is the mind-boggling fusion of postmodern cyberpunk and future neo-noir. This adds yet another layer of beauty and intrigue, especially in Vangelis' instantly recognizable score and with the cynical and introverted Deckard feeling much like a role Humphrey Bogart might have accepted.<br/><br/>The second definitive sign of Blade Runner's colossal greatness lies in its cautionary tale view of the future – and in 2009, unlike 1982, we all know how alarming the possibility of it successfully predicting the future is. After all, 2019 is only 11 years away. Pollution, slavery, prostitution, global warming, corruption. Technological enslavement? Think about that the next time you buy a piece of audiovisual equipment or even the next time you fire up your computer. Good sci-fi always tries to predict the future. Only the very best get it right.<br/><br/>In summary, you can throw 2001: A Space Odyssey or Metropolis or even The Matrix at me, but in my book, with its ageless eye-candy, its questions about life and human nature, and its gritty yet all-too-possible prediction of the future, Blade Runner is the definitive science-fiction movie of all time."

Guy plays a top-dog replicant. Harrison Ford is a pretty poor actor, and he's thankfully reduced to nothing but a handsome mug here. Sean Young and Daryl Hannah both have it going' on in this one too! This is a piece of film too sophisticated for the likes of Hollywood (or maybe just our current stagnant period of culture). The music by Vangelis carries the film and the romance of the imagery and environment here is super rad. Plus, it asks a lot of important existential questions in the wake of AI and cybernetic implants and cloning and other technological developments, all without sounding preachy or pretentious.<br/><br/>Amazing that Ridley Scott made this and ""Alien"" and then went on to make nastiness like ""1492: CoP"" and ""Gladiator"".

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","2","12 April 2008"," All the visual pull of a sci-fi film with the heart of a drama
","""Blade Runner"" is a film very much like the androids that are in it: innovative creations that appear one way on the outside but are another on the inside. ""Blade Runner' has the facade of an action sci-fi epic, but is more a futuristic drama that poses questions about humanity and questions the future.<br/><br/>Forget that it's Ridley Scott, epic action filmmaker. Forget that its Harrison Ford, 80s action film extraordinaire. ""Blade Runner"" is not even close to those genres--it is science-fiction, but with a focus on the purpose, not on the technology. While ""Blade Runner"" offers some stunning visual effects (for 1982) and some terrific art direction, it's only meant to create the sci-fi aura needed to make the ideas hit harder.<br/><br/>Ford stars as Rick Deckard, a Blade Runner in Los Angeles in 2019. A Blade Runner is a cop in charge of hunting down Nexus 6 androids that were banned from Earth under punishment of extermination because they exceeded human strength and knowledge. When 4 of these ""Replicants"" hijack a ship and find their way to Earth (they are supposed to remain in Earth's off-planet colonies), Deckard is put in charge of taking them down, and he goes around trying to do just that.<br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" moves rather slowly, taking a lot of time with its scenes. Especially when the sci-fi leads you to expect action, it can get really slow. It's the images and the use of darkness and light that make this film good and interesting. While confusing, you start to get the film towards the end.<br/><br/>While not Ford's best role because it doesn't call on him to do much, he still continues to be the best protagonist to get his butt handed to him in every film. He's always the most realistic of any hero because he never does it without help or without getting something for his grief.<br/><br/>Once you get what the film says about humans and emotions and what truly is human, then you appreciate how the film goes about getting there. An action film simply wouldn't do that. Once again, the sci-fi is simply to establish and set the tone for future L.A., it is not an integral part of the film. Expect some more thought-provoking sci-fi along the lines of an Assimov, Wells or Orwell and ""Blade Runner' will surely give you something you enjoy munching on."

The Villain (Roy Batty) isn't even shown in action or given diolog until halfway into the film, and by then you have already gotten bored of Deckard. This pacing continues, causing the ending to be abrupt and makes the audience unappreciative of Roy's goodbye speech. But you find yourself used to this after more viewings. The pacing isn't remotely formula which does spoil the first impression I must admit. <br/><br/>But pretty soon you'll find that the he movie is entirely watchable.

","A while last year, I thought I'd check this film out (this was before the Final Cut version was out). I wasn't that familiar with the whole history of the film's terrifying progress at first and reading 'director's cut' on the cover (this was the unofficial 90's director's cut), I was worried I'd never see the film in its true original artistic form as I thought it would've been. After watching and doing a bit of research, I realised there's no need.<br/><br/>Everything... was beyond anything I had seen the first time watching it. The score is very, very atmospheric all thanks to the mastermind composer of Vangelis, fitting incredibly well with the setting. <br/><br/>Special effects, were almost convincing, I was so awed by what they achieved back in the time. It proves that model effects can do a lot than cheesy looking, mindless and overused CGI crap Hollywood produces nowadays, when it began as a supposed revolutionary advantage for creating more convincing dinosaurs for the time Jurassic Park was successfully released in the 90's.<br/><br/>But what justifies the film importantly is plot and characters. Harrison Ford's role as a Blade Runner has great character development, with the film sometimes trying to pose 'that question' upon the audience: is he human? Rutger Hauer's villain role in the film also has great character development as leader of rebel replicants trying to escape slavery and seeking vengeance upon their masters. Then it strikes me: what if he really wanted to be more human? Indeed, the character mentions wanting 'more'.<br/><br/>When the film was first released, it did of course not go well with the audience. I think at the time, Sci-Fi was more popular with the action sub-genre than the unfamiliar approach of taking a different route, most importantly, when audiences catch Harrison Ford's name in the lead role, they expected the film to follow routes with Star Wars, instead with reusing and blending noir, an old genre probably considered dead. However, that was only half the audience's opinion. The other half was more open eyed to the structure.<br/><br/>Although it had mixed success on its first release, it of course followed a cult following, and considering the theatrical version was edited from the vision Ridley Scott had in mind for 1982's first audience, it has been improved throughout the 90's until an official Final Cut came out on the film's 25th anniversary last year.<br/><br/>Having the unofficial director's cut, I'll probably just stick to it. Whatever version you'll find (commonly the Final Cut for those who are recently new), it will still remain a classic that deserves to be seen."

","Blade Runner is one of those films where you have to be prepared to have your brain scrambled. No real hero, no real beginning or end. A lack of geographical location, apart, that is, from a perpetual rain-soaked decaying metropolis, and a complete distortion of ones senses. Not just the best science fiction film ever made, but one of the best films of any genre. I don't normally rate Ford very much, but here he was perfect for the task, with his lugubrious eye raising cynicism, his world weary reluctance to get himself to the task of tracking down the replicants. Rutger Hauer is brilliantly creepy and ice-cool as the man/machine that wants to live on at all costs. The directors cut is far superior to the original. If you don't like science fiction do not be put off seeing this - it has style, verve, and panache by the mega bucket load. You will come away gasping for air."

","I hadn't seen Blade Runner for quite a while, so after getting my sweaty hands on the new 5 disc final cut special edition box-set, I had to watch what director Ridley Scott sees as the definitive version of the film.<br/><br/>First of all this film is over 25 years old, it came out the year after I was born. What is most striking to me is the fact this films aged so well, this is in some parts down to the 'final cuts' visual tweaks, but it's also thanks to the way the film is shot. The futuristic elements in Blade Runner never becomes the main showcase of the film, they're kept in the background or in the dark and you only ever see a glimpse of this and a glance of that. Unlike some sci-fi films that show everything clear as day all the time, to get the 'AAAH' factor and then a few years down the line they look dated. The atmosphere sets the mood and feel of the film, it's dark and gloomy, forever raining, with glints of light and an urban Japanese look. It's a believable future and it doesn't seem so far away. The story follows Deckard (Harrison Ford) who is the Blade Runner of the title, a cop who specialises in retiring (terminating) replicants, human clones now deemed dangerous and declared illegal. His expertise are needed when 6 replicants are loose on the streets after escaping from an off-world colony to Earth. There's a lot more to it, but I wont spoil anything. The story to me isn't the heart of the film anyway, it's about the desire to live, human emotions, philosophy and memories. The acting is kept mostly subtle, like Ridley's vision of the future they never really become powerhouse performances, but it's masterful subtlety. Then there's Rutger Hauer as the main replicant, the standout performance for me and it is easily his finest hour, he is remarkable here. Evidence that he had a great ability that's been shamefully overlooked somewhat in his career.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is a timeless, incredible and hugely influential sci-fi classic."

","After reading the many opposing views of Blade Runner, seeing the many different versions of the film and enduring the dismissive opinions of several of those I know who've no love for the film or its creator, I can still say that for me, my introduction to Blade Runner a quarter of a century ago was one of the defining moments in my enjoyment of film. Rachel's first and second visits to Deckard's apartment which features one of cinema's great merging of image and music, the fleeting movement of shadow in Rachel's childhood photo, the truly moving revelation of Rachel's realization that her cherished memories are as cold and calculated as the world she inhabits, Zora's desperate and futile effort to survive and of course, Roy Batty's roof top moment of knowing what it means to be human (experiencing mercy, memory and the reality that it is all ultimately fleeting ""Tears in the Rain"") and an ending that is ours to interpret (audiences have been trying for 25 years) ""She won't live but then again, who does?"" <br/><br/>I saw Blade Runner when it was the small type co-feature to ""The Wrath of Khan"". I'm sure the last dollar from ""Khan"" was spent long ago, still, this great and neglected film continues to find new audiences and challenge those who 25 years ago saw in it something special, something great. For me, Blade Runner is ultimately a religious allegory. The Son of God (Batty) fulfilling his ultimate destiny, to save falling man. Driving a nail through the very hand he will save Deckard with, the wind mills of man's futile search for youth, the dove (Holy Spirit whom he will release to the heavens upon his death), reaching out to save a falling Deckard with nail through hand, Deckard responds by spitting at him (as humanity spit upon Christ at Golgotha), Batty sharing the wonders his dying eyes had seen much as Christ shared the wonders of his Father in Heaven, ""Time to die""-It is finished"" and of course, Deckards salvation and his understanding of Graft's final words and the true role of the unicorn (how could Graft have known of Deckard's dream of the unicorn?). Lastly, Deckards subtle acknowledgement of who and what he is and that the future though unknown is already foretold for all of us, replicant and human alike. Just as Rachel is Deckard's bridge to his humanity, Graft's origami unicorn is the reminder that like Graft himself, Deckard is himself a replicant.<br/><br/>Like the Christian belief that man finds his true humanity through Christ (not to be mistaken for the Schuller, Hinn, Graham, Roberts, ad nauseum brand of heresy), so to, the replicant's begin to find their own humanity through love, mercy and finding meaning in their existence. Of course this is all supposition and opinion, but in the end Blade Runner's ultimate greatness may lie in its ability to have tilled such fertile soil for thought, opinion and enjoyment."

","The landmark science-fiction thriller gets a much-touted Blue-ray release, and for anyone who ever valued what this film did so brilliantly in the first place, deciding on a purchase should not be an issue. When re-watching the slow-paced, visually immersive yarn with superior video clarity it becomes even more apparent that Blade Runner, simply from a production standpoint, remains a high-water mark in visionary design and all but overshadows any technically superior fantasy worlds created thereafter.<br/><br/>Perhaps the lesson Blade Runner can still teach effects-heavy Hollywood is that CGI should rightfully be used to touch up things in post, since we realize how much more completely convincing and authentic things were when they actually had to be physically constructed and implemented. As technology has vastly improved over the past quarter-century, so the imaginations of our biggest and brightest cinematic storytellers shrunken. Never mind the many flaws within Blade Runner movie itself, they all fall by the wayside as we are continually reminded of a time that Hollywood put all of it's guts into sharing a vision with the world."

I think all the actors did a terrific job: Sean Young, Daryl Hannah, Rutger Hauer, not to mention Harrison Ford. At first I didn't like the movie that much, but as I kept watching, it grew on me. The version I watched didn't have any voice-overs and although I haven't seen the other one, I think the director's cut is better. With the voice-overs you would have thought of Deckard as a detective, who has to look for clues and hunt down the replicants, but without them Deckard is just a man doing his job. Furthermore, in the director's cut there are a number of long scenes, which have no dialogue and that leaves us time to soak in the atmosphere and hope that the future will not be like this.

","I first viewed BR years ago with a relative and some mutual friends. We writhed over the barbarity of Replicant Roy Batty and his 'fellow travelers.' What a dreadful killing machine he was! A perfect excuse for Supercop Rick Deckard's comparably barbarous actions, eh? After all, somebody had to do it. Deckard seemed to be spiritually dead, anyway. The ending filled me with sadness. I had seen life/love flow out of the dying Roy. My companions were surprised at my response.<br/><br/>Now, years later, the Director's Cut, which I just viewed, has left me with still more disturbing questions about who is, isn't or might be, what it is to be a sentient machine, evil and so on. I offer my thanks to the many thoughtful, insightful ideas set forth in the 772 other Viewers' Comments. Whew! I prefer to limit the scope of my Comments.<br/><br/>The truly tragic scene in the film is Roy Batty's death. Desperate to prolong his life, he rages ""against the dying of the light."" Confronting his creator, Eldon Tyrell, he learns that his life is NOT extendible. Only at the end does he accept his fate; head bowed, he finally lets go. His life ebbs away as Deckard, the implacable enemy whose life he spared, looks on. <br/><br/>""ALL THOSE MOMENTS WILL BE LOST IN TIME, LIKE TEARS IN RAIN.""<br/><br/>I am reminded of the universally evocative ancient Hellenistic statue, THE DYING GAUL (230-220 B.C.), which depicts the final agonals of a wounded warrior whose army has been vanquished. Over the centuries, this statue has elicited great sadness and sympathy for the fallen warrior. <br/><br/>Are there any Tragic Heroes in Blade Runner? Who comes closest is Roy Batty, endowed by his creator with superhuman beauty, intelligence, strength and will (Milton, anyone?). His tragic flaws were either flukes or intentionally built into him by his creator; his short life span was a precautionary measure, we are told. Tragically, his humanity developed too late.<br/><br/>BLADE RUNNER is, in my opinion, also a work of art for the ages.<br/><br/>Milton? you say. After seeing it in the mid-70's. I concluded that Star Wars was inspired by John Milton's PARADISE LOST. The ancient questions and verities will be with us always."

","""Blade Runner"" is among the best and most influential science fiction movies of all time. It has influenced countless stories set in ""dystopian"" futures with its depiction. It is not of the same stripe of science fiction as Star Wars or Star Trek, as its story is grounded in a grim Los Angeles of 2019. Some people may the film's brand of science fiction slow-paced due to its emphasis on slowly developing a story over action sequences, although the film does have a few well-placed action scenes. However, for those that can enjoy the unfolding of a science fiction detective story, ""Blade Runner"" is great.<br/><br/>The dim, smoky vision of Los Angeles in 2019 is mesmerizing and one you are unlikely to forget. Vangelis' score is very appropriate to match the setting and extremely memorable, and I particularly enjoyed the main title track and ""Blade Runner Blues"". Every performance in the film is excellent from Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard to the supporting cast. The engaging plot and characterization and the questions the film raises make the film suitable for repeat viewings.<br/><br/>There is considerable debate between which is better between the two cuts of the film currently available, the original theatrical cut and the director's cut. Both are worth seeing if possible. Harrison Ford's narration in the theatrical cut fills provides interesting details and is worth hearing at least once, but is not strictly necessary. I prefer the director's cut because I welcomed the scenes not in the theatrical cut and found the ending more appropriate."

","Underneath the spectacular and somehow sad shots of the futuristic urban landscape, deep and disquieting questions are creeping: Are my memories real? Are they my own? And if not, who am I? Was I born, or created with a banal purpose? Is my disappearance preestablished even since before my existence? Will every thought be lost? Not only my thoughts, but all of them? How do we price life?<br/><br/>The eye concentrates all ""Blade Runner"" simbology: consciousness, conscience, and the unconscious, the faking of emotions, identity, sadness facing an unfriendly future, and the killing of creators: in fact, the murder of aspiring deities. That postmodern Prometheus named Eldon Tyrell could have thought better than creating cold-hearted creatures: his demise at the hands of one of his creations (after an almost incestuous kiss) is coherent in a film obsessed with eyes.<br/><br/>Unforgettable scene when Pris, created to be a living sexual doll, but with a mind of her own that grants her the ability to suffer, is hiding among genuine mindless dolls. And then there is the lyric aspect of the film: a sensible romance and wonderful music, and of course that final monologue just before the last mortal replicant releases his soul (symbolized, in a very classical way, by a bird).<br/><br/>All this is present in both versions of the film, but the director's cut is better, more noir, more conclusive, and with a richer layering: in the commercial cut, Gaff's little figures (besides their symbolism of Deckard's situation) only serve a minor revelation, namely that Gaff had been at Deckard's home and let Rachel live, while in the director's cut the (now absolutely necessary) unicorn dream sequence turns this into a major revelation, because Deckard's intimate thoughts are known by Gaff, which means Deckard is a replicant.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott has never equaled himself, not even in ""Thelma and Louise"" or ""Gladiator"", and the merit of his co-workers can not be overlooked: Hampton Fancher and David Peoples as screenwriters, composer Vangelis, designer Syd Mead, FX wizard Douglas Trumbull, etc.<br/><br/>Not to forget Philip K. Dick's inherently philosophical literature, much of whose anticipation will continually catch us in the next years, as unfearful scientists begin to play with the possibility of creating artificial minds: beware of your offsprings!<br/><br/>10 out of 10 for Ridley Scott and all the rest, and perhaps for a masterpiece that, in a certain sense, created itself at the right time."

","It must be wryly amusing for anyone who was originally involved in the making of this film to read 21st century reviews of the film. After being mercilessly slaughtered by critics at the time of its original release a quarter of a century ago, Blade Runner is now hailed by critics - probably many of the same as the most influential and visionary sci-fi film ever made. It is one of few select films which have had a great afterlife, long after they were originally released to an indifferent public.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, the VCR revolution of the early 80's was the saviour of Blade Runner. The incredibly detailed cityscapes, the wonderfully observed roles of the replicants with their various unique physical traits and mannerisms, and the searing vision of an over-populated, acid-rain drenched Los Angles, were scrutinised, studied and raved over by the midnight movie / art student crowd. Word of mouth grew over the years, generating a huge fan-boy subculture which exist to this day (indeed, try typing Blade Runner into your search engine and check out some of the stunningly designed fan sites dedicated to the film). Other film-makers started to steal many of the visual motifs and concepts of the film; which is probably one of the most referenced works of art ever produced. You can see Blade Runner steals in toys, computer games, virtually any Japanese Sci-Fi Manga / Anime (Akira and Silent Mobius are stand out examples), countless TV shows and of course other dystopian Sci-fi epics.<br/><br/>So why the great influence? Visually, the film is still stunning, a totally convincing vision of a near-future LA of incessant pollution, commercial-drenched neon avenues and oppressive, towering skyscrapers. Pretty awesome when you think that CGI was only just rearing its head in the likes of Tron (released the same summer). The population is a broad mix of religions, races and languages, which is the way most major city centres are like now. Ridley Scott has never since achieved the same visual splendour  save perhaps for Gladiator  as this film.<br/><br/>The story itself is a pretty standard hardboiled noir cop thriller, with Harrison Ford's weary, disillusioned cop (Blade runner) being forced to hunt down illegal artificial slaves (replicants) who have escaped from deep space colonies and are attempting to reach their creators (the Tyrell Corporation) in order to extend their 4-year lifespan.<br/><br/>I won't tell the reader any more  It is for the fresh viewer to check out the details, I'll only give them the broad brush strokes.<br/><br/>Let it just be said that Blade Runner is a powerful, evocative and truly astonishing picture that rewards the viewer every time you watch it. If you can't take something away from this picture, then you are not a cinema lover."

Time to die..""<br/><br/>The beauty about the good science fiction it's that's craft a poetic view of our self, a world were we can achieve the edge of our potentials.<br/><br/>Here we are talking about one of the most influential pictures in all the movie history. Ghost in the Shell, The Matrix, Akira, The Five Element, don't exist whit out this Sci-fi epic, that's create. More than 20 years before its release this movie looks like new, it's like Citizen Kane, Casablanca or Lawrence of Arabia, because like any other truly master peace it's a reflection of his own time, also it is a critic, to all the previous and subsequent art, at the same time it is a critic to itself, that's why the real classics are above of time.<br/><br/>Ridley Scot creates an indispensable cult reference. He use for first time special effects and technology as and aesthetic and artistic element as parts of the narrative. The incredible and retro productions design and set decoration, the avant Gard special effects, the cloths, in resume, any object in film transport you to a dream reality, to a nostalgic space in side your brain. Harrison Ford and Rutter Hauer deserves and academy award nomination for best acting both. Also, the rest of the cast are perfect, the performances are fabulous, I can not imagine any other actor to play the role of some of which they appear in the film.<br/><br/>The groundbreaking soundtrack of the Vangelis, create the right atmosphere. When you hear the music its make you feel like if you look a Rene Magritte canvas, its the world that you see whit your eyes, but something it is not correct, and annoying you in a very subtle way, also developed in side you the sensation of expansion of your mind whit out not boundaries.<br/><br/>This its truly science fiction, no fantasy like Star Wars (I am say this not as an insult, its only editorial comparison), because Blade Runner talks about human condition, if you read the screen play and tray to made a resume of the plot, you only would see the history of a police officer who tray to kill some androids, but if you made a reflection you will see that this picture represents the internal and eternal fight to try to define the essence of the human condition, using a futurist scene and characters in parts of robots with human actions and emotions to make patent the point in comment, all time you know that robots don't exist, as they appear in the movie, but at the same time you cant avoid to identify your self whit the characters, and to see with greater clarity your own complexity in the process.

","I can't put off, any longer, commenting on this film. I first watched it back in 82 and it has remained in my top 5 favourite films (sci-fi or not) ever since.<br/><br/>Where do you start? Opening sequence with cityscape and explosions of light coupled with Vangelis music - superb. Portrayal of life some 40 years in the future was, for me, far more realistic than many similar attempts. I am guessing that large city life would be very crowded, dark, rainy and multi-cultural. I am also guessing that spoken language would be merged into combination of many. OK there were a couple of police cars hovering about but we had Harrier Vertical take off jets back in the 60's.<br/><br/>They reckoned that Harrison Ford was unhappy playing Deckard but, uncomfortable or not, a hallmark Ford performance as the downbeat, struggling ex-retirer of Replicants (humanoids) - we have seen this kind of role repeated so often by Harrison in his later films.<br/><br/>We start off disliking, even being a bit frightened by, the 4 Replicants but, as the movie progresses, you can't help feeling sympathy for them and their need to understand where they came from, why they were created and how long they would live for - very human concerns that we all share.<br/><br/>Loved the Gothic city scenes, the hi-tech flying advertising boards, the constant rain, the building interiors, the photography, sounds, music, acting - well, just about everything.<br/><br/>Highlight? You guessed it - Roy's (Rutger Hauer's) final speech complete with doves  no, I'm not quoting it here  why not see it for yourself? - you won't be disappointed."
"tetractys","9","1","2","22 April 2007"," Brilliantly staged classic
","Just about everyone who has seen this classic 1982 visionary sci-fi flick from Ridley Scott has seen the version with Harrison Ford's voice-over, which was the first production release. The more recent ""director's cut"" (which isn't, really) omits the narration and includes a few theme-clarifying scenes. A true director's cut would have included scenes omitted by producers for lack of money and time during production. The narrated version has been viewed so extensively that the ambiguity and subtlety intended by the director will never be widely experienced.<br/><br/>That said, the confusing and legendary production hassles associated with this film did little to reduce its impact since the real star of the film is the visual interpretation of a future world full of pollution, advertising and proletarian masses. Superimposed is the story of a hunt for renegade androids, but that is secondary. The poignant and depressing mood, highlighted with moments of nobility and love, presents an antidote for Scott to the criticism of his previous Alien, scorned by some critics as a hunt for a monster in a rubber suit.<br/><br/>Comparison to the movie's handling of the nature of the androids and the hunters to that of Philip Dick, the author of the novel on which it is based, provide thematic intrigue. Are the androids admirable despite their brutality? Are the humans, despite theirs? Has the inhuman environment created a world where nobility is impossible, or can love transcend such degradation?<br/><br/>On first viewing, themes and story elements matter little. You'll revel in the mood and luscious visuals complemented by an achingly sad Vangelis music track. Bilious gas plumes, giant Gaudian advertising blimps, 800-story urban pyramids, skyscrapers with moving billboards on their sides--all at night, with a constant dreary rain--provide enough distraction to make even a movie without substance watchable. But this isn't ""2001 - A Space Odyssey,"" which gets so bogged down in visuals the story explodes. Harrison Ford falls for Sean Young--a replicant like those he hunts. Whether they manage to live happily ever after or if Ford's character is human are two of the unanswered conundrums in the script.<br/><br/>Despite Blade Runner's flaws, it remains an enduring classic far surpassing its original cult status."

","This was the best movie of science fiction I have ever seen, and one of the best 10 films ever made. It is perfect in all aspects. First of all, it is one of the big 3 science fiction films made by the experts critics (with Brazil and 2001: Space Odisey), and no one can miss it. It was made in the 1980s and based on a book of the 1950s, and shows in it a lot of things which happened after it was made, and more things which every day are being made and discovered as it was shown in it. It isn't one of most science fiction films, which are in a very rare and fictional context; this film is very close to the real future, even today, at 25 years of its release date. It is also a very good drama. It appreciates the human being, and shows it's emotional superiority towards machines; it shows the interior superiority of humans. It is a very poetic film. It also has of the best music and a very good actuation from Harrison Ford All this shows that, in conclusion, it isn't only a perfect film in it's science fiction side, it is perfect as a drama too, and has excellent music themes. It is a film which can't be missed by anyone, and I wouldn't believe someone who says that it isn't a good film."
"retrograde-1","10","1","2","15 January 2007"," ""The light that burns twice as bright lasts half as long""
","On first viewing of Blade Runner most people will be left confused and probably a little disappointed. Even thought the studio had there way to some extent (cutting part of Scotts original vision in order to increase profits) this was not a film made to appeal to niche groups and anyone looking for a generic action film with an obvious conclusion will be disappointed. For these reasons it did fail commercially on its first release in 1982.<br/><br/>It could be best described as a film noir set in the future. Power hungry corporations harness control over a mixed race of neo-Tokyo lower-class citizens living in a decadent Los-Angeles slum. Enter Rick Decard a retired private eye who gets unwillingly hired to hunt down and eliminate a group of replicants who have escaped an off-world colony and arrived on earth to in order to extend their four year limited life span.<br/><br/>Based on the Philip K. Dick novel ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep"", there are many existential themes running throughout and many questions purposely left unanswered so the viewer can come to his own conclusion. What is the nature of our existence? What does it mean to be human? Do we fully appreciate life? Are but a few.<br/><br/>Everything about this film works. The cinematography is outstanding with every scene meticulously shot. The set and design are also stunning and still sets the standard for which every sci-fi film aspires too.<br/><br/>The actors are also cast perfectly. Harrison Ford plays Rick Decard a man troubled by the demons of the past with seemingly no escape from his violent reality and Rutgar Hauer as Roy Batty the replicant leader haunted by his mortality, unable to find a cure. The supporting cast also put in memorable performances. A special mention to the futuristic, synthetic score by Vangelis that draws the viewer deeper into this dystopian view of the future. It gets better with repeat viewings in that you slowly uncover new insights into the character motivations and the heavy use of symbolism. Its a near flawless film and could entertain endless hours of discussion. Watch both the directors cut and voice over editions to fully appreciate this masterpiece."

They escape from their working place (spaceship) and return to earth to find their creator. They have limited maximum four years lifetime and they are programmed with the safety software which prevents them knowledgeable about their robot beings. The company which produces replicants also invents a device contains fake personal history so they can remember their pasts.<br/><br/>Blade Runner unit is a special group of cops who have the only power to destroy the replicants. The story of movie focuses on Blade Runner, Deckard, played by Harrison Ford. Deckard is the only cop who can terminate (retire) renegades replicants.But when he falls in love with another replicant Rachel, he starts to think about what he is doing<br/><br/>The movie moves very slowly as a science fiction, but it is perfect for a movie which you can also consider a film noir.However. Blade Runner is unique movie which combines two completely different genres in an excellent way.<br/><br/>Acting is superb in the Blade Runner. Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer performances are one of the best in their career and Sean Young's performance is also fairly good and fits perfectly for her character. <br/><br/>Visual effects are simply great in the movie. In the opening scene, big skyscrapers, disturbing fireballs, huge and cold buildings show us that future is not friendly. Flying cars and sky taxis also look pretty convincing.<br/><br/>Score and music of the movie manage to give moody ambiance of the dark future and also using of synthesizer works well in haunting scenes.<br/><br/>In a philosophical perspective, Blade Runner forces its audience and asks ""What makes us different than artificial"" or being an artificial makes them less human. While the movie is asking these questions, we watch war between humanity and replicants.<br/><br/>These four android and their desire to live represent that they are not just robots. They are more than artificial beings. They can feel, they can have passions and important than everything they can love. In this point movie clearly delivers its messages to audience<br/><br/>I believe that, the philosophical aspect, dramatic story line, dark and pessimistic ambiance and magnificent finale make the Blade runner greatest science fiction movie ever made."

After buying it, i wondered if I had wasted my money. I did not.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is one of the greatest achievements in cinema. The idea is taken from a book, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep."" And of course, a movie can never fully translate from the book, but this movie would stand alone if the book never existed.<br/><br/>The director gave such a vivid and detailed glimpse into a world dominated by a sort of ""super capitalistic"" view. The world is over crowded, over polluted, full of strange mutants, and almost everyone smokes. The mood set by the atmosphere of this potential future is perfect for the theme of the movie. The constant rain and low lighting provide a somewhat depressing atmosphere. And in some ways, the theme of the movie is depressing. What is the meaning of life? What does it mean to be human? Not that those questions themselves are depressing, but when you see this movie and you see the way things turn out and how the theme is presented, you will understand how well it reflects the atmosphere provided.<br/><br/>The acting is above average in this movie.

","Ridley Scott,""Blade Runner""'s director, is the main star here. That is not to suggest that Harrison Ford and the cast do a bad job. On the contrary, the whole film is a nice piece of work. However, with the feel of the film and the overall look (back in 1982, no less), its consistency was all in Scott's hands and he could've dropped the ball. Like his work in ""Alien"" before, ""Blade Runner"" continues to shine without appearing to be dated. <br/><br/>My only problem with the film is its lack of emotion. In a sense, the film is cold. Perhaps as a commentary on the Replicants and the future which Scott has created, he may have chosen a sterile environment on purpose, as to gauge what we believe makes us human. No one is special in the film, aside from Roy, himself a Replicant. In the end, it is Roy who appears more concerned with the finality of his situation than anyone else. And, although whether intended or by accident, the viewer will sympathize with him more than with anyone else."

","Decker (Harrison Ford) lives in 2019 Los Angeles. He is a mostly retired blade runner, that is, a person who hunts down replicants and eliminates them. Replicants are manufactured human beings that do work on the ""off colonies"" of far space that regular human beings have populated, too. Replicants, who are vital in the colonies, are forbidden to come to planet earth. If they do, they are tracked down and killed. Most of them have superior physical powers but lack problem solving and reasoning skills and have few emotions. Although Decker wants to be retired, a particularly lethal group of replicants manages to come to earth and the big boss police chief makes it clear to Decker that he is needed. Or else. Decker begins to hunt down the four replicants on the loose, just as he meets a lady named Rachel, who may be a replicant, too, and a very pretty one. Is there really a world of difference between humans and replicants? What have we really done to ourselves and our civilization by making these ""almost"" human beings? This is one of the greatest movies of all time. The story is taken from a work by Philip K. Dick and is superior science fiction. Ford embodies the morally confused but determined blade runner very well. The other actors, especially Rutger Hauer and Sean Young, do fine work, too. However, the style of the film is the movie's greatest asset. The seamy modern world that Ridley Scott and his companions have created is beyond wonderful. From the flying transport machines that bark out advertisements to the people below to the decayed buildings from another era, this is a world one has to see to appreciate. If you have never seen this film, don't walk to the nearest video store or library. Run at top speed and wrestle the film out of someone else's hands, if you have to. This is a piece of celluloid that will be studied for ages to come."

It is a well thought out film and the acting is brilliant too. Vangelis creates such a perfect musical soundscape using technology for almost the whole soundtrack and it really suits the film. I don't think this film could ever be made in the same way again. I give it 10 out of 10 and that's after seeing it a countless number of times so I advise everyone of all ages watches it!

","Blade runner is... wow. It is a classic in every manner a movie can be. Quite possibly the greatest sci-fi movie ever made, Blade Runner takes us to the distant dystopian sprawl of Los Angeles. In Blade Runner's future, war and pollution have wracked the earth, and killed the wildlife. Humans greed and technological might have created the replicantes. Replicantes are perfect biological constructs, built of flesh and bone, they are superior to humans in every way. To prevent an uprising, the replicantes are given hardwired four year life-spans and their brains are filled with programmed responses and coding, this is the only way to tell the difference between a replicant and a human.<br/><br/>As the story progresses, a tale of humanity and acceptance is unveiled. The movie, much as the book had, explores what it means to be human, and it addresses many of the evils of humanity in a way anyone can relate to. It does not vilify technology, nor does it shove a moral down your throat, rather, it does something very few movies have dared to do, even in the 20+ years since it's arrival. That is, it trusts the viewer. As an action movie, it is decent, but that is not where it's heart lies. Truly a classic, a necessity for any sci-fi fan."
"mentalcritic","10","1","2","3 July 2006"," More relevant now than it was in 1982
","Recently, the Aspies For Freedom website published a list of the ten characters in feature films whose mannerisms and stories most closely match those of real Aspies. Some of the choices were not so surprising (Edward Scissorhands, Fred Tate). Others were somewhat odd (RoboCop, Khan Noonien Singh). But the characters who shared the top place are all from this film. Not so coincidentally, they are all Replicants. In the midst of a propaganda war with normalist organisations such as Cure Autism Now that want you to believe being on the autistic spectrum automatically makes one of no worth to society, Blade Runner elegantly sums up what life is really like for those of us on the higher end of said spectrum. You know, those of us who build tomorrow's computers or paint tomorrow's masterpieces, just to name a few things. The thing that catapults Blade Runner into such brilliance that it should be preserved as an example of Western culture at its very greatest is that this relevance is completely accidental.<br/><br/>The story is as simple as it is shocking. Although 2019 is fast approaching, and the floating car or human machine is still a fantasy, what is important to understand is that in a world of equal poverty and despair, mankind has created the new underclass. Terrified by the fact that these artificial humans are their equals in intelligence and their superiors in physical strength, humanity creates a new police force with the sole purpose of hunting this new underclass. Treated as if they are mere property, or pets that have gone bad, members of this new slave underclass come to Earth seeking the ability to extend their lives. As the plot summary on the Region 4 DVD says, their only crime is wanting to be human. Although the film only gives vague hints of this, these poor creatures are pretty much birthed and then thrown into a life of slavery without so much as a pause. If mankind can rise to the level of his betters, then he will do his damnedest to drag his betters down to his level.<br/><br/>To be fair, Blade Runner does take its time to develop its story, and a lengthy attention span is required to get the most out of it. In contrast to many films made around the same time or in the subsequent years, it is designed to reward the intellect of its audience rather than their conformity. With a third and ostensibly final cut of the film on its way, there is already some minor debate over which of the two previous editions is the better one. For my money, the director's cut wins every time. The voiceovers of the theatrical release are obnoxious and insulting to the intelligence of the viewer. The happy ending robs the film of its final-note impact. And without Deckard's dreams of unicorns or his developing romance with Rachael, much of the meaning of the story is lost. Like tears in the rain. This is a supreme irony, as the so-called director's cut of Blade Runner is one of the few ""special editions"" that is shorter than the original release. Which goes to prove the old adage that the executives who sit in board rooms and make decisions all day just do not know how to properly put together films.<br/><br/>Acting performances just do not get any better than this, either. Rutger Hauer is absolutely chilling, and yet charming, as Roy Batty, the self-appointed leader of the latest bunch of rebel Replicants to make it Earthside. After monumental performances in such Dutch-language classics as Turks Fruit or Soldaat Van Oranje, Hauer rises to his apex here, and proves that in any film, a protagonist is only as good as his antagonist. Harrison Ford plays it cool and understated for the most part, making sure the audience understands his character is totally unaware that his world is about to be rocked to its foundations. The surprise factor of the final moment is as much due to his performance as a clever script. Sean Young briefly demonstrates she could have been a serious actor as the most unusual kind of love interest, and the support cast is far from shabby here, either. Joe Turkel is especially creepy as Eldon Tyrell, the ringmaster of what seems to have turned into one painfully oppressive circus. The character truly thinks nothing of creating an entire life with only one purpose in mind, and Turkel sells the fact like ice cream in a heatwave.<br/><br/>The dystopian vision of what is now a very near future also resonates in the present. As we spin through a grimy Los Angeles, we no longer have any idea who owns what, and corporate imagery is pervasive enough to feel like an eye in every corner. Product placement can be annoying in films where it is done blatantly or without any real purpose, but in Blade Runner, the placement of corporate logos gives the scenery both a reality and an artistry rarely seen elsewhere. I do not know how much TDK paid to have their logo displayed during Batty's rooftop battle with Deckard, but the imagery alone was worth every penny, and then some. In Blade Runner, TDK really does amazing things on one's system. But all this pales in comparison to the vision itself. Watching this film in Pan & Scan is akin to blinding yourself in one eye. It is like watching a waterfall through a keyhole when you could just push the door open and see a wide, rolling vista. Nobody has ever used the 2.35:1 frame as well as Sergio Leone, but Ridley Scott gave it a very good try when he shot Blade Runner.<br/><br/>It is for these reasons, and many more, that I gave Blade Runner a ten out of ten. Whether it is the director's cut or the new ""final cut"", this is modern science fiction as it should be."

","After his Alien success and it was a 1979 revelation in movie special effects, Ridley Scott turns it up another notch to show us what 2019 LA might look like. The art direction is spectacular all right. The concept, which influenced every sci-fi after: mix futuristic fantasy with retro 1930's Fascist architecture, and turn on the strobe lights and fog machine. Give the actors a bag lady wardrobe and a flying car with DeLorean gull wing doors: That's the future kids, well, sort off. The 1979 take on future communications, a phone booth with a TV screen, ha ha  no cell phones envisioned.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford could give a Sam Spade Futurama performance back then. Today he sleepwalks through his lines. I have never seen a cocky actor disintegrate over time as Ford has declined.

","When I see pages upon pages of comments I feel I should refrain from adding anything (what more can possibly be said?) But this film is probably the only modern noir film that keeps to the true spirit of the original ""film noir"" genre; you could take away most of the future-dystopia setting and it would still be a respectable gumshoe mystery thriller. Weirdly darker than the original noir feel, and yet somehow uplifting at the end too. Oddly, the original noir films were shot with very minimal settings; they made the most of simple city scenes and sets, and yet here the city has been dolled-up like some compu-TV-robot-whore, and it still works. The scenery is like another character in the film, similar to ""nature"" being a character in some wilderness films."

"deliev","Null","1","2","18 January 2006"," God Is Dead
","This film is a brilliant attempt to make you feel the existential struggle for personal value in an atheistic world. If your a theist, this movie will remind you why you are not an atheist. If your an atheist, this movie will remind you of the empty and ultimately meaningless life that you live, for ""all those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain"". If you are debating on seeing this film, I would recommend just some basic philosophical articles on nihilism, existentialism and postmodern philosophy. I believe what I posted below will be a good place to start if you want to understand the film.<br/><br/>Humanity is represented by Roy throughout the film, especially when Roy kills his creator (Nietzsche's phrase ""God is dead"" is obviously the background for Roy's symbolic act of killing his creator). Also, in the end we find out that Roy, with the nail though his hand and dove at his side, is the nihilistic Christ (the deliberate comparison to Jesus, and the reversal of his divine proclamation of eternal life cannot be missed). This movie not only asked many questions about life and meaning, it actually answers them with Roy's last ""divine"" proclamation. Basically put, if there is no Creator that can give eternal life, there is no longer value and purpose in life because all that we experience is ultimately lost. Thus, to search for true personal value in a life thats turns into nothingness is as pointless as trying to find a tear on a persons face when they are crying in the rain. Roy's failure to have his life extended is the means used to make us feel the sadness and despair that is found in an intelligent being who will soon vanish into nothingness. The intent is to make us look at out own experiences with the same despair, because if there is no God, there is no one to eternally extend our lives. Thus, when you cease to exist, and you must, all your experiences and all the work that came to make you the person you are today will be lost. So to truly understand this movie and feel its impact, you have to put yourself in Roys place, because thats where you are. Roy did not kill Deckard because he wanted him to walk in his shoes and feel what he felt; he wanted to ""enlighten"" him. Thus, we find a purpose in this film; to ""enligten"" its viewers of their own inescapable plight in an atheistic world.<br/><br/>Some have said that another purpose of the film is to show that one must make the best of the time that they have. In other words, the point of the movie is that since we must face this horrid outcome of nothingness, then there is nothing to lose in acting as if there is true purpose and meaning in our lives so as to emotionally overcome the despair. I think there is truth to that also, and the emotional act of ""making the best out of the time we have"" was represented by the unicorn in the last scene. Throughout the film, Gaff would make origami figures that represented what was going on in the scene. At the end when Deckard was leaving with Rachel he found a unicorn origami which indicated that his dreams were implanted. At this point one must ask why the writer used a mythical animal in his dream, rather then an animal that really existed? I believe the unicorn was used to describe the act of Deckard ""making the best of things"", or acting as if there is true meaning and value, for such things are just myths (like the unicorn) in an atheistic world. Thus, to act as if such things as unicorns, value and worth were true, one would have to knowingly fool themselves and act as if the unreal is real, which is exactly what Deckard had to do with Rachel, and possibly him self. Where as Roy was not willing or was unable to entertain such emotionally driven human delusions, Deckard was and therefore joined humanity. <br/><br/>""GOD IS DEAD"" From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: <br/><br/>God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we, murderers of all murderers, console ourselves? That which was the holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet possessed has bled to death under our knives. Who will wipe this blood off us? With what water could we purify ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we need to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we not ourselves become gods simply to be worthy of it? - Nietzsche, The Gay Science"" <br/><br/>""EXISTENTIALISM"" From Wikipedia,the free encyclopedia.<br/><br/>""Books such as DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP, by Philip K. Dick, and Toilet: The Novel, by Michael Szymczyk all distort the line between reality and appearance while simultaneously espousing strong existential themes.""<br/><br/>""much postmodern writing is existential--unsurprising, since postmodernism evolved from the thought of NIETZSCHE and Heidegger""<br/><br/>""Existentialism is a philosophical movement that views human existence as having a set of underlying themes and characteristics, such as anxiety, dread, freedom, awareness of death, and consciousness of existing, that are primary."""

"MaxBorg89","10","1","2","9 November 2005"," This film's moments will never be lost in time, like tears in rain...
","""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe."" This frequently quoted line, spoken by the villainous Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), sums up the essence of Blade Runner: it's an incredible experience. Yes, there have been controversies about the film from the day it was released, be it the arguments between director Ridley Scott and the producers over which version should be shown to the public or rumors about the filming being ""troubled"", but such gossip shouldn't detract from the picture's merits, and there are plenty; in fact, a lot of people consider Blade Runner the best science-fiction movie ever made, and they do have a point - how many sci-fi flicks manage to fuse film noir atmosphere and characters with philosophical doubts on the very nature of mankind?<br/><br/>Specifically, the story, based on a novel by Philip K. Dick, is strongly influenced by the theories of Swiss philosopher René Descartes, aka Carthesius. One of the main concerns of his line of thought was the difference between men and machines, the main theme of the film: in 2019, replicants used to be part of everyday life, but are now dangerous and must be eliminated. Five of these ""skin-jobs"", however, are still at large in Los Angeles, which is why reluctant ""blade runner"" Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is asked to track them down. But as he gets more and more disillusioned about his work and develops odd feelings for one of the replicants (Sean Young), he begins to wonder: is there really something that sets him apart from the entities he is hunting? Batty and his lover Pris (Daryl Hannah) are trying to answer that question by eliminating the last imperfection that makes them less ""human"" (they only live five years), and Pris even claims to be as normal as any other person by saying: ""I think, therefore I am."" (another Carthesius-related element). <br/><br/>With his first two films (The Duellists and Alien) accused of being more about style and mood than content, Scott combines form and substance in what is widely regarded as his best achievement: the rainy, gloomy L.A. (all real sets, no CGI) sets the tone perfectly for a futuristic noir that renewed the genre by crafting an intelligent, heartfelt and adult story, making Warner Brothers' decision to chuck in a ""happy ending"" (subsequently removed, alongside Deckard's uninspired narration, from the Director's Cut, which is the version I'm reviewing) utterly ridiculous. I mean, how can a movie set in a bleak future where even humanity itself is a debatable topic end on a cheerful note?<br/><br/>Speaking of humanity, the film's point is reflected masterfully in the performances: Ford's laconic, apparently cold anti-hero is one of his best characters, and his doomed bond with Young is endearing to this day, but the whole movie is shamelessly stolen by the ""monstrous"" Batty, to whom Hauer gives a scary intensity that makes the doubtful replicant more complex and the Dutch actor's work (the best of his career) more touching, particularly when he remembers all the things that he has seen and will inevitably be ""lost in time"".<br/><br/>Dark and unsettling, Blade Runner is a beautiful, nightmarish and fascinating journey in a twisted society. No other sci-fi movie can match this one in terms of impact, both visual and emotional, and after seeing it one might ask himself what it must be like to see ""attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion"" or ""C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate""."

It would be like showing the ""Mona Lisa"" only from the neck up. It is like reading the Cliff Notes of ""Hamlet"". It is a cinematic sin. Those who commit this sin are anathema. A mark of a good film is how often it gets imitated. This film has been imitated by too many people to count. No one has come close to the visual aura of this film.<br/><br/>This film also contains one of the finest monologues of film history.

","The comment made by police captain Bryant, ""You're either cops, or little people,"" is significant in that it highlights the mindset of powerful and elite people to view the masses as worth only what can be taken from them or what they can be forced to do. Although Blade Runner is set in futuristic Los Angeles, it may accurately represent the future of a world with two classes--those who are rich, and those who are slaves. Even now the transition from worker to slave is well under way in the United States, where it will ultimately be perfected. Better to be a machine of the future and live in fear than a human.

","I love the things that you don't notice specifically on the first viewing. These things contribute to the overall atmosphere of the film, but I really noticed them after I had first seen the film. For example, Deckard's sardonic voice-over; Sebastian's loneliness and guilt which causes him to let Pris into his home although he is suspicious of her; Rachael's 40's dress and hairstyle; the inhumane testing of the 'droids; the photos that are so important to all the characters (Deckard has his, too); the casual cruelty of these creators of the androids. The wonderful humanity of Roy in the end.<br/><br/>Also, what about the light reflected in the androids eyes? Deckard's eyes reflect light in the same way. Has he been created to kill androids? Ridley Scott thought so.<br/><br/>Now other movie looked like this in 1982. Everything since has been derivative of this watershed film. Those wonderful shots of a dystopic LA in the future were jaw-dropping when I saw it in the theater in 1982. Ridley Scott used a Frank Lloyd Wright house as Deckard's apartment; this is a totally unique environment with it's walls of Mayan stellae and low ceilings. Sebastian's apartment is in the famous Bradbury (named after Ray Bradbury) building in LA. <br/><br/>This is a wonderful movie!"

","""Then we're stupid, and we'll die"" Pris says to Roy after he tells her they are the only two andys left. Blade Runner was pulled from the fantastic dystopian sci-fi book entitled ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" written by the well-known sci-fi author Phillip K. Dick. The original book is a fantastic read, with detailed imagery, and a truly deep understanding of human nature and perversion. The movie is one of the rare cases in which it is just as superior (if not more) than the book it followed.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford does a fantastic job playing the hardened ""Blade Runner"" who makes a life of hunting down and killing escaped ""skin jobs"", ""replicants"", or in the books case ""andys"". The new Nexus 6 (brain unit) is a highly superior android virtually identical to a human. These Nexus 6 are not per say evil, but come across as being murderers--this is due to the fact that 1. they have a lack of ""empathy"", and 2. the are being hunted down like dogs. The term used to label the killing of them isn't ""murder"", but ""retirement"".<br/><br/>The movie has brilliant cinematography (some of the best ever) and an unbelievably creative and hyper-real dystopian environment has been created to feature a post-war world that has been seemingly destroyed, (although the cities are bustling with activity).

","Others here might have commented on the plot and the book that inspired this feat of film-making, or on which version they preferred (director's cut or theatrical). I just want to add my highly subjective two cents. I've seen this movie numerous times now. After watching it again last night, I still find it so moving that I can't get it out of my head. I'm always immediately caught by the combination of the visuals and the music. Their synergy never seems to lose its impact, continuing to haunt my mind after the credits have rolled. The colours, the sounds. They all create this vision of a future that is heart-rendingly beautiful in its painful loneliness. The shots of the busy, crowded city contrasts with the man whose soul is silent. He might narrate the film (in the theatrical version), but to me his forced talking always seems as if he is urging himself to be alive and be part of the world around him. If he dropped the speaking, he might move back to his innate inertia. <br/><br/>The movie places you in his shoes, making you feel and hear the loneliness that is his life. Ironic, so much sound, yet so much silence. Vangelis' music is brilliant in it's ability to make the score more silent than silence itself. Also ironic is that Deckard's truest human interactions are with replicates. His conversations with real humans are devoid of meaning to him, and are only necessitated by his assignment. But his dealings with the replicates take on something greater: meaningful, important interactions at a subconscious level that leaves him changed each time. And then there is Rachel. The only other like him. The only person who feels real and alive to him, who makes him notice he's alive. It must have been some sort of betrayal to him when she implies she doesn't know whether her feelings for him can be trusted, whether they are real or artificial.<br/><br/>Perhaps the film's message is to show us that to be human is to feel and to live and to care. To be consciously present in each moment, as exhibited by the replicates desperately savouring their precious lives and implanted memories. This is opposed to the routine and almost automated behaviour of the real humans in the film, where each interaction is business-like. Though the world of Blade Runner doesn't appear to be showing up anytime soon (the future has changed too much now to conform to the projected visions of the book or film) it's still a lesson we can learn. We don't want to be among the few who are truly alive, living in a world crowded by people whose social behaviour has evolved into that of robots. It is telling that real animals are practically absent in this film. Because they cannot help being natural and true to themselves, their lively presence would have conflicted with the authenticity of the settings, confusing the feelings this film evokes.<br/><br/>Though I consider my tastes minimalist when it comes to romance, I'd have to qualify this film as such. It is in equal parts science-fiction, drama and romance. My girlfriend, though a peace- and nature-loving Korean animist, considers this film a favourite in spite of the violence and absence of nature. Together with The Terminator she also ranks it amongst the most romantic films of all time. So there you have it. It's memorable in every way and appeals to both genders. Having just watched the theatrical version, I find it hard to forget the final images. Deckard driving off with Rachel, fleeing, looking for a life they could share in a world that makes sense to them and allows them to just be. Strange how this scene is bathed in a light that is otherwise absent from the film, which for the most part was set in a perpetual night. The daylight makes it almost dreamlike, which it perhaps signifies. Yet I like to entertain the thought that the end is not a dream, that they did get away. If no one else."

","The motto of the Tyrell Corporation. A catchy one for a company that makes human-like replicants or skin-jobs. To me, this is my all-time favorite movie. I will admit to liking the original theatrical release better than the directors cut. Ridley Scott is a great director, but I still feel that both versions should have been included on the DVD.<br/><br/>My first viewing of this film was on VHS in the Undergraduate library at UNC Chapel Hill in about 1984. It was a distracting place to watch a movie like this. I have to say, I was left with a feeling of confusion, but also a desire to keep watching this one until I got it. This movie is layered is such a way as to be confusing to the casual viewer. My advice to a first-timer is to turn off the cell phone and concentrate on the film. Take in the incredible set design, costumes, music score, sound effects, lighting...everything. The acting and story will take care of itself.<br/><br/>The book this movie is based on by Phillip K. Dick ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" has some significant differences from the movie. Deckard is married in the book and Rachael is not even a possible love interest. Anyone that read the book first can understand my feeling when Deckard enters his room and slowly reaches down to Rachael. My heart was pounding as my first thought was that she would attack him or he would shoot, or...<br/><br/>The acting is superb in this masterpiece of science fiction. Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer are at their best. The physical aspect of their interaction is heightened by the ability to put just the right amount of dialog in the scenes to keep you on the edge of your seat when the time is right. Hauer plays the angry, but fragile Roy Batty with what I think is his best performance. Sean Young I don't think has ever again had a role to fit her like Rachael. Cold and distant, and later frightened and vulnerable. Even Walsh puts in a fine performance as the crusty policeman.<br/><br/>I am glad William Saunderson has found his way back to stardom with Deadwood. He has always been great at this type of role.<br/><br/>All in all there just isn't anything wrong enough with this film to give it even one bad comment. I just can't think of ONE. If you have seen it once keep watching it. You will get more each time (to me the mark of a great film)."
"simonrheath","8","1","2","28 April 2005"," Dick's book more intriguing then movie which is really good
","I am a long time fan of Blade Runner. As a result of my fascination with the movie, and in order to find out if Rick Deckard was really an android, I decided to go to the source material - Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.<br/><br/>The book was more complex then the movie. While the movie addresses several of the themes of the book, it does not, in my opinion address the distinguishing feature between humans and androids: empathy (which in the movie and book can be tested by the Voigt/Kampff scale used by bounty hunters).<br/><br/>In the novel, Dick creates a religion called Mercerism which is based on humans collectively sharing their empathy. Only by understanding the concept of Mercerism can the reader begin to understand the real differences between humans and androids. Mercerism provides an analytical framework which the reader can use to classify similarities and differences. However, once the reader thinks she understands the similarities and differences, they are turned up-side down and rearranged. The focus remains constant throughout: what does it mean to be human?<br/><br/>I wish that Scott had incorporated the concept of Mercerism into the movie because it would have given the movie direction on the issue of what it means to be human."

I didn't like the acting much, I didn't like the music and the whole neo-futuristic-film-noir thing wasn't very impressive as it's been aped in films for the past two decades and some of them have done it a bit better.<br/><br/>I felt the romance between Harrison Ford and Sean Young was entirely unbelievable and given very little time to develop - it's him suddenly wooing her and romancing her without much actual chemistry forming. Their romance is a vital part of the story but I felt it was given very little focus.<br/><br/>However on second and third viewing I suddenly realized what a masterpiece ""Blade Runner"" is. I seemed to ""get"" it; perhaps I understood the point of the film's ending more. I originally loathed the wacky OTT climax, considering it stupid and unoriginal/unimaginative - but on second viewing I picked up on all the subtleties and was touched by Hauer's final speech, particularly the ""like tears in rain"" moment.<br/><br/>Overall this really is a fantastic sci-fi film noir story - it successfully mixes various genres. Its effects are a bit outdated now and if you sit down to watch it expecting too much you're likely to be disappointed - it has its fair share of flaws (from technical to story-wise) but if you can overlook some of these it really is a great deal of fun, even if it's not ""the"" best science fiction film (as some people have claimed)."

","I'm not an ardent science-fiction fan but this film is one of the very best. It has some of the most stunning sound and visuals. OK, it's showing its age now - but it was shot in 1981 without the aid of CGI which spoils so many new films.<br/><br/>For me, the plight of the replicants was almost heart-breaking. It raises the question of when a machine becomes a human, and vice versa, which may become relevant to us all one day as medical science and nanotechnology converge.<br/><br/>I've only seen the director's cut so I can't comment on the original vs. director's cut debate - but I can't see how Ridley Scott's interpretation could be bettered."

","As Blade Runner Harrison Ford lurks in a paranoid daze through the perpetually rainy, dreary futuristic Los Angeles, we see a story unfolding which although set in a bleak futuristic vision, is as old as the hills. The conflict is not only between the Replicants and the Humans (in fact, as god-like corporate head honcho James Tyrell puts it -they're ""more human than human""), but also the conflict within Harrison Ford's character, the government assassin brought out of retirement to slay the 5 rogue Replicants, led by a philosopher-warrior Replicant played beautifully by Rutger Hauer. <br/><br/>Harrison Ford's narration has been blasted by some, and would you believe it, they removed it for the 'Director's Cut', thoroughly eliminating my desire to see said Cut. The narration is the final and crucial complement to an intoxicatingly spellbinding blend of Ridley Scott's masterful cinematography and scene-sense...Vangelis' incomprehensibly beautiful soundtrack (perhaps his best), and the understated, dream-like acting from the supporting cast, creating perhaps the most entrancing color film of all time. To remove Ford's narration is criminal, SEE THE ORIGINAL VERSION IF YOU CAN FIND IT...an increasingly difficult task. I suggest looking in overseas markets, England, etc.<br/><br/>If you've never seen this movie, shame on you. Seriously, no matter what you're into, you'll at least like it, if not love it. Just be in a relaxed frame of mind, and turn the lights low.<br/><br/>Watch for the scene where Tyrell unwittingly meets with Hauer's Replicant...who wants ""more life"" (the Replicant's lives, though rich with their powerful abilities, are brief..hence Tyrell's effort at explanation: ""The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long""). Surrounded by gold and amber materials and ambient lighting in his heavenly apartment, fittingly atop his pyramid-like office building monstrosity, Tyrell emerges in his exquisite silk robes with a god-like light and aura around him...not-so-subtle but savagely effective metaphor. I won't tell you what happens. <br/><br/>The last scene between Hauer and Ford, atop a rusty iron mammoth of a building...in the rain, again, is one of the great dramatic and touching scenes in movie history.<br/><br/>-J. Simmons"

","After viewing this director's cut, how can any sci fi fan go back to the original with all the boring voice-overs ? Each time I watch Blade Runner on DVD, I get a new sense of the beauty of the film. If one can get past the ""darker"" scenes - which add perfectly to the story line - the plot is near perfect. Another interest that I have in the movie is that it has a great love story and an ending that is suited to my romantic tastes. May the couple live long together. The movie is perfectly cast. There is no better villain than Rutger Hauer, and he even overshadows Harrison Ford as the replicant leader, and James' character as Leon is superb. I especially like William Sanderson as Sebastian, a perfect role for him. And of course, Sean Young is stunning as Ford's love interest. I never tire of this movie and am waiting for the remastered director's cut.<br/><br/>I wonder if there are scenes that were deleted that will be added ?"

Visually stunning, narratively engaging and rewarding, and worthy of repeated viewings to fully understand its depth.  This could almost be Travis Bickle's view of the future, as it bears a strong resemblance to his own New York (without the space-ships etc). The lack of constant, flowing action may turn off some people, but for the rest of us, the dialogue, the ideas, the plot, are enough to occupy our thoughts for the nights after watching it. Ford slouches through the film, effectively showing Decker to be more lifeless than the clones, but Hauer steals the film, in an impressively psychotic display, one he would perfect later in The Hitcher. If the plot confuses, the visuals will make it all better. Don't worry."

","Based on the book ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" by the late Philip K. Dick.<br/><br/>Ford is Rick Deckard, a burned out bounty hunter cop officially called a BLADE RUNNER who was charged with the job of killing cyborgs called ""replicants"", who are human like in appearance but can be built with super strength, super stamina, super everything, including super intelligence, or they can be built to be stupid. A group of replicants led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) has made it to Earth from an off world colony (the late Brion James as Leon, Joanna Cassidy as Zora, and a pre-Splash Daryl Hannah as Priss). Even though replicants are supposed to die after 4 years in order to keep them from copying human emotions too accurately, they still cause problems, which leads to the creation of blade runners being employed to kill them. Deckard is yanked out of retirement when the blade runner who was assigned to ""retire"" (kill) them is put on a ventilator by Leon and given orders to pick up where the other guy left off. First, however, Deckard meets Rachael (Sean Young), a replicant who doesn't even know that she's a replicant but is ""beginning to suspect"" and later has a torrid love affair with Deckard, leaving Deckard with the ethical dilemma of either killing her or hiding her.<br/><br/>But is Deckard himself a genuine human? Hopefully not, because that would take all the sting and exoticism out of his relationship with Rachael. But you never know, he may very well be one of them, as he takes a horrible beating all throughout the film and always manages to survive.<br/><br/>
Harrison Ford is fine in his usual quiet demeanor, but the film is stolen from him by Rutger Hauer with his intense, off beat performance as Roy Batty, the near Christ like Replicant leader. However, the film is dedicated to them in different halves before they meet for the climax. A flop at the box office in 1982 in light of the new desire of the time for dashing, swashbuckling adventure films, it has found its audience and appreciation in the years that followed,<br/><br/>Visually stunning, best suited to night time viewing."
"grahamsj3","7","1","2","2 February 2004"," Weird. Good, but weird
","This is a pretty freaky flick. Harrison Ford sure stepped out of his box to make this one! The film centers on Ford, who is a sort of a terminator for human clones who've gone astray. Cloning is common but it is very difficult to tell a clone from a real human. Only a special eye scan test taken under questioning can tell. It takes place only about 20 years in the future, so the special effects are minimal. This isn't a typical high budget Ford film. It's totally different from anything else you've ever seen him do. Director Ridley Scott did a good job, but it's pretty much out of his usual genre also. The film also stars the gorgeous Sean Young and Darryl Hannah. Also giving a good performance is the always good Rutger Hauer. It's weird. Just plain weird. Good, but definitely in the twilight zone."

","Cast aside your bad day in seeing matrix revolutions and see the best sci-fi movie ever made, Blade Runner<br/><br/>This movie is just magical, but like allot of other people, I didnt like it the first time i saw it either. It just was not what I expected it to be, a action movie. However the fact that the movie forces the viewer to question it, but the movie delivers when seeing it sometimes makes it better and more real, and this world is real. This movie's special effects still dazzle and while its not star wars(thank god)its not meant to dazzle, but still it dazzles! The scenery is just the best, in depicting a high tech but still a run down rathole LA, as we are raised to heaven at the tyrell corporations pyramid or run down abandoned buildings. Writing about scenery, this movie is a noir story with heavy drinking anti heroes and femme fatale(but no cardboard badguy since everyone is a hero in their sense)set in the future, but changing the time of place would still throw the whole thing of because of the movies theme. What does it mean to be human? And who is human? In terms of the matrix this has challenged me more because as a person i question myself and my role in society as to who i am, but i guess the matrix does that too to a point. Grade A acting, Harrison Ford does his best role, and his reasons for disliking this movie is entirely his own nothing with the movie itself, but the pain of the production of it.Scott is just a great director and as the reviewer before said he captures the mood perfectly, its a grim movie so it should be grim. If you loved the mood of the movie as I then dont miss Alien and Legend as they capture just like Blade Runner what it set out to do. I just love this movie. See it, but go into it with a open mind"

","My Rating: ***1/4 out of ****. <br/><br/>Blade Runner is one of three films that was adapted from a Phillip K. Dick sci-fi story. The other two films were Minority Report and Total Recall. Out of those three Minority Report is the best. Blade Runner ranks as second but it has some flaws that cannot be ignored. <br/><br/>I have a complaint about the casting. Harrison Ford is miscast here, I know they wanted to put Ford here after his two excellent performances as Han Solo in the Star Wars films, but I found him flat here. Sean Young and Daryl Hannah dont have much acting to do here, but they do an adequate job nonetheless. The standout is undeniably Rutger Hauer, who is excellent as the bad guy, he is intimidating and he steals scenes from Ford and anyother actor in the film. <br/><br/>Nothing is more impressive here than the visuals. The Visual Effects still look fantastic, even 20 years later. The sets and the cinematography are excellent. The film has a dark film-noirish atmosphere to it. Its impossible not to be impressed by the visuals. <br/><br/>Blade Runner is an example of style over substance. The movie has loads of style but it also has a thin plot and some uninteresting characters. Visuals reign supreme over the entire movie.

","SPOILERS included<br/><br/>First of all, I'd like to say that everytime I think about this film I think of it as being stunning, but when I genuinely think about it, a lot of it I find dull. I know a lot of people adore this film & I can see why. The thing is however, that I intensely dislike the Rachel character. I find the woman annoying and infuriating. I suppose this is why, whenever I watch this film, I watch with glee whenever Rutger Hauer is on the screen (he makes this film what it is) & I tend to switch off and relocate my attentions at the reappearance of that annoying woman.<br/><br/>I think apart from the stunning visuals of this film (like I suggested, the ultimate art house movie?), I think the one thing I adore about it, and hence why I look back at it with such fondness is the climax of the film. The two main comments, firstly by Hauer & then by the Olmos (playing the character Gaff), are beautiful sentences. Olmos's comment is thought provoking & intensely philosophical with regard to how meaningful our lives actually are, whilst Hauer's is so poetic & so beautiful, that it feels almost like part of a Shakespearean' sonnet.<br/><br/>Scott's directing, the previously mentioned speeches, & the quality acting provide a stunning film with a scary look into the future.

"Darth in the Bath","Null","1","2","16 February 2003"," a haunting sci-fi experience that you will grow to love...
","For all those bemused by its popularity:<br/><br/>As most will tell you, Blade Runner really is a film that will grow on you. I first saw it when I was 13 and it went completely over my head. A few years later I watched it again and it went completely over my head. Then a while after that, again, it went completely over my head.<br/><br/>
Ten years later I wish every sci-fi film could be like it.<br/><br/>
Blade Runner is so brilliant because it is so ""boring"". It's not a sci-fi film out to excite with shootouts or chases or a big world-changing finale... even though it does include them. It has many concepts and ideas and characters that Ridley Scott refuses to explain and instead lets his audience decipher events and visuals with his or her own imagination... what a beautiful sentiment.<br/><br/>It's best not to approach Blade Runner as an action-packed one-note film that starts and ends with the opening titles and closing credits, a mistake most of us have made. The trick the film-makers pull is to merely suggest the scenes that you come to expect. You're given hints about mutinies aboad slave ships and crash landings in the ocean and replicants being fried walking through electrical fields, about off-world colonies and social-political machinations too complex to ream out in tiring exposition. You'll find that 50% of Blade Runner exists in your own head, that's the gift that the makers of this film have done... they've created a universe for every viewers mind to swim in.<br/><br/>The level of design is, in itself, a glowing testament to attention to detail. This is part of the joy of watching a Ridley Scott film. He doesn't just handsomely decorate his sets with odds-and-sods to make it look nice, his sets practically ooze character and history. Just look at J.F.Sabastian's apartment and all his self-made toys and assorted nick-knacks. Just look at the sushi-bar and its steaming heat trays and busy chefs. Just look at Chew's eye-shop and its frosted surfaces and vile, fleshy creations. You could spend an entire viewing just staring at all the different props and gadgets that lie about simply because, as previously mentioned, they could truly be for anything.<br/><br/>Jordan Cronenweth, the sadly departed cinematographer, did his best work on Blade Runner. He has given us visual melodies in which our eyes can dance to. His favourite shot was the one where a puff of Rachel's cigarette smoke is illuminated by light whilst Deckard is interviewing her and the image dissolves to a long shot... as if the previous one was just blown away. His crowd scenes are lit by gaudy neon signs and umbrella's with florescent handles and sparkling drops of rain. One of his greatest achievements was his lighting of J.F.Sabastians apartment building, filled with constantly moving shafts of light that fill the empty, lonely spaces.<br/><br/>
Music wise, for a film all about the inevitability of death and the eternal question of ""why are we here, what's it all about?"", Vangelis' score really helps you to experience and feel the dark, the rain, the cold and the loneliness of Los Angeles circa 2019 and it's sorrowful hymns will make even the most synthetic of hearts pump warm, red blood. The best of which are Rachel's song and Memories Of Green (re-used in Scott's other film Someone To Watch Over Me). It's a famous and often talked about cornerstone of synthesized harmony.<br/><br/>But don't forget about characters. All the above images and sounds help to deepen what all the main character's feel in the film: a chronic fear of death. Whether it's Deckard constantly watching over his shoulder for danger ""quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?""; Rachel coming to terms with her hunted inhuman qualities ""I'm not in the business, I am the business""; the other Replicants searching for a cure for mortality ""the light that burns twice as bright burns half as long""; J.F.Sabastian's accelerated ageing; Bryant's illnesses (he pours Deckard two drinks simultaneously because he's too sick to drink himself, a brief nod to The Big Sleep) and Chew's slow freezing after having his protective coat ripped off. It's a story of the loneliness one feels when faced with the inevitable and his or her desperate search for a cure, something we can all relate to and will have to deal with sooner or later.<br/><br/>It also ends without a hero. Deckard neither succeeds nor fails, he just does what Roy Batty wants him to do: understand and empathise with why he's fighting for his life and why he had to escape a life of slavery. In the end Deckard silently realises where the human race has gone wrong in inventing replicants with feelings, and why he's glad not to be one of them... whether human or replicant is up to you :)<br/><br/>It also stands as being the most quotable sci-fi film since the Star Wars Trilogy.<br/><br/>Keep on watching it, you'll understand in time and as mentioned by others, the book Future Noir is a great way to kick-start your interest in the film as it goes through the film scene by scene like the commentary the DVD never had."

Unlike other science fiction films.. (Terminator 2, Aliens) this film doesn't focus on action. Actually, action is rarely used and most of it is hand to hand combat or Deckard shooting someone. Okay, now for the acting. Harrison Ford does one of his best performances ever, he doesn't say much or do much but adds a kind of tiredness to the character. He seems to be tired of having to hunt down these replicants and feels bad for them. I think he is even a replicant himself actually. You also have that pollish guy, I can't remember his name that plays Roy Batty. He does such an amazing job of playing a villian especially with lines such as ""did a man go to your house? Police man?"", ""Its too bad these memories will be lost like tears in the rain,"" and finally ""If only you could seen what I have seen."" I really liked James Edward Almos's character even though he mostly drove Deckard around. He was the guy that did the Origami which has a surprising turn toward the end. He also delivers the line that I labeled as my title, ""It's too bad she won't live! But then again who does?!"" and Harrison Ford nodds his head. Overall I think this and Alien are two of the best sci films ever created."

","Its remarkable to think this film is now 20 years old and on initial release bombed at the box office both in the US and here in the UK. This wasn't helped by a film beset with behind-the-scenes problems:-<br/><br/>a/discontent & disagreements behind the scenes between actors (primarily Harrison Ford) and director Ridley Scott.<br/><br/>b/ the mainly US film crew not warming to the exacting  & seemingly arrogant nature of the relatively inexperienced new Brit  on the block, Scott.<br/><br/>c/ the rather nervous producers & accountants realising from an early stage that this kind of movie was not going to be in the same action-fest, mega-buck-block-buster as Star Wars, but would instead take on a rather more darker, slower, morose theme coupled with an ever-increasing budget that eventually broke a film studio;<br/><br/>d/ the intervention of the studio in forcing Scott to go for the highly controversial ""Studio Cut"" version with an upbeat but highly unlikely tacked-on ending & a rubbish overdub narrative, which totally ruined the balance of Scott's original cut until a Director's Cut was issued in 92 with a more satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>e/ problems with the scripts, screenplays, the screenwriters and the original author himself Philip K Dick, who wrote Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, which inspired the film.<br/><br/>f/ the various inconsistences within the film - were there 6 replicants or only 5 when they visited Earth; the poor editing & sound; the ongoing argument as to whether Deckard himself was a replicant etc.<br/><br/>
But to the film...... ...is set 20 years in the future. Colonisation of other planets has begun leaving only an underclass left to inhabit the big cities like Los Angeles, a place of continuing black rain, darkness, pollution & social bleakness.<br/><br/>However, robots (or replicants as they're called) are in full service off-world, doing all the dangerous jobs humans don't want to do. Six of these replicants mutiny, kill people and return to Earth in search of their creator.<br/><br/>The leader of this highly intelligent, highly dangerous band is Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer - in my opinion his best ever role) who realises that all replicants only have a 4 year life span. Roy & co. want that extended, considerably!<br/><br/>The police are informed and bring in their top Blade Runner (Harrison Ford) to hunt and ""retire"" these renegades. And so begins 90 minutes of detective work, investigation, murder, abstract romance & intrigue.<br/><br/>Director Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator, Thelma & Louise), has always been criticised for his films being all ""style over substance"". It is true to say that Blade Runner is a visually stunning masterpiece although the quality of the character-development & storyline pace is erratic & plodding to say the least.<br/><br/>However, the film holds up very well. Those expecting something akin to Star Wars meets Raiders of the Lost Ark, will be disappointed. The action sequences are few & far between; the story is mature and therefore slow to develop. The special effects are very good & realistic although not on a par with today's CGIs, which I believe is a good thing.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford is given a much more rounded character as Deckard the Blade Runner rather than the comic-strip hero of Raiders & Star Wars. As a consequence he finds it very difficult to offer any real depth or emotion as Deckard.<br/><br/>The real acting honours goes to Hauer as Ford's nemesis: suitably under played but with a hint of Aerian menace and ends the film with a beautifully rendered monologue of his short life!<br/><br/>Overall then, Blade Runner (the Director's Cut) is a superior film with only a few short comings. It's best viewed on the big screen in 70mm THX sound, but the tv compromise is nearly as good. The music by Vangelis is just SO perfect, coupled with some fine visual effects and camera work by Jordan Cronenweth, Terry Rawlings & David Snyder.<br/><br/>There are rumours of yet another Director's Cut for 2003 based of Scott's original ideas that were latter scuppered by the studio (that forced him into churning out the first version with the ""happy ending""); and then scuppered again with a compromise Director's Cut version, which despite of its title still wasn't Scott's original version.<br/><br/>And then of course there is the ongoing rumour of either a sequel or prequel. A rumour that has been buzzing on the Blade Runner chatboards of the internet for years and yet nothing has yet to materialise, and hopefully it never will.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is a cult movie that has risen from the ashes of apparent failure at the box office. Much like 2001: A Space Odyssey, it captivated a public with the darker side of science fiction, a fiction so close to our own reality that we feel more engrossed and fearful of what this film says about our dependence on cybernetics, the ecology of the planet and mad scientists no different from the Frankensteins of the past trying to tell us that the future of robotics (and human cloning in particular) will be a blessing to humanity and not a terror to be feared.<br/><br/>Highly recommended<br/><br/>*****/******"

In that sense the film is quite different from sci-fi films as Alien or Starship Troopers(bleh). It also is less violent but the violence can therefore be more intense.

Being a fan of old detective stories like the Maltese Falcon I really enjoyed the commentary by Deckard.  His voice over actually adds something to his character that is needed. Strange that without it the movies ""feels"" entirely different.  I only hope that in the future Warner Bros. releases the original version on DVD and allow the consumer to decide which version they prefer.<br/><br/>Even without the commentary, the story still stands on its own.  The plight of Roy and Decard and their battle to define what it means to be ""human"" works well within the confines of the story.  The monologue at the end when Roy is dying on the roof is probably one of my favorite scenes in the movie, but the added commentary by Deckard in the original makes the scene more powerful in my eyes, because we can relate to Deckard and how he feels about the whole thing.  His actions afterwards makes more sense.<br/><br/>I've read lots of comments on this movie, and I guess no one is ever going to agree on the classic status.  A shame really, because though it isn't perfect, Blade Runner is one of the best realizations of what cyberpunk really is all about.  It should be viewed for that reason alone.  Whether you like it or not, this is one of those movies that movie goers should view at least once."

","I've seen the directors cut and the produce's cut.  I also read the book. The film is only loosely based on Dick's short story and had a different take on androidism than the film.  The film's take was extremely thorough and more dramatic.  I liked the directors cut better than the other because it is unnarrated.  This makes the protagonist appear to be the man with faults that I think Scott wants Deckard to be.  It also strengthens the parts of the other players because you don't really know who the good guy is which is another thing I think Scott wants to express.  Dick's book flatly said androids are bad, no matter what.  Scott wants us to ask ourselves what exactly is humanness and must humanness be experienced or can it be implanted.<br/><br/> I like a film that invents a place and time I couldn't invent for myself, that takes me somewhere beyond my own imagination.  The sets, casting and camerawork did that for me: exotic LA 2019.<br/><br/> The problem I had with this film is that I think Scott gave up on it half way through the film's production.  There are some script continuity problems (what happened to the fifth android that everyone is talking about) and some of the buildings in the long shots sure look fake.  I get the feeling that the editor didn't have enough film to work with the result being a pretty good flick instead of great flick."

","If anything is certain and inevitable in the future (if it isn't colonisation of other planets, or even the employment of human clones for off-world slave labour), it will probably be the continual growth of the human population on this earth.<br/><br/>It is a fact of nature - humans are the supreme species.  We are the highest in the food chain, highest in intellect, and highest in our own selfishness. Yes, we humans are all a bunch of arrogant viruses, endlessly striving to satisfy our ever growing needs and a better quality of life, by consuming the available resources around us in vast amounts.<br/><br/>Greenpeace, animal rights, zoos - they might provide short term solutions to allow nature in general, and other species of animal a place on this earth - but it isn't going to last.  The human population will continue to grow - as long as there are very few predators to hunt us, and ever advancing medical science keeps us living for longer.  Eventually there will be so many people on this planet that there will not be enough space for any other species.<br/><br/>At present - even though it may seem that humans make a up an unhealthy large number for one kind of species - insects are still the most numerous species on this planet.  But in the world of Blade Runner (a pseudo, media inspired, prophecy of the future) it seems that humans have once and for all surpassed even insects in their numbers.  According to the movie, it appears that not a square inch of the planet has been left untouched by the human tendency to use up all of its available resources, and occupy it with fume belching industry; or erect very large, menacing buildings, intrusive transport infrastructure, and seedy night spots, in the place of virgin forest and vast plain.<br/><br/>But its not all doom and gloom.  We are intelligent, if very selfish, creatures - and we do possess certain problem solving skills.  We humans - being the bright chaps we are (and at the same time ONLY thinking about ourselves) - have recognised that we are rapidly running out of space on our planet, and so have logically found a solution to this growing problem. The solution is to look forward from the confines of the Earth, and out into space and the prospect of colonising other planets.<br/><br/>This is the world of Blade Runner - a world that reminds us so much of our own world, and where its heading, that it's frightening, disturbing, and absolutely awe inspiring at the same time.  The film takes this scenario, locates the action in a sprawling North American Metropolis (that oozes menace, darkness, decay, and a strange organic beauty); throws in a plot about some off-world genetic clones rebelling and returning to Earth; incorporates a tension ridden, exciting and unsettling script (and some rather talented players, come to think of it); and mixes it around with a subtle but emotive musical score, and some striking imagery; in a shiny, and slightly rusty, pudding bowl.<br/><br/>It's disturbing, thought-provoking, awe-inspiring, futuristic nonsense at its best.  Don't just view it passively (and become bored in the process) - slurp it up, swirl it around, taste it, then swallow it.  The final act is guaranteed to leave a satisfying after taste."
"auberus","9","1","2","27 February 2001"," Between Sci-Fi Thriller and ""Film Noir"", a masterpiece.
","Ridley Scott was 45 years old when his fifth movie was released in 1982. After 19 years of public life 'Blade Runner' is considered a 'cult movie' transcending the genre becoming a classic. The plot may seem a little bit simple at first sight however 'Blade Runner' raises some of the most fundamental questions flirting with existentialism as well as humanism. If the movie was inspire by Philip K. Dick's novel: 'Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep', the realization of the scenario differed completely. The story takes place in a dark and urban near future where Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford best role) is a blade runner, a cop and has been asked to retire/kill 4 replicants who escaped from an obscure space colony, have hijacked a space ship to return home back on earth (where they have been declared illegal) seeking for their 'maker'(the charismatic Joe Turkel). The mission turns out much more difficult than expected. The 4, soon 5 replicants are not 'computers' they are 'physical' (Human made by Human through genetic manipulation I assume). They have great intelligence and superior physical abilities and resistance. They are looking for answers and are determine to get them what ever it takes. Their questioning will become ours: What makes us human? Are we human from birth in other words by essence? Or do we become human with what we do, through what we achieve? Who is a human being? Rick Deckard who tracks down Zhora (the beautiful Joanna Cassidy) or the tragic Zhora who after a stressful hunt seems suddenly so close to us when being shot down, frozen in an everlasting slow motion made of shattering glasses. Roy Batty who discovers his own humanity when facing his last trial, the only trial he will never win: death ; or Eldon Tyrel who plays God but has forgotten to play Human? Maybe 'memories' is the clue we are looking for? But what kind of memory and whose memory? Sure my memory (personal or common) is part of what makes me act as a human being but doesn't it alienates me like a trauma alienates a patient? So love has to be the ultimate clue. But in that case what kind of love? The love that shows Deckard to Rachael (the enigmatic Sean Young) made of sarcasm and bitterness or the love shared by the powerful Roy Batty (the awesome Rutger Hauer) and the wild Pris (best role ever for Daryl Hannah)? What feeling shows more humanity? The kiss made of tears that Roy lives on Pris's cold lips. Or the one that Deckard stills from Rachael after making her uncomfortable? Ridley Scott lives the answers to each and every one of us. Once again (Alien 1979) he has created a fantastic atmosphere made of dark streets, flying cars, post modern buildings, flame burst in a black sky, everything blend in a powerful and spiritual music written by the talented Vangelis. Once again he had the right actors: Edward James Olmos as the ambiguous Gaff, William Sanderson playing the pathetic and naive J. F. Sebastian or Bryan James as the powerful and hopeless Leon. In this environment the so call humans behave like 'soulless machines' and the so call machines are searching for their soul discovering their humanity. This masterpiece is and was directed as an 'initiatic journey'. We'll understand that what we look for and what we found is ourselves."

","So - How do you spell ""Blade Runner""? Why, it's easy - B-O-R-I-N-G!<br/><br/>Yes. It's as simple as that.<br/><br/>And with that in mind - When it came down to seriously contemplating the infuriatingly ""muddle-headed"" factor of Blade Runner's boring (yes, Boring!) story - I'd easily say that ""To be an Android, or not to be an Android""(?) was definitely not an appropriate question to be asking oneself in regards to this slick Sci-Fi/Noir-ish wannabe film.<br/><br/>No. I think not.<br/><br/>Personally, I think that the only worthwhile question to be asking oneself (and others) concerning Blade Runner was quite obviously - ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?"" - Yeah. That's the question to definitely ask oneself.<br/><br/>And, for me, when it came down to this mighty pertinent question of ""Do Androids (indeed) Dream Of Electric Sheep?"" - Let me tell ya - By the time that I had endured watching this utter disappointment of a movie, from start to finish, I honestly couldn't have given a bloody damn, one way, or the other, what frickin' Androids, or anyone else, for that matter, dreamed of. I really couldn't.<br/><br/>Anyways - In conclusion, I would like to say that, yes, I quite readily agree that Blade Runner was, without question, an impressive triumph in production design. There's certainly no doubt about that. And that, yes, this film's ""Vangelis"" soundtrack was equally awesome to the ears. Indeed. - But, with that all set aside, I personally believe that Ridley Scott clearly overstepped his own limited potential as a Director when he made the feeble attempt to fuse the genres of Sci-Fi and Film Noir (in 1982!?) together. Yes. A truly incompatible combo of 2 conflicting genres, in my opinion.<br/><br/>I mean, Scott may have understood the genre of Sci-Fi well-enough, as was plainly evident with Alien. But, when it came to Film Noir (in 1982!?), Scott was, quite obviously, an amateur and out of of his realm with this genre, as is plainly evident that he's never tackled Film Noir before, or after, this particular film production.<br/><br/>Perhaps, with the production of Blade Runner, Ridley Scott should have taken a few Origami lessons, himself. It may not have improved his direction much. But - Hey! - What the hell? Eh?"

","Directed by Ridley Scott (back then movie-making rookie, recognised from his astonishing debut film ""Alien"") ""Blade Runner"" did not become a highly-acclaimed science fiction classic right away. When this based on Philip K. Dick's novel titled ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" film opened in cinemas in 1982 it was criticised for its slow-paced tempo and ""chaotic plot"". Today it is often listed as the most important and original movie of the genre along with such masterpieces as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" by a titan film director Stanley Kubrick and Andrei Tarkovsky's ""Solaris"". But does it really deserve the credit it gets nowadays? Action of ""Blade Runner"" takes place in 2019, in futuristic Los Angeles. The movie follows a story of Rick Deckard (played by Harrison Ford) - retired blade runner, a man who took care of replicants (superior forms of androids, they are human look-alikes with programmed feelings, but are much stronger physically) if they started causing troubles. Unfortunately for him, he gets an offer he can't refuse and is forced to take up his very last job and solve a problem of an artificial intelligent rebellious gang with their leader Roy Batty (breath-taking role of Rutger Hauer) ahead.<br/><br/>Director Ridley Scott adapts Dick's vision on screen with a great passion. Thanks to Jordan Cronenweth's amazing photography, the streets of Los Angeles are dark and climatic. The depressive, somehow melancholic mood is additionally built up by the music soundtrack by a Greek composer – Vangelis (also known from his works on ""Chariots of Fire"" and ""1492: Conquest of Paradise""). Surely, it is the technical aspects that develop the remarkable atmosphere, but ""Blade Runner"" is not a great film only thanks to them. The main advantage of the flick is a fantastic script. Screenwriters Hampton Fancher and David Webb Peoples deliver an A-class writing. They say a lot, but also keep the plot minimalistic and enigmatic. Of course, they also ask some poetical questions (in the spirit of the original story) about a meaning of humanity and emotions but keep it unpretentious and fun to watch for a common viewer. Also the acting is great (as I mentioned beneath). Harrison Ford and Sean Young (portraying android Rachel – femme fatale of the film) show some real skills, but the real icing on the cake of the cast is Rutger Hauer. He played his role of a savage and violent, but deep inside emotional and sensitive replicant so well, I can without exaggerating say that it is one of the best antagonist roles in history.<br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" is without doubt one of my favourite films. The fact it was so ahead of its time, that the critics had some serious problems to get it says a lot about the quality. Coming back to the question from the first paragraph, the answer is definitely ""Yes!""."

","At this point there's really very little room for debate about the artistic merits of Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner'.

Not a hit with either critics or audiences back in 1982, today it sits near the top of dozens of ""Best of"" polls. The one remaining question is; beyond its technical and artistic merits, is 'Blade Runner' a great film? The answer is, or at least my answer is, almost.<br/><br/>Is it a bit cold and emotionless? Yes, but that's its tone not a flaw. Is it a bit confusing? For certain, but sci-fi of this type rarely spoon-feeds you every last detail. There are dozens of ways to interpret this film. A sure sign of good storytelling.<br/><br/>The story is strong, the script tight and the performances exactly what they need to be. In short, 'Blade Runner' is more than just a pretty face."

","The film is dark dystopian and visually impressive. Harrison Ford stars in Blade Runner. Set in the mega futuristic City of LA, Rick Deckard is a former special cop who hunts down human looking Cyborgs called Replicants. In a city that is a blend of 19th century and 21st century architecture Deckard must reprise his role as a Blade Runner when a group of Replicants return to Earth seeking answers to their questions.<br/><br/>Blade Runner was made at a time when the Sci Fi genre was just beginning with Star Trek, Star Wars and Alien all becoming major movies during that period of the late 70's early 80's. This film continues in that form. It combines the realism of Alien with the fantasy of Star Trek. Director Ridley Scott did a brilliant job in portraying a megacity. The costumes, feel and elaborate set up of the city exemplifies how a mega city would really look like. <br/><br/>The Cyborgs running around as murderers, the night club and market places that are shown give us perspective on how the people on the streets behaved instead of just focusing on the skyscrapers. The characters lacked much of an impact on the movie since the sheer size of the city dwarfed their importance. Deckard becomes involved with Replicant women while the Geneticist responsible for creating these Cyborgs comes to a nasty end at their hands. <br/><br/>This title is stunning to watch but very hard to understand. There is a similarity with other earlier Sci Fi movies, Metropolis being one. Thoroughly enjoyable seeing Harrison Ford play an excellent protagonist. He is particularly good in these movies because he is both an accomplished actor and can do these action packed scenes as well."

","For an early 80s effort so steeped in (Hollywood's version of) punk rock culture, this has aged surprisingly well. I recently re-watched for the first time since Reagan was President (the version with Harrison Ford voice-overs), and was surprised at how quickly it demanded all my attention. Even the tinny electronic soundtrack music sounds better here than on any ten space-rock albums by eerie era contemporaries like Tangerine Dream/Kraftwerk/Kitaro/Goblin/Philip Glass --- Everything about the look and attitude of the female lead character screams Bettie Page to me, right down to the archly painted brows. In keeping with this underground subcultural feel, the film's dreary sogginess, and the aura of decay and ""perfect storm"" damages that seems to infect everything on screen, from the epic backgrounds to the lighting, hardware, framing, tinting, right down to the characters' clothing and even their very complexions.<br/><br/>There aren't many films anything like Blade Runner (and the few with any similarity are from the same era - Liquid Sky, Class of 84, Metropolis as re-envisioned and soundtracked by Giorgio Moroder, maybe Dead End Drive-In) This is a future that looks to be particularly soul-sucking, where life itself no longer has much tangible worth, now that replicants have forever muddied up how humans perceive themselves ---- ie a nice place to visit (on DVD), but I admit I'm grateful Hollywood didn't live there long ----"

Bladerunner works on so many levels, its imagination both in the way it tells its story and in the way it creates a fantastic yet totally believeble future inspires a multitude of questions, grips you from the opening moments and leaves you stunned at the conclusion.<br/><br/>Even with the creaky (but appropriate) voice over and relatively happier ending the original version shines. Filmaking is an ensemble process, as has been shown time and again placing the film back in the hands of one person, even the director, has a negative overall effect on the movie. The original movie inspires the viewer to think, gives them enough to discuss and form their own view of overriding concepts, it creates an enigma that fuels speculation much as 2001 did before it and it is all the stronger for giving the viewer this power. The director's and final cut just place you in the hands of Ridley Scott, the film is still awesome but its also more sterile and manipulative... if the final cut had made the cinema's in 1982 I doubt its influence and impact would have resonated today as significantly as the true original.<br/><br/>Please stop making directors cuts of films, Ridley Scott, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg etc are all prime examples of how even the most gifted and imaginitve of film makers end up damaging even more than they could ever hope to enhance."

","Blade Runner has received mainly above average reviews from critics and has become somewhat of a classic with time.  I recently watched this film and am wondering why.<br/><br/>Not that I didn't like it...I actually find some levels of brilliance in the film, especially for what period of time it was shown in theaters.  However, what was brilliant to me was visual.  What wasn't was the story behind it.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford, Sean Young, and M. Emmet Walsh had good acting performances; otherwise, the acting was not too special to me.  If you want good acting in a similar film to this...watch Haley Joel Osment in AI (I use similar loosely.).  Overall, acting was good, though.  Cinematography, special effects, and music were dark, mysterious, and very appropriate.  However, the plot was muddled.<br/><br/>Perhaps this blurry storyline was what was intended.  But, while watching the film, I became rather nonchalant to the characters.  I didn't take sides in the film, and close to end, I simply didn't care (with the exception of the one brilliant scene with Sean Young, who suddenly became very philosophical).  Overall, I found the movie too mysterious.  If it was trying to say something, I to this day have no idea what the intent was. The ending (Director's Cut version) was weak to me.  Honestly, it didn't do anything for me.<br/><br/>Special effects are a tool to be used appropriately in movies; however, I think in this film, they became the overpowering appeal.  The human/Replicant storyline didn't fulfill its role.  This is unfortunate because I think this film has the potential to be a masterpiece. Unfortunately, chances of this are as dark as the city of L.A. in 2019.<br/><br/>5/10"

","As it often happens when you watch ancient classics in a modern age, the strongest feeling evoked by Blade Runner is, unfortunately, boredom. I sat to watch it for the second time with intentional bias to see only positives but in the end the only positives I found was tone and technical details. Blade Runner, godfather of all that is cyberpunk, truly has that stagnant atmosphere of futuristic desolation essential to the genre. Sunless cityscape with a thousand points of meaningless lights, streets littered with nowhere people, isolation creeping behind the cynical antihero... memorable. Visual representation is great and groundbreaking for a 1982 year (I guess). It conveys the feeling and it is enough for me.<br/><br/>But everything else, namely script and, as a consequence, actors play, is a drab. Blade Runner plot is weak and its direction is even weaker. The pursuit for escaped replicants does not to grab attention at any point of the movie. All the numerous scenes that try to emphasize the characters of the dystopia, bring mostly disillusionment because they are either pretentious, banal or out of place. The pinnacle example is the renown final scene where Roy chases Deckard for whole ten minutes all the while howling like foolish dog. Can you truly say that scene had to be there in a full length? That it had to be there at all? Aside from countless artificial attempts to display the depth of the personas or philosophy of the setting Blade Runner has almost nothing. No action, no twists, no side stories, only quite predictable love thread between Deckard and Rachael. Ford's play is the remarkable but even he cannot do much with the script that ask you to ""mope about"" for 117 minutes straight."

","""Blade Runner"" is the kind of movie that leaves me with a million things to say and an inability to put anything down in writing. Quite simply, it's an engrossing film experience. In large part I think it's the mythology of the story that grabs me, the history of the Nexus Phase and how replicants virtually surpass humans in their abilities. My latest viewing was of the Director's Cut; it's been quite a while since I've seen the original with Harrison Ford's narration, so comparisons don't come easy at this point. Even so, I've been enthralled by the picture every time I've seen it.<br/><br/>Thinking about it today as I write this, we're only five years away from Ridley Scott's original vision set in Los Angeles of 2019. Robot technology seems to be in the news just about every day now, though nothing remotely approaches the wizardry of replicants, but who knows how far things will go. It's going to get pretty interesting.<br/><br/>As for the picture, after each viewing it takes a few more days for it to completely leave my thoughts. One hopes that the future doesn't resolve to the type of dystopian darkness that films like this and the Terminator films manage to depict. The real world is scary enough as it is."
"Cosmoeticadotcom","6","2","8","29 July 2009"," Overrated
","All in all, Blade Runner is a passable film, a 65-70 out of 100 (mainly on the strength of its technical achievement), but nowhere is it near great, much less the masterpiece its fans claim. Like its source novel, it has a few good ideas, more bad ones, a thin plot, trite and leaden dialogue, and poor characterizations, made all the worse by mediocre to bad acting, from the always overrated Ford, to the abysmal Young, to the over the top Hauer (aptly demonstrated by his silly soliloquy) to the lifeless Hannah (both of whose portrayals do nothing to engender sympathy for the Replicants), to the quirk-infested Olmos. Add in the chemistry lacking love story between Ford and Young, and the far too long sequences designed to simply show off the visuals and inner workings of Tyrell's corporation, the muddled plot (especially in the later non-voice-over versions), and the film is a classic triumph of 'style over substance.' Even that cliché grates, despite its aptness. Granted, it would not surprise me if claimants of the Deckard as Relicant posit point to the chemistry lacking love story as proof that both characters are inhuman, but Occam's Razor points to the simpler interpretation that it's just bad acting and writing.<br/><br/>Similarly, the overall film ultimately falls far short of its claimed greatness because it simply is never sure of what it wants to be- another strike against its 'visionary' claims. It has too many feet on too many boats that diverge- is it sci fi, is it existential, is it film noir, is it a character study? In truth, it has elements of all these and more, but not enough of any of them to make it work as one, much less all of these. In fact, the chief failing, on all scores, for this film, is that Ridley Scott really had no vision for the project, grafting elements from Alien and many of the other films mentioned in this essay, trying to take what worked from each, and ending up with a film that, in many ways, is a mess, and a dull one, at that. Yes, it has plenty of visions, but no single vision; and in its own myopia, Blade Runner's dystopia founders. And I doubt any further cuts or recuts can retire that ill."
"TheHande","5","2","8","2 July 2007"," A beautiful but hollow picture...
","Whereas most science fiction films often have trouble creating believable settings for their stories, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is something of an opposite. Visually it's a beautiful piece of cinema, but the plot and characters all seem to lack any kind of emotion.<br/><br/>Add this to the film's rather relaxed pace and you have a film where after the first 15 minutes of watching special-effects you star peaking at your watch to see how much longer is it gonna take until something happens. The problem of the plot isn't so much that it doesn't work, but it's execution is just so miss-mashed with everything else in the film that it becomes tiresome to follow.<br/><br/>The fact that everything about the film would make you wanna believe it's an action-movie doesn't help either. In the end the film is astonishingly beautiful science-fiction drama with a plot you couldn't care less about.<br/><br/>Both Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford have seen better days."

","My favourite movie genre is science fiction. The reason for it is because after every time I watch a great sci-fi film, it'll always leave me with a new theoretical concept to think about after the movie's over. I'll admire the film-maker's creativity and excellent ideas with these well-built sets.<br/><br/>I had very high expectations for Blade Runner, it had an early 80s Harrison Ford and an interesting concept that I read from a few brief plot summaries. Unfortunately for me, this was the most disappointing film that I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The film's main plot is that there are ""Replicants"", clones that were in off-world colonies (now illegal after a mutiny), that land in a very dark futuristic version of Los Angeles. Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a Blade Runner, his job is to kill or ""retire"" these six Replicants. Rutger Hauer plays Roy Batty, the leader of the Replicants that landed on Earth. The feel of the film is a very dark, a gloomy vision of the future.<br/><br/>I loved Harrison Ford's performance as Indiana Jones and Han Solo is one of my favourite movie characters of all-time but he didn't display any of his acting talent in Blade Runner. He doesn't show any emotions at all and he was just annoying. The rest of the cast wasn't any better except for Rutger Hauer. I liked the way he spoke in this film and his speech at the end was great (I won't deny that).<br/><br/>Another of my major complaints is that the pacing of the film is so unnecessarily slow. It just lagged on, it felt as it was three and half hours long when it was just over two hours. They are so many scenes that could've been cut, especially the numerous montages of Deckard driving through the city.<br/><br/>The film is not all bad though. The sets are very original and the cinematography really stands out. The score is great, I really loved the music at the ending credits that gave it a science fiction feel.<br/><br/>Overall, I really hated this film. There is a lot of aspects of it that I just despised but I do praise all the work that was done to build all these amazing sets. The ending to me, didn't make any sense at all and the bad acting made me stop caring about the characters. Also, the slow pacing just made the film completely uninteresting. I just wanted it to end.<br/><br/>My rating : 5/10  I have seen it twice because many say it deserves more than one viewing and it received a 4/10 on my first viewing."

","Before seeing 'Blade Runner 2049' I wanted to see the original 'Blade Runner' so I finally got around to watching it yesterday. To say I had hoped for more would be an understatement. When a movie is on the IMDb Top 250 movies list it generally is a very good sign of a high quality film. Unfortunately though some films slip through the cracks and make it for other reasons, such as critics giving it overwhelming positivity. If 'Blade Runner' was released today with the same story I doubt it would even get a theatrical release. Perhaps standards were just far lower in the 1980s.<br/><br/>The simplicity of the story is what astounded me. Sure it's easy to follow (incredibly easy to follow), but there is also no depth and nothing worth thinking about and working out for yourself. We are treated to some of the worst written narration you will ever hear in film. It feels so out of place and forced and completely takes you out of the film when you are listening to it.<br/><br/>The acting was also surprisingly choppy in a lot of cases. Apparently Ridley Scott isn't big into directing his actors - and it showed. This played a part in the fact that I simply didn't care about a single character in the film. Also the ending makes no sense whatsoever and again we are treated to a stupid line of narration going something like ""I'm not sure why he saved me"". There was very little to like about this film and I certainly hope the sequel is a vast improvement."

"lysserd0","Null","2","9","5 October 2011"," Convoluted and Unnecessarily Confusing
","I get the feeling that this film is full of symbolism, and from other reviews I think to confirm this. Let me say this now, symbolism usually creates an exclusionary work. Let me explain.<br/><br/>By using symbols you create links between certain objects and other things. Depending on how difficult these links are to understand you create different levels of exclusion to your audience. Some symbols are easy to grasp and exclude almost no one, and it progresses up to symbols that only make sense to a certain group. I would place this movie in that later category. Throughout the movie I found that I recognized the use of symbolism without being able to place what any of it could mean.<br/><br/>So to someone who isn't in the group intended to understand the symbolism from this movie, the entire film is a cascade of confusion. Why this, why that, why, why, why! That's the only thing this film left with me.<br/><br/>Without understanding the symbols and/or having previous understanding of the plot from reading the book the entire script falls apart. None of the characters actions make much sense and often the motivation for them is non-existent. The effects manage to hold the test of time, but that's about it. No part of this script or plot appreciates like the effects do.<br/><br/>SHORT VERSION: If you are familiar with the plot, have read the book, or you think you are in the group that could appreciate the movie's symbolism then watch it. If you feel, in any small way, you do not meet these requirements then do not watch this movie. Ever. And hit the people that suggest that you do."
"screenman","8","2","9","26 December 2007"," Elaborate but Inadequate
","Other commentators have already suggested that the events and ideas contained in the story were insufficient to fill the length of the movie, and I'm inclined to agree. There were times when in did appear to drag.<br/><br/>The interpretation of the future was also a bit cackhanded. Right from the beginning we see those huge out-wellings of flame over the city. What are they supposed to be? Surely someone would have capitalised upon such wanton waste and stored the gas for heating. It is simply the director's triumph of imagery over logic. Already there is great concern about atmospheric pollution, global warming and so forth, yet our skies are nowhere near as gloomy as those depicted in the movie. Perhaps we lose the battle. But even that hardly explains why the interiors of buildings were so dimly lit. How could anyone see to work, let alone clean-up? Also, as these replicants were effectively regarded as machines, and highly dangerous ones at that, it is certain that they would have been fitted with some kind of tracking device like SatNav. Look how widespread that has become already. Furthermore, I rather think that a more effective method of dealing with them than just a modified handgun would have been devised. And why so little CCTV? Wouldn't there have been cameras in the lifts of the Tyrell Building? And what about security guards, intruder alarms etc. How could a replicant get to see the man himself simply by accompanying an employee? Try that in any major corporation today. Day or night, it just won't happen. <br/><br/>This movie is a paradox. The very technology that creates these wonderful puppets would be spread throughout the world, checking-up on them and everyone else. '1984' was a much more accurate piece of science fiction. In Britain at least, it is almost fully realised. Actually what we have here is science fantasy, not fiction.<br/><br/>As to sending one man with one side-arm to hunt for half a dozen dangerous opponents? No; that doesn't make any kind of sense at all. Especially when those opponents are strong enough to punch through walls and quick enough to dodge bullets.<br/><br/>But if you can get your head around the one-sided and anomalous interpretation of technological development, and you can avoid chafing at the slow, slow pace of a fairly straightforward story, it's quite a mesmerising audio-visual experience that will linger in your memory. Commentators who see multiple layers of wisdom after viewing it dozens of times need to get a life; they remind me of those people who used to hear secret messages in old vinyl records when they were played backwards. If there's any subliminal instruction here it probably runs 'believe this movie is more than the sum of its parts'. What better testimony to the confusion of its message than that the director himself has so often re-written it?<br/><br/>It is extremely elaborate in presentation, but a good artist uses your imagination rather than his own. He just scatters random and abstract clues and lets you deduce their meaning. Imagery so lends itself to interpretation in fertile (and gullible) minds. Just check-out the power of religion.<br/><br/>Enjoy it, by all means. Just don't think too hard."

","Yeah I like Blade Runner. In fact for years, it was one of my top 5 favorite films. And yeah, I still like it. There's flying cars, Rachel...And then there's all that fog.<br/><br/>But after all these years, i do see there are holes here and there, and most obviously, the story is thinner than paper.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, the cinematography, the atmosphere, the sheer cinematics of it all are still powerful. Blade Runner is an extremely charismatic film. More than anything, it is just so dang beautiful to look at. <br/><br/>The story on the other hand, is less pretty. Though the themes of the film are there, mostly thanks to Philip K. Dick's original source material. But so much work was spent on the look of the film, the characters are clearly an afterthought. There is such an underdeveloped set of characters and story, I'm not sure anything actually even happens in Blade Runner that is worth....well....happening. The android/Deckard undercurrent is there, but it seems thin. It feels thin. It is thin. <br/><br/>Now Apocalypse Now ran into similar problems, but there was so much subtext with the material and so much interaction with the characters, there still was some narrative drive. Blade Runner struggles to engage me these days. <br/><br/>The look of a film can be a major character just as an actor can be. But I don't think it may be a great movie because of that alone. This ain't 2001. If Blade Runner had a further developed character set, aside from Rutgar Hauer's wonderful Batty, there would be a monolithic masterwork here. Instead, we have an amazing exercise in style and nothing more.<br/><br/>I am a professional photographer. I know light. Its my job to do so. I can tell an extremely talented man in the way of Jordan Cronenweth shaped the signature look of Blade Runner with Ridley Scott. Those shafts of light coming from nowhere have so much visual power. So on that basis alone, thin plot and characters aside, Blade Runner is still quite good at what it is, once you settle on that.<br/><br/>My feelings about Blade Runner are similar as my feelings for some of the more beautiful women I have been with. I love the film when I see it, but I don't think about it all when I'm not watching it. The only thing left is a fog."

The Workprint and Final Cut clearly did not have the finished restoration effects that were promised. So much hype and in the end they seemed to have forgotten to include them.

","Blade Runner is one of these movies that you will either love or hate - no middle ground. The feelings it evokes are so strong, that at times it is almost overwhelming to watch. Based on the rather well known novel by Philip K. Dick ""Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep?"", it borrows from the futuristic, dystopian universe of the novel but, being a movie, it surpasses it and becomes something greater, something more profound, something that no movie has been able to top since. It is no coincidence that all the futuristic movies/series since then, have borrowed very heavily from Blade Runner in aesthetics, environments, music and so on. The irony is that even today, with all the CGI available, BR instead of being outdated, still shines to the point you would think it was filmed last year not almost 40 yrs ago. Even if Ridley Scott didn't make any other movie before or after BR, I would still regard him as one of the best directors ever, just for this film. The blending of the cinematography, music, acting and script give us the definitive cyberpunk movie, which is deeply philosophical in its core, and where most dystopian films try and fail to deliver, BR is successful and ominous at the same time. The soundtrack by the great Vangelis Papathanasiou is nothing short of a masterpiece- there are times that I think Vangelis might not even be a human, but an advanced alien in disguise because the music he writes is just otherwordly. Combine his music with the visuals created by Scott and his team, and you get a pretty detailed picture of what the future is very likely to look like- foggy and dirty, acidic and ultra high tech, familiar and strange at the same time. It is a world where nothing is as it seems, the humans act like replicants and the replicants like humans. The lines are blurred and upon a second viewing, you literally don't know who to root for. I will stop here- there are so many things to praise about this film that it is impossible to do so here. If you haven't watched it, please do so. No matter whether you love or hate it, it will be a once in a lifetime experience, guaranteed."

","Blade Runner is a legendary piece of science-fiction. Not many films are able to establish such a profound and unique cinematic universe in a little more than two hours. Ridley Scott went a step further, and revolutionized a genre.<br/><br/>Blade Runner was one of the primary influences for the now extremely popular cyberpunk sub-genre of sci-fi - characterized by a corporatist dystopian take on a technologically advanced society. In the film, Detective Rick Deckard (played by Harrison Ford) is pulled out of retirement, and tasked with tracking down four Nexus 6 Replicants - robots with superhuman strength designed to be used as slave labor on hazardous planets - who have illegally landed on Earth after hijacking a spaceship and murdering everyone on board.<br/><br/>The film is stylized like a film noir. The only main difference between the plot of a true film noir and Blade Runner is that Blade Runner is set in the distant future of 2019 (the distant future in 1981 anyway). Though, with the setting, there comes a number of dramatic turns that could only be accomplished in film of its kind. The movie's plot brings to mind questions about humanity through the allegory of the Voight-Kampf test - a device and procedure designed to tell man from machine. Though the test is only conducted twice in the entire film, there is certainly more to glean from it than whatever is on the surface level - especially after a character asks Deckard if he's ever done the test on himself before. The movie's ending leaves the viewer just as many questions as the beginning, which, in Blade Runner's case, is probably the best possible way to conclude. I personally believe that this movie is one of the few films which has a perfectly written story.<br/><br/>While in my opinion the plot is the best aspect of the movie, the way the movie was filmed and constructed is just as, if not more important than any amount of writing.<br/><br/>Every single shot has a purpose. There is not one camera angle, one brief snippet of film used, that isn't necessary. Anything that is visible on-screen is there for a reason, however cryptic it may be. Nothing is on-screen for longer than it needs to be either. The shots are cut in such a way that every featured object is on screen for just long enough for the viewer to both see it, and contemplate it and its relevance to the film. I retained more from my first viewing of Blade Runner than I have retained from consecutive viewings of most other movies. Right alongside the camerawork, the lighting is also fundamental to creating the atmosphere of the movie. Being a sort of ""neo film noir"", most of the movie is set in darkness. The weather is constantly dark and stormy. Most illumination is done via neon, street lights, and headlights. If anything is lit up, it's important. For example, when light is shone in a replicant's eyes, there is a strange reflective effect reminiscent of the eyes of a cat or dog. It creates a way for attentive viewers to keep track of who is and isn't a replicant, and in general is a very intriguing effect to behold. Conjunctly, this is one of a few movies where I noticed the lighting directly contributes to the mood of the story. For instance, during a tense, high-energy chase scene in the film, most of the lighting is done with rapidly rotating or otherwise mobile spotlights - usually associated with risk and danger. In this film in particular, light is so important that it can drastically change the mood of a scene whilst still maintaining relative subtlety.<br/><br/>The casting in this movie is extremely fitting. I couldn't picture an actor other than Harrison Ford playing Deckard. It's just not possible in my mind. Aside from the main character, the way the replicants are portrayed in the film feels extremely fitting - given a major plot point in the movie is that replicants only have a four-year lifespan. They behave in what could be described as a child-like manner, putting feeling before thought into their actions. They don't have any past memories or maturity to go off of, so they'd naturally act like an upset child during the situations presented. The actors did a great job of conveying this, and I probably wouldn't have caught it if they didn't accentuate it.<br/><br/>In conclusion: Blade Runner is unique. It's an art film that doesn't feel drawn out (as art films have a tendency to do) and is also extremely engaging. Despite being made in 1981, it still stands up today, and remains a timeless classic. 2019 may not be the futuristic landscape Ridley Scott pictured when he set the film, but being the current year, it's more relevant than ever to look at this classic piece of science fiction, and appreciate its worth - both as it was back then, and now."

","'Replicants are like any other machine, they're either a benefit or a hazard, if they're a benefit then it's not my problem'. I will remember this line and a few other spine-chilling ones in my film, especially the tears in rain monologue, sad and awesome. I don't have a favourite film, but this one almost made it to #1 on my list, I can't believe how a film could impact my life with just the first 10-15 minutes. The cyberpunk, dystopian los Angeles is beautiful yet kinda creepy. The city reminds me of the Rapture from another great game BioShock which I also love. It may look like a Sci-Fi or a special effects extravaganza but really it's a story of Freedom, love and creation. It beautifully mixes genres such as Drama, romance, a little bit of horror and obviously a noir-thriller.<br/><br/>Blade runner was a film ahead of its time which explains how it bombed at the box office but like other films that came out during that era, it is now a classic. It was very influential because of how it inspired many other Sci-Fi thrillers or just Sci-Fi movies to come such as Total Recall, The Terminator, Equilibrium and more. Even though this film is praised by audiences and critics i still feel this film is underrated. I cannot help but feel myself immersed into the dystopian los Angeles and why do I feel immersed well it is because of its slow and beautiful cinematography that shows almost every detail of this cyberpunk world. Some people may feel that this film is just pure eye-candy but it is definitely more than just the city of Los Angeles, its about Replicants that just want more life and freedom so that they could live like other humans. What makes replicants so human is the fact that they don't wanna die like every other human. But they are seen as evil cyborgs because they do anything to get what they want. That is also the issue with humans as well because don't we also sometimes do stupid or bad things to get what we what like hackers for example, they hack the internet and other brands to get money which sounds even more evil because these nexus 6 replicants don't want money, they just want to live.<br/><br/>My conclusion is that Blade Runner is a gorgeous, creepy and groundbreaking masterpiece that asks fascinating questions such as what does it mean to be human? This is an amazing film and if you haven't watched it then I say why haven't you already?"
"reggienunez","10","1","3","29 January 2019"," Ridley's scifi masterpiece is one of the greatest films ever
","Blade Runner is considered one of the greatest science fiction films ever made and it is easy to see why. Deeply thematic, rich characters, a fantastic script and nuanced performances toppled with some of the greatest cinematography ever put on film this is a film version of the mona lisa- every frame can be hung on a wall. Ridley Scott, fresh off the success of Alien is in top form and Blade Runner will be the film he will always be remembered for. Harrison Ford is competent as Deckard and anyone expecting him to be the usual dashing hero will be disappointed. Rutger Hauer steals the show as head replicant Roy Batty. The noir look of the film has inspired so many movies and video games since there isn't really a point talking about it- you have to see it to believe it. One of the greatest films ever made. Period."

"Sci-FiHorrorFan","10","1","3","27 February 2018"," A Very thought provoking SCI-FI Classic.
","I enjoyed this film quite a lot and I found the story very intriguing.The movie is visually stunning and captivating just as much as the new 2049 movie.I would put both movies in a top 30 Favourite Sci-Fi movies list.
Blade Runner 2049 is my favourite of the two movies but both are Great movies and the original one has grown on me.
I like the original movie much more now than I used to and I think that's because I'm older now and I understood the story a lot more this time around.The story is definitely original and interesting and I can fully understand why this movie has a cult following, it deserves it for being a Great and emotional story.I am glad this movie is now respected by a lot of peope, it deserves the respect it gets.<br/><br/>The cast of the movie is also Great and they all did very well acting wise.Harrison Ford was great in the lead role as Rick Deckard and I thought his character was interesting.He plays a blade runner who is a person that hunts down and kills replicants, who are beings that look human but are not human, and that idea is interesting to me.
The movie also looks Great and has beautiful Cinematography.I am just a sucker for great cinematography and I always find myself Captivated by that sort of thing.I really liked the look of the Futuristic blade runner world it actually looked like a fun and interesting world.the music was Great,The directing and writing were pretty good and I found myself immersed in the movie and I was never bored, the movie constantly had me thinking and I Like Thinking movies that make you wonder about things.Blade runner is also a very influential Movie.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is Not really an Action movie it's more like a Sci-Fi Mystery Thriller.The movie has a good Atmosphere to it too.I thought Rutger Hauer was Very Creepy in his role As a Replicant and he pulled the role of brilliantly.He had moments were he was intimidating as well as creepy and He was good as a villain.His partner Pris Played by Daryl Hannah was also Great in her role as a creepy Replicant, she did a very good job at pretending to be inoccent one minute and then totally switching and acting really crazy and weird.Brion James was also very good in his role As a Replicant who worked with Rutger Hauers Character.He also had moments where he was creepy and intimidating especially in the scene where he attacks Harrison Ford.and of course you have Sean Young who was good as the replicant Rachael.
She plays a good replicant who is different from the other replicants and I thought The relationship between her and Rick Deckard was okay, You may not get to see the two of them together for very long but when they are together their scenes are okay,their scenes could Have Used A Bit More character Development and could have been longer but they Were Alright.<br/><br/>The movie is definitely Subtle in its messages and it definitely feels like a movie that is trying to be ambiguous and that's not always a bad thing, in this movie I thought it worked, and there is nothing wrong with being subtle either.
This is definitely a movie that focusses on telling a story and Not on Action which some people may have a problem with but I was fine with.The lack of action did not bother me much and that's because I enjoyed the story and the great visuals.I also liked the ending to the movie where Harrison Ford has a fight with Rutcher Hauer.I thought The chase was exciting and tense.The only thing that confuses me a bit is the roof Top scene, I thought that scene was strange in both versions of the movie and I still don't fully understand that, I think I half understood it.My guess is Rutcher Hauers Character felt like he was a slave even though he wasn't and he was sick of living which is why he did what he did and he wanted to do one last good thing before he went.it's definitely a strange and sad scene but it does keep you thinking even when the movie ends.<br/><br/>Overall Its a Great Movie and it's very well made and I'm glad I watched it again."
"Bored_Dragon","10","1","3","18 February 2018"," Review for ""The Final Cut (2007)""
","Loose adaptation of Philip K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" had six different versions, until in 2007 ""The Final Cut"" was released. This seventh version allowed Ridley Scott to finally get the film closest to his original vision, without test audiences and studio pressures twisting it. I won't go into differences between versions and reasons why there's so many of them, because I didn't see them all and you can always google it.<br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" is one of those movies that should be seen in theater. It's made for big screen and you can't fully experience its visual magnificence by watching it at home. It would also be blasphemy to use lousy plastic speakers while watching this piece of art, not only because of Vangelis's music, but because overall excellent sound.<br/><br/>Story develops in 2019, when nature is destroyed, human race colonized outer space and androids are used as slaves. The last generation of androids are almost undistinguishable from humans in body and mind, so there's a risk that they develop emotions and become unpredictable and dangerous. For that reason they are given life span of only four years and they are forbidden on Earth. Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Brion James and Joanna Cassidy are four of such Replicants who killed bunch of people, hijacked a ship and came to Earth to find their maker, in hope he could stop them from dying in four years. Harrison Ford is Blade Runner, member of special police unit whose job is to track Replicants on Earth and kill them on sight. Both sides, from their own point of view, have justified causes for their actions, so even if Blade Runner is our leading character you are meant to root for, if you put yourself in Replicant's shoes you'll realize that they didn't have much of a choice and you would probably do the same in their place. Movie doesn't serve all answers on a silver plate, some things are left to us to interpret and it opens some moral questions that will make you think.<br/><br/>Performances of all actors are great, characters are very convincing, Sean Young and Harrison Ford have nice chemistry, and overall atmosphere achieved by Scott and Vangelis is stunning. Based on audio-visual magnificence and essential issues it deals with, ""Blade Runner"" could be compared to Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) and Kubrick's and Spielberg's cooperation ""Artificial Intelligence"" (2001), and I think it's safe to say those are three greatest SF movies made to this day. If you are interested in A.I. subgenre of SF, I would, beside these three, also recommend Spike Jonze's ""Her"" (2013) and Chris Columbus ""Bicentennial Man"" (1999). I must emphasize that last two are in my top five only because of their story, while in every other aspect they are far below any comparison with first three.<br/><br/>10/10"
"tomgillespie2002","10","1","3","22 January 2018"," A turning point in science-fiction
","Ridley Scott's Blade Runner has had such a profound affect on the science-fiction genre across every medium that we are still seeing imitators today. If the opening shot of the dark, futuristic landscape of 2019 Los Angeles seems at all familiar, it's either because you've witnessed this cinematic masterpiece before, or seen an ill-fated attempt to recreate this grim, claustrophobic future elsewhere. Blade Runner's classic status now seems almost ironic, given the film's disastrous reception upon its original release, and the countless different versions released since. Among others, there was the original 'workprint prototype', the U.S. theatrical cut, the international theatrical cut, the broadcast version, and The Director's Cut. I think most would agree with me when I say the 'Final Cut' is the definitive version, trimmed of Harrison Ford's rambling narration and the tacked-on happy ending that borrowed unused footage from Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.<br/><br/>In the future, the Tyrell Corporation has manufactured bioengineered humans known as Replicants, commonly used for slave labour off-Earth. Granted the intelligence of their makers, the Replicants tend to start questioning their purpose, often resulting in mutiny and violence. To counter this, Tyrell has limited their lifespan to four years in the hope that they will die before such thoughts can even enter their mind. However, four Replicants (Rutger Hauer's leader Roy Batty, Daryl Hannah's Pris, Brion James' Leon and Joanna Cassidy's Zhora) have rebelled against their masters and made it back to Earth. It is the job of 'Blade Runner' Rick Deckard (Ford) to hunt the foursome down and 'retire' them before they can cause any real damage. Deckard questions the morality of his job, especially when he meets Tyrell's latest creation, the stunning Rachael (Sean Young), a Replicant who isn't aware of what she is.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is simply astonishing on a number of levels. When Vangelis' score - a majestic combination of the classical and synthesised - kicks in early on, Scott's film becomes an experience on a whole other plain. The production design, which is a noir-ish hybrid of choking, rainy streets and golden interiors blackened by shadows, had never been seen before and hasn't been so effectively moulded since. This feels like a wholly tangible future, lived-in and almost familiar, and although we may not have flying cars, super-beings crafted by science or Atari as a thriving corporation, the future depicted in Blade Runner isn't much different to the world we live in today. The sets, special effects, music and editing are all combined by Scott to create a world we can almost touch. The fleeting moments of violence, something the film was criticised for on its original release, are fast, shocking and ugly. There's a scene in which a death occurs in slow-motion through various panes of glass which is almost beautiful to behold, but even this plays out with an air of tragedy. The line between good and bad is certainly blurred here.<br/><br/>I haven't read Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick, but common opinion is that Blade Runner eclipses its source and then some. It's the stuff of dreams for science-fiction aficionados, going way beyond its thriller premise to touch on some big philosophical questions and ponder the very definition of being human. Hauer's masterful portrayal of Batty ends with a monologue improvised by the actor, and his speech is one the most memorable and quoted pieces of dialogue in cinema history for good reason. It is moving and stirring and will catch you off guard, forcing you to reflect on everything you have just seen for days after. Ford is impressive too, downplaying the goofy charisma of Han Solo and Indiana Jones and growing into the beaten-down, conflicted bounty hunter. But the real star here is Ridley Scott himself, who has never made a finer film, crafting a landscape that would go on to be the go-to aesthetic for dystopian futures. It would take either a stupid or unnervingly brave director to make a follow-up, but if any director has the ability to expand this universe into something even more spectacular, it's Denis Villeneuve."
"sakram","6","1","3","28 December 2017"," Slightly Overrated, not boring, but not too masterful, it somehow falls in between
","Blade Runner 1982 is one of those movies which take place in the future, with a vast boost of scientific and digital evolution.
Surprisingly, the concept was pretty good, but the movie could've been shortened to 1h30m, it felt so slow and underwhelming in many parts.
One of the biggest weaknesses is, it felt so incoherent, between each part and another, and how 'this' led to 'that', a viewer would be all confused
Now, to logic, the plot wasn't so 'heroic', so that's a pro, but the con is, it didn't feel anything special type thing at all.
This movie plays the role of bedrock for Blade Runner 2049. So it's a must-see-first.
6.5/10"
"smatysia","5","1","3","26 December 2017"," Don't really get the appeal
","Hard for me to understand how I've never seen this film until now. I've certainly known about it ever since it was released. The most striking thing about it is the extremely detailed sets of the dark, dystopian future. But it just didn't do much for me overall. Not a lot of character development, but I guess some of the characters are machines, and do not develop. I didn't even recognize Daryl Hannah. It's always fun when viewing or reading something from the past which predicts the present, to see what they missed. In this case no one carried personal communication devices, and there was still a major reliance on printed material. Anyway, I can't really recommend this film."

","Everything that could be said about this movie has been said and many times over. It still is one of the best made movies of all time, why? Just 'cause it is. Over the years I have purchased every new version that was released, starting with laser disc to DVD, to Director's Cut and eventually Final Cut. When it was released on Blu-ray I bought that too. All because I wanted to see this movie in its best possible mode.<br/><br/>Now I also have it in 4K UHD with a remixed Atmos soundtrack. Whilst I use a 4K UHD player I only have a 1080p HD projector and TV. I bought the 4K player because there are still too many titles that release the Atmos version only on 4K. I like big sound, which brings me back to Bladerunner 4K.<br/><br/>Even in down-scaled 1080p the vision is spectacular. It's better than the Blu-ray. It may be my imagination but I believe the higher resolution has improved the level of visible detail, even at 1080p. I can only imagine what it would be like to see this through a 4K projector.<br/><br/>The remixed soundtrack in Atmos, WOW! It expands the movie so much, it is as the ad says, totally immersive. For no other reason, the soundtrack alone has justified the purchase."

","""Blade Runner"" stars Harrison Ford, and is about a detective, known as a blade runner, who must kill replicants (robots). The concept itself is interesting enough, allowing for an endless amount of paths for the film to approach. ""Blade Runner"" has an incredibly grim yet beautiful landscape with a seemingly endless torrent of rain which adds atmosphere like hardly any other sci-fi. Deckard (Harrison Ford) is involved in a huge case which results in amazing battle and action sequences. The sets are masterfully created, but the second half of the film is where the pace and story-line heighten with incredible battles and scenes involving Rutger Hauer as Roy (the main replicant antagonist) who delivers a performance making him one of the most memorable antagonists of all time, equalled by the Xenomorph of ""Alien"". Three years, in fact, after the release of ""Alien"", Ridley Scott has once more made a spectacular, cult-classic science-fiction film; only this one challenges what the world may eventually succumb toÂ… in just two years time."

","Blade Runner is my all-time favorite movie. I saw it in the theaters when it first came out and was so transfixed by the experience I stayed and watched it a second time. Since then I have watched it countless times and own the deluxe Blu-Ray version. This film has the perfect combination of a great director, perfect cast, story by Philip K. Dick, film noire setting, soundtrack by Vangelis and amazing special effects. The combination is a perfect storm that simply must be experienced by any fan of science fiction. It's amazing what Ridley Scott achieved using essentially in-camera special effects like models and rotoscope.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of Philip K. Dick, and despite being a loose adaptation, the film is a great rendering of ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" I don't require films made from a book to be perfect, word-for-word renditions of the story and I was delighted by this rendition of Dick's story. I'm a sucker for stories about artificial intelligence and what it really means to be human. I also love stories that at the end leave you wondering about crucial plot points. Blade Runner hits the mark on both these points. I have carefully written this review to reveal no spoilers, so you'll have to watch the movie to see what I mean.<br/><br/>There are a few different versions that do not have as ""soft"" of an ending as the original theatrical release, but I like the Directors Cut the most.

Let's not forget the ending. The Tears in the Rain speech is one of if not my favorite movie speech of all time. While the debate on whether Deckard was a replicant or not can get very ridiculous and repetitive, it does make you think. But now that the trailer for the sequel came out, I think we know the answer to that question. Brilliant movie with great visuals, acting, characters, and great themes of what is human and what is machine. Blade Runner is my all time favorite movie."
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","10","1","3","29 March 2017"," Need I Say More? ...Blade Runner is... Blade Runner.
","Ridley Scott terrified audiences in 1979 with Alien, and then he made them think about their perception on artificial intelligence with 1982's Blade Runner. This masterpiece of scifi cinema brings up questions like: what is real? Is our perception of things true? Is it right to control others? Are our eyes tricking us? And most importantly: what is the difference between man and machine? What happens when there is little difference between the two? <br/><br/>Blade Runner is a stylish and well-written and directed masterpiece of dystopian fiction. Having come out five years after Star Wars, it's a shame that it flopped competing with E.T.; Harrison Ford should have attracted greater audiences because his performance as Deckard is awesome! He's your typical cop in downtime, but once he's contracted to kill 'replicants', he's gonna go full Blade Runner on your ass! <br/><br/>I love this movie. It's super expressive of metropolitan life under the influence of the police, a tech-giant and how the technology around us changes our world in unimaginable ways. What's not to love here?

"kainoa-27087","9","1","3","2 March 2017"," A Movie Ahead of Its Time
","I was pushed back into my seat, my eyes glazed and wide open. I was fixated on the beauty that was in front of me. It felt as if I was transported into the film itself; transported to the concrete jungle of 2019 Los Angeles. Hover cars flew past me, and I realized that I was crying a little bit. How could this movie bring tears to my eyes in the first 5 minutes? The movie Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott, is a piece of art. The film made me rethink what a movie experience should be. A good science fiction film should transport you into the world of the film. It should make you feel like you are a part of the action. What makes Blade Runner so special is that not only does it transport you to the urban sprawl of a future world, but it makes you forget about your real life on earth. At the end of the movie, I felt a bit out of place. I longed for the vast city and hauntingly beautiful world of the movie. I was a different person walking out of the theatre, my mind racing and my heart throbbing from the achingly beautiful soundtrack and stellar performances. This is what a movie should be. Action packed, a meaningful story, and a soundtrack that complements the film in a unique and magnificent way. A film that makes you question what it means to be human, Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott, is one of the best movies of all time due to the dazzling visuals and soundtrack, a meaningful and deep storyline, and superb acting throughout. A few words come to my mind when I think of the Blade Runner soundtrack. Mysterious beauty would perfectly describe it. The soundtrack is something I have never experienced before. A mix of space adventure, and romantic mysticism, the soundtrack gave me goosebumps all over my body and emotions flooded over me like a tidal wave. Composed by Grammy Award Winning musician, Vangelis, the soundtrack complements the film in a powerful way. During each scene, the music works with the cinematography, feeling almost like a trippy music video. In many films, the soundtrack overpowers the movie, or vice versa. In Blade Runner, there is a perfect balance between the two. Blade Runner's soundtrack is superb, but doesn't even compare to the brilliant visual effects that were ahead of its time. The incredible thing about Blade Runner is that no cgi was used throughout the whole film, it wasn't invented yet. The special effects team used matte paintings, different lighting techniques, and miniature models to depict the dark future world of dystopian Los Angeles. When I heard this myself I was baffled. The amount of time and work put into this film is truly amazing and unbelievable. Many shots include fly-overs of the whole city, every detail in the buildings and even on the street hundreds of feet below are emphasized and included. The artists department was not lacking in detail here. With architectural interior designs by the iconic, Frank Lloyd Wright, the world in Blade Runner is symmetrical and beautiful. Combining classic 80s technology and ideas into a dystopian, futuristic style, works very well and is captivating when on the big screen. I found myself generating an obsession with the architecture and design in the movie, it changed the way I see the world around me. As a photographer, it has influenced my style and I see through the camera lens in a kind of ""Blade Runner filter"". Another fascinating thing about the visuals was the cinematography and set design. Each shot in Blade Runner could be its own work of art. The film moves at a slow pace, without boring you out. Each shot is carefully framed and there is a huge focus on portrait shots and facial features. There is a particular moment in the movie that I think is the most beautiful thing I have seen in a film. Deckard is standing inside of his apartment, while the lights from the many drone blimps in the bustling city shine through the closed blinds. The shot is powerful and really gives the audience the feeling of actually living in such a world. On top of the groundbreaking visuals and untraditional storyline, performances by Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer really make the film believable and noteworthy. A quality that makes someone a great actor, is if they can truly transform themselves, believably, into that character. Amazingly, in Blade Runner, every actor and actress successfully achieves this feat. When an actor has to pretend like he or she is a man made robot, it is far from easy. Rutger Hauer, who plays an escaped replicant, Roy Batty, has many excellent and timeless monologues in the film. His famous ""tears in rain"" monologue can be considered one of the best acting performances of all time. Harrison Ford, playing Rick Deckard, has to play a cop trained to kill, or retire, escaped robot replicants. Throughout the movie, he had to act in such a way where the audience couldn't tell if he was a robot or a human. This is what makes great acting. The performances done by these actors are unforgettable and make the film much stronger. In conclusion, Blade Runner is a must see film for people that love movies with deeper meanings, and for the beauty and cinematography. I would not recommend this movie, however, for the average movie goer. This film is not just a futuristic action movie, it is an artistic experience that leaves you on a higher level of human thought after seeing it. Blade Runner is one of the best movies of all time because of its dazzling visuals and soundtrack, a unique and intriguing storyline, and superb acting. This movie will forever have a solid place in film history and will continue to inspire directors and artists for generations"
"thesouthfamily2-552-707097","8","1","3","2 January 2016"," ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe""
","Directed by genius film maker, Ridley Scott (Alien, The Martian, Thelma and Louise), Blade Runner is such a unique and intriguing entry into the sci-fi movie genre. While watching the movie, I was instantly blown away by how realistic this dystopian future was. It seemed straight out of 1984.<br/><br/>The story is based in L.A. during the year 2019. The film follows Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who's job is to track down and kill ""replicants"" (a replicant is a human clone that was used for slavery years before. By the time Blade Runner begins, replicants a considered illegal and now must be destroyed). While the premise has been done before, what makes it stand out above the rest is the theme of man vs. machine. Ironic that it's the machine at the end that gives the monologue about life, rather than the human characters. It's also ironic that aside from Harrison Ford, all the replicants are alive and cherish life and are more fleshed out in character development than the human characters.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the film that is exhilarating is the unbelievable, visual beauty that exists in Blade Runner. From the cinematography to the production design, everything about it seems real and alive. The film is over 30 years old; yet I can't find one thing in the film that looks the least bit dated. There was absolutely no computers used in the effects, and yet, the ""Blade Runner"" world looks completely authentic. Luckily, it's finally starting to be recognized as one of THE seminal special-effect films. I love how incredibly meticulous the details are. From Japan's influence in our country's future culture, to the neon umbrellas, it still looks like we're heading in that direction. Every building looks like it exists, every vehicle that flies passed the camera shines rings of light into the lense. It's film making at it's finest.<br/><br/>Perfectly fitting with the visuals of the film, is the musical score done by Vangelis. The unbelievably beautiful use of synth music blended together with blues and jazz is something that truly makes Blade Runner what it is. The soundtrack for the film has got to be one of the more underrated film scores I've ever heard.<br/><br/>As far as performances go, everyone does a fantastic job. Daryl Hannah,Edward James Olmos, Sean Young, and William Sanderson all created great memorable characters, but with out a doubt, the two people that really need the most mentioning are Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer. Both Ford's and Hauer's performances are really unique and exciting. Deckard is one of the best protagonists and Batty is one of the best antagonists. The way Hauer delivered some of his dialogue is truly mesmerizing, while Ford's performance is more physical, but equally engaging. The closing monologue by Hauer at the end is really though provoking, and makes the audience question life.<br/><br/>Blade Runnner really is a director's film. This is Ridley Scott's movie, one can see him and his mind on every frame of film. Scott created things that no one else would have ever thought of, and that's why it's still remembered. It's still ahead of it's time, and it still makes people want to watch it over and over again. It's definitely a film worth multiple viewings. I wasn't a huge fan the first time a saw. The second time I watched I liked it just a bit more. The third time I watched it I liked a LOT more, and the fourth time I watched it I really fell in love with. Blade Runner is one of those films that, you not only like it more every time you watch it, but you like it more by a substantial amount."

","The view of the world in this film is cool for me, although now there are a lot of similar products in other films, books and comics. This film was released in 1982. So many those works would be influenced from this film. I can watch it smoothly because of it. However, that situation makes this film less surprising because of its huge influence. Although that I watched this film many years later from the release in 1982, I felt that most things in the story is still not out of the date. Not only view of the world, but the characters in this film are attractive for me. Especially Replicant is more attractive than others."

","With its bleak tone, omnipresent rain and tough-yet-vulnerable protagonist, Blade Runner is a film only a man raised in Newcastle-upon-Tyne could have made (said as one myself). Ridley Scott's film succeeds on many levels, most notably its beautiful aesthetic; the vivid, metallic cinematography set the visual template that thousands of mostly inferior blockbusters have since adopted. However, the thing that elevates this film above the rest is that its beauty is not exclusive to its visuals - the sound-scape, storyline and symbolism are also outstanding in their execution. One thing that the film does particularly well is to draw you into its world to the point where you almost forget that you're watching it on a screen. This is done partially with the outstanding set design, but also through the background sounds. The noises of rain, traffic and the city imitate perfectly the sounds of a real city - they constantly suggest that the world you are watching does not end just outside the frame, but encompasses an entire metropolis. On top of impressive acting and a strong story, the use of religious imagery often lends extra weight to already powerful scenes. Costume design, such as Batty's oddly white hair (a reflection of his unnaturally rapid ageing), also helps us to understand what the characters are thinking about and struggling with. Overall, Blade Runner is one of those rare films that seems to succeed in every category - few movies will ever match the brilliance of this one."

","It's funny. I've only seen this movie once and it was years ago and just on a computer screen and yet the movie is exactly the same as I remember. Either I have an incredible memory or Blade Runner has some magical quality that makes it unforgettable.<br/><br/>The tone makes this movie. The feel of it, the way it washes over you and stays with you afterwards is more significant than the story itself. It's dark and somewhat gloomy. But not depressing, just kind of sad or contemplative. It's refreshing that it's not trying to be funny or deep or clever. It just tells its story matter-of-factly. It weighs down on you over time. There are no light moments of comic relief (although there is plenty of subtle humour). That kind of tension is enjoyable when so many films are impatient and predictable.<br/><br/>It raises interesting questions about artificial life. What would it be like to realise that you were actually an android? A bit like Dark City and The Matrix, you have to ask yourself what you really know for sure. Are your memories real? Is that air you're breathing? The steady pace of the film allows you to fill the quiet moments with your own thoughts and considerations. It allows you to meditate on these themes, this futuristic world which we might one day live in.<br/><br/>Blade Runner could be one of the most influential films ever made. It's visual style is incredible. It's Gothic, dream-like, iconic and other things that I'm not good at describing. Many of the shots seem to have an immediate emotional or psychological impact, they mesmerise or relax you in some way. They sear into your memory. The music by Vangelis is also gorgeous and haunting. It fits with (or maybe sets) the mood of the movie perfectly.<br/><br/>Perhaps loneliness is another theme of Blade Runner. Deckard doesn't seem to have any family or friends. He doesn't say much. He doesn't smile or laugh or cry (nor do most of the characters). But you always have an intuitive sense of what he's thinking or feeling. Maybe the simplicity of the character is what makes him more believable and easy to relate to - we can project ourselves onto him.<br/><br/>The replicants sometimes show more emotion than the human characters. Sean Young is beautiful, her eyes are always alive even as her body is still. Rutger Hauer makes a very cool, fascinating villain. He is so calm and gentlemanly and yet ominous (a bit like Bane) and says so many poetic and insightful lines. It makes you wonder, what is humanity anyway? Why are we sad when someone dies? Did God create us with a purpose? Why did he give us our flaws?<br/><br/>I felt some of the violence was over-the-top and unnecessary. It didn't add to the story. But at least this isn't Prometheus.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is a must-see as far as movies go. It has similarities to so many other movies I can think of and yet it came out before all of them. It's a vivid sci-fi, film noir story. I have to give it a 10 because it is so unique and made me feel things I haven't felt in years. Feelings that are hard to put into words but which fill me with wonder about life's questions and make me feel more alive."

","No spoilers as always, just some coded references.<br/><br/>A bit of watch-history, if I may: I first saw Blade Runner as a kid, a kid who loved and repeat-watched Star Wars (the original trilogy, naturally). Back then I wasn't impressed by Blade Runner at all, probably because I was expecting Han Solo rather than the introverted action we get with the Ridley Scott film.<br/><br/>Then I saw it again as a young adult, and appreciated it a lot more. It still felt slightly detached, a bit cool (the cold kind), but I understood it much better.<br/><br/>Almost 20 years later I finally get round to watching it a third time. Kubrick's 2001 has a very similar watch-history, and upon its third-viewing just a few weeks ago I declared it my Number 1 favourite film, giving it an easy 10/10 (only 7 of my 700 rated films are a 10).<br/><br/>As a sci-fi fan I was fully expecting Blade Runner to similarly WOW me...alas, it somehow fell just a bit short. That cool, detached vibe was still there. The scenes, as memorable as they are, just sort of happen without much viewer connection (especially the famous final speech). The Final Cut version - first time I've seen this edition - has a couple of jarring edits which added to this odd feeling (check out how the edit cuts after the nose-pulling scene, and another example how after Batty says to JF: ""I'm sorry, Sebastian. Come...come"" it cuts immediately to Roy looking all theatrical, but alone, in a completely different setting.<br/><br/>Add those odd vibes to the overlong romantic scene in the middle of the movie, which just felt tortuously slow, and truly cheesy too, thanks to the only piece of soundtrack music which has dated horribly...Kenny G has a lot to answer for.<br/><br/>This 'disconnect' is the reason it can't touch 2001 (which has a very different quality of 'disconnect'). Saying that, Blade Runner is still worth a very good and entirely recommended 8/10: <br/><br/><ul><li>this is one of cinema's best-realised future worlds. It's believable &amp; immersive to the point you can almost taste the air.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>great cast, with characters that reveal their colour over time...like a fine wine.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>aside from that awful misplaced sax, the soundtrack is gorgeous, and fits the world perfectly.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the ""is he or isn't he"" ambiguity is nicely done, tho' I wouldn't even call it ambiguous (he ""is"", and so is Adama).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>there's a large handful of memorable scenes, even if you do feel weirdly disconnected to what's happening, you'll still enjoy the surreal vibes.</li></ul><br/><br/>Best to watch it when you're feeling that world, if the first 30 minutes don't pull you in then leave it for another day."

","****Warning: Spoilers**** Blade Runner is a fantastic film that was released in 1982, which is taking a futuristic look into the year 2019 taking place in Los Angeles. The main actor in the film is Harrison Ford, who plays Rick Deckard, Sean young as Rachael, and Rutger Hauer as Roy. Deckard is an ex-cop whose job title is a Blade Runner. A blade runner is a person who has the task of hunting down and retiring replicant's that are human clones that were utilized for labor on other planets that was created by Tyrell Corporation. A group of replicant's became very violent, killing humans. A law was set in place making them illegal on Earth and the penalty was execution (Retirement). Early in the film the leader of the replicant's Roy is seeking out answers for how he and the others can live past their four year life span. Deckard through the film starts to have feelings for a special replicant Rachael and learns replicant's have memories of other people implanted in them. In the end, Roy begins to understand what it's truly like to value life and saves Deckard after their violent encounter. In the very last scene, Deckard leaves with Rachael to live out the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>One of the themes to Blade Runner is morality. Deckard early in the film says that if replicant's are dangerous it's his problem otherwise they are fine. This shows he knows that is wrong to retire a replicant when they are not threat. This grows further later in the film after Rachael saves Deckard life from another replicant. Deckard's boss wants him to track down Rachael, but he ensures her that he won't do it, but someone else might. Then in the final scene where Roy is chasing Deckard on the roof and saves his life is another example. Roy had the opportunity to kill Deckard but pulls him up from the ledge of the building. Roy speaks to Deckard for one last time before his life span ends. Deckard comes to the realization that Roy had truly loved and valued all life which is why he let him live. <br/><br/>One of the biggest techniques utilized in Blade Runner was the usage of the lighting. The overall movie was very dark, and the different lighting they had used was well done. The darkness had helped show the futuristic looking city of Los Angeles. I also noticed the film remained dark the majority of the film until the end when Deckard and Rachael were driving away to live out their lives together. Another scene that stood out to me is the final speech Roy gives, the lighting had helped strengthen the emotion. Another technique utilized was motifs. The one that I spotted was origami, I believed the origami is there to remind Decker that Rachael is not real or about their relationship. The origami appears several times and again at the end of the film when Gaff played by Edward James Olmos leaves it outside Deckard's apartment. <br/><br/>I believe this movie is outstanding, this is now one of my top favorites. It shows that you can do what it is right and if you value life enough you can find your own answers to what's most important. I'd like to also point out that I had watched both the original theatrical version and the director's cut. The major difference between the two is the original had narration and the director's cut did not. I preferred the original because the narration added more detailed explanations of what was going on. The acting was very good, especially with the actors who played the replicant's. They had to try and show fake emotions, which I imagine was difficult to pull off."

","..so says the motto of the Tyrell Corporation, which builds humanoid robots, called ""replicants"" to do manual labor on off world colonies. The latter part is key, as replicants have been forbidden on earth, and any replicant who defies the order is to be hunted down and ""retired"" (read: killed) by special police called blade runners (replicants are supposed to be retired in 4 years regardless). Set in 2019 Los Angeles, Blade Runner presents a bleak dystopian future. The very first thing you see after the opening credits are these giant smokestacks belching black clouds and fiery bursts into the air, then high rise buildings which dwarf anything that's been built today, with full picture/video ads playing on the sides of the buildings, plus flying cars called spinners. This contrasts with the poverty and despair which you find below (shades of the old sci fi movie ""Metropolis""). The main character is Rick Deckard, a blade runner, played by Harrison Ford. He's up against a group of rebel replicants led by Roy Battie (Rutger Hauer) who have come back to Earth. They want to be human like everyone else, and are willing to die (or kill) trying. There's another interesting twist to the story, which is hinted at more strongly in the director's cut than in the original: Is Deckard himself a replicant?<br/><br/>The concept was very good (taken from a story by Philip K. Dick, who's had more than one of his stories made into movies posthumously). Human robots who simply want to be human. The idea of humans killing and enslaving each other is not new; it's been going on throughout history. But in this case, humans have elevated themselves to the level of playing God by creating artificial life, with emotions and false memories of childhood, then subsequently extinguishing that life when it is no longer considered beneficial to the general populous, or if said life rebels. Again, nothing new. The eugenicist movement of the turn of the last century, which gave us the likes of Hitler, Stalin and Mao, believed this stuff too.<br/><br/>Given everything this movie has going for it, I should love it. Alas...it moved at an absolute snails pace, and the character development just wasn't there. I just didn't care that much about what happened to the characters in the story, and given the story and subject matter involved I SHOULD care..deeply. The mere fact that Ridley Scott re-cut this movie three times tells you all you need to know there. Unfortunately, re-cutting Blade Runner is like trying to give an ugly building a fresh coat of paint...it's still ugly. Ironically, what this movie has going for it in spades are the visuals of the futuristic Los Angeles; they're nothing short of stunning, and this was long before the advent of CGI.<br/><br/>Blade Runner could have been great. It SHOULD have been great. It's disappointing to see such a great idea for a movie fall short."
"aldinchova","Null","1","3","29 December 2012"," Story of modern human alienation packed in Sci-Fi masterpiece
","""More human than human"" as said in the movie is actually the main idea and point of this film. While I was watching it I had strange feeling like this film was made recently, not long ago. When you watch it, if you don't know anything about when it was made you would think it was filmed in 1990s or maybe in 2000s and you would be surprised to learn that it was made back in 1982. And still today after 30 years it looks fresh and relevant. It testifies about one thing : this movie was much ahead of a time when it was made, I would say without exaggerating at least some 10-15 years ahead of its time. <br/><br/>Intelligently packed, it tells a story of our own human alienation from each other through fictional dystopian society of the future where we produce replicates to do our dirty work and at the same time be as much as we are to make it extremely hard to spot the difference in order to avoid discomfort of humans still self-deceived of being superior. The catch is they are designed to last only for four years and they die as programmed, so they will be denied an opportunity of self-knowledge.<br/><br/>And that self-knowledge could lead to rebellion against their own designers which is the deepest human fear - becoming evolutionary obsolete and being replaced with a new specie much more advanced. Therefore, movie raises many philosophical and ethical questions which will not be assessed on this place for it would take a whole new review to write. The point hidden in the story about relations between humans and AIs (Artificial Intelligence beings) is in our own relationships between each other. Located in future, story of the movie is actually an allegory of our presence, but still this movie was prophetic and farsighted. Many things seen in the movie (like artificially designed and ""printed"" objects and animals) are becoming reality of 21st century with new nanotechnologies and 3D printing technique's appearing that could revolutionize our way of life and who knows what else future brings. <br/><br/>And modern and future human isolation and alienation can be seen throughout whole movie - one example are toys to serve as ""friends"" for J.F.Sebastian because he does n't have real ones. When four self-knowing replicates escape from space and return to Earth they become immediate danger. And blade runner (Harrison Ford)is dispatched to hunt and kill them all which he successfully does for three of them - Leon, Zhora and Pris because they are impulsive and reckless. But their leader Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer)is something completely else. Intellectually and physically superior he predicts every move his opponents will make because they made him to. There is brutal symbolics when he kills his designer Dr.Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel). Like a grim message of possible human future, or an irony that our own superior creations could come to collect our debts we made on this planet. Punish us for our countless sins towards ourselves and everyone and everything else. <br/><br/>Philosopher and killer, Batty is personification of best and worst in us, he is representative of mankind and with his own tragedy he is representing tragedy of us. He is collective human conscience. He could have easily killed Deckard (Harrison Ford), but he did n't because there was no point in doing so. He just showed him what it feels to be hunted and in fear, because in his own words life in fear is life of a slave. And he was tired of it. Deckard was not a real enemy, just a tool in hands of those who considered him disposable just like the replicates. Deckard understood it from last confession made by Batty and in the end of the movie he takes with him his love Rachael (also replicate) to spend with her the little time left. Maybe Deckard too is a replicate which we are left to guess and speculate on that irony. <br/><br/>Every next generation washes up achievements and mistakes, hopes and horrors, visions and memories of previous ones with their own maybe saving them only in collective remembrance of all of us. As beautifully said by Batty in his last words - ""I've seen things you people would n't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched c- beams glitter in the dark near the Tanhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die""."

","Futurist Syd Mead (design stylist who started with Ford and moved into film with his first feature, Star Trek – the Motion Picture) gave director Ridley Scott a blueprint by which he could formulate a world of the future, an apocalyptic or apocryphal vision of the future where humanity would struggle to survive in a dirty, dusty, polluted world dominated by oil and where most species of animals had gone extinct.<br/><br/>The object being, we'll just clone them and everything will be OK. It was easy to believe such a world would come to pass in the late 1970's when the Arab oil embargo woke America up to the fact that oil and money, not the military, would call the shots for the people of planet Earth.<br/><br/>The story of ""Blade Runner"" is only loosely based on Phillip K. Dick's novel, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" whereby Dick envisioned a time where cyborgs (combinations of humans and robots) would merge into androids and become as intelligent as people – begging the question, ""Would they dream?"" Scott gave the weight of the film to special effects supervisors Richard Yuricich, who had already proved his worth on ""Star Wars"" and Douglas Trumbull, who had set the groundwork for special effects with his early work on ""2001"" and then later on ""Close Encounters."" Trumbull loved to use miniatures while Yuricich's approach was to use opticals and traveling mattes. Combined, the two men created some dazzling special effects that hold up even after forty years and the advent of CGI. Of course, it helps to have perpetual darkness and constant rain to mask any deficiencies. Still, we can suspend our disbelief and take in this once possible vision of a world now just seven years away. We can believe in the flying cars and pyramid shaped buildings that rise out of old LA because they help to tell this dark story and its tale of a future world run by corporations run amok.<br/><br/>The problem with predicting the future is that most people, most authors, never look at the practical side of the equation. While it would be nice to have a flying car, the idea that the sky is filled with flying objects that could crash into one another over a school yard or a hospital or a city park is even more frightening than a robot that walks, talks, and looks human. Meanwhile there is the practical side of creating replicants, the so-called ""cheap labor"" used to help create offworld colonies. The cost of even one such creature would be astronomical compared to the cost benefits derived. The idea a corporation could crank them out like car parts in a world already filled with seven billion people is downright silly. Why build a robot when plenty of cheap labor is readily available for one one-hundred-thousandth of the cost? Predicting the future is tricky business.<br/><br/>In the end, it is the ""film noir"" side of ""Blade Runner"" that is exciting to watch along with its versatile cast of players. Scott employs his actors to perform as Humphrey Bogart might in the ""Maltese Falcon"" – say little, express more with the eyes and appearance. Scott's use of score is questionable. Vangelis purely synthetic sound at times grates on the nerve when it overwhelms a scene and takes getting used to. However, what has made the sci-fi offering a classic perhaps falls upon the steadiness of actor Harrison Ford, who emotes even less than the entire cast combined. His universal appeal comes from his common sense of humanity which he brings to every role – that sort of wise handyman who can fix whatever is wrong. Scott was wise to cast Ford, who manages to keep one foot of this whacko fantasy on the ground long enough for us to relate.<br/><br/>While I gave the film an overall rating of 10 because I believe you should see it, the film has fallen from grace in my mind and is no longer the ""Wow"" movie I saw in LA at its premiere years ago."
"g_ryder","8","1","3","23 May 2012"," Suspect?...How can it not know what it is?
","I had to see this film couple of times before I could figure out the art, the symbolism and the philosophical ideas driving it. The dialogs seem innocuous on the surface, but as you go deeper and go over them from various angles, they turn out to be profound, especially those that take place in Tyrell's office. This is art and intellect at its best. The central theme or idea of the film is based on a very fundamental question: How does one distinguish a 'real' human being from an 'apparent' human being? Precisely what defines 'human' apart from mere bodily appearance and intelligence? In the movie a lie-detector like machine is used to detect the emotional responses of a test subject to determine if that subject has enough empathy to qualify as a human being, failing which he/she is identified as a 'replicant', which in the movie lingo means genetically manufactured pseudo-humans, designed to work 'slave like' in extreme physical conditions that also require intelligence. Naturally, in the context of the plot, all 'self attested humans' consider the replicants as mere machines, and those that do not perform according to their set role, or display rebel like behavior are to be hunted down and 'terminated with extreme prejudice' by the special policemen called 'bladerunners', who are also trained to use the 'empathy test' to detect replicants. It is the untested assumption, amounting to prejudice, that the replicants can never have higher emotions like empathy, love, compassion, value for life other than one's own, etc. The central idea of the movie is that this untested assumption, this 'extreme prejudice' is now going to be tested for all that is its worth, and lots of 'lives', both 'human' and 'replicant' are at stake.and both the human characters as well as the replicant characters will display behavior that is not to be expected, is extremely ironic if the existing assumptions and prejudices are to hold. The other striking aspect I found was a great sense of ironic humor in the dialogs. One example is Tyrell proudly claiming 'More human than human is our motto'. That one made me laugh for a long, long time. Then there is the romance between Deckard and Rachel which also blends well with the central theme, an integral part of the plot and which also gives a sense of completion to the movie in the end. Rather than classify this as science fiction I would classify this film as 'humanities reality', that is, a film that should be considered as one that addresses the most serious human concerns about the slow 'disappearance of the human' (Rick Roderick) in the postmodern world, a world in which 'real' is no longer meaningful and only the commercially manufactured images that sell the most are the only values left. This a one of those few movies that can be watched several times from different perspectives in order to fully appreciate the artistic and intellectual quality of the movie."

","Blade Runner is a cult classic that surprisingly has held up well over time.

The human element at times is discarded in the Sci-Fi genera, but that is not the case in Bade Runner. Their is a human elements that is decreasingly made available to today's audiences.<br/><br/>One only need think of the Transformers movies by Michel ""I only blow stuff up"" Bay, to understand the concept of the human, emotional connection is rare thing in today's Sci-Fi filmmakers.<br/><br/>In all honesty, I am not sure if the audience is a by product of the directors lack of ability to extend that emotional struggle to the audience or if it's vice-versa. Needless to say , it is sorely missing.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is exceptionable, and delivers on the true nature of this category of film making.

","Having been a long term fan and follower of all things Science Fiction, this film drew me in as a moth to a flame. From the lighting, use of weather, dialogue, casting, visual effects and simply stunning performances from Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer and Sean Young, this film ranks at the top of a rather short list of the most important science fiction films ever made. Gritty and visionary - with the haunting Vangelis soundtrack, and the grim vision of Ridley Scott at the helm, far moreso than Alien, this is his masterpiece.<br/><br/>Based on the Philip K. Dick story, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" this story, and subsequent motion picture paved the way for other noted artificial humans, culminating with Brent Spiner's Lieutenant Commander Data in the 1989 Star Trek: TNG Episode ""The Measure of a Man"", where Data is legally declared a self aware sentient being with the subsequent right to not be a Federation guinea pig.<br/><br/>If you haven't yet watched either - watch both.

","The critics seem to say that the visuals in this movie are outstanding but the rest of the movie is somewhat dry. I have a differing opinion on this matter: if we take the movie purely on its visuals, and even on the action, then we loose a large part of what this movie is about. Ebert's comment on the unrealistic nature of Tyrell's death is unimportant for if one is concerned more about how the replicant got into his office then you have missed the entire point of this scene.<br/><br/>The original release was not how Ridley Scott wanted the movie. I thought the original was boring but the Director's Cut (1993) has turned the entire style of the movie around. Ford's dubbing has been removed, there is an extended scene with the love affair between Ford and Young, and the ending has been changed completely. The original ending has Ford and Young driving off through a lush green countryside with their eyes on a beautiful future. The other ending is far bleaker with the words ""It's too bad she won't live, but then again who does,"" A very existentialist ending, which really is the whole point of the movie.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is about life, death, and the nature of humanity. Six replicants, advanced, genetically engineered robots, have escaped from their offworld colonies and have come to earth to confront their maker, Tyrell. The reason they come to Earth is because they have had a limited life span, four years, built into them, and they are reaching the end of their life. The whole purpose of this reminds us that we are all destined for the same end, and the point of the movie is that there is no way to end it. The close is superb for there is no huge gun battle where Roy (Rutger Hauer) goes out in a blaze of glory, but rather just dies because his time is out. Scott uses a dove in this scene as a possible symbol of the ascension of Roy's doll. In the end we are reminded that we all die. No dream world where the good live forever and punishment for evil is to have this eternal life ended. But then this dream world is not so fantastic after all for we all fall short of the glory of God, and as Romans 3:11 says ""there is no one who is righteous, not even one. There is no one who does good, no one who understands, all have turned away, together we have become worthless."" We are all evil thus we all die ""the wages of sin is death."" There is a very interesting idea in this movie though, about the nature of humanity. The ascension of the Roy's soul is a suggestion that there is more to the nature of the replicants than just a simple work tools. The idea is that these replicants are in a way more human than we are. There is a suggestion that Decker (Harrison Ford) is a replicant. We are not told directly but hints are dropped, like one replicant saying to him that he will live longer than him, and also the nature of Rachel. She is a replicant with a full memory implant. As far as she is concerned she is a human, and as far as Decker is concerned he is human. Also notice that there seems to be a glint in the eyes of the replicants. The owl in Tyrell's office always glints.<br/><br/>There is a lot to this movie. Not only is it a cinematic masterpiece but it also goes down as a literary masterpiece. The critics, when approaching this movie, obviously want huge action, but Blade Runner does not deliver, rather it reminds us that we will all die."
"filmdebateblog","Null","1","3","23 September 2011"," THE FINAL CUT film debate
","Join the debate at filmdebate.wordpress.com THE UGLY: I had never seen Blade Runner before the ""final cut"" was released in 2007. As of now, it is the only version I myself have seen so I can't say too much about other versions at the moment (although I have seen enough tidbits of the theatrical version to know that the voice-over truly does suck). That being said, I think the Blade Runner version I've seen is one of the best sci-fi movies ever created: alongside others like 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Empire Strikes Back, and Alien. The visuals of this movie are amazing; I could probably watch it just because of the visuals. Even compared with the sci-fi movies being made today (or especially compared with), this movie's dystopian future is highly believable: and all this without any use of computer graphics or animation! The future-streets of Los Angeles are probably the most fully-realized sci-fi set piece ever created and perhaps one of the most influential. The score is also pretty awesome.<br/><br/>What I'm curious about though, is what my fellow film-critics think about Harrison Ford's acting. I think his performance comes off a little half-hearted at times and I believe this was one of his least favorite times acting in a film. Also of interest to me, this movie almost seems atypical to Ford's usual characters. Deckard is an anti-hero who's morals are murky, isn't terribly adept at offing replicants, and who doesn't really overcome his enemies through sheer willpower and awesome flip-over-back fight scenes (aka: Indiana Jones, Jack Ryan, or President James Marshall).<br/><br/>THE PROFESSIONAL: Before I get into it, let me say first-off that this is the best film that Ridley Scott has ever made. And yes, perhaps it took SEVEN VERSIONS of the movie to actually get to that point. My first exposure to this film was a Director's Cut on VHS. I can't imagine to think what the movie would have been like with Harrison Ford giving voice-over-narration, as in some earlier studio-tampered versions. The Final Cut definitely deserves a spot in the hall of cinematic greatness for all time. Let me say it again with more emphasis, this is the best Ridley Scott film by leaps and bounds – and it makes me cast suspicious glances at some of his other films. How could the director who made THIS movie (albeit after seven attempts) make THOSE movies? <br/><br/>THE FUGITIVE: Come on! Are you telling me that Thelma and Louise is not the best film ever made!? Driving off a cliff for no real apparent reason is so poetic! <br/><br/>*** CONTINUED AT filmdebate.wordpress.com"
"publiusromanus","Null","1","3","10 August 2011"," One of Scott's Best
","When people ask me, ""What is film noir?"", I tell them to watch Blade Runner. Without a doubt, this film deserves mention as a member of an artistic genre, as a science fiction film, and as a great movie altogether. Ridley Scott, who I consider to be an almost stylistic continuation of Kubrick, truly outdoes himself in veering drastically from most of his films' styles. In Blade Runner, you smell the cigarette smoke, feel the humidity of steam in your face, and are both taken aback and also drawn into this gritty world of corruption and backwardness.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford makes the cynical detective role look easy, and does what he does best. However, Rutger Hauer shines in this movie, as the victim of society and backwardness, and raises the ultimate truth of the film at its climax.<br/><br/>In the end, Blade Runner's only fault is the soundtrack. I will not deny that Vangelis was instrumental in creating the sound of Modern Film score, but in trying to make a totally futuristic, synthetic score, the picture loses the depth that a traditional soundtrack delivers. And, in addition to that, Vangelis tries to incorporate typical instruments, such as the Saxophone, which doesn't quite blend well with his style.<br/><br/>Overall, I love the film, and recommend it to most of my sci-fi friends."
"mnpollio","8","1","3","22 June 2011"," A visually stunning film that actually improves on subsequent viewings
","It's 2019 on planet Earth and blade runners are glorified bounty hunters called in to identify and destroy rogue replicants, synthetic humans with fixed life spans relegated to work in dangerous environments. Harrison Ford is a semi-retired blade runner called back into action to hunt down four renegade replicants that have mutinied and returned to earth in search of their creator, who they hope will extend their lives.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's science-fiction/film noir epic based on Philip K. Dick's novel may not quite live up to its legendary cult status, but it certainly comes close enough to warrant a success. I saw the film on its original release in 1982 when it received mixed critical reviews and tepid box office, but its reputation has steadfastly and deservedly grown over the years. It is that rare film that actually improves on subsequent viewings as it reveals hidden depths on further introspection and facets which were dismissed as misfires the first time around have been re-evaluated.<br/><br/>One thing that was never disputed was the visual impact of the film. Not since Fritz Lang's legendary silent film masterpiece Metropolis has a futuristic world been depicted with such convincing and compelling realism. The Earth of Blade Runner is a grungy, polluted, rain-soaked hell-scape of seemingly endless night drenched in neon, gigantic skyscrapers and nightmarishly crowded streets. This is a rare film in that even if the story failed to work at all, one could sit in wonder for the running time just admiring the elaborate denseness of the background and the limitless imagination of the director and the set designers, costume designers, visual effects artists, and various technicians that brought it all to breathtaking life. We see flourishes of both the future and the past in everything, including wardrobes and hairstyles that remind one of the 1940s. That alone is a simply amazing achievement. Truly, the sheer verisimilitude of the environment is nothing less than stunning.<br/><br/>The ""villains"" of the piece – the replicants – are undeniably deadly, but their hopes for a better and longer life make them oddly sympathetic. These synthetic humans ironically seem more emotionally accessible than a number of the humans populating this future, which is unquestionably the point the film makes. The question of what exactly constitutes ""being human"". The lines are further blurred with the introduction of the assistant to the head of the company that manufactures replicants, a stunning beauty named Rachel (played by Sean Young), who unbeknownst to herself is a replicant with the memories of another programmed into her. Ford becomes entranced by her and feels oddly sympathetic to her plight when she begins to realize the truth.<br/><br/>One of the things that drew many complaints initially was the low-key performance of Ford in the central role coupled with his world-weary voice-over narration. However, I have grown to believe that both elements work surprisingly well. The narration and the restraint of Ford's performance are both ingredients very popular and often important to the noir genre that Scott is partially paying homage to. Vangelis' soulful jazz-inspired score also adds to the atmosphere of the piece.<br/><br/>Rutger Hauer is first-rate as the charismatic and threatening leader of the replicants. If his final confrontation with Ford is anti-climactic, Hauer nicely pulls off the undertones of the character's final moments on screen. Young has become a huge Hollywood joke after her career derailed a number of years ago, but her work here is quite moving and displays some of the promise that she demonstrated early in her career. Neither Edward James Olmos or M. Emmet Walsh have much to do as Ford's colleague and supervisor. Joe Turkel provides a subtle turn as the creator of the replicants. William Sanderson is also memorable as a lonely company employee whom the replicants befriend for their own reasons. And who can forget the lithe and beautiful Daryl Hannah, who makes a terrific impression as the deadly acrobatic replicant Pris. Her showdown with Ford is one of the film's highlights, even if it could have lasted longer.<br/><br/>A truly marvelous achievement that should be watched more than once to fully appreciate what Scott and company have accomplished."

","I recently watched this for the first time, and I'm quite pleased with this film overall. I love the classic Star Wars movies, and this plot and settings seems like Star Wars/Terminator/The Fugitive/Robocop mixed together; very exciting.<br/><br/>The visuals, cinematography, lighting, and 80's special effects make this movie worth watching on their own. However, the plot seems to jump around a lot, and even skips some major build up; some scenes just happen as if everyone knows what's going on, and the viewer is expected to put the pieces together. But I guess that's part of what makes this movie good, people are allowed to make of it what they wish, instead of being spoon feed all the details.<br/><br/>Despite the plot skips, this is an excellent film. The twisted futuristic concepts and visuals are a creative work of genius. At some parts I forgot that I was watching an 80's film, as some scenes are so brilliantly done that they seem like a feasible glimpse into the future. But then I'm brought back to reality with some of the 80's hairstyles and 80's movie aspects; like random scenes with midgets, old digital displays, and the fact that nobody had cell phones or ipads.<br/><br/>Also, this is some classic Harrison Ford acting, if you're a fan of Ford, or Star Wars, or anything Futuristic or Sci-Fi, you must watch this film at least once."
"darren-christian","9","1","3","2 February 2011"," Ridley, the master visualist
","This film is a visual masterpiece, the haunting city scape's and decrepit buildings are incredibly realistic.This is shocking considering the movie was made in 1982. Ridley is truly a master visualist and his work is beautifully complimented by the expert photography of Jordan Cronnenweth.It is a bleak look into the future, but what scares me most is how believable it is. Ridley takes everything into consideration down to the finest details and provides a interesting view of the street culture in the year 2019 which doesn't stray too far from some neo lit cities of the present.The movie practically invented the sci fi noir genre and if not the first of its kind ,surely the most dazzling.The action scenes are intermittent which adds to the authenticity of the events and juxtaposes the formulaic explosive sci fi action films of recent times.The Film also raises deep philosophical questions about the human condition and stays true to the central themes of Philip K Dicks novel ""Do androids dream of electric sheep"".The cohesion between Dicks writing and Ridley's visual craftsmanship has spawned a cinematic masterpiece.This movie is almost 30 years old and has not dated one bit,let that be a lesson to all those who think CG is the way forward.If practical special effects are able to create results that this movie has displayed, i say we should consider reverting to those techniques once again.Go watch it!!!"
"paul2001sw-1","7","1","3","9 November 2010"," The past in the future
","The Los Angeles of the near future will, apparently, be very similar to the Los Angeles of the recent past. Yes, it's always raining, but otherwise Ridely Scott's 'Blade Runner' is set in a world recognisable from the novels of Raymond Chandler or from Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown'. The fact that the plot is about androids seems a minor detail, until about two thirds of the way through, when the film becomes darker and stranger. Themes resembling those of 'Logan's Run' start to emerge (the idea of premature mortality), and although the film ends with an action sequence, it's not shot quite like a conventional all-action finale, with more of an emphasis on mood and less on viscerality. The scene is accompanied (as is much of the rest of the film) by a soundtrack that unquestionably belongs in 1982 (when the film was made), but the overall effect is actually quite moving. Still, although more ambitious than Scott's earlier 'Alien'', 'Blade Runner' is also less perfect. Some details feel like oddities, thrown in for effect without making perfect sense, and Harrison Ford (in the lead role) struggles to convey complex emotion (although he is not playing an android, but allegedly a human). But it's certainly a brave and distinctive movie, and not without intelligence either."

","Blade Runner (1982)<br/><br/>Top 3 - 1982<br/><br/>Top 3 - Sci Fi Films of All Time<br/><br/>Top 50 - All Time <br/><br/>Ridley Scott's visually intoxicating sci-fi epic that is 'Blade Runner' has finally gained the momentum and recognition it fully deserves, over two decades after its release. It even made the revised version of the AFI's Top 100 American Films.<br/><br/>When released in 1982, Blade Runner flopped at the box office and sharply divided critics. Its technical brilliance was universally acknowledged, however many critics believed the film lacked a real human story and depth in its dramatic nature. Even eminent American critic Roger Ebert felt the film failed on a 'human level', although he somewhat revised his opinions years later.<br/><br/>Well I strongly disagree with this interpretation of the film - after all, this is a cautionary tale about the accelerating mechanisation of our society, the unsustainable expansion of the world and the increasing grasp of massive corporations. The film's elements range from subtle philosophical dilemmas such as 'What makes a human a human?' 'What constitutes existence?"" An allusion to these dilemmas is offered by Pris (Daryl Hannah), who is a Replicant when she utters Rene Descartes' signature dictum: ""I think therefore I am"". Or when Roy (Rutger Hauer) quotes Nietzsche (""I've seen things"") in his monologue at the end of the film. Blade Runner has depth and multiple layers to it, which I suspect would be fully discovered if the film is watched multiple times.<br/><br/>Los Angeles, 2019 - Oppressively high rise temples soar up into the occluded and polluted skies of LA. Acid Rain collects between the neon-illuminated fissures that separate the colossal buildings. The city is a hybrid of races (there is nothing sci-fi about that) and the city's poor are enslaved in infected dwellings on ground level, while the rich are secluded in their skyscrapers or the very rich have escaped into ""off world colonies"", where they profit from Replicants who they use as slave labour. The Tyrell Corporation makes Replicants exactly like humans and injects them with a lifespan of 4 years, because they collect too many memories and acquire to much human experience, making them dangerously human. Can these artificial beings become humans? They feel, they smell, they are emotionally attached, does that matter? The film centres on a Blade Runner assigned to ""decommision"" a few Replicants who escaped back to Earth, which is strictly prohibited. As the film progresses, we wonder is Deckard a Replicant, if so he is indistinguishable. This film is the grittier, darker more violent 80s version of Kubrick's '2001'. It is an astonishing achievement.<br/><br/>The film was overshadowed upon release by the dominance of 'ET: The Extra Terrestrial', another masterpiece by Spielberg, but one that offers more comforting qualities than Scott's probing epic.<br/><br/>10/10"

","In 2019 Blade Runner Deckard (Ford) is hired to track down and retire numerous replicants, slaves who have come to earth seeking their constructor.<br/><br/>Almost 30 years on Blade Runner is renowned as a classic, despite bombing in theatres when first released, but significantly all the attention is what happened behind closed doors for this sci-fi smash.<br/><br/>There have been riffs between Scott and his apparent distance to his crew, the central star argued whether Deckard was human or not but what is most debated still is this whole business with specific cuts.<br/><br/>First there was an unapproved director's cut, and then in the early 90's Scott did his own version with the latest cut and apparent finale being released two years ago.<br/><br/>Having watched the director's cut, and my first viewing of the film, a few months previously I was left spellbound by the attractive graphics, the gritty and mind conceptual nature of the sharp scripting amongst the usual bravado performance by the Star Wars hero Harrison Ford.<br/><br/>One of the debates is the inclusion of Ford's narration. Now the final cut does not include any of this apparent narration and I am unable to recall how much was included in the director's cut but ultimately from my perspective the absence is a powerful thing as we are left to work out the complexions of Deckard's nature.<br/><br/>The opening sequence explains the facts regarding replicants and Blade Runners with a soulful futuristic vibe playing in the background. We then open to a futuristic Los Angeles with numerous towers on fire and a splendid montage of a fiery eye that sets the tone for a noir styled futuristic film.<br/><br/>After a sharp murder Deckard is hired to kill the remaining replicants and is soon on a detective style trail to exploit the activities of their creator with Rachel (Young) applying the necessary rivalry and challenge for Deckard.<br/><br/>Amongst all the terms and relevance of the time, this is quite a silent movie with Ford's masculine figure saying what he only needs to and creating that soulful presence he does so well. Young balances the actor with her inside numbness whilst Hauer is perhaps the most intriguing character, being evil but with a purpose and significance.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's direction takes in mind the complexity of reality for the future with the crowded streets, the development of the replicants and working a constricted tale for Deckard to try and master.<br/><br/>This is all about the humanity in the future and how machines hinder our options and possibilities. It is relative but also highly enjoyable and exceptionally exciting also.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is certainly stunning in visuals, but looking deeper it is a cleverly woven narrative about humanity against machine and whichever version, is worth watching."

","Blade Runner, where do I start? It's loosely based on PKD's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"". I had the luxury of reading the book before watching the movie. I felt that although there are huge differences between the film and the novel, the overall feel and message was still there.<br/><br/>What is life? What is a soul? These questions come to mind as the story of Deckard and the 'replicant' fugitives plays out. The story is phenomenal, the acting is superb. Rutger Hauer is amazing, and instantly became one of my favorite actors of all time after watching the ending sequence where Roy chases Deckard - and notably when Roy interacts with his 'creator'. ""I want more life!"" The production quality of Blade Runner is unreal. Made in a film-making era where CG was just being touched upon, and scaled models were still an industry standard; I can't believe my eyes whenever I see aerial views of the city. The special effects were made with extreme care, and are used in a subtle and tasteful manner.<br/><br/>The way Deckard interacts with the futuristic city is EXTREMELY believable. I have a hard time thinking that there's a camera crew just barely off screen. The level of immersiveness is untouched by CG scifis like the new Star Wars prequels, for example.<br/><br/>It's a visual feast - the characters are perfect, the story and the philosophical questions around it are deep and necessary as well. Nothing feels forced. The setting and it's inhabitants are natural and believable. I watch this movie always wanting more. I wonder what Ridley Scott could've done with a bigger budget and maybe an hour or two more. I heard Blade Runner flopped when it released in theaters. That's hard to imagine. I can't fathom the idea that this movie wasn't successful from the get-go.<br/><br/>I'd like to personally say that this is my favorite movie of all time. I think it should be considered as important to the science fiction genre as ""Metropolis"". I don't care what genre of film you prefer, I think everybody who takes anything for more than just face value should give Blade Runner a watch."

And what's more, I now notice how hauntingly poetic (ah, Vangelis' ethereal music score!), darkly enigmatic and contemplative it is, among its bursts of thrilling, unforgettably violent action.

It's not so much that you want to be in this beautifully mechanized, steely, Gothic future, but that when a shot changes, you are like a dope fiend whose fix has been snatched away from him right when the last hit was wearing off in that you couldn't take your eyes off of the buildings, vehicles, architectural approach, clothes, and arrangement of everything in the last shot.<br/><br/>The unusually effective 1980s synthesizer score has an irresistible hypnotic effect over you, just as Ridley Scott's ominous, foreign atmosphere does. Say you were flipping through channels and came across this movie during one of Vangelis's big moments, one being the final credits, it would be very difficult to go away before he's done.<br/><br/>I won't deny it any kudos for its exceptional technical achievement, but I also can't deny my lack of satisfaction with the story itself. A movie can't be driven by its production design. The focus of any film has to be its story.<br/><br/>The main premise is very interesting, but never given depth. It seems lathered on top. Blade Runner, despite its status, is a case of style over substance."
"RSuttile","10","1","3","8 January 2008"," Blade Runner
","I was very young when I first saw Blade Runner in the theater. I thought it was basically a 1930's detective novel made in the future. However there is so many things written about it, including Ridley Scott's admission that Dekker (played by Harrison Ford) is in reality not a human but a replicant. Now I know there are a lot of ""clues"" that he is a replicant: The way his eyes glow, the subtle remarks that are made, the unicorn dream etc. etc. However there are some things that make me think he could be a human: the replicants all seem to have superior strength and stamina, Dekker seems like a normal human being. If he was as strong as the replicants, even if he was programmed to ""believe"" he was human, why didn't that superior strength come to play? It also seemed strange that the other replicants seemed to be unaware that Dekker was a ""brother"" replicant as well, and if they did, why didn't they try to win him over? Ahhh here's the rub, the Voit Kamp test is supposed to test a person's ""empathy"" the emotion that the replicant's lacked. Empathy is a person's capacity to feel another person's feelings as like your own. Dekker seems to me in the beginning to be a man who has grown cynical, but his hunt for the replicants brings these emotions back to him. He actually falls in LOVE with a replicant, he witnesses a replicant out to kill him us his last bit of strength to save his life. I think the idea of the story was that aside from the 4 year lifespan, the human condition of the future has actually dehumanized humans until they were really no better than the replicants they created. Yet through his hunt for them, Dekker actually gained back a humanity that he had previously lost. Did anyone ever consider that the movie loses its power if Dekker is a replicant? Is Dekker a replicant? To tell you the truth...I really don't know. I think that so many things were put into the story to cloud and delude people and keep them thinking that there really is no answer, it is up to your own opinion."

","I just finished watching the Final Cut version from the five disc briefcase edition that was just released. I've also been reading the other reviews here. For me, my Blade Runner experience began in 1984 when, at the age of 12, my friends and I were allowed to watch this R rated film by our parents. At 12 it resonated with me, particularly the philosophical aspects of the story, namely that all life is just fleeting like tears in the rain. The film instantly became one of my many favorites, but not the only favorite.<br/><br/>As I've talked to more and more people over the years about films I find I am now in the minority when it comes to appreciating Blade Runner. I admit, and will not argue that, the film is slow paced. In fact, I'm not surprised that the slow pacing turns many people off, especially nowadays when everything has to be edit, edit, edit. As for the screenplay having inconsistencies and being too thin--well it just might. I guess what I experience when watching Blade Runner is a unique vision--Ridley Scott's vision--of a possible future where like Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"", man has created androids in their own image, but they aren't happy. In fact, they are both angry and depressed that there's no purpose to life, that they have no control over when they will die and that the person who made them can't fix any of their problems.<br/><br/>So, I disagree with reviewers that say Blade Runner offers nothing to chew on or think about afterward. Yet, my wife completely didn't get Blade Runner. She just saw it as long, boring and confusing. Her perception focused on how Deckard's character is weakly written. How Harrison Ford did a poor job of acting along with Sean Young, Daryl Hannah and several others with the exception of Rutger Hauer who she felt did an excellent job of playing his role. She didn't like Vangelis's musical score and found it completely dated and inextricably tied to the 1980's. There is discord in this household tonight! To each their own. I think this is guy's film anyway. I don't know too many females that rave about Blade Runner (not even my wife). I also think that this film has a nostalgic value. I believe if you were alive and cognizant at the time this film was originally released it has a special place despite its shortcomings. I will always enjoy Blade Runner and its pessimistic view of life, after all pessimists are realists and closer to the actual truths in people and the world."

The eeriness it contributed to the scene where Rachael comes to Deckard's place to prove how human she is really drew me into this world for some reason. <br/><br/>-I don't draw as many philosophical insights as other people say this film appears to be laden with, but then again I have only seen it once. Perhaps it will grow on me. It was close to being very good but didn't over step the mark IMHO.<br/><br/>Start is excellent, middle was a little slow for me, but the ending definitely was what pushed this up to a solid 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>Good movie...yes.

","Blade Runner is a true science fiction classic.<br/><br/>I first saw this at a young age and, although found it a bit confusing and slow at the time, was still taken by its striking visual power. But seeing it again as an adult was an altogether different experience.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford is perfect as the brooding android killer, and the visual effects still hold up today as well as they did back in the early 80's.<br/><br/>The film is a richly detailed, staggeringly beautiful, and intelligent piece of cinema.

"shanfloyd","9","1","3","24 August 2007"," A pioneer in the genre of sci-fi.
","This is one of the five timeless classics that literally shaped the genre of science fiction in modern cinema. 'Blade Runner' is shockingly original in its concept, with considerable depth in its theme and vision. Much has been written in the other user comments about the story and its philosophical implications, the acting, the screenplay etc. I just want to focus on two major aspects of the film.<br/><br/>The film brilliantly captures PKD's vision about the future. PKD has always outlined a rather dystopic society, with paranoia screaming out of its every corner. The film's use of dark sets, smoke, faded light, night-time rain, broken buildings, exotic people has effectively set the right mood for what PKD had dreamt of - a society on the verge of breakdown, living on the edge with crime, corruption and misused technology. All credits must go to the art/set directors, the cinematographers and of course to Mr. Scott himself.<br/><br/>The original music is just breathtaking. Vangelis created the right sound for every mood, mostly dominated by paranoia and fear of the unknown. The use of foreign music in many scenes only add to the vision of cultural complexity.<br/><br/>The director's cut is vastly superior than the original release not only because it excludes the voice-over, but because of the brilliant extra footage and altered ending. It designs a more perfect way to throw out the question whether Deckerd himself was a replicant or not."
"thepooles-1","Null","1","3","19 August 2007"," The replicant Roy ends up nobler than his creator or tracker.
","Just as man may have made God in his own image and not vice versa the replicant Roy transcends his created purpose in his final moments with an act of unprogrammed compassion for a human who most likely was incapable of reciprocation. The tracker Deckard was more monstrous than the rampaging Roy. I think Philip Dick's tracker cop Deckard could easily have transformed into an unwitting replicant and one cleverly used by the authorities. Another Sci Fi classic is SOYLENT GREEN which I feel captured the more likely dystopian near future. Both film directors were savvy in their scoring choices. Beethoven worked for SOYLENT GREEN and Vangelis's 80s synthesizer arsenal layering was perfect for BLADE RUNNER."
"Det_McNulty","10","1","3","7 May 2007"," The ""Director's Cut"" Is Both The Intended and Definitive Experience Of *The* Philosophical Tour De Force In Perfection
","Ridley Scott first proved to be a consummate master of cinema with the classic sci-fi horror, Alien and two years prior he had crafted his critically-acclaimed The Duellists. Then in 1982 Ridley Scott returned for his now superlative work, the ground-breaking masterpiece, Blade Runner. It remains one of the most controversial films ever made, due to the range of extensive cuts and edits which were performed by the producers. In 1992 Blade Runner: The Director's Cut was released. This marked a huge accomplishment for both Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford who have both cited the original version as ""fake"". Although Ridley Scott considers the Director's Cut to be rushed, it is still the version which he considers true to his original vision and there is no question about it, the Director's Cut is the only way to gain the true representation of the film's colossal greatness.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is a vague adaptation of Philip K. Dick's, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and remains a polarising and visionary image of the possible dystopia the world could so easily become. The year 2019 and a ""techno-metro"" Los Angeles police-department known as ""Blade Runners"" pursue Replicants (genetically-engineered species which are almost indistinguishable from humans). The Replicants are deemed too dangerous for society and are illegal on Earth. Blade Runners are law-enforcement agents set to execute (""retirement"") any Replicants which have found their way onto the Earth. Deckard, a retired Blade Runner is unwillingly called back from retirement to pursue four known Replicants who have gained entry into Los Angeles. <br/><br/>There is a common misconception that films which have huge budgets and deal with weighty topics are not able to balance both intelligence and entertainment. Except, Blade Runner (although made on a large budget) is far from being a Hollywood film, which is of course a relief because today's Hollywood would rarely dream of letting a film like Blade Runner be crafted in the way it has been. They would want huge explosions, people running in and out of buildings shooting the ""bad guys"" and common-placed clichés to please mass-audiences. Commercially, Blade Runner was a failure and views of the film were extremely diverse, this is just one of the reasons why the film has gained a cult success.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is a film is so visually stunning that everything about it becomes etched on your mind. The opening shot of a huge dystopia stretching as far as the eye can see, while contrasting against the magnificent lights and colours illuminating the L.A sky is awe-inspiring. As the film progresses you become opened-up to a grim environment where there is little way of differentiating night and day and little way of knowing the time. It is a society overrun with consumerism, technology and most of all menace. It is an overwhelming atmosphere, filmed with grim beauty and visceral flair, an environment where everything is busy, yet people are lonely inside. In a way it is a society where paranoia is quite apparent and nobody is oblivious enough to truly ignore it. The score is another one of the film's many fantastic technical achievements, it perfectly adds to the film's haunting and sombre mood.<br/><br/>The retro set-pieces are vibrantly detailed, echoing the shades of techno-noir from the use of camera movements, to other elements such as character personalities, traits and actions. The incorporation of ""femme fatale"" is another method used to emphasise the film's shady noir. Then you have the use of symbolism, moralistic undercurrents and the religious imagery (such as the film's significant chess game). In addition, Blade Runner has political (Japanese culture being a strong-hold for American culture) and social subtext (businesses overriding people). You could even go so far as saying the film's main focus is on the individual sorrow of ""what Deckard really is"".<br/><br/>Blade Runner is a film whereby the narrative is so involving and relentless that it is impossible not be compelled by the film's infinite selection of material to scrutinise and discuss for hours on end. The acting from the entire cast, notably the performances from that of Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer adds to the film's emotional complexity. Harrison Ford gives the performance of a lifetime; a timeless performance of a man's tortured ""soul"".<br/><br/>Blade Runner is a film of thought-provoking ambiguity, conflicting view-points and dramatic emotions. Even on my consistent viewings of Blade Runner I still gain the cold feeling I got the first time when I saw the stunning array of beauty of the film holds, even in the darkest of moments. Ultimately, Blade Runner remains a poignant reminder to how artificial-intelligence could quite possibly become only too ""human"" and man's hopeless pursuit for immortality. There is no denying that Blade Runner is one of the finest films ever made and a film deserving repeat-viewings."

"n-bogdanovic","10","1","3","1 May 2006"," The most fantastic Si-Fi film ever
","This movie is the great blueprint for nearly all Sience-Fiction movies coming afterwards. It is courageous as well as spirited, seminal and prophetic. Probably, This is the reason why BR (especially the end) was 1982 so deformed by the producers. I was 14 years old when it was released in Germany. I could only watch it through the eyes of a boy that was on the verge of getting an adolescent. Thanks to the corresponding zeitgeist of the 80's with it's unmatched mixture of fascination and fear of the future, it was an admirable work and a thunderclap that nearly produced an overflow of fascination in a young boy's synapsis. But I got a wonderful glimpse and now an assuredness that I was a witness to something singular. The beginning shows a central theme of the film. An apocalyptic skyline with gigantic fires mirrors in the eyes of a man. The eyes are the window to the soul of a human and they are used to separate the humans from the non humans, that means the replicants. The replicants are used for dangerous slave works in the outer worlds. No more. The interesting thing is that they are much more intelligent,strong and fit than even the engineers who constructed them. But whenever they try to come back to the earth, they will be killed, euphemistically called ""retired"". People, who do this job, are called ""Blade Runner"". Deckard, the main character of the film, is one of them and his name is no accident. Deckard refers to Descartes, the french philosopher and founder of the modern philosophy, who's known for his insight that self awareness is the basis for existence. At the beginning Deckard is confident about the role all beings play. But he's that only because he doesn't question anything. He lives his life, and that's it. His new job changes everything. Bryant, his last boss, ""motivates"" him to ""retire"" four ""skin-jobs"", i.e. replicants. So he starts as usual. At first he has to show the machine for revealing non humans to Eldon Tyrell, the genuine diabolic chief of the Tyrell corporation, who invented and ""produces"" the newest generation of replicants, called Nexus 6. Deckard demonstrates his machine on Rachel. Questions are asked to provoke an emotional reaction in the test object. Replicants can't deal with it. Tyrell advanced his replicants, but the machine works even with them. One of the two weaknesses of them. The other is the lifespan of 4 years. As Rachel starts to get aware of what she is, Deckard is grievously untouched. Tyrell regards and realizes all. As the Owl he owns, the symbol for wisdom. The first impression of Roy Batty, the leader of the replicants, who came back to earth for a special reason, is symptomatic for the rest of the movie. He's unapproachable for the humans he visits. Deckard does his job as usual with Salomé, the name of a bible character. In the meantime, as Roy Betty visits his maker, Eldon Tyrell, the ""god"" of Bio-Genetics. Roy wanted to bid his ""father"" to give him more time to live. But all Tyrell can do is to summarize Roy's life in two sentences. ""The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And you have burned so very very brightly Roy."" Then the son kills his father. Nitsche's greeting. Then, Rachel shows Deckard photos of her youth to get a confirmation for her last hope to be human, but he destroys all her illusions. She weeps - one of the most human emotions. Deckard recognizes what he's done and wants to console her, but is merely implausible. That's the point when Deckard gets real doubts, because he can't handle real emotions himself. But he carries on. In the end he is confronted with Roy Betty, who sees his lifetime fading away. Therefore he drills a nail through his hand to feel life through pain. That reminds of Jesus which is again no accident. In the end Deckard is eyeball to eyeball with his own death. Roy stands beside and confronts him with the only feeling he experienced himself: fear. ""Quite an experience to life in fear, isn't it ?"" and then... Roy saves him with his pierced hand, holding a dove, the symbol for the soul, in the other. His last words in view of his nearing death are ultimately sad and wonderful at the same time: ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.......All those moments will be lost in time. Like tears in the rain. Time to die."" Then his dove rises. What a statement ? He tells his innermost memories, which were not implanted and will be lost when he dies. He realizes that the meaning of life is to live. He accepted his ending existence as Roy Batty. That gave him salvation and he could die being one with the world. There he reminds again to Jesus. He learned his lesson, and that makes him really ""more human than human"". Actually, the Nexus 6 are the only ones, who shine in a dark world of steady rain and curious people. The end gives a hint on Deckard's reality as he finds an origami, which symbolizes a unicorn. It's from Gaff, the mysterious figure, who follows Deckard through the whole movie. Deckard nods his head as if he knows. It was the final scene of the better version. No questions anymore. The movie makes a mountainous statement of what makes a human human. The conclusion can only be the self awareness and the affirmation of life. And it was the end of a gigantic and singular movie which You should have seen. A comment will never live up to the atmosphere BR enfolds You in. Even today, 25 years later, I'm still enchanted. The themes, implications, questions and answers are unmatched and more actual than 1982."
"wanderingpoet","10","1","3","8 April 2006"," My all-time favorite
","What more can be added to this masterpiece? Not only it's full of poetry but superbly directed. A story that could have been so easily turned into a low rate sci-fi flick ends up being a poetic insight into the meaning of life. It's a hard, dark story that pays homage to the ""black movies"" of the 30's and 40's and by mixing it with an anticipation background renders a tale of hopeless quest for the reasons that make us human. No doubt, it is Ridley Scott's best movie ever, and the soundtrack by Vangelis has become a cult among collectors, being an essential addition to the obscure atmosphere that pervades the whole movie.Harrison Ford may have given better performances than in this film, but his role as the detached, lonely Blade Runner Deckard has made him an icon in sci-fi genre. Fortunately, Scott did not fall into the temptation of making another sequel to Star Wars and he went one step forward, showing that a science fiction movie can be much more than just laser sables and x-wing fighters. A must-see for any fan or connoisseur."
"alpha641","10","1","3","19 March 2006"," Blade Runner 1982- The International Cut
","I viewed this particular version of the movie (when it was first released back in 1982) and found it to be much more tantalizing and intriguing than the Director's Cut (which seems to be the only version available on DVD at this present date). Not only did Harrison Ford narrate throughout the whole movie (to help the audience better understand the plot, characters and/or their motives), but at least two major scenes were excluded from the Director's Cut. I personally feel by exclusion of these key parts, it lessens the integrity of this movie. I would like to see the original (Inernational Cut) be re-released in the United States. I believe it would be a great success in drawing more viewers to this timeless classic.<br/><br/>I would also like to point out the musical soundtrack was absolutely sensational. There could not have been a better composition created for a movie such as this than the one that was created for this movie."
"thedestroyer6666","10","1","3","19 January 2006"," The epitome of sci-fi masterpieces
","Very few films in cinematic history have the power to live on through different new waves of cinema, and indeed the test of time. Most, like the special effects of the fifties, have in some way or another been out- done, forgotten or indeed re- made. None of these are ways in which 1982's Blade Runner has been affected by the test of time. If anything, Blade Runner has got better and better as time has passed since its release, and is now regarded as something of a lost gem of the otherwise bad decade of film- making, the eighties. The charm of this futuristic and deeply provocative science fiction film was much hated by audiences upon its release, and it is very difficult to see why. Douglas Trumbull's lushly dark and upsetting skylines and cityscapes are still as imposingly sinister as ever it was, and the man vs. machine storyline is perhaps the only sci- fi narrative that stays intact as a result. The sheer originality of the film, not succumbing to the confines of some more run- of the- mill narratives, is a depiction of film- making at its brilliant best, with the film noir influence painting a bleak image of a dystopian future world. So, if all these points about the film are true, then why was this film not more of a success? I believe it has very much to do with the presence of Star Wars still floating around, even five years after its release. Audiences were won over by the intergalactic battle between good and evil and idolised the role of Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, and indeed Darth Vader, the demonic leader of the dark side of the force. Quite rightfully so, as Star Wars in 1977 was definitely ahead of its time in terms of special effects and sheer scale, but here is where I get controversial. Blade Runner is better. It has all the charm and intelligence of Star Wars, and then some. The special effects are sublime and involving, and the story is way more complex and meaningful than Star Wars or indeed any other sci-fi film of the era. The beauty of Blade Runner is everywhere, from the meaningful and emotionally provocative script, the excellent acting and the dazzling special effects, to the way the film communicates with the audience on a much higher level than most films ever could. The sheer beauty of this film is not noticeable unless the viewer engages and understands just what the film is trying to tell them. Blade Runner is a very clever film in that it prophesises what the future could hold for mankind. If that is not a scary thought, given the content of the film, I don't know what is. Later next year, Blade Runner gets it's long awaited and indeed welcomed release on DVD, to celebrate the films' 25th anniversary, and I feel that for once, the film will get the attention and public welcome that it deserved upon it's release over two decades ago. Of course the film will have critics swarming over it, ready to pick any fault they can, but I think somehow that it was never intended to be that sort of film at all. It is a film that just needs to be heard as it gets its message across. I really feel that if people really listened on its release, we could now be talking about Blade Runner in a very different way. Maybe even with the same status as Star Wars has. But, I guess that it is down to public opinion, and preference, but surely that should not overshadow one of the great marvels of sci-fi? The debate about Blade Runner continues, with critics constantly mulling it over, reconsidering its status even twenty four years after it first graced our screens. But I think that this film will never be forgotten. Undoubtedly the best work to come from Ridley Scott yet, and a truly provocative and moving film, I think Blade Runner will be talked about for many more years to come, and as a result, the charm of it will never die. So remember don't judge a book by its cover. Go and see Blade Runner, and treat yourself to one of the greatest influences on modern cinema and arguably one of the best book to film adaptations you are ever likely to see."

","I've seen thousands of movies but Blade Runner is my favorite, my No. 1 movie ever. Even after all those years it looks impressive and fresh today. Everything is superb - from the Philip K. Dick's idea to Ridley Scott's direction, actors, Vangelis soundtrack and Syd Mead's visuals. It's deep, balanced, inspiring, a true cult movie. Blade Runner inspired so many more movies, books, computer games... it's a milestone in a film industry. When I look at the Blade Runner today in a technical way I enjoy the real-life look of old-school special effects - no CGI that oversaturate today's fast-food blockbuster movies that look more and more like Playstation intros. I appreciate it even more today than in 80es as in over than two decades no SF movie succeed to be so compelling and complete as Blade Runner."
"Polaris_DiB","10","1","3","25 October 2005"," Humanity and God
","Three genres are traced back to Expressionism: film noir, science fiction, and horror. All three are represented to some effect (well, maybe not so much horror, though a few moments are spine-tingling) to create the dirty, sulky atmosphere of 2019 Los Angeles, where the rich have gone to live on the off-world colonies and the rest of humanity bubbles and ferments in a disgusting world of industrial sludge and ever-pouring rain, a world now penetrated by four replicants (androids) escaped from the off-world colonies and who must be hunted down by Deckard, a blade runner.<br/><br/>Such is the overview of the richly articulated and darkly felt exploration into humanity and creation, where humans have created humans and those humans are aggressors against their creators. Man, beast, and robot are mixed and only divided by social taboos and product numbers, only that doesn't necessarily make the humans much different either considering how literally crushed they are by industry and advertising ever flashing through the streets in neon signs.<br/><br/>The story arch follows Deckard as he is forced unwillingly into hunting down the escaped replicants and slowly finds all roles reversed, both of the hunt and of the status. As he falls in love with the replicant Rachel, Deckard is forced to hide her from the very people he works for just as much as he's forced to pass their judgement on people whose only crime is the desire to live. Such poetic exposition is not realized through the human characters; their actions are too mechanic and bland that they nearly seem invisible. It's realized in the replicants, who desire, love, feel, and hurt.<br/><br/>This is an awesome and powerful look into what it means to be human and God. Both the stylistic elements and the craftsmanship of this film work together perfectly to create an atmosphere often attempted but never as fully realized in this distinct and important film. It's a must for all lovers of cinema to experience at least once, and hopefully see again and again and again.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"Phil9","10","1","3","5 October 2005"," Why do Directors dream of Director Cuts?
","Blade Runner has become one of the real classics which is more and more difficult because studios, producer and directors are often willing to sacrifice good ideas on the altar of ""fast money"" like done with Matrix. So we have to be grateful that there is no ""Blade Runner II"" or ""The return of BR"" that devalues this great film. BR's DC is a rare example for a film that seems to be better understood by the producers than the director in terms of viewer's needs. It's not only because I'm used to the original version of Blade Runner that I think Ridley Scott made a mistake with the new version. Ford's off voice may not be essential, but for first time ""Blade Runner's"" it is helpful for understanding what the film is about without explaining too much. I think director and fans tend to forget that. In my opinion The additional scenes are needless and annoying. The scenes totally destroy the pleasure of discovering all the subtle hints for Deckard may being a replicant that can be found in the original version. I prefer to think by myself rather than being hit with the filmmakers message. It is an example of a trend in Hollywood's film-making: explain everything only to be sure that even the last one gets the message. Some things are much more striking and of course more interesting if not said explicitly - but for that you need a little more faith in your audience. It's too bad that Scott lost that with the DC. Even the new ending isn't better at all, since the original ending wasn't really a happy ending with the uncertain how much time is left for them. Original version 10 of 10 Director's cut 7 of 10"

His final lines will remain in the history of cinema forever: ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.

","Blade Runner is not your day-to-day science-fiction movie filled with action sequences or aliens. Its a slow burning nightmarish depiction of what we may encounter in future on our path of technological advancement. Frankly speaking, I felt totally bored by its first half where nothing much happens. But the same was build up to the one best endings I have ever seen for any movie(talking about the final cut of the film).The message it tries to convey is very deep and philosophical which sometimes may not be understood in one viewing. The second time you see it, you are well aware of the pacing so you can indulge in the beauty of the film(more or less like viewing 2001: A Space Odyssey).<br/><br/>Harrison Ford plays Deckard who is a Blade Runner. Blade Runner is a guy who hunts Replicants. Now Replicants which were clones created for working as slaves by a conglomerate called Tyrell Corporation. But later they are outlawed on Earth due to their tendency towards violence. Now some 4 replicants have made it to LA in pursuit of their creator and its Deckard's task to 'retire' them.<br/><br/>Well the best thing about the movie is not its plot or story but the visuals. The dark and gloomy portrayal of the LA city is quite haunting. Makes you immediately think of our imminent future.The cinematography is top-notch. Also the questions it raise about humanity are golden, such as the meaning being a human , our resistance to our imminent death, can we be so technologically advanced that we can defy the laws of nature and so on.This is what pure sci-fi movies should be about generating thoughts and questions in our minds.The music by Vangelis adds remarkably to the haunting experience the film gives. Among the performances Harrison Ford does justice to his role of Blade Runner a character who slowly starts to understand what it is like to be replicant. The best performance is by Rutger Hauer playing Roy Batty the leader of the escaped replicants. A scene involving him and Deckard towards the end is one of the most heart-touching moments ever portrayed in movies.<br/><br/>If you do not like the movie on your first view better suggest watch it again knowing what the movie is about and is trying to say. Also I would recommend the final cut of the film. Right now, this is my favorite science-fiction movie till date (yes, I prefer it more over the ambiguous and long 2001).

Originally in retirement, he is forced to re-enter the force when six replicants escape from an offworld colony to Earth.<br/><br/>I watched this movie with an expectation. A high expectation. A really high one. I heard such words like ""classic,"" ""amazing,"" and ""brilliant."" I also watched this movie with a mindset. In my mind, I intended this film to be an action thriller type of film. Well, when I saw the movie, I hated it.<br/><br/>It's probably those two reasons why I didn't like it. I found it so dull, boring, and slow-paced -- really not what I have intended in mind. The whole film felt like an art piece instead of a movie. It's like a BS message type film, as if it was ""robots have feelings too"" type of message.<br/><br/>This film isn't for everyone. You'll either love it or hate it and I really hated it. Some will admire it as an excellent piece of art while others will hate it for not explaining much and leaving everything ambiguous and opened. Well, I will praise this film for the excellent look and visual effects, but that's about it. I really did not get what the point of the film was. It went all over the place.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford's performance was also a let down. Expecting this to be an action film, I expected Ford to be an action hero, as he is always portrayed in action films he starred in. However, his character in here is old, retired, and just not into anymore action. Sheesh! Watch it if you want to but I will say that people who would like to see a film that has a resolution in the end with a coherent story to not expect much from this. As for others, enjoy the visuals."

A.I. had much better acting, and when it comes to the story it explored the concept of ""human"" much better.<br/><br/>In this future, there are flying cars, androids with 4 year life spans, and Harrison Ford. While all three could be in the future, it isn't very likely right now. And the worst part is, the weapons aren't even as cool as Star Wars.<br/><br/>Ford falls for an android, but a special one. Will he have android future? Possible. But I know that those children will probably want a career. And I don't think that is worth it.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is sub par.

","Blade Runner is a decent atmospheric movie with good music. The pacing is slow and while I thought that it was fitting for this kind of movie some other viewers might find it too much.<br/><br/>The story is basically about a cop that is tasked with hunting replicants (kind of androids) who are trying to find a way to survive their ""death date"". Neither the plot for the hunt nor the plot for their survival are very well developed or captivating. Another big aspect is character development which is fairly poor for this movie.<br/><br/>The movie does raise some interesting questions about existence so I can see a type of viewer getting excited about it and giving it a good rating.

","I thought blade runner(1982) was a well thought out film,and I see how this film was ground breaking at time of release but now this film confused me I did not know much of what was occurring during the film which was frustrating to me. The story is told all through and through there are no major flashbacks that I could remember seeing but that kinda sets into the confusion on my part I as a movie watcher prefer a little call back than scrolling at the beginning. I know you could say the same about Star wars but those movies were immediate action and drew you in this movie did not really do that for me. The setting is very future there are a lot of very weird wonky odd things occurring in the movie. Different shots were used to convey all sorts of different things in the film and they did a great job with that and how they used camera angles to their advantage. This movie was something I came into with an open mind but really couldn't gather everything it conveyed but I tried my hardest to. I enjoyed the movie but not as the plot tried to put it out to me. The costumes and the settings and everything they built was very cool and gave off a great vibe I loved the way the directors made everything work. The acting was very good I have no problem with any of that I thought it was very good and very thought out. I know I've gone back to this a lot in this review but the movie was confusing for me that may be because I watched it in class with a lot of talking but that's not usually how things occur in movies for me but maybe i need to open my mind for this movie and take deeper thought into it. This film was very very very ahead of it's time which I really respect about it and makes me like it a little more."

","Excellent movie. I'm a huge fan of Blade Runner and this movie doesn't disappoint. Such emotional! Awesome! Bravo! Well written script, excelsior photography, awesome soundtrack (although i missed Vangelis, he really missed it). Watch this movie! I recommend it! But attention: watch it quiet, unhurried, unworried, healthy and rested. <br/><br/>Don't expect a movie full of twists and action all the time. Blade Runner requires ATTENTION, reflection, immersion, and philosophy about existentialism.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS FINAL'S SCENE EXPLAIN*<br/><br/>When Roy cries in the rain we can realize this: we don't see his tears, because the rain hides it. However we KNOW he is crying (a masterpiece subliminal scene). This scene reveals Roy's frustration and reveals that Time (or Death) actually destroyed all the experiences he lived (real or not), but importants for him by losting them, attributing insignificance to them.<br/><br/>On another hand at the same scene the movie cut to the Deckard's face and what we see? Deckard's crying in the rain, but WE CAN SEE his tears highlighted. This time, the rain don't hide the tears. Why? Because this moment won't be lost in time, unlike Roy said. Because Deckard learned with Roy the meaning of what is be human, and what is the valor of life. In other words, Roy and his lesson won't be lost in time. He will be remembered forever, in one way or another.<br/><br/>Now, when i saw the last Blade Runner 2049' scene, i've confirmed that theory (what made me cry): Joe (Agent K) laid down on the stairs, ""Crying in the Snow"". The snow represents the peace and calm with himself, but once more the movie show us his frustrate tears highlighted. WE CAN SEE his tears. Why? Joe, despite sadness and frustration, DIES KNOWING HE WILL BE REMEMBERED, unlike Roy, because he did (willingly, free of chains) the right (and relevant) thing by saving Deckard's life and providing the meeting with his daughter. In other words, these tears won't be lost in time, like tears in snow.<br/><br/>So, both Roy and Joe, died doing the right thing that has eternalized in the world, unleashing important events, so that they will never be lost. The difference is that Roy died thinking that he and his actions (and memories) would be forgotten, while Joe don't.﻿"

","Ridley Scott directed the adaptation of Philip K Dick's novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.' Scott called it Blade Runner and had a dark dank rain-soaked setting of a futuristic LA of 2019.<br/><br/>Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is called out of retirement to take out four Replicants, fugitive robots led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) who want to find their creator and get him to expand their lifespan.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott managed to capture a vision of a future that was regarded as too depressing at the time of the film's release. It was a film noir future that was accompanied by a moody jazz soundtrack. It had top notch visual effects and model work, some 1940s influenced set, costume and art direction. The use of lighting at times was exceptional.<br/><br/>In fact Ridley Scott's vision inspired a whole heap of filmmakers who wanted to make a grungy sci-fi film set in the future.<br/><br/>The film was at times a detective story with a narration by Ford, it had some strong violence such as when Deckard chases a female replicant, shoots her down and she crashes through plate glass windows. Then there is the fight scene between Batty and Deckard with Batty easily being the more stronger.<br/><br/>Yet the film is also a puzzle about identity, Deckard hunts out replicants who are physically indistinguishable from humans but then advanced replicants are created such as Rachael (Sean Young) who do not even realise they are cyborgs. In one of the director's cuts we are led to question Deckard's own identity because of an inserted dream sequence of an unicorn.<br/><br/>The film has a hauntingly scary and magnetic performance from Rutger Hauer, Sean Young is beautiful dressed up like a femme fatale. Ford is rather subdued compared to his more famous roles of Indiana Jones and Han Solo but in retrospect he pitched it just right."
"Cameronius_113","8","1","4","1 February 2017"," One of the greatest sci-fi films
","WARNING: Spoilers will be necessary in the main review for me to talk about this movie in the amount of detail I want to. Final verdict will have spoiler-free conclusion NOTE: I watched the Final Cut of the film, the official director's cut of the film which is what the director considers to be the 'complete' film.<br/><br/>Blade Runner was released in 1982 and was directed by Ridley Scott. It is about Rick Deckard, a 'Blade Runner' (kind of a policeman), who is assigned to terminate some Replicants (workers on an outer space mining colony) who have escaped from their post and reached Earth. This is often called one of the greatest science-fiction movies ever made and that is definitely for good reason. Preparing for this film, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw on-screen.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly the best thing about this film is the theme that it explores and one that is likely to stay relevant for much time in real life; what human life really is. Most of us just take our life for granted as it is just what we have expected to be there for our entire lives so we never really question it or take a deeper look into it. This movie expresses the theme of what human life means very well as it explains it from the point of view of beings who aren't lucky enough to have that life (the Replicants) and the reason the audience now see it as so important is because it is expressed from that certain viewpoint.<br/><br/>The visuals are a big thing in this film and they are absolutely stunning and they remain some of the best I have ever seen in a film (along with 2001: A Space Odyssey). The colour and design choices help create an amazing landscape and adds a dark feel to the place too. I also believe that the visuals aren't just there just because they can but they also do add something to the movie too; the characters of the Replicants all simply want a human life and the beautiful look of all of the locations simply adds to their desires so therefore I think that the visuals add lots of extra effect to the film, not just for the viewer but also for the story and themes.<br/><br/>I find the Replicants themselves, Roy Batty (the main antagonist) in particular, to be the most interesting part of the film as I haven't seen any other characters like them in a film before. Instead of just being plain greedy and power-hungry villains, they only want the things they are after because they believe that they don't have a fair lifestyle compared to the humans and that they were only created for slavery. You can also see how hurt they are too, like in the scene where a Replicant is asked about his mother which agitates him as he has no mother and just simply wants one like every other human. The scene in the film that stood out to me the most was when Batty saves Deckard's life just so he can teach him the value of life and that he shouldn't waste what he has and the death of Batty's character that occurs afterwards was effective as the audience now felt for his character more than any of the actual humans because he had expressed his viewpoints well.<br/><br/>One of the biggest debates about this film and a question left at the end is if Rick Deckard, the main protagonist, is a Replicant or not. This was kind of left ambiguous at the end and I guess that was the final result after many people on the movie were debating whether he was human or not. I'm intrigued to see what the sequel does with this plot line and if it'll answer it or keep it ambiguous. If Deckard does turn out to be a Replicant then there'll be a lot of explaining to do.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a great film and definitely one of the greatest science-fiction films ever made in my opinion, with an interesting and effective theme and also many other things such as the visuals which aren't just thrown in there for the audience's delight but also for the characters too. I would highly recommend this film.<br/><br/>8.3/10"
"hellraiser7","10","1","4","2 March 2016"," Soul Searching
","This film is my favorite film of all time (and for the record on my birth year), based on one of my favorite books of all time by one of my favorite author's Philip K Dick. The film also had a universal appeal as it has inspired lots of TV shows (Ghost in the Shell, Batman Beyond, Exo Squad, Phantom 2040, Battlestar Galatica, etc.) and other things. But also changed the way we saw sci-fi, showing how much more it can be.<br/><br/>The production value is just fantastic because it's all practically. The city landscape is just awe inspiring along with the cinematography of it. From the very beginning with the music, once we saw that city I knew we've been transported to the future and I just didn't want to leave as there is just so much to see and take in. From the hover cars (still wonder about the traffic laws in air traffic), the big flat screen displays, the scanner screen in which you can speak out coordinates for the screen to zoom in. I really like the use of the lighting, from the amount of grit and darkness making the world not just feel accessible but also giving the film the noir feel. The futuristic city feels plausible and I personally feel with some of the technology we have now we're starting to get very close.<br/><br/>Music score is just beautiful, I love how it's orchastratic but also a bit of techno beat which sort of fits the film and the world that it's in.<br/><br/>But I just really love the story it is so rich with content that it would literally take more than one watch just to uncover more. It's not so much just a simple detective story but really just like most to all of Philp K Dick's works are really sort of an extensential philosophical meditation on the subjects like life and death as well as what is human? The characters are great, it's true not the deepest characters but sometimes characters we don't know too much about I find more interesting than ones we know everything about. And also what's really interesting is the fact that there are really any good guys and bad guys their all kinda in a gray area which was for it's time sort of rare.<br/><br/>Richard Decard this is believe it or not my second favorite role from one of my favorite actors Harrison Ford, because the character he plays isn't really a hero but most of all human. He's a guy that is sort of broken and haunted by his career that he at first didn't choose to question until now, and just like the rain the guilt is weighing down on him and not stopping.<br/><br/>In a way most of this film is really about Richard regaining his own sense of humanity. This guy was literally from my observations an all business type, it can be a really sad lifestyle because it's a rather two dimensional existence; it's simply a lifestyle but not really a life. We kind of see it from his apartment which doesn't really have much to anything, just some random stuff but no real sense of an identity.<br/><br/>It's until Richard starts to have a relationship with the replicant Rachel, we see him become more balanced. I really like how it's handled, it feels realistic from the way they interact as we see both of them are trying to get a read on one another and warm up. I even like the Rachel has that look and mannerism like most women in the noir genre whom can be helpful but also carry a sense of mystery attached to them.<br/><br/>Roy Batty is played well by another favorite actor of mine Ruger Hauwer whom is an antagonist (well sort of) that you actually sort of feel a sense of pathos for even sort of side with (I said sort of). Roy isn't a Replicant that wants to do take revenge on all mankind cliché. This is a guy that is trying to put more time in his biological clock.<br/><br/>Some of the things he says are great, I really like it when he states and questions with slight frustration and fear why they weren't built to last. That's the kind of questions that we ask, whether were of a faith or not; and to this day still have no answer.<br/><br/>There is an interesting dichotomous relationship between both the humans and the replicates. As we see most of the human have allowed themselves to be less human and the replicates are becoming a bit more human. However we also see the parallels between both human and Replicants, just as the Replicants are looking for more time to live but are also constantly fascinated in their experience with our culture is just like our own common struggle to live life to the fullest and also somehow give ourselves a few more years to live, so we can experience more.<br/><br/>But also we find ourselves questioning things, I really like how there is this revolving notion on Richard Decard possibly being a Replicant and there are some suttle hints. Like one interesting moment was when we saw the eye lights on Richard for two seconds it's easy to miss. The thing is each of the Replicants all have one signature where their eye pupils have light. It sort of makes sense as to why he's so good at tracking Replicants down. I don't know whether Richard is a Replicant or not, I leave that for your own judgment but then again does it really matter.<br/><br/>Decakard is searching for his human soul, just as we are searching for our own.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"

"robsta23","7","1","4","24 April 2015"," Mediocre Movie with a Great Third Act
","My opinion of a film usually relies heavily on the conclusion of the film. My favorite movie, Pulp Fiction, has a stunning and nearly mind-blowing ending. The same goes for other films I love such as Psycho, Memento, The Prestige, and It's a Wonderful Life. But when I read Blade Runner I read it as a boring movie with a great ending which gives the film great meaning. I haven't seen the theatrical version, but I have seen clips of it, and I think the voice-overs by Deckard take away from the film even more. While the noir film usually relies on narration, this film is fine with this aspect taken away, leaving Deckard's thoughts more ambiguous to us as an audience.<br/><br/>I have to admit I think the concept of the film is intriguing. We learn with the help of text at the film's opening that replicants have been created as slaves, but since they are intelligent they have turned on their creators. The title of the film refers to those who are meant to ""retire"" these replicants.<br/><br/>The mise-en-scene of the film has a Gothic quality to it which really leaves me with an unpleasant taste in my mouth. It fits into the noir aspect of the film since it is so dark, but it also has a really creepy quality to it which the film does not need. In scenes revolving around Sebastian, the man creates these ""friends"" for himself, these living puppets in a sense, which underscores the motif in the film of playing God, or creating life. The replicant Pris seems to blend in with these creations since she looks otherworldly, with white makeup covering her face, black around the eyes, hair almost as light as her makeup. It's like she is from the circus, which does not belong in a movie revolving around city life.<br/><br/>Perhaps the mise-en-scene will grow on me over time; I hated it on first viewing, but I realize it adds to the dark tone of the movie and is fitting. In a final fight between the Blade Runner and Roy, Roy shows compassion and helps Deckard to live since he is about to die, but we have no idea when Roy is meant to die, just that his life is running out due to a four year lifespan. While he gives a brilliant monologue, Roy dies with no preparation for the audience. We might have viewed Roy with more empathy if we knew he was going to die in a matter of minutes, but it is still a powerful death.<br/><br/>The movie has a brilliant ending in which an origami unicorn is placed in Deckard's place. It is said that replicants have built-in memories, and earlier in the film he dreams of a unicorn. The cop knowing about the unicorn suggests that Deckard is perhaps a replicant himself, which is a brilliant ending which gives the film a whole new meaning."
"Red-Barracuda","7","1","4","20 April 2015"," Stylish and thoughtful tech-noir
","Like another film from 1982, John Carpenter's The Thing, Blade Runner surprisingly failed critically and commercially on release, only to go on to amass a cult following and subsequently to finally attain actual classic status within the genre. Based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Phillip K Dick, this was director Ridley Scott's second sci-fi film after Alien (1979). It's set in L.A. of 2019, which is now a polluted dystopia full of huge overbearing billboards and enormous skyscraper blocks that resemble Mayan temples. The heavy clouds and constant rain ensure that all events play out in a constant darkness. In this future there are advanced androids called replicants, which are used for dangerous activities such as off-world colonisations. A rogue group of these machines rebel and return to earth with deadly intent. A detective who specialises in assassinating them - a blade runner - is given the task of seeking and 'retiring' them.<br/><br/>The specific combination of a world in permanent darkness and a detective storyline featuring a world-weary policeman results in perhaps the ultimate example of tech-noir, which is a combination of science fiction with the feel of traditional film noir mysteries. The very original production design used to construct this future world is probably the single most notable feature of the film and is what defines it. Both the cityscapes and the retro-styled interiors are very well conceived and delivered. The script and acting are both good too with Harrison Ford perfectly cast in the lead role and Rutger Hauer never better as the lead android; we also have a very memorable turn from Daryl Hannah as a pleasure model replicant. Rounding things off is a famous synth score from Vangelis; unfortunately, the film only features the brilliant main theme in the final credits.<br/><br/>There have been three different cuts of the movie over the years. I saw the original one several years ago and have recently seen the 'Final Cut' (I never saw the 'Director's Cut'). There are quite a lot of amendments in this last version but the main one that people remember mostly is the ending in which an earlier unicorn dream and origami model are used subtly to suggest that the protagonist is a replicant himself. The ending is certainly darker than the original one but not without hope, after all the message of the film is an ironic one in that it is suggested that it is only the replicants who experience true living in this world. Human drudgery on earth is nothing compared to what these androids experience in their shorter lifespan. So when Ford's character exits at the end knowing his true nature, he realises that he may in actual fact be the fortunate one."

","Influence, upon influence, upon influence. That is what Ridley Scott has gave ""and will"" give generations of future film-makers with his magnum opus, ""BLADE RUNNER"". Credited personally by Ridley himself as the best film he ever did, I don't even know where to begin writing a review on this. The man just finished the behemoth that is ""Alien"" (1979), and proves he still had a lot more to offer the science fiction genre. Like Alejandero Jodorowsky before him, failure to get an adaptation of Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" going, made him sign on to work on this masterpiece.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, here's what your missing. Futuristic city visuals set in a dirty, smoke ridden Los Angeles, Androids i.e. ""Replicants"" in the form of a young Daryl Hannah, and a career best from Rutger Hauer. Stellar action scenes evoking classic Film-Noir, and possibly my favourite of all Harrison Ford performances (""Raiders"" is my favourite film & Han Solo is my favourite smuggler, but in this role he finally gives us a gruff detective persona that fits well within what he's capable of).<br/><br/>The film itself gets very philosophical. The entire narrative derives heavily from the classic Phillip K. Dick novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"", which I've read and adored. But even doing so the film questions who is & isn't human, a class system of sorts, what is a human made of via. depth and mind and is our hero a replicant himself? Questions that come off less preachy and more profound towards the movies conclusion. Though I found it very complex first time around, future showings had lifted the smoke around the movie to reveal one of the best cinematic experiences around. But I cannot not mention that I saw the ""Directors Cut"" first, then the ""Final Cut"" (2007 - a gorgeous restoration). I have the big collectors box set, and must get round to the following versions.<br/><br/>Other than that, everything about it looks like it jumped out of an illustration. Vangelis music makes everything grand especially in the hallway of mirrors, and final moments on top of rooftops and final soliloquies have gone on to become immortalised in cinema.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 10/10. A stunning piece that will remain timeless. However, I really am not looking forward to the sequel in production."

","Well, it's time to move out of Southern California for, in SEVEN years, it's gonna be one hell of a hellhole and not a single owl in existence!<br/><br/>The gorgeously shot Blade Runner shows a future just shy of 37 years (at the time of release) that ""might"" have happened considering the technology progressions back then. But, in reality, maybe these ""advancements"" in technology everyone's so worried about isn't moving as fast as everyone fears. Hell, our hero, Rick Deckard, lives on the 97th floor in his apartment building – which isn't the top floor, and I do not believe there to be a building that size yet erected in L.A., let alone in the process now, in 2012, that would take probably more than 7 years. Oh and there are more buildings just like that one. And half-as-tall, fire breathing pipes!<br/><br/>I digressthis was a fantastic movie, filled with unique characters, grand sets/designs, a fairly decent score, wonderful cinematography and deep characters – especially, but not limited to, Sean Young, who is NOT a favorite of mine, but probably did the best job of all actors in this movie. Sadly, I avoided watching this movie my whole live – its 30th Anniversary is in less than a month – because after two attempts, I ""felt it was too slow and dark"" and turned it off 15-20 minutes in.<br/><br/>Well, that was my right, but I'm glad I acknowledged the fact it is, as it is, a slow burner, and that I could move forward to an extraordinary looking and good story.<br/><br/>Ricky boy, better known to most as Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a ""kind of"" ex-cop, or Blade Runner, brought back into the line of duty – isn't every retired cop in movies? – to trace and find five rogue replicants (of humans) because they're outlawed on Earth in the far-distant future of 2019. Lucky for him, these angry robots don't really have any super-powers, aside from being immune to both hot and cold and they're sorta stronger and they're just as bright as humans are.<br/><br/>Of course, the story takes turns, gets complicated and we learn a bunch along the way. And as mentioned, it's a deliberately paced film, so sit back and enjoy both the film noir story unfold and the fantastic shots, both aerial and in new/old buildings.<br/><br/>As beautiful as the cinematography and crisp and original as the designs, sets, locations and ideas, sadly the monitors took me back a bit. I had to laugh a bit, because for all they came up with: the flying cars, the space colonies – oh, I forgot to mention that, they're pulling an Aliens before The Company did – and of course, the replicated humans, themselves, no way they could've made any of that using the computers/monitors displayed in the movie that probably heated up too much when PONG was played.<br/><br/>YES – I know, that's not a flaw, in fact, that was all they had back then, well, those ""state of the 1982 art"" monitors and little patience on imagining what the future computer screens might look like. Heck, if my argument was valid, Director Scott's own Alien ship, the Nostromo, 3-years prior, may never have left the dock considering their monitors were even less sophisticated. So, I wouldn't downgrade the movie for that, I just thought it was funny.<br/><br/>At its core, it's the grand tradition of detective stories, it's a 1940's private dick plot set in the future. For 99% of the graphics and ideas, this movie was far ahead of its time 30-years ago and is highly recommended for anyone who hasn't seen it.<br/><br/>(SPOILER ALERT – do NOT read on without having seeing the movie) On a side note, I was a tad bit confused with the ending – and I'm not referring to the odd cat & mouse chase scene where our ""villain"" strips to his skivvies following him kissing a man on the lips in the segment prior. No, I mean, some idiot person I knew many moons ago spoiled the ""secret"" of who Deckard really was. Since the movie, itself, was left wide open for interpretation, I chose NOT believe my person's take, especially after my research following the film. The original author, Phillip K. Dick, did not make Deckard a replicant and therefore, despite all other theorist's ideas and blatant clues left by Director Scott throughout, I chose to believe Dick. (No Pun.)"
"Mackiatoe","10","1","4","2 January 2013"," More than just a Sci-Fi classic
","It's hard to say just how much I love this film. After I first watched it, I found it a very confusing film that, to me, wasn't that good. But then, after thinking about it for a while, it all makes sense, and comes together. This is a film you having to watch twice - and films you have to watch twice are always good.<br/><br/>What Ridley Scott has created here is a believable, stunning and dark portrayal of the future. Keep in mind that the buildings in most of the film were not done with CGI, but were real models. For something that doesn't use CGI this is truly an achievement - and this was done in 1982.<br/><br/>The characters are, after a second viewing, easy to empathise with and develop incredibly well as the story goes on. While for some there isn't much character development, I would say that actually for the experience of the film it's not necessary. Most of these characters are replicants, by the way - they don't have much of a life anyway.<br/><br/>as for the story, this is where many give up. It's slow, basic, yet it works so well in the setting created. It gives the viewer time to think and work out everything, and for many (including me) you'll need that! Most Sci-Fi films of today's age are way to quick. They're certainly good, but few really have the power and emotion that this film delivers.<br/><br/>Talking of power and emotion, there is one big reason why this film is so good - it leaves you questioning. Films that literally have an affect on you (The Matrix or Inception are other good examples) are hard to pull off, but here it is done seemingly. You are blasted with subliminal messages throughout the film - don't worry, not bad ones. They are far, far more realistic, such us where the most common person is from (China, hint hint), who is advertising and how, who is living on the streets and who is booming, class gaps, wealth and so on. Ridley doesn't doesn't just produce an amazing film, he produces a stunning, realistic world that, in some parts of this world, doesn't actually seem hat far off. This film is more than just a story. It's incredible because in the space of 2 hours, we see a dark, grimy future and a retired cop, doing one last job, being put through a tough job in a huge city, that actually has a mental affect on you. What those affects are, is up to you - and that is another reason why this film is so good. It doesn't give opinions on itself, it generates individual ones. Compare the opinions of die-hard fans and they'll all come up with something different. In conclusion then, this is an incredible film that has really redefined it's genre, and redefined a whole sci-fi community with just how clever, realistic and powerful this film is. if you love sci-fi you have to watch this. Probably twice though.<br/><br/>10/10"
"saymonja","7","1","4","1 December 2012"," Not perfect, but outstanding sci-fi adaptation
","For whatever reason, its taken me 34 years to make it through this film. This one of those ""must sees"" during college, from that generation during which the big budget sci-fi epic was coming into its own on the screen. I'd always known this was part of some upper tier of sci-fi filmmaking, along with Brazil, the unfortunate yet still intriguing Dune, and later on, City of Lost Children (and plenty of other things I've since forgotten. You know, short term memory was decimated in my 20s). This is the tier of films made by filmmakers, vs. film studios, Hollywood types and hacks--which were still enjoyable on some other level, but I'm sure I'd have hated films like my beloved Star Wars, had it come out while I was an adult--these films where, yes, there are some arresting visuals, a few, ahem, borrowed plot devices, and lots of whimsical entertainment value, along with loads of tired clichés that really offer us nothing more than entertainment--which is fine when you're six, and maybe beyond. <br/><br/>I was always afraid that Blade Runner just kind of straddled this line between eye-candy and artistry. Plus, I was always watching these films, in college. You know how that goes. You're in some burned bro's dorm room eating pizza, and he's like, ""bro, you HAVEN'T SEEN this sci-fi epic/anime/Lebowski? DUDE. Hey, are you gonna pass that thing or not, bro?"" This never led to a true appreciation for cinema in one evening. <br/><br/>So, here I am, 15 years later, sober in my mom's basement, like any good liberal arts student. At first, I'm a bit apprehensive. The synthesizers come in, and I immediately scrunch my face up. Oh, poor sci fi synths...still doomed to be an indicator of the short sited 1980's and its desire to seem as future-y as possible, in a New Wavy kind of way. Hell, that Roy guy could have been Sting (so glad he wasn't). And then there's Rachael's New Wave meets 1940's noir look, which took me a minute to process. However, I stuck with this film this time--and part of the reason was that I was finally watching this on a wide screen, which makes all of the difference. The 3 other times I watched this were on older televisions, with that boxy whatever you call it ratio that ruined so many films in their transition to VHS, before we decided that lopping off a 3rd of the picture from sight was sort of insane, like putting your hand over Venus de Milo's head and saying, ""oh yeah, I guess that's impressive or something"". The visual elements to this film are exceptional, in that they still amaze, and clearly set the groundwork for the next 30 years of sci-fi aesthetics. <br/><br/>And the longer you stick with this film, through the pseudo-noir stuff (luckily this version lacked the much maligned narration--boo-hoo, I had to actually pay attention the whole time, rather than have everything spelled out for me, confusing as it was, at times), the more you will find it to be deeply affecting and poignant in its philosophizing. Of course, knowing this was a story by Philip K. Dick (whom I haven't read much of but really have enjoyed), I went into this film with a certain amount of expectations, concerning the ""intelligence"" of this movie. And this is one of the slippery slopes of sci-fi film adaptations: how the hell do you cram all of these aspects into 90-120 minutes, without either treating the audience as imbeciles and filling in all of the details via narration or a scrolling text prelude, or worse, omitting some of the very themes and ideas that make the original work enjoyable and important. Obviously, Dune failed miserably (though I thought the aesthetics were everything I'd imagined while reading the novels). I can't attest to Blade Runner vs. Do Androids Dream..., but I can say it was affecting as a stand alone work. I had horrible fears about some of the actors, particularly Roy, who just looks like an 80's cliché, yet in the second half of his film, where the emotional plights of ALL of the characters are really fleshed out in surprising detail for this kind of film, I was completely drawn in. There is enough emotional intelligence in this film that I was surprised that it came out of Hollywood! And I really haven't liked anything else Ridley Scott has done. And I wonder what Scorcese's planned version, if done in the 70's would have looked like! That aside, I'm glad I watched this movie, and without spoilers, I'll say that I was so pleasantly surprised by every facet of this film. Aside from those terrible synthesizers...I mean, they had her playing that melancholic bit on the piano, right during an emotionally tense part...yet they smear those awful synthesizers over it, and almost steer the whole thing into Hollywood melodrama..almost!"
"ElMaruecan82","10","1","4","19 November 2012"," As philosophically significant as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" ...
","Ridley Scott recreates a cyberpunk dystopia with the same meticulous craftsmanship than Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" and the alienating technology of the urban landscape is so dazzling that each single frame has a magical hypnotic effect, making ""Blade Runner"" one of the few critically untouchable films on the simple basis of their artistry. <br/><br/>Indeed, for a genre that relies on pure extrapolation in space and time, ""Blade Runner"" is an iconic reference for both directors and art-designers, yet there's much more insightful themes to be covered. Through cloning, robots and extra-terrestrial expansion, Sci-Fi vehicles humanity's most existential quest: immortality, humans' control on their own creations or how much of God can they ever be. On that level, ""Blade Runner"" is as philosophically significant as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". <br/><br/>And like Kubrick's masterpiece, it's no surprise that ""Blade Runner"" was also criticized for the slow pacing and relative absence of a plot. Speaking of my own experience, I didn't watch the theatrical version; I read that the voice-over narration was removed, so I can only judge on the basis of the Director's cut. However, remember my first feeling: as much as I loved the design, the artistic achievement, I was bored by the story and the lack of emotional connection between the characters. But I respected the film and its iconic status; I knew I couldn't dissociate the plot from the visuals since the action-less parts were clearly meant to be more introspective. After a third viewer, rather than an action-packed thriller, I see ""Blade Runner"" as a meaningful examination of our own condition through the antagonism between humans and Replicants.<br/><br/>The film opens with a written introduction, less stylish than ""Star Wars"" but much more promising. It sets the action is Los Angeles, in 2019, where a powerful Corporation named from its head, Dr Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel), created a highly advanced form of engineered robots, equal in force and intelligence as any human being, known as Replicants, whose purpose was to contribute to the off-world colonization. But four of them rebelled and slaughtered all their vessel's occupants and came back to the Earth, where their presence is forbidden. The mission of the Blade Runner is to (as they say in their jargon), 'retire' them. The genius of the story is to use a plot of epic scope and instead of crossover between ""Westworld"" and ""War of the Worlds"" offers a darker and more minimalist tone, since only four Replicants are targets, still enough to root them in cinematic legend, each one unforgettable, each one perfectly casted.<br/><br/>The Replicants are Pris (Daryl Hannah), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Leon (Brion James) and the leader and closest to perfection in his Aryan-like appearance is the emblematic Roy Batty (Ruthger Hauer). Leon is the first to appear during the infamous Voight-Kampff test: a series of questions meant to detect Replicants' flaws in the eyes. Although the eye-symbolism is omnipresent as eye is considered as the window of the soul, Ridley Scott doesn't regard the Replicants as soulless creatures. Tyrell's beautiful assistant, Rachael, played by a beautiful Sean Young as a dark femme-fatale, is the only self-ignoring Replicant since she was given an artificial memory materialized through a series of photographs in order to comfort her in that illusion. Rachael embodies the illusive Schumpeterian aspect of life, as a series of representations, something that only exists through our knowledge and stop when we are not. Is life only a dream, and we wake up when we die?<br/><br/>The film follows the investigation of Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard, and the long quiet moments are invitations to meditate on these Replicants' conditions, and how different they are, from us. Ford is a good choice because he's precisely the kind of actors who doesn't need much to say or to do, to keep our eyes focused. Through Deckard, it's a whole universe we discover, the triumph of Asia over the world, the over-urban culture, but the soul of the film, belongs to one of the most cinematic villains: Roy Batty. Through his desire to be programed for a longer life, he represents our fight for immortality, our nihilistic escape from a certain death. Tyrell, like God, created men on his own image, but after being told that he couldn't live longer, Batty rejected the God that gave him life and pierced his eyes in one of the most brutal killings from any film. Batty stands for our rejection of God's gift for the gift of life has no value if it's meant to finish.<br/><br/>Eyes are the windows of Batty's soul, many of these lines start with ""If you could see what I saw"", as a desperate need for immortality through the posterity of his own experience. This leads to the poignant climactic monologue before he dies, where he spares Deckard' life so his own death would be witnessed, then remembered. Deckard survives from the will of the villain, and in a way, it's the villain who triumphs, because he'll be remembered, and because he embodies some existential torments we can all respond to, and that carry many film noir undertones like the fatality of an existence guided by forces no one can escape from, which also applies to Rachael, and naturally, to Deckard, himself.<br/><br/>Now, is he or is he not? That is the question. What if my life started at the moment I wrote this review, with a sort of programmed memory, how could I be sure that I really lived my life. It's Zhora's snake biting his own tail  maybe the salvation relies on the present, an escape from the past and toward the future, a course between two never-existing points, that Deckard takes at the end, to join Rachael, his life or an unreachable meaning, leaving us through the iconic score of Vangelis, in our own interrogations and the feeling that there are still hidden meanings to be discovered in future viewings."
"ersinkdotcom","10","1","4","14 November 2012"," ""Blade Runner"" still one of the greatest sci-fi films of all-time
","Watching ""Blade Runner"" is an emotional investment no matter how many times you see it. I don't know if it's the lighting, the music, the dialogue, or a combination of all of the above. How a science fiction film from 1982 can still have that effect on me after seeing it dozens of times is beyond my comprehension. I always come away from the film with my insides all mixed together with sadness, excitement, and that warm feeling of happy nostalgia you get when you experience something you never thought you could again.<br/><br/>No matter what version of the movie you watch, they all tell the same story. In the year 2019, a group of organic robots called replicants kill a ship full of people while escaping an interstellar trip and head to Earth. Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is hired to hunt the fugitives down and destroy them. Deckard is what is referred to as a ""blade runner"" - a special police officer that ""retires"" replicants when they wander back to Earth where they've been banned.<br/><br/>I've seen ""Blade Runner"" in many different environments and formats. I've seen it on VHS on a 25-inch television. I had the opportunity to see it on the big-screen a couple of times at revival screenings. I've watched it on a 50-inch flat screen in a regular DVD format. I can wholeheartedly tell you that if you haven't seen this amazing piece of cinema history on Blu-ray in its restored ""Final Cut"" version then you've never properly viewed it.<br/><br/>Each version of the film has something different to add to its viewing experience. There are different endings, additional footage, and even a monologue by Harrison Ford that tells you everything you need to know (and many fans would say some things you shouldn't) to help explain what's happening throughout. I suggest watching every version of the film to truly appreciate and take it all in.<br/><br/>Douglas Trumball's special visual effects are a step beyond stunning. The use of models and practical effects gives ""Blade Runner"" a realistic look that filmmakers today using CGI only wish they could achieve. Everything from the architecture of the buildings to the designs of the vehicles still influences designers to this day."

","A blend of science fiction and noir detective fiction, Blade Runner was a box office and critical bust upon its initial exhibition, but its unique postmodern production design became hugely influential within the sci-fi genre, and the film gained a significant cult following that increased its stature. This film directed by Ridley Scott features Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, and Sean Young. The screenplay, written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, is loosely based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick.<br/><br/>It depicts a dystopian Los Angeles in November 2019 in which genetically engineered organic robots called replicants—visually indistinguishable from adult humans—are manufactured by the powerful Tyrell Corporation as well as by other ""mega–manufacturers"" around the world. Their use on Earth is banned and replicants are exclusively used for dangerous, menial or leisure work on off-world colonies. Replicants who defy the ban and return to Earth are hunted down and ""retired"" by police special operatives known as ""Blade Runners"". The plot focuses on a brutal and cunning group of recently escaped replicants hiding in Los Angeles and the burnt out expert Blade Runner, Rick Deckard, who reluctantly agrees to take on one more assignment to hunt them down.a retired cop in Los Angeles circa 2019. L.A. has become a pan-cultural dystopia of corporate advertising, pollution and flying automobiles, as well as replicants, human-like androids with short life spans built by the Tyrell Corporation for use in dangerous off-world colonization. Deckard's former job in the police department was as a talented blade runner, a euphemism for detectives that hunt down and assassinate rogue replicants. Called before his one-time superior, Deckard is forced back into active duty. A quartet of replicants led by Roy Batty has escaped and headed to Earth, killing several humans in the process. After meeting with the eccentric Eldon Tyrell, creator of the replicants, Deckard finds and eliminates Zhora, one of his targets. Attacked by another replicant, Leon, Deckard is about to be killed when he's saved by Rachael, Tyrell's assistant and a replicant who's unaware of her true nature. In the meantime, Batty and his replicant pleasure model lover, Pris use a dying inventor, J.F. Sebastian to get close to Tyrell and murder him. Deckard tracks the pair to Sebastian's, where a bloody and violent final confrontation between Deckard and Batty takes place on a skyscraper rooftop high above the city. <br/><br/>Misunderstood when it first hit theaters, the influence of Ridley Scott's mysterious, neo-noir Blade Runner has deepened with time.From the opening shot of a Los Angeles cityscape at night in the year 2019, it is clear that Scott has conjured up something special.The movie's spectacular futuristic vision of Los Angeles--a perpetually dark and rainy metropolis that's the nightmare antithesis of ""Sunny Southern California""--is still its most seductive feature, an otherworldly atmosphere in which you can immerse yourself. The movie's shadowy visual style, along with its classic private-detective/murder-mystery plot line makes it one of the few science fiction pictures to legitimately claim a place in the film noir tradition.Added to that,it's an overwhelming, immersive experience, a total creation of a possible future so complete that you don't need exposition to know how we got from here to there Overall,it is a visually remarkable, achingly human sci-fi masterpiece."

Edward James Olmos plays a mysterious detective named Gaff who speaks in a strange language that is a mixture of Spanish, French, Chinese, German, Hungarian, and Japanese called Cityspeak. Rutger Hauer plays a truth-seeking replicant named Roy Batty in a fiercely moving performance. The film's direction is flawless. The overall atmosphere of ""Blade Runner"" is astonishing. If the Director's Cut is available, I strongly recommend you watch that version instead of the original cut. The Director's Cut improved on an already great film.

"Mr-Fusion","10","1","4","28 August 2012"," Ridley Scott's timeless masterpiece
","Audiences in 1982 did not respond kindly to ""Blade Runner"". Too downbeat, too slow-moving, and not the same kind of Harrison Ford performance we all fell in love with in ""Star Wars"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Truth be told, I hated this movie, the first time I saw it. It took two and three further viewings to really appreciate what was going on here, and the movie soon became one of my all-time favorites, as a result. <br/><br/>Director Ridley Scott plunges his audience into a nightmarish vision of the not-too-distant future Los Angeles, complete with flying cars and industrialism run-amok. Other planets have been colonized for the elites, while the rest of humanity is left on Earth. The monolithic Tyrell Corporation manufactures Replicants (artificial humans that are near-indistinguishable from the real thing) , the latest version being the Nexus-6, for use on off-world jobs that are either too dangerous or unseemly for a real human. Four-year lifespans are implemented to keep the Replicants in line, and Blade Runner units (special police forces) patrol the streets to root out any infiltrating renegades. <br/><br/>Harrison Ford stars as Rick Deckard, a retired Blade Runner who's pressed into service when four Replicants (Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy and Brion James) hijack a shuttle and hide out on Earth. Their pursuit is to gain an audience with their maker, Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel). Turkel, meanwhile, has introduced a new version of the Nexus-6 in the form of Rachael, his administrative assistant (Sean Young). And Deckard finds his mission clouded as he slowly falls in love with the beautiful woman.<br/><br/>From an acting standpoint, Ford, Young and Hauer are the standouts. Ford delivers a low-key performance, brandishing his devil-may-care grin only sparingly. His portrayal of Deckard suggests a man who's trying to put all of the pieces together and make sense of it all; constantly uncertain. It's an ambiguous character (the good guy, but not so likable), and Ford truly sells it. Young really shines here, ""humanizing"" Rachael as the character faces its existential crisis. She's terrified and unstable when placed in a romantic situation and her heartbreak seems completely genuine after hearing Deckard callously drop the bombshell that she's not real. And Hauer, as the cerebral and most dangerous of the Replicants, plays up the childlike wonder of an emotionally stunted humanoid, while always keeping that lethal edge lurking underneath the surface. As good as the film's star is, Hauer absolutely steals the movie with his minute-long soliloquy at film's end. <br/><br/>Chief among the film's critical praises is its depiction of the dystopian 2019 Los Angeles; a city choking on its own technology and overpopulation. The streets swarm with all manner of ethnic varieties, all of them societal dregs (while the ones with money vacated long ago). Massive blimps float overhead touting the promise of a new life on the off-world colonies. Rain is constant, the skies are black, and foreign peoples violently mix into a salad bowl of clashing cultures, dominated by that of the Japanese (possibly the result of the early '80s concerns of Japanese takeover of L.A.). Advertizing reigns supreme, from blimps to billboards taking up the sides of skyscrapers. <br/><br/>It's a triumph of art direction, production design and cinematography. Scott has created a world that lives by its design; both repulsive and engrossing, at the same time. The streets are lit mostly by commercial neon, while interiors are lit by shafts, rays and baths of light (thanks to the brilliance of cinematographer Jordan Cronenweth). You can almost feel the steam rising from the streets and smell the grime on the payphones. No one in their right mind would want to live here, but it's the kind of place that's brimming with detail that leaves its mark; you're drawn to this vision, time and again. And let's not forget Vangelis' synth-noir music, which is less a score and more a mood exercise that wholly blends with the fabric of the overall movie's design. Total immersion, that score.<br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" polarized audiences when it was first released, mostly due to its ""leisurely"" (as Gene Siskel famously put it) pacing and murky narrative. Style over substance. And I thought the same thing, at first, but further viewings proved me wrong. There's a lot going on here under the surface, the visuals just impress and constantly bring you back for another go-around. Ultimately, ""Blade Runner"" is a movie about ideas, from slavery to mild paranoia, and (chiefly) what it means to be human. <br/><br/>It's a movie that I've seen countless times, and I'm still ready to watch it again. If it's not the vast array of textural surfaces and thematic layering, it's the performances from Ford and Hauer that prove engaging (again and again). It's less a design aesthetic, more a totally immersive world that I totally enjoy returning to. It's nothing short of impressive that the same praise bolstering ""Avatar"" is even truer of a 30 year-old film lacking any CGI. <br/><br/>10/10"
"cat_ranchero","10","1","4","27 August 2012"," Final Cut... Still great!...
","Visually stunning with a beautiful and atmospheric score by Vangelis, this film has a lot going for it (IMO). Great performances all round; Harrison Ford plays the world-weary Deckard to a tee, Rutger Hauer is excellent as the brutal but fragile Roy Batty and Sean Young plays Rachael with just the right amount of fear. Also worthy of note are; Edward James Olmos as Gaff, M. Emmet Walsh as Bryant, Daryl Hannah as Pris, William Sanderson as J.F. Sebastian, Brion James as Leon, Joe Turkel as Dr. Eldon Tyrell and Joanna Cassidy as Zhora.<br/><br/>This is the second time I have seen this particular cut of the film and I have to say I like it just as much as the 1992 Director's cut even though Ridley Scott didn't have an awful lot to do with that version.<br/><br/>A very introspective film with all the action focused on Deckard and the Replicants without the audience really seeing much outside this group. Yes there are hints; the advertising for the off-world colonies, but apart from that it's very insular. Moving on, I thought the effects were truly stunning, given that there was no CGI back then, although it has been used to enhance certain things in this cut, and the design, the look and the feel of the whole thing is superb. A world is created that the audience could easily imagine Los Angeles 2019 to be like OK, maybe not the flying cop cars, but you know what I mean.

","Of all the science fiction movies that came out in the 80s from George Lucas's Star Wars to Robert Zenekis's Back to the Future, this one seems to be of the more talked about, high rated and influential. Even 30 years after its initial release you can still feel its influence in most science fiction films to this day. The story is adapted from Philp Dick's novel Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep and it is a very loose adaptation with events and characters from the novel either changed or omitted but the film takes a creative approach to the novel giving it an art-house feel. Unfortunately most modern audiences who haven't read the book or seen the movie for the first time might be bored by its slow pacing and lack of action since it was advertised as a sci-fi action film.<br/><br/>In order to appreciate this film you have to understand the time period in which it was released. Back in the 80s sci-fi was at its peak with releases such as The Empire Strikes Back, Star Trek The Wrath of Khan, and E.T which were all box office hits at the movies with their fantasy and adventure approaches to their stories. Blade Runner on the other hand had a more unique approach with its dark and depressing depiction of the future L.A., pollution, overpopulation and Eastern culture influences with a touch of noir mixed with philosophy, a noir narration spoken by Harrison Ford and an atmospheric soundtrack by Vangelis. Not to mention Ford playing a dark anti-hero role rather than the big screen hero role that most audiences associated him with. All this led to its failure at the box office and it wouldn't be heard from again until its revival in 1993 with the release of a directors cut which the director Ridley Scott was not involved that omitted the narration and changed the ending which led to its popularity with cult audiences. In 2007 Ridley Scott returned to Blade Runner and added some clean up to the movie, added a few extra scenes and minimal CG to create his definitive edition of Blade Runner.<br/><br/>The performances in this movie are great with Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer as the standouts. The production and setting design is well done giving it a great and unique noir atmosphere which has been highly influential in most science fiction movies since then. And the action scenes are great and intense even emotional at times. As for story its both hit and miss. Its got a great and thought provoking premise and a great setting to put it in but some of the characters are underdeveloped but maybe they are supposed to be that way because of the ideas that the movie presents to the viewer of the differences between emotional man and unemotional synthetic human and what it means to be human.<br/><br/>Its a great movie but not for casual audiences who want fast paced action and adventure. Since there are multiple versions of the movie go for the Final Cut for the better experience. 9 out of 10 stars. Despite this films flaws. I never get bored with this film no matter how many times I watch it. It's that good but that's just me. You have to figure out for yourself if this is a great film or not."
"Kubris","9","1","4","9 June 2012"," The next generation of noir
","IMDb Top 250: 115<br/><br/>Note: This is a review of The Final Cut.<br/><br/>Don't be deceived by Harrison Ford's face and the bright neon signs: you will find no happiness in Blade Runner. Unapologetically draining, Blade Runner sees LA, 2019 as a packed slum of flying cars, advertisements and an especially Asian influx of culture. There is a hanging mood of decay, of uncaring, and it creates an empty feeling. Blade Runner is extraordinarily atmospheric. Also there's robots, and the robots- replicants- are a problem.<br/><br/>Thus, the blade runners were created, police force (executioners) who retire (kill) illegal replicants on Earth. Deckard is one such hunter, played by Harrison Ford in his least macho and most vulnerable major role. He returns from (is forced out of) retirement to find and terminate 4 replicants, and this task composes the plot of the film.<br/><br/>Despite the future setting, Blade Runner is an old school noir at heart, with a flawed protagonist,important setting, and menacing villains. It's the next generation of noir, both in the film and real life. <br/><br/>Both in content and aesthetically, Blade Runner is ahead of the curve. The cheese of certain 80's sci-fi is non existent here, and I'm not sure if that relates to the DVD I have or if the film is just extra gorgeous. There's a certain aura of primitive technology with films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The Terminator that just isn't in this film. The cinematography and art design is magnificent, as well as Vangelis' electronic score.<br/><br/>This serious film is filled with serious characters. Leading is the aforementioned Deckard, a victim of his city: he is constantly in a state of melancholy, and often found with a drink in his hand. He hasn't found what to do with himself, and it's so absorbing to see Ford in a weakened state. His prey, the replicants are also intriguing in their own ways: Batty, Pris and Leon. The all bring something different, a different angle. I won't even get into Batty's final, mission stating speech.<br/><br/>One of the best things about sci-fi is that it can work with material that no other genre can. Blade Runner is outrageously packed with symbols and metaphors, such as eyes and origami. The film is filled with themes and open to many interpretations. I believe that all sci-fi can be applied to the present or past, and saw this situation as a parallel to post- Civil War America and found the ultimate message being that all life is precious, and that when we die things indescribable die with us. You can't live in fear. Oh, okay... Batty's speech... it's a show stopper, short but expansive in interpretation. Easily the most important scene in the film.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is a giant in the genre, an incredibly important and influential film. It may be slow, but patience and an open mind is well rewarded. This film won't be lost to time like tears in the rain. 8.9/10"

","I have finished this epochal cult film's final cut version (not much as a rematch since it vaguely left me any impression from the very first encounter, which took place more than 10 years ago), the film hasn't dated at all for 30 years, is still sharply crafty with an astonishingly visual impetus, which is pristinely avant-garde as well as its subversive kernel about the clone ethnics.<br/><br/>BLADE RUNNER is an atypical Sci-Fi breed (loosely based on science fiction mogul Philip K. Dick's novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?""), especially among its time overlapping with STAR WARS trilogy's heyday, it turns a completely opposite aesthetic approach (the nearly all moist and dingy settings, an anti-hero and anti-villain characterization, a foredoomed fatalism spin, the grotesque costume and character moulding, parsimonious fighting sequences), which bears itself out as one of the paramount film in its genre. The film might be trapped in its lengthy narrative tempo, but every single scene is devised with a cataclysmic desperation, resembles Ridley Scott's renowned career-breaking masterpiece ALIEN (1979). <br/><br/>While Harrison Ford plays against his comfort zone as a battered ""human"" blade runner, its's Rutger Hauer's replicant Roy Batty overshadows everyone else, buoyed up the somber aura using his near hysterical interpretation of a perplexed highly-intellectual creature whose resentment and despair are so palatable and evocative. <br/><br/>The birth of the film was a notorious plight at that time, with an alienated team and financial lapse, even after its theatrical release, its flaccid box office performance sentenced the demise of its outlook, that said, it is a film ahead of its audience by many years, and now its classic rank has been established, how comforting and gratifying.<br/><br/>ps. this year Scott's much-hyped prequel of ALIEN sega, PROMETHEUS has unveiled its second trailer, which seems that Scott is back on his virtuoso trajectory, another bona fide classic is forthcoming? This summer it is a battle between PROMETHEUS and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, keeping fingers crossed it will be a win-win denouement."

","I have seen Blade Runner dozens of times and it becomes apparent that eyes are a prevalent thematic element throughout the movie. From Tyrell's owlish trifocals to Leon playing with frozen eyeballs to Pris spray-painting her eyelids to Deckard's photo-focusing computer. When we see the artificial owl at Tyrell Corp its eyes have a yellow glow, like how a cats eyes flash in the dark. In the remastered final cut this glowing flash appears in each of the replicant's eyes, including Rachel's at times - notable when moving from light into darkness. DECKARD'S EYES NEVER DISPLAY THIS. Also I noticed in the final cut Deckard's eyes are OPEN when he has the unicorn vision. This all leads me to actually change my theory that Deckard is in fact NOT a replicant. Wow. I again applaud Ridley Scott for what I feel is the most timeless, brilliant movie ever made."

","Maybe I have too much reference material to allow me to enjoy this movie as everyone else has, being that I watched this in 2006 instead of 1982. Maybe in 1982 this movie would have been a lot better, but in 1982 I was too young to watch this movie let alone understand anything about it. The concept was a good one, that of life like robots, A.I., cyborgs, replicants, etc. but in this day an age that story has been told a million times in a million different ways (see A.I., Terminator 1-3, Matrix, Space Odessey 2010, I,Robot, etc.) Bladerunner was interesting and distinct from the standpoint that these robots only wanted to stay alive longer than the 4 years they were designed to. The movie as a whole was alright, I just couldn't get acclimated to the idea that these robots were too life-like. They not only displayed feelings, but they had feelings for each other, they feared death, they displayed panic, passion, and they sweat and cried. But what really took the cake was Deckard (Harrison Ford) sleeping with and ultimately falling in love with what he KNEW to be a robot, and likewise she fell in love with him. That was a bit much."
"chvylvr80","10","1","4","11 September 2003"," The best Sci-Fi movie ever made
","I'm always nervous when writing a review of a well known and respected movie that is dear to my heart. I'm afraid that I won't do the film justice. Ok, here I go. Blade Runner is the greatest work of both Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford. Harrison plays beautifully the part of Deckard. Deckard is not an invincible hero but a regular man who can sometimes screw up or be a bit of a coward. He's a normal guy, and Harrison shows us his sadness and regret. Rutger Hauer is perfect as the poetic Roy Batty, desperate to experience life a little longer. I could go on with the rest of the cast but every person in this film does Oscar caliber work. The vision of Los Angeles in 2017 is both beautiful and depressing. Spectacular sets and matte painting abound. The mournful score enhances the mood of the film, and the story is simple yet brilliant. Ridley Scott proves to be a great director and really shows us what a work of art this film is. It is a pity that the movie did badly on it's debut but no one accused the American public of having taste. Bottom Line: This movie is sheer art and to miss seeing this film is missing one of the great films of not only Sci-Fi but history. A classic and a masterpiece."

Dick is much darker, much more intriguing and is a rare masterpiece."

","Nice romantic, futuristic score by Vangelis and the production design is stunning. But, like salad dressing, it ought to have something worthwhile to go on. I realize this film has a big following and is extremely popular in some circles but I was unable to get with it.<br/><br/>No complaints about the performances or casting. Take Sean Young. If you took a talented sculptor, asked him to close his eyes for a few minutes and dream up the most beautiful woman imaginable, he might come up with someone with Sean Young's features. Well, throw in her unimpeachable body too. You'd have to instruct the sculptor carefully though. None of this ""interesting"" business, just plain gorgeous, get it? Forget the Mona Lisa or Eakins' wife. Think Betty and Veronica.<br/><br/>You can't sculpt acting talent, lamentably, but in this case it doesn't matter. Anything low normal or above will do. Sean Young is all glossed up in a hyper-Hollywood manner. Her eyes carefully darkened, her lips a deep and shiny cherry red. Even bald, she looks just fine.<br/><br/>Obviously a lot of effort and imagination have gone into this movie, but what, really, is it all about? A government hit man is hired to find and terminate half a dozen evidently violent robots who are developing human traits. But, suppose the hit man, Harrison Ford, and the object of his intentions, Sean Young, feel attracted towards one another? These robots appear to eat and do commit other acts of biological interest although why that was programmed into them is problematic. Interesting question that has been raised often before.<br/><br/>In any case, when the broth is reduced, it's a pretty slow movie. Some suspense and a good deal of romance. I didn't get much out of it, didn't really care about the characters, but don't want to advise anyone to avoid it. If you peaked on Scale 8 of the original Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. Or -- well, you'd have to go to a lot of trouble to find that out. So, to save time, just ask yourself if you have any faith in astrology. If yes, see this flick."
"ebhp1","5","2","13","7 August 2004"," Overrated...
","Sorry, but this film is way overrated.  Top 100 of all-time?  I don't think so. Here's why:<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>1) Incredibly slow pacing...for an action/adventure type film, there is just way too much down time.  I can only take so many minutes of watching a man (Deckard, played by Harrison Ford) drink himself into oblivion while staring at photographs. 2) Special effects that really date themselves (the original Star Wars came out several years before this and looks much better in today's light than this film). 3) I didn't fear the Replicants.  I actually felt more sympathy for them than for alcoholic Deckard. 4) Poor set up with Deckard being convinced to come back to kill 4 of the replicants.  Rather than a clear motivation, we're left to trust that Ford has no choice...simply because if he's not a cop he's a small (i.e. regular) person.  Who cares! 5) I can't tell if the dialogue was really poor, or if the acting (especially Ford's) was sub-par.  I think it might be both. 6) If the Replicants are due to expire any day now (since they have a 4-year lifespan), then why not sit back and just wait for them to die?  The climatic scene with Deckard battling Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), ends up with Batty actually saving Deckard from death.  Batty then sits down and expires. THE END!  That sound you just heard was all of the tension/suspense deflating from the balloon, rather than exploding with a loud pop! Lame. 7) As for all of the ridiculous suggestions that Deckard is in fact a replicant, why is it then that he gets tossed around like a rag doll whenever he's battling a replicant?  Doesn't make sense, although this would have been a great twist to the movie if the Writer/Director had intended it rather than leaving it to the rabid fans to come up with the idea.<br/><br/>Sorry to be a wet blanket on what is considered by way too many people to be one of the best films ever made...but this film has far too many  holes in it and slow pacing to qualify as a good film, let alone one of the best ever made.  I give this a 5/10, but it only gets those 5 points because the film was definitely ahead of its time back in 1982.  It was just poorly executed. I'd love to see a re-make of this with today's technology, but with a new script.<br/><br/>ebhp"

I think both of these directors did some huge, memorable films. I like the movie called The Last Boy Scout, and I love the Alien. By the way my favorite from the quadrilogy is the forth part by Jeunet, but the first? It's a frantic, dramatic show, and Scott's showmanship is unquestionable. However Blade Runner. Yes, this title is such as the film, it went about Harrison Ford. I like Harrison Ford too. And I love Rutger Hauer - of course I love Helmut Berger too. But I adore Philip K. Dick!

A sci-fi tale about no love - except the marriage -, no Hollywood, no Vangelis - excuse me for that -, no romantic, but ""penitence-box"", sheep, horses, frogs, in a mystical theological robe.

","Blade Runner is one of those glorious films that has gained in popularity the older it has gotten. Ridley Scott's follow up to the critical and commercial darling that was Alien, was by and large considered a flop and damned for not being a science fiction action blockbuster. There was of course some fans who recognised its many many strengths during the initial weeks of its 1982 release, but many who now claim to have loved it back then are surely looking sheepishly in the mirror these days, for the hard-core minority of 82 fans remember it very differently.<br/><br/>Remember the spider that lived outside your window? Orange body, green legs. Watched her build a web all summer, then one day there's a big egg in it. The egg hatched... <br/><br/>Anyway, that's by the by, the point being that a film can sometimes be ahead of its time, misunderstood or miss-marketed, Scott's masterpiece is one such case. Story, adapted in fashion from Philip K. Dick's story, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Is pretty simple. It's a dystopian Los Angeles, 2019, and there are four genetically engineered Replicants - human in appearance - in the city, which is illegal. They were designed to work on off-world colonies, any Replicant who defies the rules will be retired by special police assassins known as Blade Runners, and Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is on this case. A case that will prove to have many layers...<br/><br/>A new life awaits you in the Off-world colonies! A chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure! <br/><br/>Ridley Scott gets to have all his cakes to eat here, managing to blend intriguing science fiction with film noir. That the visuals are outstanding is a given, even the film's most hardest critics grudgingly acknowledge this to be an eye popping piece of visual class - the mention of eyes is on purpose since it's forms a key narrative thread. That it is awash with eye orgasms has led to critics calling a charge of beauty over substance, but the deep themes at work here tickle the brain and gnaw away at the senses.<br/><br/>Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is to be a slave. <br/><br/>Mood is set at perpetually bleak, a classic film noir trait, and paced accordingly. Scott isn't here to perk anyone up, he's here to ask questions whilst filtering his main characters through a prism of techno decay, of humanity questioned to the max, for a film so stunning in visuals, it's surprisingly nightmarish at its core. The emotional spine is ever present, troubled when violence shows its hand, but it's there posing an intriguing question as the Replicants kill because they want to live. And this as our antagonist, Deckard (Ford a brilliantly miserable Marlowe clone), starts to fall for Rachael (a sensually effective femme fatale portrayal), one of his retirement targets.<br/><br/>Tears in the Rain.<br/><br/>As Rutger Hauer (never better) saunters more prominently into the story as head Replicant Roy Batty, the pic evolves still more. Haunting lyricism starts pulsing away in conjunction with Vangelis' rib shaking techno score, while Jordan Cronenweth's cinematography brings Scott's masterful visions to life, key characters one and all. Visuals, aural splendour and dark thematics - so just what does it mean to be human? - Indeed, curl as one in a magnificent cinematic achievement. A number of cuts of the film are out there, and all of them have fans, but Scott's Final Cut is the one where he had total artistic control, and the scrub up job across the board is quite literally breath taking. 10/10"

","Ridley Scott's phenomenal feature film debut, The Duellists, was followed by yet another masterpiece, Alien. His third effort, Blade Runner, eventually proved to be an all-time classic, too, but it didn't look like that back in 1982. I saw the original theatrical version back then and I was disappointed. It might have had to do with the fact that at the time I was expecting the magic and excitement of Star Wars (especially from a movie with Harrison Ford in it), and Blade Runner didn't quite measure up to that standard. Another plausible explanation for my then lukewarm response is that I simply found it painfully slow-paced and boring, and the dismal explanatory voice-overs made it virtually impossible to become immersed in the film.<br/><br/>The 1992 director's cut completely changed my mind, partly because I had grown up and got accustomed to art movies by then and partly because it removed the unnecessary voice-overs, which resulted in a film with a totally different feel. The deeply elegiac story about the true meaning of humanity finally matched the gorgeous visual feast.<br/><br/>Viewed strictly in its later incarnations (the director's cut and the 2007 'final cut' which is basically the same as the 1992 version with only minor alterations), Blade Runner is one of the greatest 'pure' SF films (not mixed with action/adventure or other genres) that has a solid place alongside such milestones as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Solaris (1972) or A.I. (1999)."

","I first saw this film (Final Cut) three years ago in Blu-Ray, and I was stunned by its visual details. To achieve something like that in 1982 is a big deal, and to inspire a generation of filmmakers by doing so is a huge feat. Kudos to the production team!<br/><br/>The problem lies in its screenplay which is a total disaster, given the nature of the themes it tried to explore. It was only saved by the ideas of its original author Philip K. Dick who was more interested in exploring the dark side of American future. It is debatable as to how much of that vision was accurate, but some Americans today have widely acknowledged its dangerous similarity to the present situation. It is interesting why an author of that caliber, who lived during the glory days of USA, had such a bad dream about his nation.<br/><br/>Sir Ridley Scott (of 1982) is absolutely fantastic as a visualizer, but his lack of storytelling sensibilities is highly evident in how he has handled that flawed material. He is very successful at creating such an immersive experience that, if the viewer willfully suspends his belief, can feel like he had a bad nightmare. <br/><br/>There isn't anything here for the actors though, apart from Rutger Hauer and his iconic 'Tears in Rain' monologue, which I felt was very poetic and quite thought provoking in the end. I'm eagerly waiting for its recently announced sequel and hope that it features a better screenplay which is less fumbled than its prequel while at the same time retaining those oddities that actually makes it so special."

The well realized, dystopian city combined with the pristine soundtrack make this one of the most spellbinding sci-fi noir worlds ever. The story is told extremely well and there are many gems for the observant viewer to discover. It delves deep into themes like; ""what does it mean to be human?"" and ""how do we define consciousness and what are the moral implications?"".<br/><br/>The supporting cast also play their roles expertly. In particular Rutger Hauer, who became one of my favorite actors from his performance given here. The dialogue in this movie, despite being quite minimalistic, sports an absurd amount of memorable lines given by many different characters.<br/><br/>In summary; if you are hesitating to watch this movie, just do it.

It's superior cast of people who are determined to transcend themselves is key to make an instant classic. The blue eyes, blonde hair and grimace from ear to ear of Rutger Hauer made him the ultimate ice-cold replicant, while Harrison Ford, after Star Wars and Raiders Of The Lost Ark, proved his ability to present a complex and morally charged character. The role of composer Vangelis was also of great importance. He created a delicious and almost Spartan sober sound-scape, which echoed the perfect cries of an unhinged future. And what would the movie have been without the miraculous special effects of wizard Douglas Trumbull, the man who had polished 2001: A Space Odyssey for all eternity.<br/><br/>Upon release, the movie turned out to be a flop, but not for long. When the picture first appeared on video, it rapidly gained a cult-status held to date. We are fortunate to behold Ridley's ""Final Cut"" version where, for the very first time, the dream of the unicorn can be seen the way it was meant to be. The sparingly but intense violence is no longer trimmed and the digital polishing makes the picture shine more beautifully and confident than ever before.<br/><br/>It is hard not to be intrigued by the surprisingly philosophical overtone ""what makes a human human?"" Let yourself be dragged in by this classic science-fiction masterpiece."
"Murex003","7","1","5","24 August 2012"," Aspects of this movie are good, but some are bad
","This movie is overrated for sure, but it's not a horrible movie because of that.<br/><br/>The movie had an atmosphere to it that seemed to convey the same affect to me as a surreal painting from the 1920s. I came out of watching this movie once again with a strange unease of unfifilment and perhaps in some way I lack the ability to really feel this movie as other people seem to. This film was a work of art in a visual way, but it lacked emotion in my opinion. There was really no emotional amplitude at all in this film. I gazed upon the screen watching this as if I was on some kind of pain-killing medication. The story was very boring- detective guy in the future hunts down and kills dangerous synthetic bad-guys. Yeah, there is a bit more to it than that, but not much more. There was no philosophical dilemma or revelation, and the action scenes were a bit of a let down for me.<br/><br/>One of the strange things I found to be true about this movie was that it is a bit unpredictable, but in a bad way. At any time, anything could have suddenly happened and I wouldn't have flinched or asked myself 'Why did that just happen?'. The characters were so emotionally bland that I had absolutely no vested interest in what happened to them.<br/><br/>What I did like about this movie was the strangeness of it, and how it was such a hard movie to grasp. I learned that it's best to not try too hard to feel this movie like most other movies, and it's best to watch this movie when you are in a particulliar mood. I enjoyed this movie for it's unique visual affects (not effects, but affects). I think I would consider this movie more of an 'art movie' rather than a 'science-fiction movie', even though it has those sci-fi elements. It doesn't fit well in any one class of movies very well, which I do like."
"Brawl_666","8","1","5","19 October 2009"," something different....
","There are certain movies that pose a challenge for a calm, unbiased viewer. Blade Runner is one of these films. Over the years this film has acquired the status of a religious cult, something almost akin to Scientology or Objectivism, and so its difficult to simply dismiss it as long, slow, tedious and overrated. Let me start by comparing this film to other ""sci-fi"" movies. Scott's previous 'Alien' struck a precarious balance between commerce and art - not as hopelessly shallow as Star Wars, and yet hardly as ambitious as 2001. Blade Runner abandons the traditional narrative style altogether; it communicates almost entirely through images, symbols and motifs, and it has a loopy, splintered, chaotic, upside-down narrative pattern.<br/><br/>The future is incredibly bleak. Corporations rule the roost. The government and police are totalitarian. A new type of technology allows us to play God - to CREATE human beings, and USE them for our purposes. And then to KILL them, once they cease to be useful, or before they acquire enough volition to become dangerous. The central question seems to be - who is truly human, the ""clones"" or the ""natural"" people ? The powerful seem to be inhuman in their exploitation of the clones, and the people on the lower rungs of the social ladder tend to be robotic in their behavior, since they are powerless and live only to follow orders. And so, as a friend remarks, the main idea here seems to be that the clones are the ONLY humans, since they are the final victims of a vicious cycle, and they alone experience any authentic emotions at all.<br/><br/>First the pros. Money has been spent, and some shots are absolutely amazing. The remastered Final Cut is dazzling to look at in Blu-Ray. If you love production design, photography and original visual effects, you will be in heaven. Its obvious, however, that no consensus was reached during pre-production on what the final film was going to be. Now come the cons. Recall how streamlined and systematic 'Alien' was; Blade Runner sits on the opposite extreme of the discipline scale. No care has been tendered on producing a cogent, coherent screenplay. Shot composition and editing are terrible : the timing and sequencing of consecutive shots is shockingly bad, resulting in a distracting, unfocused and overly long narrative that will not appeal to most viewers. Terrible choice of music that works only for one scene (the ""tears in the rain"" speech). Another thing that is, in retrospect, a failure, is the casting and acting. All the actors are consistently, terrifically bad.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is a movie that will mean different things to different people. I don't think this is a film that communicates well at all. Its about ideas all right, but I think you should have a solid, fool-proof plan in place before you embark on any big project. Easier said than done, of course."
"g-bodyl","8","1","5","6 October 2008"," OK at the best!
","Blade Runner is not a good movie, but it is not a bad movie either. It's only OK. I don't know how people could love this or hate this because this movie has everything in between. The story takes place in 2019 and is about a a guy named Deckard who is a cop that must destroy replicants or robots that are on Earth since they have been banned. The acting is good. Harrison Ford did good, even though he did not like Ridley Scott. The music was OK. At least there is something different about the music. The problem with this film is that it's too dark and boring. I could hardly see the movie on my television and I was watching it during the evening. I also thought that this is kind of boring. The action scenes are few between. The ending is confusing and stupid. I was shocked at the ending because it was so abrupt. Overall, this is interesting, but not worthy of an Oscar. Basically, it's OK. My rating is 6/10."

"TeaTaker","5","1","5","29 December 2006"," Read the Book...
","PLEASE read the book: ""Do Androids Dream of ELectric Sheep"" from which this movie originates ! In-a-nutshell: What appeared on screen (and I have seen both versions) is NOT at all accurate/faithful to what Dick wrote ! In fact, this gloomy/doomy scenario is vastly different, given how the book is COMEDY... and not even necessarily 'black' at that ! Mr. Dick, famously, saw things through rather 'rusty' rather than 'rosy' spectacles, but his novel IS funny, and fun to read, whereas ""Blade Runner"" (which in fact is a name borrowed from ANOTHER source, entirely), is completely lacking in humor on any level, unless you find it funny to be asked about your mother, and react by 'offing' someone for posing that question.<br/><br/>And, contrary to what the first reviewer states, I happen to feel that WITH the added 'Voice Over' and PERHAPS with the 'happy ending' (that being a rather relative term), the movie as first presented IS 'closer' to the novel... at least, the novel's quality is reminiscent in hearing the Voice Over content, which sometimes even borders upon a sort of ironic humor.<br/><br/>Someday, if we are lucky, someone WILL make a version of this movie that IS faithful to the book, and we will all be the better off for it ! Meanwhile, let me make clear that I am a long-standing and well-versed avid fan of Science Fiction, and to call this POSSIBLY, even, ""The Best Sci-Fi Film EVER"" is really a misjudgement. I am well aware that there IS quite a 'cult-following' and a plentitude of fans for this movie, who may argue over the merits of its two different releases (and I happen to own BOTH), BUT...<br/><br/>Might I suggest that the ORIGINAL ""War of the Worlds"" (tho' laughingly dated by the 50's cars in it), and ""The Forbidden Planet"" (with an unfortunate all-Theremin soundtrack) are tons better VISUALLY ? Yes, Blade Runner presents some very interesting and visually astute views, but, so what ? It is rather bleak, and not terribly stunning. ""This Island Earth"" is another 50's era Sci-Fi that I happen to like, not one that I would say is 'possibly the best ever' but one that I would vote for as having one of the best TITLES of 'all time' and a Flick with some very interesting visuals... (too bad the original has gotten censored and cut, there was a rather 'shocking' scene with nudity when the two main protagonists get 'prepared' for space travel... but, then, the 'creatures' in it are a bit too laughable by today's standards).<br/><br/>All three that I mention should be seen before voting for 'Best Ever' I think. Too, consider ""The Day Earth Stood Still"" which unlike the others is B & W, and has even more 'weaknesses' as far as Special Effects go, BUT it tells an important and meaningful 'story' delivering a significant 'message' that is still as relevant today as it was so many decades ago ! I won't say that IT is 'best ever' but, well, MAYBE it's message is ? <br/><br/>Just expressing ""My popcorn's worth""."

","There have been many movies about a future dystopia, but ""Blade Runner"" is truly one of the best. Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, a cop looking for renegade replicants - robots designed to look like humans - in 21st century Los Angeles. As he travels through the city, we get to see how it looks: it rains constantly, there's nothing but advertising everywhere, and everything is totally paved over. Grim yes, but not as grim as some of the experiences that Deckard has throughout the movie. Ridley Scott gives the movie a setting as grim as the one in ""Alien"". You can't really say whether a person is supposed to feel cynical, fearful, or whatever while watching this movie, but it is definitely a movie that everyone should see."
"jboothmillard","8","1","5","8 July 2005"," Blade Runner
","I had seen this film a few times, but perhaps never really got into the swing of it, so I watched it twice on the same day, this definitely helped me appreciate it much more as a great classic, based on the novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" by Philip K. Dick, directed by Ridley Scott (Alien, Thelma & Louise, Gladiator). Basically in Los Angeles in 2019, artificial humans were bioengineered some time ago, these are known as ""replicants"", but after a bloody mutiny on an Off-World Colony ""replicants"" were declared illegal, a LAPD cop specialising in detecting replicants, called a ""Blade Runner"", must terminate them, termination is called ""retirement"". Retired police officer Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is detained by officer Gaff (Edward James Olmos) and brought to his former supervisor Bryant (Wild Wild West's M. Emmet Walsh) who informs him that four replicants have escaped and hijacked a ship back to Earth, they are trying to extend their their lifespan. These replicants are Leon Kowalski (Brion James), Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) and Pris (Daryl Hannah), Deckard initially refuses the assignment to retire them, but Bryan threatens him, he reluctantly agrees and carries out a test at Tyrell Corporation used for Nexus-6 models, the assistant of Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel), experimental replicant Rachael (Sean Young), believes herself to be human, given false memories, but a more extensive test is required. Roy and Leon do their own investigation to find a way to extend their lifespan, which for a replicant is four years, and they learn about genetic designer J.F. Sebastian (William Sanderson), Pris later finds him and manipulates him to gain her trust, Rachael meanwhile visits Deckard herself and tries to prove her humanity, showing him a family photo, but he explains that her memories are implanted, taken from a real person, she leaves in tears. Deckard finds and searches Leon's hotel room, he is then lead to the strip club where Zhora works, he chases and kills her, Bryant then comes and tells him to kill Rachael, who has departed from Tyrell Corporation, he does spot her in a crowd, but is attacked by Leon, until Rachael kills him using Deckard's gun. While Deckard and Rachael return to his apartment where he promises not to hunt her, they share an intimate moment, and he stops her from leaving, meanwhile at Sebastian's apartment Roy tells Pris the others are dead, Sebastian reveals he also has a short lifespan, due to the genetic premature aging disorder ""Methuselah Syndrome"". They go together to see Dr. Tyrell at his penthouse, Roy demands more life from his maker, Tyrell says that this is impossible, dismisses doing ""questionable things"" and praising Roy's advanced design and accomplishments in his short life, Roy kisses Tyrell, then kills him, Sebastian manages to escape alone in the elevator. Deckard finds Sebastian's apartment and ambushed by Pris, he manages to kill her just as Roy returns, Roy's body is starting to shut down, he chases Deckard through the building up to the roof, Deckard tries to jump across to another roof, but ends up hanging, Roy jumps across to watch him as his grip loosens, but Roy hoists him onto the roof and saves him. In his last moments of his life Roy delivers a monologue about how his memories are about to be lost (this was improvised by Hauer), Deckard watches silently as Roy dies in front of him. Gaff arrives and shouts to his Deckard, ""It's too bad she won't live, but then again, who does?"", he returns to his apartment and finds Rachael there, depending on the version you are watching, Deckard and Rachael either leave the apartment block to an uncertain future, or drive through an idyllic pastoral landscape. There are three versions of the film to watch: the 1982 original, the 1992 Director's Cut (which drops Ford's narration and has a bleaker ""happy ending""), and 2007's The Final Cut (where Scott had complete artistic control, and contains an extended unicorn dream sequence). Ford is really good as the gloomy but determined ex-cop, Young is suitably mysterious, Hauer is exceptional as the nasty android with fake memories of a nonexistent childhood, and the supporting cast members do well also, it is well directed by Scott, and the story is interesting and relatively easy to follow, but what really makes this film ahead of its time is the neon-drenched metropolis, the darkened world full of flying vehicles and cool looking buildings, it is a fantastic futuristic science- fiction thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Visual Effects, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Production Design/Art Direction, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Make Up Artist, Best Score for Vangelis (Chariots of Fire), Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Harrison Ford was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 74 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!"

But it's not terribly good.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an intense action flick?  Sorry.  There be lots of action, yes, and quite a bit of violence.  But of all the ""action-packed"" thrillers I've seen, this has the least.  (Part of what first interested me in watching 'Akira' - in my mind, one of the greatest sci-fi flicks ever, albeit anime - was the TV ad long ago sporting the line ""'Akira' makes 'Blade Runner' look like Disney Land.""  Well it certainly does.  There's scarcely anything very outrageous in 'Blade Runner' at all.  Excepting, of course, Tyrell's death...)<br/><br/>Looking for an unbelievably deep, thought-provoking flick questioning life itself?  Eh...no.  That it certainly isn't either.  If you're looking for something with a great, deep meaning, try 'Vanilla Sky' or something like that.<br/><br/>This is just a very shallow movie, all in all.  It's good, yes.  But not very.  There's just really nothing to it.  The plot is horrible, the action is minimal...blah.<br/><br/>All told: a classic, and little more.

","all this film has going for it is the production design. This movie is dreary, ugly, and very pessimistic. The buildings of the future are very huge and advanced, but the people in the film are all depressed and cynical. Harrison Ford gives the worst performance of his career. It is hard to see why this film is praised so much by people. The storytelling is totally muddled and terribly hard to follow. You might think I should watch this film again to appreciate it, but I won't. That's the last thing I would do. Watching the film for me was painful. And what's with that scene were the bad guy kills some other guy by squishing his eyes out and crushing his skull? Couldn't he have killed in another way? <br/><br/>This film has no redeeming features whatsoever apart from the aforementioned set designs, which are quite inventive. The characters are all far from interesting. All actors give flat, superficial performances. The story is extremely depressing. I can't recommend this film at all.

"rt-ingram","9","1","6","24 June 2016"," A film that's definitely a 'grower'
","I wasn't so keen on Blade Runner the first time around; I did think it had a good story but I didn't like the slow pace, and despite reading really good reviews beforehand, it didn't make an instant impression on me. However, it has since grown on me, and as such, I can safely say it's one of the best sci-fi films around. It's even been added to my personal DVD collection.<br/><br/>If you're thinking the film is your typical shoot them up type film, you are sorely mistaken. Blade Runner focuses more on the characters in the film than big action sequences, and contains a very human element, which is refreshing to see. All the characters are well drawn out and you find yourself relating to the villains, as well as rooting for the main character.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is mostly top notch. Harrison Ford gives a very memorable performance as Deckard; although he downplays the role, and Deckard isn't as enthusiastic compared to Indiana Jones or Han Solo, Ford nonetheless delivers a winning performance. Rutger Hauer gives a stand out performance as Roy Batty, the leader of the replicants, bringing a real aura of menace to the role, while keeping the human element. Daryl Hannah (who was unknown at the time) makes a splash – excuse the pun – as do the rest of the cast; however, Sean Young is not very good as Rachel, the love interest for Deckard. The romance scenes between these two, normally a highlight of any film, are the weakest part.<br/><br/>The scenes in which Deckard hunts down the replicants are generally entertaining, and like all great films, the best part comes at the end, in which Deckard finally comes face to face with Batty. However, rather than the good guy finally getting the bad guy, Batty tells of his memories and then dies in front of Deckard. The whole scene is very moving and not what you were expecting.<br/><br/>There's also the question as to whether Deckard is a replicant himself. It's left ambiguous, but you have to watch carefully to find out the answer.<br/><br/>Overall, Blade Runner may not have made a great impression on me the first time around, but has since become a movie that can be enjoyed over again."
"Lejink","6","1","6","3 December 2014"," Future imperfect
","I can easily see why this film has become the cult movie it is today, regularly championed as one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. Considering it was made almost thirty years ago, it's still visually stunning with its neo-noir gloomy cinematography, the exterior shots made darker still with seemingly constant heavy rain mixed with an imaginative future vision taking in flying cars and outsize, almost floating video-advertisements, the latter at once familiar in its common-placedness and yet disturbing in its exaggeration and omnipresence.<br/><br/>There really isn't that much of a story with Ford basically re-hired by the police force he previously left to track down four humanistic androids (called replicants) escaped to earth from a space colony and now determined to revenge themselves on their creator. Besides some interaction between Ford and the replicant creator's is-she-or-isn't-she P.A., the film moves inevitably towards a final confrontation between Ford's Deckard's character and the replicant leader, the sadistic, revengeful Rutger Houer.<br/><br/>For me though, the film loves its own look a little too much and is ponderous to watch at times, interspersed by scenes of random but brutal violence. We fleetingly come across minor human characters who seem to have regressed from society none more so than JF Sebastian who becomes their link to ultimate target megalomaniac Tyrell, who lives in cluttered squalor alone with his homemade mechanical toys and robots.<br/><br/>In fact I'll take cluttered squalor as pretty much my description of the whole movie. Inevitably it devolves to a showdown between a rampaging, but fast expiring Hauer and an exhausted, beaten-up Ford which doesn't play out as you'd expect and an enigmatic final scene which interestingly questions whether Deckard's mightn't be a replicant himself.<br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" certainly succeeds in serving up a bleak vision of the future reminiscent of Fritz Lang's epochal ""Metropolis"" decades earlier. At times nightmarish in its sheer banality, it can be seen to have inspired future generations of directors and writers in film and print. Personally, it still seems to me like a short story elongated to movie length but there's no denying its imagination and artistic vision, even if I might have preferred a bit more pace and action along the way to lighten the darkness a little."

But there aren't that many long/wide shots (except when you see those monumental buildings which are all special effects I guess) so at times I did get this feeling that the sets were really small and it was all probably shot in a few rooms.<br/><br/>Deckhard's character was too pulpy. In PKD's book, he is more of a pathetic figure and not that tough. The book was more melancholic and hilarious and had more social commentary. The film is visually stunning but there wasn't enough character development.

"uroshnor54","10","1","6","19 April 2014"," Amazing
","Since the first time I watched Blade Runner, it's been my favorite movie. I think I like it just as much for the atmosphere as I do for its story. Actually, I think I might even like the world of Blade Runner more than the story. And also, I'm pretty sure most people will agree that this is definitely one of those cases where the movie is actually better than the book (although I do also love Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?) <br/><br/>I was pretty surprised to find some reviewers here calling Blade Runner boring. Maybe this is because I had already watched 2001: A Space Odyssey before Blade Runner. On most ""Best Sci-Fi Movies of All-Time"" lists, 2001 is usually first. For this reason, I decided to watch it. And it is incredibly boring. Don't get me wrong, I do admire 2001 very much. But nothing will ever make me think that some guy flying through an iTunes visualizer for ten minutes is entertaining (and yes, I know that particular sequence was groundbreaking for its time but it's not incredibly impressive now). Blade Runner doesn't stop its story to create its ambiance. You feel the atmosphere while the plot is moving forward. But Blade Runner also isn't some totally philosophical and pretentious movie. It isn't completely devoid of action or romance.<br/><br/>And I must say that my favorite cut of the movie is the original American theatrical cut. Yeah, a lot of fans say the ""happy"" ending has too different of a feeling from the rest of the movie but I like it. And I thought the voice-over narration made the movie feel like a film noir, which I thought was pretty cool."
"blazesnakes9","10","1","6","3 November 2013"," Blade Runner is one of the two best science fiction films of 1982
","What is man? What is robot? What is artificial intelligence? Those are the kind of questions a sci-fi geek will ask themselves. Ridley Scott's explosive sci-fi adventure, Blade Runner covers those aspects in some of the most eye popping and thought-provoking ways. Blade Runner tells the tale of a futuristic policeman, specifically a blade runner, who's hired to track down 4 replicants. The blade runner is played by Harrison Ford, and he takes the job after thinking about retiring on the force. The setting for Blade Runner takes place in the futuristic year of 2019, where Los Angeles is overpopulated by Americans and Asian Americans. The leader of the replicants group is an albino, played by Rutger Hauer. His mission on Earth is to track down the creator who made him and the other robots. One of those robots is a female, played by Daryl Hannah. Blade Runner has a good story to it and it's beautifully told. But, the big surprise in this movie is the art-direction and visual effects. The whole city of Los Angeles is lit with neon lit signs and giant advertising posters that really enhances the culture aspects and look of the future. Harrison Ford is also convincing as the leading role. This is actually his best since Raiders of the Lost Ark. Rutger Hauer is very frightening and very good as the killer robot with a vengeance. I like how the movie uses the 1940's film-noir style to it, creating a feel of mystery to the story. Believe it or not, I am a sci-fi geek. I really enjoy watching science-fiction mainly because science-fiction movies are thought-provoking and brilliant about the way the story is told. But, the visual effects in Blade Runner doesn't undermine the story. The special effects are indeed, exhilarating. The look and feel of this rainy and depressing city is very similar to other movies that followed after this one. What's surprising is that Blade Runner did not do well at the box office, probably because people didn't quite understand the concept and story of it. Yet, another sci-fi movie, E.T., did a lot more better than Blade Runner. In fact, E.T. grossed over $435,110,554 that year. It was also one of the best films of that year, and compare to Blade Runner, it's different in its tone and look. I find this to be very disappointing. What I mean is that movies within the same genre should be viewed the same and be reviewed as films that will make cinema history. I think that Blade Runner deserved the same kind of criticism as E.T. does because both movies relied on different stories, but inside, there's a meaning to it. If audiences and critics can't seem to rendered that fact, the movies are in for a rude awakening. In a nutshell, Blade Runner is a excellent sci-fi movie, filled with interesting characters that we care for and a set that's worth a look at. It is also one of the best films of 1982. ★★★★ 4 stars."
"RyanCShowers","Null","1","6","1 November 2013"," Appropriately Questions the Future
","Blade Runner left ""Bigfoot"" imprint on the science fiction genre 1982. Sci-fi flicks have a pattern of letdowns, but Blade Runner is something special, sustaining freshness when viewed in today's times. Ridley Scott's ambitious vision still questions the audience about the future when Blade Runner's version of ""the future"" is less than a decade away from our time. Scott, though not restricted to the sic-fi genre, unlocks the director's comfort zone and possibly his area of interest. He has a certain feel to his films that can be linked together and recognized through the auteur theory. Blade Runner also weighs on genre theory in it's attack of the humanity's future in the science fiction category.<br/><br/>The visuals for Blade Runner need not an extra injection of ""film-botox"", the release year doesn't concern itself with the picture's longevity. When making the decisions for Blade Runner, Scott has his mind in the future imagining what the decor would look like, the clothing that we may wear, and the technology that could corrupt us. The obvious, blue-glow to the photography is beautiful and doesn't feel as cheap as other futuristic tales display their films. The selection of shots and cuts are placed perfectly, including the closeups I love from Scott's films. The sound echoes all the gadgets and violence a neo-noir-sci-fi film can release.<br/><br/>Films that predict the future sometimes become cheeky and cryptic with what they want to say; thankfully Blade Runner sprints past those urges and gives its audience everything up front, though the quantity of what they have to spread is quite sizable. Will there eventually be a new race of humans? Are we becoming robots? Who is who? What makes us a human? What makes us a person? Can what we do change who we are? What are the limits of love? I'd even go as far to say Blade Runner hints around issues of race, homosexuality, and slavery. Ridley Scott is almost trying to ply open American's simple-minded views in 1982.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is as artful as you can be without becoming pretentious. It's a film requiring your attention, thought, and repeated viewings. Don't worry it's still fun to watch; it has cool action scenes and impeccable blocking. The characters are enriched with feelings of the real world, which adds another layer of identification for Blade Runner's audiences to latch onto. From 1982's eye view, it appeared that Ridley Scott wasn't an optimistic onlooker of the years yet to come. Maybe his opinions were influenced by a vision of his later career never topping his work with Blade Runner and 1979's Alien.<br/><br/>Rating: 9<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","When contemporary critics and audiences discuss about their favorite sci-fi films and they usually contain the same films; and one of those films include Blade Runner. I do think that Blade Runner is a fantastic science fiction film but I also think it ranks up with the best neo-noir films of all time.<br/><br/>Blade Runner's screenplay is written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, and it is based on Philip K. Dick's novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"". This film definitely progressed Peoples' writing career, attached with films like Unforgiven and 12 Monkeys. I have not read Dick's novel, so I came into this film blind. The film's plot takes a story that seems to touch familiar ground in previous noir films but putting a sci-fi twist to it, and I think it's intriguing and had me constantly thinking about the social and political structure of the film's world. Fancher and Peoples has written a protagonist that doesn't tell or show much and it had me curious on what his view is of the current situation and the world. I did find some of the dialogue a little vague and lacking texture but it does achieve in driving the hardboiled tone that Ridley Scott was going for. I also wished that there was more depth in the story, allowing us to explore the comprehensive world that Deckard is in.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott directed this film, who amazed me with his previous film ""Alien"". Scott approached Alien in a more straightforward kind of way, focusing more on the terror and the need for survival. Blade Runner on the other hand is much more complex and walks on the tight rope between two completely different genres. Scott was able to balance both noir and sci-fi, which made this film very unique for its time. I felt that Scott was held back in achieving his true vision as some moments feel a bit empty and need a bit more time to achieve it's true potential. The film is a major step forward in special effects and the scope of what effects can do. The film's effects are clearly influenced by other sci-fi films that preceded it, which includes Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Star Wars.<br/><br/>Blade Runner's director of photography was the late Jordan Cronenweth. The cinematography is one the main areas that convey the noir-ish tone of the film. The film definitely feels stylish which is one of the main reasons that attracted me to the film again and again. Cronenweth's use of shadows and the use of low key lighting accentuate the dark emotional weight of the film's story. The exterior scenes, which is filled with neon lights and rain, look gorgeous and keeps the audience feeling mesmerized. The film's photography has influenced future films like Total Recall (2012) and Minority Report.<br/><br/>Blade Runner's score is composed by Vangelis, who previously worked on Chariots of Fire. I really like the score of this film as it incorporates the futuristic sound of synthesizers and electronic while also keeping that classic noir sound, music driven by either saxophone or piano. It definitely sounds more personal and intimate in comparison to big science fiction films like Star Wars, which is operatic and grand.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford is definitely great in this film but cannot say that this was his best work. Ford does not have a lot to work with as his character does not have a lot of emotional depth. Rutger Hauer was fantastic in this film as he portrays with such unpredictability and eeriness that he kept me on my toes during the film, particularly the third act. Sean Young was great here, sexy and innocent, but I felt that writers did not write enough about her character.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is a science-fiction and neo-noir classic, and has influenced many films that came after it. It has a great story with an interesting setting, supported by great acting, stylish photography and an inspired score. It may not be perfect in my eyes but it shouldn't retract anyone from watching it."

","Is Tyrell a God? Are Roy Batty (Anti-christ) and Deckard (Christ) his son? Why is Deckard fixed with the photographs of his own life?

What is the verdant land and faultless is this where Deckard and Rachael seek refuge? Do Replicants have soul that flies like a dove at death? It is issues like these (but there are many more) that make people see and review the movie. Whether the mystery is sensed or not, it's there, a small voice that says - you have seen, but not seen.

There is always something visually stunning on screen 24/7, in my opinion the best part of Blade Runner is not its smart script, great story, or Oscar performances, it's the film's gorgeous and breathtaking visuals.

","I remember watching this some 7 years ago and thinking ""what's the big deal?"" It has been touted as an instant classic and one of those movies guys love universally. After feeling Luke warm about the viewing I decided in my infinite wisdom to give the movie another chance. I must have been wrong, since this is one of the most highly thought of movies of sci-fi times.<br/><br/>I was not wrong.<br/><br/>I can skip the fact that special effects have come much further than any person could have imagined. Even the people who constructed these fabulous worlds of the ""future"" would have no idea. In fact I miss movies with the character time and development that the older movies have. Blade Runner delivers---some---on this point. Decker is a largely human guy and you identify with him. What you don't know is what dirt they have on him to make him take on this task, but hey, let's let that go. Then there is the ""love"" he feels for the replicant. Does anyone actually believe this? When did the emotional ties get built so convincingly that you believe they are in love? Add to that Edward James Olmos. A weird oragami foldin', bow tie wearing, useless dude. He knows everything that is going on, yet never does much other than allude to that fact.<br/><br/>Skipping that and on to the vision of the future. Flying cars. OK fine. Paging Mr. Jetson! Maybe in 1982 everyone thought that 2019 was a real long way away. There are just too many non futuristic things to make the idea fluent. Levelor blinds, busted up stucco and drywall in the houses. Heck, everything but the cars and guns was just as it is today. If we can develop alternate fuel sources and make a car fly, why couldn't the human race improve on anything else? What gets at the heart of this criticism is that the movie is just downright boring. The first replicant he shoots dies rather normally, much like a human. But what the heck is up with Pris? What's with the flailing death? She was not a robot after all. The best interaction is with Decker and Roy. More human and intimate than anything else in the movie. I give Rutger Hauer props for his performance. Harrison Ford was OK. May I missed some seriously important info before I sat down to take this all in, but I doubt it. I just don't see how this movie is so good. 6 out of 10."

","If you are used to sci-fi movies being made a certain way: heroes being typical heroes, showing off futuristic weapons and in your face graphics then do not watch this movie.<br/><br/>The best way to enjoy this movie is to just imagine it as a creative science/philosophical university paper. It is basically Ridley Scott putting forth the rhetorical questions associated with 'what it means to be human.' and throwing it into a dystopian world in the not so distant future. While I can understand the message and why the long, oh so long scenes are present in the film, I, much like regular people (non-professional critics) feel that the tried and tested methods of suspense and character building are sorely missed. Its long but not suspenseful, it makes you think, but not too much and not often enough for a movie that lacks any of the other entertainment factors. If it were a short film it would be worth a 9 or 10 but as a looooong movie with dull characters it loses a few points due to time wastage."

"GeneSiskel","5","1","7","26 October 2009"," Death and Transfiguration
","In ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" Stanley Kubrick turned men into machines and machines into men to question where we had come from and, with artificial intelligence, where we were going. It worked spectacularly and has stuck in our collective consciousness since 1964. (Most Americans probably hear the opening bars of Also Sprach Zarathustra and think black monoliths the way Pavolv's dog heard a bell and thought dinner.) Ridley Scott, in his own meditation on death and transfiguration assembled 18 years afterwards, toys with similar themes. His future, set precisely in 2019, is a noir world of spent parts, sidewalk dining, handguns, advertising hype, unfeeling cops who don't need no stinking machines to detect an absence of feelings, dolls in theatrical make-up and shoulder pads, and androids who live in places like the Bradbury Hotel -- in other words, a future rather less believable than Kubrick's because it is so intentionally retro. It is also a world in which aryan creations meet their creators, crucify themselves without need of crosses, and -- if they don't exactly die for our sins -- have at least witnessed them before they pass on. Speaking of witnessing, I somehow missed seeing this movie for the first 27 years after it was released. Today I watched the theatrical version of ""Blade Runner,"" the one with the hokey happy ending, on my computer. It was stylish, late-industrial, soft-porn nonsense but still well worth the price of admission -- which, in my case, was nothing. The plot, with its protagonists ascending into the equivalent of Sam Goldwyn's heaven at the end of ""Wuthering Heights,"" is as coherent as that of most action movies, the sets hearken back to ""Metropolis,"" Harrison Ford overacts less than he is wont, and the women, or maybe they are androids, are stunning, even -- or maybe especially -- when they are doing back flips into the camera. But it's still stylish nonsense, unredeemed by a legitimate idea or human relation. Five out of ten."

","I saw Blade Runner on cable when it first came out. The best science fiction shows us a future that could possibly exist. The problem i had with Blade Runner then was the same problem I have with it now. It was released in 1982. At the time the year 2019 was only 37 years in the future. Extrapolating on current technology there was no way the world visualized in the film would exist only 37 years in the future. Advanced human androids, flying cars, and planetary colonies? I don't think so. This for me made the whole film strictly a fantasy. If the filmmakers had set it in the year 2119- a simple fix by simply changing the opening title card, it would have been much more believable. Even now with the year 2019 only 11 years in the future the world of Blade Runner is at least 150-200 years in the future. <br/><br/>Granted you could make the same argument for 2001 but that film was more accurate in that it showed a Pan Am shuttle(foreshadowing the space shuttle) and an orbital space station which is currently under construction(Albeit in a much simpler form).And there was nothing in that film which couldn't have existed if the Vietnam war had never happened. Blade Runner is simply not realistic given it's historical context. So while brilliant visually the film as science fiction doesn't work but as fantasy works very well. So simply put Blade Runner shows a world that could exist---BUT NOT IN THE YEAR 2019. 2119 yes. 2019? No."
"ajthekoolaidkid","8","1","10","1 October 2014"," This movies worth is completely dependent on the viewer
","Blade Runner Review<br/><br/>The film Blade Runner, produced in 1982 and directed by Ridley Scott depicts the story of two unlikely lovers in a futuristic world ravaged by human activity (""Blade Runner."" –RottenTomatoes). This movie is definitely worth watching as long as the viewer is willing to be fully engaged in the movie throughout its duration. Blade Runner is a suspenseful film containing several plot twists and important minor details. Likewise, this movie is known for being a point of discussion in the field of philosophy for a reason, it raises very large questions about humanity and what it takes to love. The story of Blade Runner is that of a human being tracking down and killing humanoids, while falling in love with one. However, it isn't until the very closing of the movie until the viewer learns that Deckard, the main character; supposedly human, is in fact a replicant himself. This raises questions for the viewer like, ""do replicants, humanoids, have souls,"" ""why can't a human love a replicant, who is, for almost every aspect, human"" and ""why is it suddenly okay for a replicant to love a replicant if supposedly replicants can't love?"" Likewise this movie forces the viewer to try to define love and its relationship, or lack thereof, with having a soul. I believe that Professor David Reeve answers some of these questions rather well; ""if replicant love is or can become real love however, the question of who has a soul may not matter all that much"" (Reeve, David). The humanoids are not referred to as having souls because they weren't born like normal human beings. Professor Reeve notes the importance of having a childhood to having the ability to love and respond to circumstances with the correct response. It is our mothers that teach us to love and our childhood that teaches us how to respond to new events. It is less common for adults to experience new events, so generally adults have the ability to respond accordingly. This is why it is some important that Rachel had memories, even if they weren't hers. Rachel metaphorically did know what it was like to be loved unconditionally by her fictitious mother so much so that she strongly believed she was human. However again, can a non-human know love, and do these memories give her a soul? These are questions that the viewer is required to answer throughout the movie, and then again with Deckard. The writers of this film did an outstanding job of forcing the viewer to question such deep questions about humanity and what it means to love. <br/><br/>Again, I would recommend this movie to anyone willing and capable of critically analyzing a movie, but for those who watch movies just to relax, I would not. This rather suspenseful movie requires a deeper level of thinking in order to understand the full context. Blade Runner set the stage for many sci-fi movies and this is perhaps the reason it performed so poorly in movie theaters (""Blade Runner."" –RottenTomatoes). While this film contains several deep underlying concepts its cinematography is only decent. Perhaps at the time the movie was filmed it could have been state-of-the-art, but it has certainly been surpassed. The special effects in this movie are on par with B perhaps even C-list movies, but the acting is tolerable. In addition Blade Runner is not a happy go lucky feel good movie, its dismal settings and suspenseful scenes leave the viewer on edge. While these characteristics may be favored in horror films, I was not prepared for them. This movie should not be viewed by children either, but that is for the reasons of nudity and a particularly disturbing scene that involves borderline rape. The viewing of Blade Runner requires a certain level of maturity in order to enjoy and understand.<br/><br/>My recommendation of Blade Runner is split on the basis of entertainment and content. For the everyday movie goer who just wants to sit back and watch a story happen in front of them I would not recommend this movie because of its lacking cinematography and acting. On the other hand however, I highly recommend this film to mature intellectuals. This movie's content, especially the role of Rachel, encourages the philosophical query of love and humanity in a manner that most people would blatantly ignore. If the producers of Blade Runner were trying to target their movie at a target consumer group including older intellectuals, I would agree that they succeeded at doing so and would recommend this movie to them. <br/><br/>Works Cited Blade Runner.

There weren't any cool 'let's dissect a robot-synth' scenes, which would give the viewer the impression that it really WAS the future that the movie is taking place in.... oh no! Instead we as the viewers are just supposed to accept that it's the future, because the actor is playing a robot-synth... during the whole movie we never see any 'proof' that the actors are actually robot-synths... I mean, take a movie like Terminator 1/2 for instance... Those two movies feature robot-synths and the director of those movies actually takes the time to SHOW YOU that the actor is an actual robot-synth, by having a hand chopped off, or having some exposed wiring in the chest or whatever.... but Bladerunner did none of that...<br/><br/>Anyway, that was my biggest gripe about the film... other than that the film has very little action and the pacing of very slow.

For me Blade Runner felt more like the latter. Not to say I didn't like it. But it's reputation went before it and my expectations were high. The change of fast 21st century pacing compared to 20th wasn't as much a shift for me to change to. For me it was more the main character and story just wasn't that interesting. Why had the AI come back? Where had they been previously? Although I must say the villain truly did embody the crazy antagonist. I feel like he alone made this film as well known as it had been. Popping his head through the bathroom wall was crack up.<br/><br/>Although, I'm a bit confused on why the AI could bleed and not survive bullet wounds, in what way were they robots then? They seemed to be such close copies to humans that it was a bit too far. Looking forward to seeing the sequel though if the story can progress in more interesting ways.

","It is wonderfully pleasing to the eyes: haunting and compelling technology-dreams made from past and present to resemble a futuristic vision. I am a big fan of Syd Mead, who developed a lot of the futuristic objects and street designs for the film. Personally, I am mostly interested in production design (Ridley Scott was a production designer himself and it shows in this opulent, visually strong film) and am intrigued on how the film resembles social, ethnical and political aspects into buildings, textures, light and sceneries.<br/><br/>It's hard to overstate how influential the film was; it invented the sci-fi sub genre now known as ""cyberpunk"", and it was also the first ""film noir"" in a sci-fi setting. I was stunned by the creative approach onto the noir 'look' (and 'cliches' sometimes) and how the film builds onto them to generate a new approach.<br/><br/>Personally, I am a fan of the slower paced storytelling and the fact that there is not so much action / violence shown in the film compared to works today. (I could see myself drifting off in the last part of the film where a lot of fighting goes on...).<br/><br/>The story is deeply philosophical and still prominent in today's connection with technology. Sky Mead said: ""Technology builds onto itself - we extend, perfect, re-invent older forms of technology. We reassemble it to form new ways of creation and interaction."" Sure, the film depicts another 2019 than we live in, superficially, but the sub-message of the film stays the same: the (in the 80s) modern technologies and media (television, radio, screens, telephones,...) are reassembled to futuristic machines. Today, we work with highly perfected machines like smartphones and small computers, that were originated in the past.<br/><br/>Blade runners approach onto the city-scape in general features a dark consumer-driven dystopia, mixed with dirt, cramped spaces (many people), nights lit by billboards, shop fronts and social services and surveillanced by oversized advertising hover-aircrafts shouting messages onto society. The set design features many textures and crafted elements from the far east, different religions (globalization?), even some buildings represent ancient maya temples - the city became the world.<br/><br/>I love watching films from that point of view and am happy I finally got to see a groundbreaking film that influenced pop culture, modern sci-fi and is referenced throughout film making history until today."

","Okay what has NOT been said about Ridley Scott's mind blowing look at November of the year 2019 with Harrison Ford's policeman dragged out of retirement and hunting down a group of dangerous androids trying to avoid their own death, so I'll make my review short. As for the date, well, since no day of the month is given, just November 2019, I guess you can
say that the movie takes place today, the 27th of November, at least I prefer it to.<br/><br/>The good -
The special effects. Even today the special effects are astonishing. The sets are eye popping as well. The look of a future L.A. being
so clogged with smog that its always nighttime dark 24/7 - only the tallest buildings can look over the smog and see sunlight - and always raining was a great idea. Even Philip K. Dick, who happened to see some dailies
of Blade Runner before he died said the world that the movie set forth was very close to the one he imagined when he wrote ""Do Androids Dream of
Electric Sheep"", the novel the movie is based upon. And Vangelis' music adds even more depth.There's also Harrison Ford's performance as Rick Deckard. Ford is well cast. He really gives a depth I don't think anybody else could pull off. In fact everybody's performance is good - especially Rutger Hauer's. He gives one of the the most vile, yet sympathetic villain performance you will ever see.<br/><br/>The bad -
Well the story does kind of bog down a little. Is Deckard really a flesh and blood human, a tired old Blade Runner who hates his job and guzzles booze? Or is he a Replicant himself, recently programmed to think his existence is that of a tired old Blade Runner who hates his job and guzzles booze? The war between Scott and Ford on this subject is legendary and one of the main reasons the two did not get along. Scott said Deckard was a Replicant and left subtle clues
about it. Ford said the opposite and did the same as Scott to get his point across as well. This is what throws the movie off a bit. Is he one of them... yes or no? You'll just have to decide that for yourself... and sometimes that doesn't completely work. Like here.
Another thing I will disagree with is the notion that Ford's narration is pointless, like Scott - and Ford as well - thought (they were forced by Warner Bros to put the narration in after preview audiences got confused on the narration-less storyline). It is why it is not in the Director's Cut. But I feel it adds to Blade Runner, not takes away. And as a result the movie looses some of it's impact without it. The same goes for the original ""happy"" theatrical ending. It adds, not takes away.<br/><br/>The great -
Rutger Hauer's soliloquy at the end (no spoilers here, we all have heard about it). When I saw Blade Runner back in 1982 (yes I actually saw it in the
movie theater when it was released back then!) the soliloquy was not that well known at the time and it came out of left field for me. It made my
jaw drop! It is brief, poetic, and beautifully spoken by Hauer. It sums up what the feel of the film is about. And to think, Hauer made it up! I guarantee you, from the time you hear it, it will haunt you from that moment on.<br/><br/>In all this movie STILL demands your attention. Forget those who says the special effects and the fantastic sets are the movie's stars and not Ford, Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Brion James, or anybody else. Its all fine. If your a fan of good thought provoking sci-fi, then give this a shot.<br/><br/>My rating (from Excellent to Poor) - Good. To any serious science fiction, fan this is a must."

","I've expected to love it but only elements that saved the film for me was the nicely presented dystopian atmosphere, Rutger Hauer's performance and the film's essence. Other than that, it was just filled with errors and cliches.<br/><br/>In a world which classic sci-fi stuff like overworld colonies, flying cars and surprisingly intergalactic travel exist and people use cheap vantilators in their offices (lots of creativity here), we have replicants, humanoid robots who are able to feel emotion and they live only four years but we don't get even a fictional explanation of how. Deckard is a former blade runner (a special operation unit to terminate replicants) and he was the best of them, according to Bryant. Yet, he seems very surprised when he sees the profile of a replicant on the computer screen, he even feels the need to ask ''What's this?'' (at least he could wait for two seconds until Bryant explains it.)<br/><br/>City is presented as a large and overpopulated urban area, so the police force must be equally large. But when one blade runner gets injured, they pull a former one out of retirement. This indicates that police force is critically insufficient.<br/><br/>Tyrell Corporation must have the profiles of the replicants they have created, so why not utilize them? Why do you need the Voight-Kampff test at all?<br/><br/>One of the replicants, Leon, is said to be able to lift ''400-pound atomic loads'' but when he confronts our tough cop he decides to pass the time with soft slapping him around instead of just finishing him so the femme fatale can show up just in time and save the main character and they can make love like in 60's arthouse films, because that's what everyone in the audience wants, right Mr. Scott?<br/><br/>It is also very interesting that Ms. Rachael doesn't know that she is a replicant, despite these robots have superhuman strenght and agility. She probably have never tried to lift something heavy or catch something quickly in her life before, I guess.<br/><br/>Why does a genetic engineer for the biggest company in the world (Sebastian) live in a jerry-built apartment by the way?<br/><br/>Tyrell, the head of the company that creates these replicants, is wanted by his creations (they killed 20 people and coming after him) so he is supposed to be cautious about his security but somehow there is nothing in the name of security around where he lives (not even a camera in the elevator) and the leader of these replicants easily gets to his bedroom (Mr. Tyrell never panics or calls for help by the way) and gouges his eyes, as he acts like this creature who he limited his life span to four years is his best friend in the world.<br/><br/>Also, it was a really valiant move by Roy (the replicant leader who can break bricks with his head but screams when he pierces his hand with a nail) who brought his death two months forward so we can have a dramatic ending.<br/><br/>All right. I don't mean to offend anyone who is a fan of this film, in fact I think Blade Runner could be awesome. I kind of still like it with its flaws. However, I cannot just ignore everything, jump on the fan vagon and claim this is a ''masterpiece''. For me, this is no different than a B-movie you would only watch to have some fun. I know I only pointed out the negative aspects but that's because of the intense hype this film gets. As for the good parts, the atmosphere, action and acting is quite remarkable (mostly because of Rutger Hauer). It is also clear that this film has a historical importance and influence on many films after itself, unfortunately I do not consider this a justification."

","Blade Runner is a great film, very well directed and great effects for the time period it was recorded in. I think that the overall storyline of blade runner is a little confusing since it is hard to keep up with who is a replicate, although that's what makes this movie great because it creates the suspense and gives great actions scenes. I do think at the beginning of the film it all looks a little sloppy and not well organized but as the movie continues it turns into a world that you understand why things are the way they are. The technology they predict in the future is not so extreme that it makes it realistic, even today. I personally think that the music effects were stunning it created the suspense the movie needs and express the actions very well. It is not a movie that gets you bored, the sound effects give the extra vibe the movie needs and it is very well express. Blade runner it is a great movie especially because of its visual effects which are amazing. The ending scene was very good hook for the audience. At the very end you are left with questions and i personally think i would like if the movie did not end like that."
"crystalwolf-62477","8","0","1","6 May 2019"," An In-depth Description and Review
","Blade Runner was filmed in 1982 with conventional filming techniques. It was directed by Ridley Scott, and major actors in the film were Harrison Ford, Sean Young, and Rutger Hauer. The story itself is based on the short story ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" by Philip K. Dick, and Hampton Fancher and David Webb Peoples wrote the screenplay. The soundtrack was written by Vangelis. The film is a sci-fi/noir detective film. The film is rated R, and compared to other more modern R-rated films, Blade Runner is one of the milder R-rated movies. Many consider Blade Runner to be a classic, and there are several elements in the film that support this feeling. Though Blade Runner is approximately 36 or 37 years old, readers who want to avoid spoilers, pay attention: This review will have spoilers, but warnings will be given beforehand. The section with spoilers will be marked by the following: *-*-*-*-*<br/><br/>The basic plot of the movie is that in the 21st Century, Tyrell Corporation has advanced robotics to the Nexus era, during which Replicants were created. Replicants are essentially cyborgs that are almost identical to humans, and the Nexus 6 model of Replicants were designed to be better than humans in every aspect except one-- due to fear of them overpowering their creators, they were programmed to have a four-year lifespan. Replicants were used for slave labor in off-world colonies until they were declared illegal on Earth after a Nexus 6 combat team murdered people and escaped. Several task forces were formed to eliminate any Replicants who escaped to Earth; these task forces were called Blade Runner Units (hence the title of the film). The main character, a man named Rick Deckard is a member of such a unit who is called into duty (against his will) to hunt down and kill the four remaining members of the earlier-mentioned Nexus 6 combat team who escaped to Earth. The setting is stylized-- Los Angeles in a futuristic 2019 -- and the storyline is told in a linear fashion.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is a major part of the movie. The film uses the soundtrack, characterization, editing, lighting, and camera movement to inspire feelings of calm or dread in order to truly heighten the experience. As most of the film happens in heavy shadow, the few locations that are lit have symbolic meaning; these locations are Tyrell Corporation (which is almost constantly illuminated by sunlight or electrically, and the architecture of the building itself is reminiscent of a Mesoamerican pyramid), and, though less frequently, Deckard's apartment. Cuts were used to establish a rhythm, to shift between characters (Deckard and the Nexus 6s), to transition between different areas, and to mark the passage of time. Specific camera movements and angles are used to direct the viewer's attention to certain things in each scene (objects in the environment that aid character development, etc.). Different languages are used (one character only speaks in English once), and unspoken words are often fairly easy to interpret. Suspension of disbelief is maintained fairly well throughout the movie, and this is broken only by a) the fact that it is now 2019, and the filmmakers gave people too much credit on how technologically advanced society would be now (similarly to Back to the Future), and b) it is raining in Los Angeles in almost every shot, and though this is to maintain the atmosphere of a noir film, it almost never actually rains in Los Angeles.
*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
There were only two things I personally didn't like about Blade Runner. One was the fact that the relationship between Deckard and Rachael was forced. I'm aware that this was most likely to fill the troupe of ""good guy gets the girl,"" but Deckard clearly forced himself onto Rachael. The romance subplot had a purpose, it was just rushed and didn't have much basis behind it. The second was how needlessly drawn out Tyrell's death scene was. I know this was probably to show off the special effects they had developed, and death scenes are usually exaggerated (especially in R-rated films), but it really didn't need to be that drawn out. Besides, Roy crushing Tyrell's skull and then proceeding to gouge his eyeballs out was a bit much.<br/><br/>The fact that Gaff could suddenly speak fluent English at the end when he never bothered to before was a bit confusing, but I suppose Gaff just didn't feel like it until then.<br/><br/>Also, the only things that gave Blade Runner an R rating were the gore that occured in the death scenes/fight scene at the end, and the fact that one of the Nexus 6s (Zhora) had her ""titties"" out on screen for about 20 seconds while getting dressed.
*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*<br/><br/>Overall, if you're a fan of sci-fi/noir detective films, Harrison Ford, or Ridley Scott, then you should check out Blade Runner and see what you think."

","The characters all use certain slang and language, that is because some of the characters are not human and have to develop feelings and things, while some are already human and talk in a way that they could carry on a not
Al conversation , while you have deckard who is not human but he thinks he is and speaks like a human.The style was very interesting and set different moods for this move it seems to remain in a kinda dark tone so deftly has some creative people working in this movie with the dark raing scenes and you could always feel like you could cut the tension on the scenes with that feeling of stress between two people.
The camera angles give a point of view of how they feel and how they are acting, it also helps with a lot of the special effects. Which th camera movement they accomplish what a lot of people should be amazed to hear how they made this movie. The movements are a tremendous part of this movie helping so much with the mood they want the movie to have. Making all the props larger or smaller. The setting is is stylized into a science fiction film, the setting suggests a cold empty world, the unicorn that is a fantasy has symbolic meanings to show you that deckard is really a nexus robot. The costumes they used I the making of the movie was a very interesting. I'd look at a certain character and I could figure out the role they were supposed to be playing.The style was very interesting and set different moods for this move. With the tense scenes and the ones were they would let off some of the tension, while there was still an unexpected twist always around the Corner.the soundtrack they used very much fit the direction the movie was trying to go in. The mostly dark and very eerie video that it gives out. Most definitely makes the movie what it is."

","The lighting in the movie played a big role in the vibe that the atmosphere gave off it gave it
this sense of mystery and almost an ominous feeling that continued throughout the entire movie. There was very little natural light and everything seemed to be covered in darkness. Essentially the whole movie takes place in the shadows and the tactics that are used to for the most part determine someone's humanity seem as though it could be a problem for some people in the real world. This movie seems very driven in one direction never truly deviating from the path set in the very beginning too much. The beginning scene starts with a man being interrogated and they are zoomed in on his eyes as this takes place this sets the tone for what the world has in store for you. This is followed but a superhuman display even furthering the point that this is a sci-fi world. With later world building you can find some of the story grounded in reality that would remind the viewer of the world that we live in. There are other references to the our society with what is essentially the police in this movie. They for the most part enlisted Harrison Ford as a hit man that is to take out the replicants in the movie. These replicants possess superhuman strength and have a lifespan of 4 years. The only true way to tell the difference is through a series of questions that is testing their memories because they can only remember back so far due to the fact that they have implanted memories. He is tasked with finding all the remaining replicants in the world and eliminating them entirely. Along the way after taking out a few replicants he meets one that for some reason he finds different from the other and decides not to kill her after she saves him from a very near death situation. During this time they have a conversation that strongly foreshadows a very important plot twist towards the end of the of the movie. He then proceed to give him a lesson in humanity and how things are done by invoking humans natural instincts for reproduction within the human race. The very end of the movie throws one of the biggest plot twist when it is reveals that he is one of the replicants that he has been hunting the entire time. The movie leaves you with many question and a desire for a follow-up story on what happens to them if they are hunted like he stated that would happen in the movie. This movie was a confusing journey that left many stones unturned but was interesting and needs a sequel"

"annakimnguyen","7","0","1","6 May 2019"," Good for dystopian lovers
","Being a teenager I never had a taste in films that were filmed before the year 2000. However, this movie had definitely enlightened me to try to watch more older films. I love dystopian genre of movies and books. Blade Runner was a very original and different and nothing I had ever seen in this modern day. The beginning was definitely a bit confusing. Two men in a room, one asking the other one odd questions and then ends up fighting each other in the end. Watching this movie in our AP Literature class, no one around me really understood what was going on which had driven away the attention of most students in the room.
As the movie was going on, our teacher had told us that some of the setting was actually used with models none being CG. Being able to portray flying cars and things that won't even be invented till decades after the movie release was surprising. The movie made very realistic models which is crazy that they even did it without the help of computer graphics.
The ways that the characters were conveyed were very interesting. The replicants were often wearing clothes that most wouldn't have worn to fit into society. One of the female replicants had even put a black eyeshadow all over her eyes to make her look like a raccoon. The directors had used this to portray her more crazy like nature. While her lover was wearing what you would typically see villains from superhero movies wear. This was probably to show his strength and power as a replicant.
The theme of the movie was definitely that no matter what you try to create, humans can not be replicated perfectly to fit into society. They will either go crazy or just be insufficient compared to a actual human with feelings and a conscious to know right from wrong. Humans are pure and too complicated to convey in an artificial intelligence.
The movies message was to show how you should value your life and make the most of it. Replicants had only 4 years to live and were begging for more. While some people are throwing away their lives some people just want more of it.
The rating of this movie would be very different if it were to be rated today, with just mild language and little nudity. I would definitely recommend this movie for someone who enjoys dystopian with a bit of action."
"katherineexo","9","0","1","6 May 2019"," An impressive and enjoyable sci-fi film
","As I watched Blade Runner, the movie conveyed senses of mysteriousness, murder, and passionate romance. The movie itself is critically famous for its impressive filmwork, which proves itself throughout the film. With the works of the directors, technology during that time, and the characters, a film in the 80s portrayed similar to a modern 21st century work.
Knowing the movie was filmed in the 80s, where technology was not evolved to film such a work like Blade Runner, I was taken aback with parts of the movie. Due to the futuristic setting, there were flying cars, off the world colonies, and replicants. All the objects within the film were as realistic as possible, with help of lightning adjustment and organization. Often, the film is shown in the dark which adds to the rising mysteriousness aspect of Blade Runner. Light comes in as like from flashlights, just streaks going back and forth. It's similar to what one recognizes of prison and light falling through catching the criminal. Another impressive scene forwards toward the flying cars roaming around the futuristic setting of Los Angeles. Even in modern day, flying cars are way ahead of its time, so how did Blade Runner achieve its advance technology presentation without CGI ? Statues. By taking small objects and filming it close up over a long period accumulated a new insight in the filmmaking industry.
The movie's characters created a suspension of disbelief within the film with its concept of false, implanted memories. The replicants tease apart these memories between the realm of true and false. To be who you are, you have body and possessions, but what happens when they're all taken away; you're left with memories. But what if the last thing you have is also fake? When Deckard described Rachel's memories, they were not her own, but Tyrell's niece. Replicants have escaped from off world colonies and right there it portrays an alien-like world with beings other than humans. Violence with the death and fighting scenes between Deckard and the replicants, two scenes hold significant to the movie as a work overall. Deckard's chase after Zhora accordingly should've took less time than what was filmed, but the whole chase was put on slow motion creating a suspending moment. Zhora falls through multiple screens of glass showing detail along with the creeping music adding onto the climax where she's shot and falls to her death. Another scene is the ending between Deckard and Roy. The never ending rain and as previously said, the darkness and broken light rays by itself created a tension between the characters. Rutger Hauer portrayed Roy well, the inhumane movements, and ghastly sounds of a revengeful replicant.
This film was enjoyable to watch despite the time it was made in because it felt very ahead of its time, or perhaps the film defied time itself. It was confusing at certain points to understand more deeply on a futuristic level as it confused me with modern day beings. Blade Runner proved impressive with its filming technique for its realistic flying cars and ships. To imagine that it was all shot from a mini toy really surprises me, similar to the film The Nightmare Before Christmas. Blade Runner ended well with its continuing mysteriousness of whether if Deckard is a replicant or not."

The camera angles give a point of view of how they feel and how they are acting, it also helps with a lot of the special effects such as making small things look much bigger to create a setting . The setting is is stylized into a science fiction film, the setting suggests a cold empty world, the unicorn that is a fantasy has symbolic meanings to show you that deckard is really a nexus robot they do not exactly tell you this but that is the importance of the unicorn to hint and show you that he really is a nexus. The shot distances can make close up things seem much larger than they are such as cars and buildings they will have close up shots on smaller things to appear larger, the purpose they serve is due to budget and the fact that they can not use digital editing for things.
The purpose of the music in the film is too cause suspense and to make things more tense or more relaxed depending on the situation, when the music gets intense it makes u focus more and get on edge because you know something is about to happen that is going to be important,it helps to shape our interpretation by giving suspenseful music during an important part of the movie and helps you get a feel of the meaning of the the moment in that movie and helps to reinforce the scene."

","As someone who grew up in the 2000s, I have not seen many movies that were made like Blade Runner. Blade Runner did a lot of great things with special effects that you would not expect a movie from 1982 be able to do with the lack of computer programs to assist them. For the most part the special effects were fairly believable, even now in 2019. The people who made the movie did a really good job making the movie believable for the most part, but there are some aspects of the movie that I find hard to believe.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in Los Angeles in 2019, and in a very dark and rainy world. I do not recall seeing any sunlight throughout the entirety of the movie, which played a big role in setting the mood of the movie as a very down and emotionless time. The emotionless mood that I get from the rainy weather and lack of sunlight ties well into the emotionless state that the replicants live in with a lack of memory and a struggle to handle emotions. The Los Angeles that was depicted in 2019, is vastly different than current day Los Angeles supposedly set at the same time. The Los Angeles depicted in the movie is very congested with skyscrapers reaching high into the skies in every scene that shows the surroundings. The city in the movie was overcrowded with no nature or wildlife anywhere, the only life was the humans and replicants. Current day Los Angeles on the other hand has plenty of nature and wildlife. The actual city is not so overcrowded and polluted as the Los Angeles in the movie.<br/><br/>The plot at times was difficult to understand and easy to get confused with while watching. Blade Runner is a movie that you should watch very closely or else you are going to get lost in the plot very quickly. There was times in the movie that I was confused who was who and what was currently happening in the movie, Blade Runner is definitely not a movie to throw on in the background while doing something else. I do not think it is the fault of the movie creators that the movie is confusing at times, rather it is the viewer not paying enough attention closely. It is partially the movie creators fault, but not as much as the audience is most likely at fault for not staying focused on the movie.<br/><br/>Overall I thought the movie was enjoyable and everyone should give it a watch. It was different from any movie I've seen before, most likely due to the time I grew up. It has great special effects for its time. Although the audience can get lost in the movie at times, as long as you watch closely and try to enjoy the movie, anyone can enjoy this movie."

Blade Runner
The movie Blade Runner was directed by Ridley Scott in 1982. It is a science fiction film based in the future, where a war against mankind and superficial humanoids is taking place. These human like creatures are called replicants, and have nearly exact mannerisms to a human, however, they feel no emotion. The only way to differentiate a replicant from a human was to run a test consisting of multiple questions aimed to revoke emotion and monitor them with a device that measures pupil dilation, capillary refill, and other physical signs to show emotion. If no emotion is sensed they are killed, or retired. In this movie four replicants stole a spaceship and are on a quest to find their creator. It is up to a retired blade runner to find them and retire them.
This movie is set on what the future was thought to look like in Los Angeles. It had very strong Japanese elements from clothing, store signs, billboards, and many languages were fused together to create one form of dialect. There were many futuristic forms of technology throughout the movie such as flying police cars. Characters did not have one style, rather every character had their own distinct way of dressing. Some characters such as the main character dressed fairly normal, while other characters wore heavy eye makeup and adorned themselves in unusual jewelry. The women in the advertisements displayed were dressed as geishas. The tone of this movie was a serious one and at times it was slightly violent. One of the opening scenes was a man doing a test on the replicant, and then the replicant shot and killed him when he could not answer questions about his mom. The main character throughout the movie narrates his thoughts. This reminded me of those black and white detective movies from the 60s. The setting and special effects of this movie are far ahead of other movies made in the 80s. The special effects are superb for its time, everything from the scene in a lab for replicant eyes to flying cars to the special effects makeup. If made today, however, with the technology and cgi we have today I personally believe more could be done in this movie, more creatures could be created to emphasis other planets have been discovered and colonized, the outfits could be given a Hunger Games Capital esque to them, and the violent scenes could have been made more realistic.
In conclusion, Blade Runner was an amazing film for its time. Everything from character development, to scene cuts, to setting and props, it is obvious a lot of effort and work was put into this film. This movie was rated R then but nowadays it would probably be PG13 due to today's society being less sensitized to nudity and violence. It was an excellent movie although hard to follow at times. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys futuristic sci fi."

","Blade Runner is set in a future Los Angeles 2019. Blade runner's primary antagonists are human-like replicants programmed with knowledge of their artificiality. Replicants are continually evolving to the point that they have reached the intelligence level of their human equivalents. They were developed for slave labor for humanity. Before the events of Blade Runner, replicants were outlawed on Earth after a few cases of replicants attacking humans.<br/><br/>
The atmosphere of the movies is very moody although the streets are filled with neon signs, the visual characteristic is its pervasive night and enduring rain, with smoke filling virtually every scene, inside or outside.<br/><br/>
Blade Runner is set in 2019, and they had a vision of what the future would look like, but since we are currently living in 2019, it is not accurate because we do not walk in the streets with futuristic clothes, we are not close to making duplicates of our selves. One thing they were guessed right is the fact that Los Angeles is overpopulated.<br/><br/>The movie contains multiple symbols; one of these symbols is the unicorn. Unicorns are a symbol of purity and a dream, and in blade runner, it signifies that Deckard is dreaming thinking he could be with Rachael because she will not live.<br/><br/>
I think the characters are dressed in the past, for example, Racheal with the puffed shoulders suit and Deckard with his trench coat. The makeup on the characters is very dark and edgy.<br/><br/>The lighting in Blade Runner is minimal and ambient. The lighting added to the setting, the mood of the characters, and the overall atmosphere of the film.<br/><br/>Different camera angles were used to emphasized characters emotions, sometimes creating a glow in their faces and add colors to the eyes."

","In reviewing the film Blade Runner, made in 1982, it is interesting to look at the time period it was meant to portray. It was made to be set in 2019, and it being 2019 currently makes this movie appealing to look into. Even though this movie did not accurately predict what present day society would be like, the movie did an amazing job of portraying a futuristic society. From immense skyscrapers to flying cars to replicants of people, the audience is made to believe this alternate universe will exist in the future regardless of when this future may be. This movie largely focuses on this in depth future and details of the society and less on conflict between characters. The movie does not have as much action as I was expecting considering that Harrison Ford's, Deckard's, mission was to eliminate the existing replicants on Earth. Personally, I thought the build up to conflict between characters was slow because of the large focus on setting the mood for the film and society. The setting of this movie was gloomy and mysterious. This is set through the constant rain and dim lighting in the film. Since most of the movie is dark and in the shadows, the points of the movie that are illuminated show their importance in regards to a visual appeal. I also feel like the characters add to the mood of the movie in a beneficial way. Deckard's mindset and personality in the movie is very bland which may stem from the idea presented at the end of the movie. Other characters like Tyrell also seem very emotionless in the film. His role as an intellectual and designer of the replicants is accurately portrayed through his bland emotion. Another way the tone is set in the movie is through the soundtrack. The majority of the music in the film contains a saxophone and does a very good job at portraying mystery along with showing the goal of Deckard trying to complete his mission. This music combined with the characters as well as the tone portrayed through the setting contribute to the gloomy society that is meant to be depicted. I personally think that this mood is executed well and I think that these features are the highlights of the movie."
"rubaykaykay","6","0","3","6 May 2019"," A Review: by Me
","Before I begin, let me state that I am writing this movie review because my teacher assigned me to. However, the following statements are my honest opinions. In this of Blade Runner review, I will be discussing three different topics: aesthetics, costuming, and setting.
Throughout the entire movie, one thing that really stood out to me was the overall aesthetics of the film. Everything is dark. Most of the lighting is dark and heavily plays on shadows. The weather is also gloomy, and the presence of rain further darkens most scenes. The entire movie is colored by shades of black and gray. For example, in the scenes where Rick is walking through streets, most of the buildings are gray, and they loom over the people walking below them. Rick's apartment also competes for the title of darkest setting in the movie. The walls are painted gray, and the corners are dark enough to conceal a person. However, the gloomiest, darkest, grayest (if that's a word), most depressing scene is the rooftop fight scene, where Roy speaks his last words. The message delivered here, that memories will eventually fade, is just as dark as the aesthetics. The lighting and scenery accompanies the darkness of the theme of Blade Runner.
The people of Blade Runner are dressed mostly in black, allowing characters to retreat into shadows. The black attire is so uniform, that I almost feel like there's a rule that outlaws colorful clothes or that all characters are stuck in their middle school emo phases. Although, I do understand how the dark clothes help push the theme and aesthetics of the movie. I do like how the main fashion trend is sort of a 1940's rich white woman meets a 1990's leather jacket wearing teenager. The costumes help draw attention to the importance of the characters in the movie. Rachel's dress is exactly that- her dress. The structure fits her perfectly and allows her to make a silent statement when she enters a scene. Rick wears a long leather coat that adds drama to action scenes.
Lastly, I wanted to compare the setting of Blade Runner with today. The movie is set in 2019, and is it currently 2019... This is kind of like the whole Back to the Future comparison. Obviously, the writers and producers didn't see 2019 being that dark and uniform, but the robot aspect might have been expected. The film came out in 1982, so the prediction of creating some sort of robotic human within 40 years is reasonable. We do have bionic prosthetics and Hanson Robotic's Sophia, but our robotic development isn't as realistic as predicted in Blade Runner. They also have an underlying theme that in this version of the future, people aren't really individuals with a purpose. At this point, most people are just living because they're alive. I find it ironic that the people who really value their memories and lives are the robots."
"lalacapozzi","7","0","2","5 May 2019"," No longer able to suspend disbelief
","In 1982, Disney's ""futuristic"" park, EPCOT, opened, Time Magazine's Man of the Year was THE COMPUTER, and personal technology is starting to advance. On the cusp of the digital age, Blade Runner was released in that same year. Blade Runner takes place in 2019, making it an interpretation of the oncoming future, a result of the advancements of technology beginning to take place at the time the film was released. When released the film entertained not just through the action and plot line, but the fact that it legitimately could be foreshadowing the true future.
Today in 2019, Blade Runner is unable to captivate audiences in the same way because how the world is portrayed in the year 2019 in the film is not at all how the world is 2019. The film is dark nearly the entire time which serves its purpose well of creating an ominous and dark feeling about the future throughout the film, however all of those alive today know that the sun is not blacked out day and night by industrialization. This movie said to take place only 37 years after its release, was doomed from the beginning to lose its power of suspending disbelief in its audiences.
Blade Runner's plot can be summed up into one sentence: Deckard is faced with killing the person he loves while he tries to stay alive himself. The concept of this movie is incredibly interesting and thought provoking in the sense that predicts such a dire future, however, the resolution of the film is completely focused on Deckard getting to be with the woman he loves. When this resolution happens, it suddenly makes the thought-provoking parts of the movie seem less interesting.
Additionally, in today's world, most are horribly desentized to violence and other things that in 1982 were considered shocking (i.e. nakedness in film), making the parts of Blade Runner that would have originally been controversial and eye-grabbing, uninteresting. In 1982, Blade Runner was an amazing futuristic movie, but today it is hard to stay focused on for a general audience."

"mrsaturn-80983","8","0","1","26 January 2019"," A dystopian noir done well
","""Blade runner"" is a film that has a alot of short comings but overall it still holds up very well to this day. In the far future of 2019, artificial intelligence created by humans known as replicants have gone rogue, Officer Deckard (Harrison Ford) is sent to take care of the 4 replicants. This movie sets the tone for what's in store in the 1st few minutes. It opens with some exposition and it leaves you wondering what the replicants are capable of. Let me first say that this movie is absolutely gorgeous, the visuals are the main star of this movie. Ridley Scott did a fantastic job of creating a dystopian world. The cinematography is stunning and it overshadows everything in this film. The main character Deckard(Harrison Ford) is fairly uninteresting his motives are unclear most of the time, and Harrison Ford's acting is quite mediocre in this film. He never truly feels like a fleshed out individual, he is always seen with no emotion and a bottle of liquor in his hands. All of the replicants do a great job of being emotionless except when needed. Deckards love interest throughout the film isn't even aware that she is a replicant which makes you feel attached to the character. The replicants are afraid of death, which makes them feel as if they are real humans with emotions. The two antagonists during the end of the film do a great job. The male relpicant especially does an exceptional job. He comes off as being not human but he shows so much emotion through anger and fear. Overall this movie does a good job on setting up a good noir film, but not every question is answered and the ending just brings more questions."

The story develops around a ""Blade Runner"" who is assigned to stop this threat. The movie then brilliantly blurs the difference between the humanoids and humans. This is achieved by showing relationships between the humanoids and humans. Also the extreme difficulty of detecting the humanoids and their high level of human function further confuses the issues of what is to be human. Many ethical questions are presented especially with the shoot to kill on sight no questions asked elimination of the humanoids by the authorities.

"zfoxer","10","0","1","14 April 2018"," How the future looks like...
","""Time enough""...<br/><br/>This is a sci-fi classic that stood the test of time. It became a classic due to the great representation of a dystopia, i.e., a projection of the future that creates mixed feelings. Great technological advancements, and on the other hand, misery and low quality of living (actually... survival). The wealthy people abandoned the earth for other planets due to the depletion of resources. It is inhabited now by the poor, what is today... the cultures of the developing world. The way this environment is depicted and the human responses it triggers, created a uniqueness that made the movie a cult classic. <br/><br/>The scenario is of lower importance. Eventhough it is strong, it is there just to exhibit this great dystopia. Most actors play their roles in a satisfying way. The fact that some of them play replicants (bio-engineered humans), doesn't deter them for portraying vivid human behaviour (like sarcasm, fear and protective instincts, among others). This is a key factor for the success of the movie, i.e., not behaving in a mechanical style that lacks human traits. They are still humans and this is connected to the audience in a great extent.<br/><br/>Another integral part of the movie's DNA is the soundtrack by Vangelis. The former is difficult to exist without the latter and vice versa. It adds a great soundscape to the environment that provokes a feeling of melancholy and paranoia. Consider as an example the death moment of the replicant leader. The electronics (mostly analogue synthesisers) of the early '80s are exploited to their limits providing a timeless experience.<br/><br/>There's no other movie or series that comes even close to this dystopia. All attempts have failed miserably. There's a surprising exception though which is a trilogy of computer adventure games of the '90s by the main title ""Tex Murphy"". Their representation of this environment is majestic. <br/><br/>...""Time to die""!"

"Comic_Central","8","0","2","30 January 2018"," Excellent Idea for a Sci-Fi Movie!
","When I was first going into watching Blade Runner I had very high hopes for the movie as of all the praise that the series got and the hype that the sequel was getting and I have to say it was one amazing movie.<br/><br/>Lets start off with the writing of his. The writing was well done and created a universe that is believable but also futuristic and unreal at the same time. I think that not all that credit can go to the writers though and i can in part go to the wonderful directing done by Ridley Scott. The story arcs of every character seemed to have a beginning, middle and end. These story arcs flowed well and allowed the villain of this movie to get a good amount of screen time. I prefer movies that hide the villain in the shadows but show them off in a few scenes that leads up to the final dramatic showdown between the hero and the villain and this movie delivers just that. If the villain is great though we need to have a equal hero as well and that's just what we got. Rick Deckard was a interesting character to follow and his character was intriguing and made me want to find out more about him as a character. The only bad thing I have to say about the writing is that the movie did seem to drag at points and became a bit boring in parts. To the point where I was very eager for something that was interesting to happen again. These parts did seem to come and go faster than some movies in modern day cinema. Also the character named Gaff seemed a little underdeveloped and I would have liked to see his character fleshed out a little bit more.<br/><br/>Now lets look at the acting and the cast of this movie. The acting for this movie was incredible. I don't have any flaws I can pick out from this. There was that scene where Rick Deckard did bad acting but this was done on purpose by Harrison Ford. It takes a good actor to portray a character that's bad at acting. The cast was also a amazing cast that consisted of Hollywood greats such as Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Rutger Hauer, Edward James Olmos and Daryl Hannah.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting much from the special effects and was actually expecting some quite bad effects whether it was practical or not. But what was in the movie was incredible for the year it was made in. (In case your wondering it was made in 1982). The effects still hold up today unlike the original Star wars effects which look a bit odd in today's cinema. Ridley Scott's unique directing style reminded me of the tone and vibes of what i got from The Watchmen. When Rick Deckard is climbing up the building to the roof in the final showdown scene the lighting, the cinematography, the music and the overall tone of it was very similar to that of how The Watchmen tone is.<br/><br/>The ending and start of the movie are arguably the two most important parts of the movie. This movie did it very well. The start drew me in and already made me interested in the Blade Runner universe and the final battle was crafted beautifully. I really liked the part where Rick Decakrd got some of his fingers broken because it made it seem more realistic and didnt make the hero/main character have too easy of a win. One of the choices in this final fight was strange though. This choice was having Roy Batter push his head through a wall. This part made me laugh more than it did make me feel on the edge of my seat and into the fight. Before and after he stopped having his head sticking through the wall had me on the edge of my seat though. The very last scene did seem to end the movie abruptly and I think that just ten more seconds could have giving it a much more satisfying ending though. That is just me though.<br/><br/>In conclusion this movie was fantastic with a few errors and problems and added up. But altogether this movie was entertaining and enjoyable. I am very eager to see what is done with the universe in the future whether it is another sequel or a comic or book series. With everything considered this movie gets a 8/10."

","We follow the Bladerunner Rick Deckard, who's job is to find the engineered humans also known as replicants and retire (kill) them. So the question only came up once for me during the duration of the film, but once you look into the details, I feel like it's clear that Rick is also a replicant. especially after hearing that last line in the end where Gaff says ""you did a mans job"". You would only say that to someone non human right? 
I think on a deeper level, this film is questioning life. Are we all robots who are programmed to think we're not or are we actually what we call humans. It's an interesting topic once you start thinking about it. And there wouldn't be just one answer to this question, especially if you involve things like religion. 
""I think, there for I am"" is such an interesting saying and line, first time I heard it was in philosophy class 5 years ago and it gave me some flashbacks to those really deep discussions. I really liked the film, and I've come to realise more recently that a lot of the films made in the 80's - 90's are really freakin' good. 
This film gave me some mix vibe of films like Star Wars, The Terminator, The Matrix. Great film! I would have given it 10 stars if it wasn't for some very slow scenes, I thought they could have cut out."

"tara_namiq","9","0","2","4 January 2018"," Simply a thrilling and exceptional film
","I think Blade Runner is simply a thrilling and exceptional film. The brilliantly crafted Sci-fi extravaganza, directed by Ridley Scott is based on a blade runner named Rick Deckard, played by Harrison Ford. He is given the quest to hunt down and kill four cyborgs, known as replicants: Pris, Leon, Zhora and Roy who is their leader. The deep philosophical questions that arise from watching the film makes it more interesting: ""What happens after death?"", ""What makes us human?"" and ""What's the purpose of this life?"". The director raises these questions but doesn't proceed to answer them in the film. The ambiguity of the film is what makes it successful as the audience are left with a cliffhanger.<br/><br/>Films are a popular source of entertainment due to the use of sound, visuals, body language, tone and expression of voice. This is effective in creating mood, conveying emotion and getting the audience thinking. An affordance of the film medium is its cinematography which is defined as ""writing in movement"" (Bordwell 2013:160). In the film noir, strong backlighting, light shafts, contrast and rain were used in most scenes to give the film its personality and an atmosphere of uncertainty which is the films main theme.<br/><br/>""Light is central to creating the mood or atmosphere of a scene and can be used to highlight certain elements"" (Monaco 2009:86). The heavy use of neon lights, smoke and thick fogs combined with shots of towering buildings and police cars flying in line with air traffic, helped create a futuristic city that the audience could believe in. The use of smoke and black and white effect helped create a perfect setting for the film. It showed the future Los Angeles to be a gloomy, polluted, ghetto and rainswept city full of litter. The angles in which the streets were captured in, made the people appear like ants, giving a sense of an overcrowded street. Again, this gave the audience a glimpse of the what the future will be like. The cast were amazing in bringing their characters to life which added a lot to the coldness and darkness in the futuristic city.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is another affordance of the film medium as it gives off a mood-controlling effect and captures the tone and theme of the film. ""The soundtrack carries the film; the images are dominated by it"" (Monaco 2009:181). The soundtrack by Vangelis in the Blade Runner helps represent a dark and gloomy world of uncertainty. In the scenes between Rachel and Deckard, the music is soft with the piano playing in the background to give a feeling of intimacy. Whereas, in other scenes, there is a more fast pace synth heavy track that works well with all dynamic movement amongst the characters. In the scene where Deckard retires Zhora, the combination of the slow motion with the blade runner blues playing in the background shines a light on the cold nature of the killing which gives it more emphasis.<br/><br/>Overall, the Blade Runner is a masterpiece and deserves credit and remembrance for its breathtaking effects, the deep philosophical story, amazing cast and its dark, atmospheric tone throughout. I would definitely recommend watching the Blade Runner as I believe it to be one of the deepest and greatest science fiction films ever made."

","A classic Sci Fi that is a must watch for fans of the genre. The film leaves you with an eerie feeling that sticks with you after viewing. Harrison Ford is nails and delivers a powerful performance. The romance between him and Rachel is palpable and they put together some of the best romantic scenes I have ever seen. The film has a powerful message that isn't preachy, but rather nuanced and cautionary. It forces the viewer to examine the human condition.<br/><br/>This is one of my all time favorite movies and really stands the test of time well. The story is coherent, the acting superb, the writing is intelligent and the characters are engrossing. If you haven't seen this film, go watch it now."

","A compelling, dreamlike exploration of what it really means to be human... Does the key lie in our memories? Experiences? Capacity for mercy and love? Even characters with small roles are well-developed and memorable, and the grungy futuristic setting conveys a distinctive mood that complements character development and action rather than distracting from it. The pacing allows plenty of time for reflection (and to soak up the haunting soundtrack) without dragging. All in all, a transcendent viewing experience."

","Something has happened between 1982 and 2019 that has turned arid LA into grimy Tacoma but that is the least of former cop Rick Decker's (Harrison Ford) problems as he grudgingly takes a job whacking replicants, robots imbued with identical human features and actions. Seems four of them rebelled somewhere beyond earth, killing their masters and now were heading for home. Deckard is an expert on replicants and hates them as part of a warped technology that has ruined the universe yet he falls for one (Sean Young). It does not cloud his thinking however as he ruthlessly pursues and ""retires"" the replicants.<br/><br/>Submerged in futuristic noir ambiance and with Ford our stoic Bogart, Blade Runner is an entertaining vicarious midway shooting gallery where the hunted are mere robots. None are programmed very nice to begin with as Deckard dispatches them amid shadow, neon and rain when in the film's climactic moment Roy the replicant played by Rutger Hauer is allowed a King Kong moment of provocative introspection. <br/><br/>Ford is a lot darker than his Solo in this futuristic manhunt, more cynical, sarcastic and finer in a different way. Sean Young has the right fatale look, Hauer is intense and M.Emmett Walsh gives it a real noir stamp with brief his presence.<br/><br/>The real star of the picture though is the dazzling production design provided by Laurence Paul along with the art direction of Paul Snyder, some wonderful special effects and if I can step away from my snobbery, an impressive music score by Vangellis.<br/><br/>With much of everything in order however Director Scott allows the film to run a solid half hour too long forsaking the compact storytelling that noir crime dramas depend. Add to this the fact most of the main characters are robots Blade Runner simply runs too long for the same payoff reducing the punch while admittedly giving us more time to admire the impressive furniture."

","One of the most influential works of sci-fi & a prime example of neo-noir cinema, Blade Runner is an impeccable blend of jaw-dropping art direction, groundbreaking special effects, breathtaking photography, stellar sound & iconic score, and was way ahead of its time.<br/><br/>Set in 2019 Los Angeles, the story follows a retired cop whose former job was to hunt down & ""retire"" bioengineered androids called replicants, manufactured to be used as slaves in off-world colonies. But when four replicants commit mutiny, he is called out of retirement to track & eliminate them.<br/><br/>Directed by Ridley Scott, Blade Runner showcases his obsession with details better than any of his works. Every set piece is refined to smallest of details and plays a key role in magnifying the film's overall look & feel. Scott unfolds things at a slow pace but neither its plot nor characters are as compelling as its futuristic setting.<br/><br/>From the technical standpoint, Blade Runner is a marvel. Production design is one of its highlights that effectively bring its dystopian setting to life. The rain-soaked, polluted surrounding is an inspired choice while the apt use of color palette & ideal lighting amplify the visuals greatly. Special effects work is top-notch while Vangelis' synthesized score brims with a quality of its own.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Harrison Ford plays Deckard with panache but it's the actor and not the script that makes this character stand out. Sean Young plays her part with a touch of innocence. Rutger Hauer's character doesn't seem interesting at first yet he is the one who leaves the most lasting impression of all in the end. And the rest deliver fine support in their given roles.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Blade Runner has aged remarkably well over the years and looks as spellbinding today as it did at its time of release. But its plot & characters lack that same level of sophistication from Scott, and the glacial pace makes it a frustrating sit. I appreciate a lot many things about it and do get its legacy but its story never stimulated me as deeply as its technical accomplishments did. Multiple viewings advised."

","'BLADE RUNNER' - 1982<br/><br/>Directed by Ridley Scott<br/><br/>Starring Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer and Sean Young<br/><br/>Plot Overview: Deckard (Harrison Ford) is forced by the police Boss (M. Emmet Walsh) to continue his old job as Replicant Hunter. His assignment: eliminate four escaped Replicants from the colonies who have returned to Earth. Before starting the job, Deckard goes to the Tyrell Corporation and he meets Rachel (Sean Young), a Replicant girl he falls in love with.<br/><br/>Let me start of by saying that I watched the Theatrical Cut of this movie. Not the Director's Cut or The Final Cut but the original cut that people saw in theatres back in 1982. And to be quite honest, I was disappointed. Perhaps my expectations were too high but I was just so disappointed by this film. Don't tell me that I need to watch The Final Cut to see the greatness in this film because that is redundant. The ORIGINAL Cut shown in theatres SHOULD be the best cut available so if they need to add to it then that is not right. Alas, I will try to watch The Final Cut and whatnot but if you think I'm being overly harsh or that I hated it, there is your answer. And I will stand by what I say.<br/><br/>Firstly, let me say that this is not a bad movie. By no means is it a bad movie. In fact, there isn't really anything offensively bad in the movie and pretty much everything works really well. For starters, it's a gorgeous looking movie. I won't lie when I say that Ridley Scott isn't my favourite director of all time and that I don't think he's the visual genius many paint him as. Alas, this is a beautiful movie. The visual effects, the sharp editing, the excellent cinematography, the rustic theme of costume and sets; all of this combines together to make a visual treat, and that is my greatest strength in this movie.<br/><br/>Next, the acting in this movie is great. Harrison Ford was pretty good as Deckard but I really don't think that this is even remotely his best role. He will always be Indiana Jones for me and nothing will ever change that BUT, I do definitely admire his performance in this. Then there is Rutger Hauer. Hauer delivers a truly exceptional performance and gives one of the better improvised monologues that I've ever seen. It IS an sensational performance and I give all credit for it to the actor, not Scott or the writing. Young was pretty good in the movie but I didn't connect to her in any way. In fact, I didn't really feel an emotional investment to any of the characters in this movie. None of them stood out as particularly well written and, while all the performances were good, none of them were that memorable. Hauer's character came the closest to being memorable but even his character was just above average. <br/><br/>The story and premise are also pretty decent. The ending is up for debate on it's 'greatness' but I found it okay. I wasn't particularly wowed by anything they did though. The world they setup was a very interesting one and I would look forward to visiting it again. But, the story surrounding this world was just alright. It wasn't that impressive and it was just kinda of okay. It was fine but that is all it was.<br/><br/>Perhaps I was overly critical of this movie. Perhaps. But if I've been told by the masses that this film will cure me, I fully expect it to. I do recommend this movie, however. It is a decent flick but I just really didn't connect to it on the level the masses did. I'll seek out The Final Cut and whatnot and try to watch them, and If my opinion changes I'll update the review. But apart from that, I didn't like the movie much. It looks nice, is well acted and has good world building but I just didn't care for it. Unfortunate really but I wont be revisiting this film anytime soon unless it is in the form of a different cut. I'll rate 'Blade Runner' 7 'Tin Foil Origami' out of 10, and I will recommend it; against my personal enjoyment levels. Purely because it is actually a solid film, I'll recommend it."

","This (as well as the sequel out in cinemas right now) are very existential. And for a Science Fiction movie, this holds up more than just well. I re-watched it recently (two of the multiple cuts) and the visuals are still stunning, eve more so if you consider the 35 plus years that have passed since this was made (and then released).<br/><br/>But you can't reduce this just to the visuals, it is about humanity, it is about existence, it is about many questions all woven into the story of Deckard, who is out to 'retire' Replicants. Harrison Ford has some impressive CV and this is not just another notch in the belt. I remember also vaguely playing the PC game sometimes in the 90s. It was really good though had nothing to do with the movie itself.<br/><br/>Many have interpreted this in many different ways. Especially with all the endings out there. Ridley Scott gives an insight into what he was out in his audio commentary. And if you can get the complete set, with an exhaustive amount of extras do so. Also do watch the sequel on a big screen (IMAX preferably)"
"mailboss","8","0","3","9 October 2017"," Unfortunately Disappointing But Still Great
","After reading Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, I finally watched Blade Runner at a double feature last week. While it was really great, I couldn't help but be disappointed in it, primarily because of how much I'd expected it to be the most grandiose piece of sci-fi ever seen, thanks to how unbelievably hyped up it is, but it just felt remarkably shallow in all kinds of philosophical discussions when compared to the book, not that they should be massively compared.<br/><br/>A movie should stand completely alone from a book it is based on, and I'm trying not to link them too closely together here, but it's hard because the best draw of the book was how much it had to say in 200 pages, and the movie just has very little to say on humans and existence, period, making what I'd hoped to be the best part really just one of many good things in the movie.<br/><br/>However, the film is a technical masterpiece. This is one of the greatest technical achievements in film. Everything looks unbelievably realistic, and makes the future feel incredible grounded. The neon lights and expansive cityscapes make for some of the most striking visuals I've ever seen in a sci-fi movie.<br/><br/>Rutger Hauer pulls off the best possible performance he could've for this character. He is easily the best character in the movie, and the movie as a whole makes Roy Batty an interesting case study, which the book really doesn't do at all.<br/><br/>Where the book and the movie both flounder though, is creating believable romance between Deckard and Rachael. In the book, however, this is not a central piece of the plot, and instead of just being sudden and weak-ish, feels incredibly off-putting and bizarre in the movie. The implications of them falling in love is still interesting, and that's easily the best part about Deckard's character in the movie, but it still doesn't make it a compelling love plot.<br/><br/>The way the plot is set up is incredibly standard too. ""Here are four guys you need to kill; have fun."" And there is no mystery or sleuthing in this cyberpunk noir, save one hilarious scene of Harrison Ford enhancing an image to ridiculous levels over five minutes.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford is decent here, but is let down by incredibly weak character writing and a few strange acting decisions. His character is incredibly weak and bland, which was sad considering how many interesting dynamics there are with the Rick Deckard of the book.<br/><br/>In the end, absolutely stellar production design and world detail elevates a decent story with decent writing and one really great aspect of the plot."

","I wasn't sure which version to choose but landed on the final cut for this review. I remember seeing the film at a much young age but not understanding much of it at the time. I read Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? a few years ago and enjoyed it as I do most of the author's work. The world built in Ridley Scott's film and the novel along with the complex philosophical questions proposed by this work of fiction make this piece of entertainment more engaging than just simple sci-fi or action movie. The film begins with a block of text explaining that the Tyrell Corporation has advanced artificial intelligence to a stage where they are equal if not better than humans. The resulting replicants are used in off- world colonization until a violent mutiny makes them outlaws on the planet Earth. Blade Runners are bounty hunters that hunt down these replicants.<br/><br/>The initial scene shows Leon Kowalski (Brion James) undergoing a strange interview about a turtle flipped over in the desert and his memory of his mother when Leon stands up and shoots the interviewer. Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is eating noodles when Gaff (Edward James Olmos) picks him up in his flying car. The skyline is enchanting and the visuals in this film are still stunning twenty-five years later. Deckard receives an assignment from Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh) over whiskey. Skin-jobs, the derisive term for replicants, have taken over a ship and snuck back on Earth. Deckard refuses because he quit the job of being a blade runner but Bryant threatens him into cooperating. Deckard is given a list of Nexus 6 replicants to hunt down and heads to the Tyrell Corporation headquarters to test the Voight-Kampff machine to see if it can identify a replicant or human.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"

","Blade Runner is a great detective, sci-fi, and action movie. Thera are problem. The romance in the movie feels forced, and two or three characters ought to have more detailed motivations and design. However, I cannot quite imagine someone not enjoying this movie. The movie excels in visuals and plot. When I began the movie, I double checked to make sure it is indeed made in 1982, and not a modern remake. My concerns are not rootless: the movie has simply splendid visual effects that it is truly timeless. Every scene, and almost every frame, can be captured and analyzed as a award-winning photograph. The plot is also awesome. I would say the pacing of the first act feels weird, but as the movie goes on the tempo gets intense and plot works a lot better. Most characters feel real and I understand the motives behind them. It is not flawless, and several things felt quite cliché and stupid. However, whatever troubles they might have, the character design works and it improves flow of the plot, unlike Star Wars A New Hope, which also stars Harris Ford, but gives everyone the laziest conceivable character. The music is awesome. I will definitely steal some of the scores here to my own film. The robots are great in capturing attention and the film uses them to discuss mortality and identity. In conclusion, the film is definitely worth watching. Two point off, first because of the sometimes sloppy character design, and the other point off for the pacing of the first act."

Its a modernist blues song -Or Miles Davis ""Blue In Green"" done with a camera. <br/><br/>The tale of sentient life forms that are treated as slaves, owned like property, and not worthy of humanity, comes straight from the blues.

They are simply two lost, and confused beings that have found warmth together in the cold world - Who cant feel that?!!<br/><br/>Add all the other layers, and of course the incredibly beautiful score by Vangelis, and you have one of the greatest films ever made.

","2017 marks the 35th anniversary of the original release of ""Blade Runner"", and also the year that its long-rumored sequel, ""Blade Runner 2049"" will be released (later in the Fall). In anticipation of that, I decided that I needed to see the original, which I hadn't seen in several decades (if not longer). Of course, when we talk about the original movie, what we really mean is the definitive ""Director's Cut"" that was released 10 years ago (to commemorate the 25th anniversary).<br/><br/>""Blade Runner: The Final Cut"" (117 min.) opens with the reminder that it is ""Los Angeles 2019"" (yes, only 2 years from now!), and we get the stunning introduction to what the City of Angels has become. It's not long before we are introduced to the Harrison Ford character, a guy who is running down "" human-like replicants"". Couple of thought on seeing this movie again after all this time: 1. ""Blade Runner"" is NOT an action movie (although there is some of that), but rather a neo-noir psychological drama and character study. It's no wonder that US audiences didn't warm up to the original release all that much, expecting a sci-fi action movie. yes, it's sci-fi, but there the comparison stops. 2. The movie's visuals and photography are stunning still, even after 35 years. 3. It is absolutely remarkable how much cigarette smoking takes place, throughout the entire movie no less. This is surely one thing that Ridley Scott got totally wrong. But on the other hand, his premonition of climate change (even though that term didn't exist yet in 1982) was in the right direction (and supposedly will be even more central in the 2049 sequel). 4. Scott's version of LA 2019 has it as a mostly Asian, Tokyo-reminding, city. 5. The soundtrack from Vangelis remains as majestic now as it was then. 6. Last but certainly not least, it's amazing to see the lead performers (Harrison Ford, Darryl Hannah, Sean Young, Rutger Hauer) so.... young!<br/><br/>Bottom line: ""Blade Runner"" circa 1982 was far ahead of its time. Now in 2017, it feels a lot more 'contemporary'. I have no idea what to expect from ""Blade Runner 2049"", but I can only hope it's not ""just another sci-fi action movie""."

","There is many versions of this film. The first version I saw was the 1992 ""Director's Cut"". However Ridley Scott really did not like this version he created his ""Final Cut"". For that version he shot more footage for this version. He did this 20 + years later after the inital filming of the ground breaking classic. <br/><br/>This film is a visual wonder. In Los Angeles in November 2019, ex- police officer Rick Deckard is detained by officer Gaff and brought to his former supervisor, Bryant. Deckard, whose job as a ""Blade Runner"" was to track down bioengineered beings known as replicants and ""retire"" (a euphemism for killing) them, is informed that four have come to Earth illegally. As Tyrell Corporation Nexus-6 models, they have only a four-year lifespan and may have come to Earth to try to extend their lives.<br/><br/>Deckard watches a video of a Blade Runner named Holden administering the ""Voight-Kampff"" test designed to distinguish replicants from humans based on their emotional response to questions. The test subject, Leon, shoots Holden after Holden asks about Leon's mother. Bryant wants Deckard to retire Leon and the other three replicants: Roy Batty, Zhora, and Pris. Deckard initially refuses, but after Bryant ambiguously threatens him, he reluctantly agrees.<br/><br/>Deckard begins his investigation at the Tyrell Corporation to ensure that the test works on Nexus-6 models. While there, he discovers that Eldon Tyrell's assistant Rachael is an experimental replicant who believes herself to be human. Rachael has been given false memories to provide an ""emotional cushion"". As a result, a more extensive test is required to determine whether she is a replicant."
"asifahsankhan","10","0","1","2 June 2017"," Ridley Scott's Stylish Dystopian Masterpiece!
","Ridley's visionary portrait of a futuristic Los Angeles 2019 (more like Tokyo City, Japan to me) with its looming video-screened high-rises, neon- lit blimps, and rain-spattered noodle shops where the ordinary JOE's eat. <br/><br/>As one of Britain's finest ever films, ""Blade Runner"" went from cult classic to an universally acknowledged masterpiece. It's probably the most visually dense film, with every frame brimming with detail and vitality, every bit of chiaroscuro adding to the film's melancholy mood. And it's one hell of a Cinema landmark, which at the same time, works as a blissful 'aide-mémoire'—that some films just deserve a second freaking chance!<br/><br/>At its initial release the film was a flop. To be fair, the theatrical cut of the film contained an unnecessary Harrison Ford voice-over as well as an ending that felt a bit too conventional for a film as bold as Blade Runner. Possible Reasons: It was the 80's and let's fact it, Ford wasn't exactly Robert De Niro who can god-smack the film's audience with just his narration skills and set the tone for it entirely. The rest of the blame can be given towards the studio executives whose moronic views, unnecessary edits and constant interfering almost ruined one of 80's most famous leading member of the Brit-pack: Ridley Scott's career. However, as Ridley began to work on a cut closer to his original vision and the film began to be seen by more and more people, it became considered one of the pinnacles of science fiction in film. <br/><br/>For Ridley, this was extremely ambitious. Even today there's something about the scope and detail of the world that comes across as maddening and innovative. And the problem with ambitious creations is that not everyone is going to get it. While other Sci-Fi films from the same year (The Thing, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial) offered film audiences heavy doses of suspense, action and adventure, Blade Runner is a film where characters espouse philosophical treatises while behaving strangely.<br/><br/>Even to this day I'm astounded by how many people love this film given the fever-pitched insanity of the final act. Rutger Hauer howls like a wolf, taunts Harrison Ford in singsong, drives a nail through his hand and then gives one of the most iconic (and, if we're honest, indulgent) monologues in cinema. Even while I giddily enjoy the last few moments of the film, I sometime ask myself how so many people can end up loving something that is this esoteric and bizarre.<br/><br/>The film is saturated in melancholy, overshadowed by death and peopled by ghosts. Visually and bionically, it is awash with haematological whispers.<br/><br/>It shows a gritty, Noir-like, rain-soaked vision of a Dystopic future Los Angeles in which government sanctioned bounty-hunters (Blade Runners) are used to track down and ""retire"" human-looking robots known as Replicants. Loosely based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick, director Ridley Scott's film is a complex, thought-provoking meditation on what it means to be human. With its striking visual imagery, moody soundtrack and advanced special- effects, Blade Runner is that rare Science Fiction movie that spends as much time setting a mood as it does discussing its big ideas. And while it may not be as exciting or revolutionary as more action-oriented movies like Star Wars or The Matrix, its cerebral nature and thematic ambiguity is what has made it a cult classic and landed it atop many critics lists of the top Science Fiction movies of all time. <br/><br/>Most Film Directors, who have finished a Science-Fiction film, tend to choose something a little more down to earth for their next project. Ridley, coming off with the Academy Award winning — ""Alien (1979)"" — launched himself into something even more stylised and visually dense: ""Blade Runner (1982)"" — Hailed for its production design, depicting a ""retrofitted"" future, it remains a leading example of the Neo-Noir genre. Although the film under-performed in North American theatres, but has since become a cult classic. <br/><br/>It's a movie that announces its impending awesomeness with authority. And style. Even, Ridley himself regards Blade Runner as ""probably"" his most complete and personal film. <br/><br/>Quick, go and watch this movie before it's 2049!"

","I've been meaning to watch Blade Runner for 20 years. It didn't release in India when I was young but the movie had assumed cult status in the video library circuit in Mumbai even then. I just kept procrastinating - partly because it had been built into such an event that actually watching it would have to be a disappointment compared to what it had become in my mind. Really poor reason but that's what it is. I finally decided to watch it this summer because I know Blade Runner 2 is on it way (finally) and I couldn't not watch it. I've watched it thrice in the past 24 hours! Each time kicking myself for seeing it earlier... much earlier.<br/><br/>It is 25 years old and its still an absolute masterpiece. The visualisation and imagery that Ridley Scott brings just blows the mind - the dystopian reality (I thought the Japanese lady and the ""Enjoy Coke"" are so symbolic side by side!). Of course the view of the future - which had till then been shiny (Star Trek, Star Wars - to a lesser extent) - looks nothing but dreary. It's a crowded, multi-cultural view of the future Los Angeles - looking anything but how it looks now. Ridley Scott must have really spent a lot of money creating this vision. It is Los Angeles 2019 (now that we are nearly there - am I glad we didn't go as far down as Scott imagine ed!) - and oddly has a New York feel. Rainy, tall buildings, dense... the streets feel like basements...urban decay is at its worst<br/><br/>The characterisations are also special - but my favourite is the character of Rutger Hauer. The Replicant who teaches the human a bit of humanity. I felt there are a few gaps - perhaps because of the print I saw - in that I felt the move from Deckard as an aberrant disestablishmentarian to an obedient cop is too sudden. As also the love between Deckard and the replicant - Rachael from interrogative to something else.<br/><br/>My simple recommendation to those who have heard of this movie and not watched - wait no further. Just watch it. Of course try and answer the big question... is Deckard a Replicant?!"
"KineticSeoul","10","0","4","16 January 2017"," A sci-fi noir cyberpunk materpiece
","To sum up this film, it's a classic sci-fi masterpiece that delves deep into existential and philosophical elements. How human's will try to create slaves or beings that will do work that they don't want to do or will not do. How everyone is looking for comfort and how some people will seek pleasure and comfort even if others are affected negatively by it. How people will give up integrity and stop with the search of wisdom for wits and how to take advantage of others for their own benefits. This film might come off pretentious to some audiences with it's visuals and style of it. But I thought the visuals and style of it actually compliments the intellectual aspects of this film. Even if it lacks in dialogue, the visuals really does bring about the grim and dark reality of the future. This isn't a film that I would watch over and over again. But for it's rare watch for me, it's stunning and psychotic when it comes to the characters and the dystopian setting. Harrison Ford was the it adventure and sci-fi adventure guy in the 70's and 80's. And he was almost the perfect choice to play an ex-police officer Rick Deckard. His job as a ""Blade Runner"" is to track down and hunt for replicants, basically human clones used to serve in the colonies outside Earth. They have a very short life span and is thought of as disposable and expendable by the humans. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) is a intimidating, manipulative and violent character that I have a lot of sympathy for. He is a character that is portrayed as a villain because of the setting and situation. And yet Roy Batty is a character that just about anyone can have understanding and empathy towards. Ridley Scott tried to emulate certain aspects of ""Blade Runner"" into his few other films such as ""Prometheus"". Other artists, directors and even video gamer designers took elements from this movie. Hideo Kojima being one of them when it came to his work in ""Snatcher"" was inspired and influenced by this film. Overall this is a sci-fi noir cyberpunk masterpiece that is most definitely worth the watch.<br/><br/>10/10"

","This film is a fascinating and involving experience if the viewer has the patience to experience the film properly. It has, despite its age, a tremendous visceral impact, especially if you can see it on a big screen in the dark. The final cut of this film is definitely the best version of this Ridley Scott classic. <br/><br/>The plot mainly focuses on ideas and how the key characters in the film deal with the situation they find themselves in. The actors playing the genetically engineered human replicants all give original, fresh, unusual yet convincing performances in their roles, led by the strong and committed central performance of Rutger Hauer is Rory Batty. The journey these replicants are on plays alongside a separate journey of another Replicant Rachel (well played by Sean Young) as a company owned experimental model that, by using human memory implants, is convinced she is a human until forced to question her existence by an interrogation by human detective Deckard. Deckard is played in a surprisingly low key and introspective performance by Harrison Ford. How the Deckard character interacts with Rachel, while he attempts to track down the group of replicants led by Hauer's character (their presence on earth is illegal) is very steadily paced, but interestingly and effectively executed as a dramatic police procedural story, including immersing you the viewer in a brilliantly realised environment of a highly polluted 2019 Los Angeles. <br/><br/>While moving through the films plot, the focus is on the gradual climax of the procedural story within the context of looking how these intelligent, super-strong, but emotionally child like engineered humans go on their journey to confront their human creator (brilliantly played by Joe Turkel as a billionaire recluse) about the truth of the nature of their existence. Juxtaposed against this is Deckard's disillusioned and largely emotionless human gradually having his humanity re- awakened by the development of an increasingly romantic relationship with Rachel, as well and questioning himself as to whether there is in fact a difference between humans and replicants. These plots are embedded is an amazing visual experience, largely down to Scott's amazing vision and execution (despite some well publicised problems during shooting), but brilliantly supported in its realisation by cinematographer Jordan Crowenweth, visual effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull and his Entertainment Effects Group Company, editor Terry Rawlings, production designer Laurence Paul and the truly amazing score of Vangelis. The final cut rightly restores an appropriate ending fitting to the noir overtones of the film, the original cut released in 1982 suffered from an out of place narration and ending that was not in keeping with the tone of the rest of the film. <br/><br/>It was surprising that ET beat this film to the visual effects Oscar, as in my opinion the work on this film was far more impactful and impressive. Overall an outstanding film experience that has stood the test of time remarkably well. It will be interesting to see what director Denis Villenuve, who in my view is an excellent choice does with the long-awaited sequel Bladerunner 2049. <br/><br/>An outstanding achievement."

","Superb sci-fi. Yet its strengths are ironically also its weaknesses. The visuals dramatically underscore the dystopian future of LA. They're deep, dark, and unrelenting. Unfortunately, they're also spread on too thickly and widely, such that their noirish presence overshadows the plot's subtle themes. Those themes, as others abundantly point out, have to do with what it means to be human. The fact that the replicants, Roy and Rachael, begin to seem as human as Deckard by movie's end is a neat philosophical twist. Trouble is these key themes are easily overshadowed by the overwhelming visuals. Thus, many well-meaning viewers get bored by what appears an absence of storyline. Too bad that a better balance between story and visuals fails to develop. Nonetheless, there's much to recommend, as others detail, in this probing slice of sci-fi.<br/><br/>(In passing—It's no accident I think that the Bradbury building in downtown LA appears throughout the 2-hours. Famous for its use in such classic noirs as DOA {1950} and M {1951}, its use here may well be a homage from futuristic noir to the classic past.)"

","Blade Runner Movie Review: Thoughtful Entertainment <br/><br/>The announcement of a Blade Runner sequel set to come out in 2017 (directed by Denis Villeneuve, who is the perfect human for such a project) has more than a few people giddy with excitement. Seeing that it's been 35 years since the release of the original, let's do a quick walk down memory lane to remember what exactly made Blade Runner a Sci-fi classic.<br/><br/>Blade Runner (directed by Ridley Scott, the man responsible for Alien and the Martian) is a beautiful blend of movie genres: film noir, science fiction, and philosophical fiction, all of which combine for an incredibly memorable cinematic experience. The story takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles a couple decades in the future.The film's unique cinematography perfectly combines the neon and gadgets of the future with dark, looming architecture and lighting, making the marriage of sci-fi and noir feel natural where it could be cheesy. The dark yet futuristic score works hand-in-hand with the visuals creating just the right background for this unconventional story.<br/><br/>Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford, who was born to play the typical hard-nosed noir detective) is a retired Blade Runner, a futuristic detective. They're a special division of police specifically hired to track down fugitive replicants (scientifically engineered humans).Deckard, who is forced to come out of retirement, must track down four dangerous replicant fugitives.<br/><br/>While the movie would be great with just the first two ingredients of our cinematic blend (film noir and sci-fi), the third (philosophical fiction) is what makes it a true cinematic masterpiece. Believable performances from all cast members and great dialogue (some of which is completely improvised, hats off to Rutger Hauer) allow the movie's heavy themes to stand out where they could have been an afterthought. While Deckard hunts down replicants one by one, the definition of humanity becomes blurry to both Deckard and the audience. From beginning to end we are both entertained and provoked to thought.<br/><br/>So watch it if you're a Sci-Fi fan. Watch it if you're a noir fan. Watch it if you're a philosophy fan. It's the combination of the three that has given Blade Runner a spot in the annals of cinema and in the hearts of movie lovers everywhere."

","Ridley Scott has made a name for himself by mastering several different genres but he's always been at his most comfortable in Sci-Fi and Blade Runner is proof to this. Blade Runner is a masterpiece, it's completely flawless, there is not a single other film like this one despite many trying. The plot of the movie seems simple but in the end it's really a story about life itself and how you use yours not matter how long or short it may be. Harrison Ford was the perfect casting for the character of Rick Deckard he's fantastic in this movie he's perfect and being an experienced operative while also managing to come across as exposed when he meets Sean Youngs character and his arc gives the film a more personal touch. The design of the city of Los Angeles 2019 is absolutely incredible the special effects are seamless and it legitimately feels like it could happen one day. It's not a perfect future it's one full of crime and poverty but that's a good thing because it makes the film feel more real and less like a fantasy Utopia. Rutger Hauer was fabulous in this movie he's just the right amount of menacing without ever seeming over the top and his monologue towards the end of the film is just a marvel to watch and few times have my eyes been more glued to the screen that during this monologue. There aren't a whole lot of action sequences in this movie but when there are it's not only riveting but really intense Ridley Scott clearly carried over the techniques he used in Alien to maintain tension and it fits just right into this film. Like I said there aren't a whole lot of action sequences in this movie it's mostly dialogue and got some of the finest and most intriguing ever put to film every new scene forces you to think and reevaluated were you were in the last scene and demands and grips your attention. Ridley Scott is truly one of the finest directors ever he knows how to direct a movie he holds back and shows just enough to keep the viewers attention. A lot of the moments in this movie don't make a whole lot of sense but it's meant to be that way, we're meant to be wondering what the hell we just watched and force us to got back and watch it again. <br/><br/>I completely understand why this film was hated upon release it was something completely different from everything else and still is to this day <br/><br/>A+/100%"

It paints a stark picture of a future where man and machine are arrayed against each other in the struggle for survival. The character of Decker is one of Harrison Ford's best portrayals. He's an ace at his job but also very alone in world. He seems to have more in common with the Replicant androids than other human beings. There's the lingering question of whether he's human or not by legions of fans. I say yes but others disagree. Sean Young is good too, and sexy! Rutger Hauer's most memorable moment in movies comes in BLADE RUNNER. Based on Philip K.

Sometimes the cinematography was so good that it made me want to write a full ten line long review about each and every scene but instead i will just try to keep it short and simple and very to the point and keep it under a thousand words but still have at least ten lines of commentary on the subject of this particular movie to be the best movie in terms of just about everything about it (except for Pris, she was a bit odd, but hey it was the nine-teen-eighty'z szo lets move right along with the ten line review). All jokes aside, i actually love the ten line review approach by the way it lets me get in just enough information about the movie as i had intended in the first place so therefore my applauding (for great classic film & great review length guidelines (or restrictions)) should be greatly appreciated on both behalves. But anyway back to the movie What can i say that hasn't already been said? For starters if anyone was complained that the special fx were lame or had anything else bad to say about the movie, they were in fact lying as a result of not understanding the true most beautiful and frightening nature of this movie-film.

Unless a viewer thinks deeply, it is very difficult grab the intention of the storyteller. Direction is good. costumes are matching.

"RLTerry1","6","0","4","29 April 2016"," Still a visionary masterpiece?
","As it turns out, it dawned on me that I had never seen Ridley Scott's Neo-Noir Blade Runner despite the fact that it it a critically acclaimed film and highly regarded by many of my contemporaries. I have found that sometimes you have seen clips, heard people reference it, and simply hear the title so much that you think you have seen it. Then you realize that you're familiar with the ideas, concept, or story but not the movie itself. When watching a movie from 30+ years ago, I do my best to place myself in the shoes of the audience then. But, I am having difficulty this time. As a peer-reviewed cinema researcher, I believe that no matter how old a film is that it should still be relevant and impact audiences many decades down the road. Truthfully, I am not entirely seeing why it is such a regarded film still to this day. However, it is definitely an artistic masterpiece due to the technical elements of the production. So in many ways, yes, it still IS an iconic visionary masterpiece; but, fails to connect or resonate with audiences today.<br/><br/>It doesn't take long to understand that this film is a neo-noir detective movie that takes place in a dystopian future. Neo-noir is regarded as a film noir style movie produced after the classic film noir period (which was relatively short ~1940s-50s). This genre (although, technically, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that film noir is more of a style not a true genre) follows many of the same tropes and elements found in film noir (think Billy Wilder's Sunset Blvd, Double Indemnity, classic detective movies, or Orson Welles). Often, the protagonist is a solitary individual who finds him or herself in over his or her head who faces or exhibits perpetual pessimism, fatality, or menace in a plot consisting of cynical attitudes and sexual motivations. From a technical perspective, film noir (or neo-noir) is stylistically dark, high contrast, low key lighting, contains strategic shadows, and shots filled with symbolism and dichotomy. The plots are usually slow burning and contain social commentary or a self-reflexive narrative. Once analyzing this movie as a neo-noir, it becomes more fascinating but still lacks that timelessness that can be found in some of the examples mentioned earlier in this paragraph. As a artistic film, I am impressed with the vision of Ridley Scott. As a classically-regarded and praised film, I am not very impressed. Although, I find that it is an excellent example of how many in the early 1980s viewed the future and that is is a fantastic example of neo-noir style filmmaking.<br/><br/>One of the biggest problems I had with the film is the fact that I had trouble loving the protagonist or hating the antagonist, or feeling sympathy for either of the aforementioned. In screen writing, it is imperative that the audience make a firm connection with either the protagonist or the antagonist. Note: the antagonist in a film/neo-noir is not always the ""bad guy."" Whereas even Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond in Sunset Blvd made a strong connection with the audience in that we feel great sympathy for her plight, yet she is the antagonist in the story–or many agree as such. Harrison Ford's Deckard in Blade Runner never quite garnered strong support from me in the same way his nemesis Roy failed to elicit disdain. Both Deckard and Roy are fairly static characters–meaning they lack dynamic development. There is, however, an indirect glimmer of character development in Roy at the very end that plays significantly into the plot for a brief but strategic moment. As regularly reoccurring throughout the narrative the character of Rachael is, she can almost be removed from the film and change little in the overarching story. For the most part, she simply exists and pays into Deckard's motivation, but mildly so. She neither causes him to view Replicants differently or becomes his sole goal. It is clear from early on in the plot that Deckard already had reservations in retiring Replicants. Rachael simply amplifies or intensifies the feelings that were already brewing.<br/><br/>Looking back at movies from the mid to late 20th century that take place in the early to mid 21st century can be quite entertaining. Sometimes the future portrayed in the film, in one form or another, has actually come to pass. Although, other times, the future is incredibly inaccurate. The dystopian Los Angeles in Blade Runner is definitely the latter. Yes, there are themes of unchecked immigration, authoritarian power, and capitalism that can be read as not so different from today; but, for all intents and purposes, the future is much more grim in the movie than in today's reality. Perhaps that's why it can be difficult to connect with this movie. It takes place in a ""future"" that never happened, and probably won't happen in the now near future. I think that's the danger when writing or directing a movie set in a future that relies heavily upon technology directly related to the plot. Some movies can pull it off. Take Back to the Future for instance. It works because the technology in the culture of the future isn't significantly integrated into the essence of the plot or are solely responsible for some dystopian world. The futuristic technology merely exists and helps to move the plot along. In Blade Runner, the whole reason for the plot is because futuristic technology in our present day has turned on its creators and became the catalyst for a world drowning in chaos.<br/><br/>If you have never seen Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, I definitely encourage you to do so, especially if you enjoy film or neo-noir movies. It provides us with a glimpse into how the world viewed a possible future in the early 1980s."

","In Los Angeles in November 2019, ex-police officer Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is detained by officer Gaff (Edward James Olmos) and brought to his former supervisor, Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh). Deckard, whose job as a ""Blade Runner"" was to track down bioengineered beings known as replicants and ""retire"" (a euphemism for killing) them, is informed that four have come to Earth illegally.<br/><br/>Science fiction and philosophy go hand in hand. From the earliest days up through ""The Matrix"" and beyond, it allows the human mind to explore hypothetical situations. This movie is a good action film (though slower than necessary in parts), but carries with it an ethical question: when do robots become human? Do they ever? And should we be constructing them in the first place? (The film sort of skirts this issue, saying they were used for slave labor -- but why bother to give them feelings, senses, sexual organs and so on?) I do not know which of the seven (!) versions is best. I most recently (2016) saw the theatrical, but feel it was lacking something. Definitely the unicorn dream sequence is gone, which is important to the plot. Things are left more ambiguous."

We find ourselves far into the future and humanity has been exploring space and colonizing on different planets, and to assist us with this; powerful corporations start manufacturing replicants who are visually indistinguishable from adult humans.<br/><br/>The noir theme of this movie was executed beautifully by Mr. Scott, when the movie starts we are immediately informed of the situation and replicants. Soon after the situation and the way of this new world is established, we are brought into the theme of this dark futuristic city. The ominous dark buildings looming overhead, neon lights, and floating blimps casting advertisements on a giant screens 24 hours a day.<br/><br/>This is one of Harrison Ford's best works, being a perfect fit as a Blade Runner and detective. The character of Rick Deckard, that he plays, is a very interesting. He brings this mystery of not fully knowing who this character is and what his real goal is.

","This atypical science fiction flick engages the brain instead of the senses, resulting in a film which feels more like an art-house experience than your typical Hollywood money maker. Seeing it as a kid, I hated it, expecting another STAR WARS. Instead what I got was a dark, gritty and downbeat film noir with little action to recommend it and a rather slow storyline. Now, as an adult, having seen the director's cut, I can confirm that this is truly a great movie with plenty of subtexts, strong themes and surprising plot twists to keep you watching through the slow spots. Visually the film is a treat, with Ridley Scott continuing his dank vision of the future from ALIEN and transporting it from space to Earth. The special effects are great, but the best thing of all is that the film isn't trashy. Scott doesn't let technology distract us from the strong detective storyline, doesn't stage any flashy laser gun battles or flying chases.<br/><br/>The (short) action sequences are dark and dirty with an emphasis on realism. Fighters bleed here, and copiously. The chase through the house at the end of the film is great stuff and the film doesn't skimp on violence either. Harrison Ford, our hero, shoots fleeing women in the back and is nearly killed on numerous instances until chance saves him. This isn't a thrill-a-minute shoot-em-up at all. In fact it's quite different and difficult to describe, feeling strangely old-fashioned despite the futuristic setting and premise. The script is fantastic and there are moments of true poetry to enjoy – especially Rutger Hauer's death scene at the end of the film which is one of the landmarks of cinema. Ford is grungy and miserable as the investigating ""blade runner"" and somehow his world-weary performance fits the bill nicely. The supporting cast of androids is fantastic – Hauer is at his prime, Sean Young is heartbreaking, Daryl Hannah mischievously evil, Brion James is a brutal thug, Joanna Cassidy just plain weird.<br/><br/>There are plenty of other nicely subtle performances here too. William Sanderson (FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE) as weird toy maker and geneticist J.F. Sebastien is memorably odd and Edward James Olmos is a mysterious cop who seems to know everything. Add in plenty of supporting regulars, tons of atmosphere and suspense and the unpredictable, original narrative, plus the original storyline from sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick, and you have a great slice of celluloid drama."

He says that both replicans and humans have their own experience and that people can not assume that the replicnas didn't feel anything. The replicans started feeling emotions and cared more for one another than many humans.This is just a way to say that prejudging someone is completely wrong.

The most aspect of the movie is in my opinion it's beauty...the way it handles themes like death and the way we all have to face it at some point...how we all are mortal, no matter how strong or weak we are. The death of Ridley Scott's brother was a major inspiration for this movie, if we pay attention we can easily see why. The way Roy looks for a cure and tries his hardest not to lose hope is easily relatable to the way Ridley's brother was looking to cure his cancer. The ending is symbolic and is so convincing because it really is something that came from Ridley's heart...His brother's death and the acceptance he must have had at some point truly shows why Ridley made it seem so real in the movie. The perfect soundtrack that hints the ending since the very beginning, how it changes to not only accompany the scenes but also make them and give them meaning...it's beautiful. Director Ridley Scott made a masterpiece like no other...a movie that doesn't need senseless violence or crazy action sequences to suck you in and never let you go until the movie comes to an end. This isn't just great cinema...this is art and storytelling at its finest. This is a version of the future that slowly seems closer to a reality than just a work of fiction. This is what we might be sooner than later,slaves to technology, slaves to the government, slaves to our dying world, and slaves to those who are born to be slavers...We leave in fear of everything...war, domination, death, but why don't we look at the good part of this world? we might die sooner than later, why not make every last day count?"

","If you have never seen Blade Runner, you will soon realize it is a very unconventional science fiction film. Especially considering the time it was released in. Keep in mind Star Wars and the Empire Strikes Back had just been released and people were in very involved in that tone those science fiction movies had. The Star Wars movies (even Empire, as dark as it is) are less serious films. In fact, the original Star Wars story was created by George Lucas as a sort of homage to old Flash Gordon adventure serials, which were pretty silly and not at all serious to say the least. So Blade Runner came out in 1982 and it was very misunderstood. Critics and audiences alike thought it was too slow and lacked character development. Even Roger Ebert said: ""It looks fabulous, it uses special effects to create a new world of its own, but it is thin in its human story. "" when the movie had come out. If you don't know, Blade Runner has been released multiple times over the years. This review will be exclusively for the Final Cut of the movie, which is widely considered the greatest. Roger Ebert even took back his previous statements about character development when he saw the Final Cut of the movie and gave it a perfect 4/4. This is just an example of initial reactions of the movie. So like I said, a lot of people didn't enjoy Blade Runner because the masses thought it was slow, but others liked its many brainy ideas. It didn't make too much money initially, and became a sort of cult phenomenon. Blade Runner still manages to look amazing after 30 years since its release. This is a movie that achieved something great by creating a future that seems new and modern with amazing new technology, but at the same time, it managed to create a very dark, dirty environment that somehow seems old as well. Something about this film is that it never feels like there is hope. It is an extremely dark movie. I love the practical effects they used in this movie to create buildings, cars, weapons and more. The effort put into this project is truly magnificent. Blade Runner, the Final Cut is a masterpiece. It's slow, but never boring, every scene is important, no scene feels out of place. It's one of my favorite movies of all time and essential sci-fi viewing."

","This is about the future. Human advanced into the universe and created ""replicant"" which is humanoid robot. Replicants do dangerous works as like slave. Their appearance is almost the same as human but they don't feel things basically. However gradually they come to have emotions and begin to riot against human. Some of them get in the earth. Blade Runner is a job finding out and destroying them. What is human being? What is life? What is love? We can think such questions through the eyes of replicants. Firstly I got the impression that they are really evil, but as the story develops, I changed my mind and realized they are not bad. They just want to live as usual. It's so sad and painful because they want but they can't do. The atmosphere of city, rainy and crowded, helps us feel plaintive. We can enjoy the unique atmosphere and the visuals."

","When I got to know of the blade runner's existence I made up in my mind an image of it being just some science fiction flick with gore and 80s music. THerefore, when I got to see it, I was... it's undescribable. I've seen other ridley scott films, the gladiator and Robin hood, but I would almost say that those films have been directed by a different person. The overall story of the film is quite simple, what makes the movie become a masterpiece is the way it is developed. Being a Christopher Nolan fan myself, I can say that I can see how Nolan's cinematography is influenced by this particular film. Other than visuals, and the way the story is shown, also the score fitted perfectly. Some sort of progressive rock merged into a filmscore, with powerful electric sounds that fitted perfectly the cyberpunk atmosphere. As for the gore in the film, I myself checked what does it consist of in the IMDb parents' guide. Literally, the way it's described makes it seem more gory than what it is. And as I was one of those people that turned around into certain scenes of the lord pf the rings, you can judge wheter you can handle it or not. Luckily enough, the fact that there are many different cuts of the film allows to choose the Director's cut version, which contains none of said gore, even though apparently the Final Cut of the movie is what Ridley Scott feels closer to his vision of the film."

","Dialogue is a nice thing, but recently I've been watching too many movies with heavy dialogue, and I'm starting to get tired of these three hour long scripts as a result.<br/><br/>With Blade Runner, less is said and more is achieved. Scott doesn't need words to accomplish a profound movie going experience. He relies on visuals, sound, and a pretty clever, perhaps ahead of its' time, set of the future.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is a breath of fresh air. The action flows smoothly and with just the right amount of it, it keeps its' pace going without becoming boring.<br/><br/>I just caught up to watching this film for the first time, and although going back to 1982 you might expect a lesser impressive future- sci fi experience since all the technology that has come after it, the movie really holds its' own thirty five years later. Some of it had that 80s action movie feel to it with the villains (the main villain looks like a Billy Idol clone straight out of one of his 80s MTV music videos, and this was the only thing I found annoying and strongly behind the time), but the film was definitely unique and original. The thing that sealed the deal for me giving it a high rating was the awesome surprise ending. That was cool."

","***User-reviewer jaywolfenstien (""A frame to die for"", jaywolfenstien from USA, 2 February 2008) has a good commentary.***<br/><br/>""Blade Runner (1982, Ridley Scott) Final Cut"", a dystopian sci-fi, is enjoyable. Adhering to the now ubiquitous visual plan of contemporary fantasy/horror cinema, we see a lot of colorized smoke along with moody and/or pulsating lighting. It is described as neo- film noir; and two noir characteristics are washed out streets and freely burning tobacco. While the story is uneven it has an unusually beautiful principal cast. Just as there are multiple versions of ""Blade Runner"", it seems that everyone has their own opinion about where it belongs when ranking all-time science fiction.<br/><br/>It is set 37 years from the film's release (2019), in a Los Angeles that is majority Asian. This Los Angeles also possesses a formidable skyline with many tall, imposing buildings featuring grim architecture. The Tyrell Corporation, a totalitarian central command structure in complete control over the human population, is manufacturing replicants. Replicants are robots intended to labor under dangerous conditions on other planets. They are engineered with physical powers superior to humans. They also have consciousness. To keep them down, the latest firmware grants them only a four year lifetime. If replicants ever set foot on Earth it is up to a Blade Runner (i.e., a contract assassin affiliated with the LAPD) to ""retire"" them ASAP, typically by use of a loud, high- caliber handgun. As the story begins there are four replicants who have stolen a space ship and escaped to Earth. Gloomy and weary Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is hired to retire them.<br/><br/>A Blade Runner can distinguish a replicant from a human by means of a test (named Voight-Kampff) that is delivered orally. The questions are hypothetical and from what we know, always contain triggers that recall the Milgram experiment. (BTW, there has never been a psychological experiment more important than Milgram. Every school on Earth should teach it. But I digress.) At the urging of Mr. Tyrell (the hands-on CEO of the mighty empire) Deckard gives the test to Tyrell's assistant Rachael (Sean Young). Although she believes she is human, Deckard concludes that she is a machine with implanted memories. Normally, this is cause for Deckard to use his gun. However, he hesitates to retire Rachael. The relationship between the pair is vital to the story. It also drives speculation and debate among ""Blade Runner"" fans over whether Deckard is actually a replicant himself. The Final Cut version of the film does not conclusively inform us one way or the other. <br/><br/>The replicants all seem intentionally more interesting than Deckard. So do Decker's work colleagues Gaff (Edward James Olmos) and Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh). While Deckard has a dogged persistence that is admirable, as he retires one replicant after another, it is usually the machine which wins the heart of the viewer. While trying not to spoil things, three of the targeted replicants make things easy for Deckard by breaking off a physical attack that would take advantage of their insurmountable strength. One replicant responds to the threat posed by itchy-trigger-fingered Deckard by demonstrating a killer set of fast-moving handstands. This is fun to observe but not effective in battle against an armed hunter. Generally, it seems that the replicants are the ones offering some humanity to the atmosphere while the brutal Tyler Corporation is suppressing it. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), the leader of the four mutinous replicants, is occasionally very appealing (even though we also see him kill a human by crushing the victim's skull). Roy is most empathetic when he clamors despairingly for a longer life. As this is in clear contrast to Deckard's misanthropy, the replicant leader garners interest at the expense of the protagonist.<br/><br/>An issue I have with ""Blade Runner"" is Ridley Scott's dull direction. I am not fond of how modern sci-fi/horror films look. There is no single image that seems to stand out and/or inspire a second glance. It is tempting to say it appears as if were filmed through a Coke bottle. Blade Runner also has innumerable close-ups and cutting back and forth between characters. Scott's imagery just is not distinctive to where ""Blade Runner"" can be regarded as an elite science fiction film.<br/><br/>Still, there may be nothing more appealing to many cinema-goers than watching a contract killer removing elements of society who are inconvenient to power. If you don't mind occasional eruptions of extreme violence, the beautiful cast and the prospect of experiencing a world (slightly) more authoritarian than ours today makes this a fun diversion. Yet, I don't recommend bringing kids to it. (Not unless you want them to grow up as contract killers. But why not? All that matters is getting paid.)"

Some over human creature is killing a god that is also a man, not some old son and father misunderstanding.<br/><br/>Then you would say -But, it looks and feels like crap nowadays.- and then i say -Well have you seen the original version of StarWars?- after someone can come up with something like -It feels incomplete and rushed.- to what i can argument -Well StarWars told a story in a saga(composed of six movies) although the first movie had a fulfilling ending.And also they changed the ending because it was not acceptable to end in doubt those days.<br/><br/>Finally smart asses will say -It comes nowhere near the book- to which i would make this final statement - They couldn't use robots that could be taken serious (they sucked so hard on movies those days), the movie couldn't be any longer(it was very expensive, you can feel there is a living world in the background), but more important, it delivers the message of the book (from my point of view), that is: to make u doubt about your self awareness, and the stance of humanity being unique and superior to whatever else is out there."

I was only maybe 8 at the time but my dad bought it for me and told me to watch it.

","Noir. Sci-Fi. Thriller. Action-adventure (OK, not so much). Perfectly cast, with Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young and Daryl Hannah, supported by Edward James Olmos and M Emmett Walsh.<br/><br/>Set in a dystopian future where it is night almost all of the time and raining continuously, where we all end up identifying with the main bad guys (The recent 'Divergent' books do call back to this work if you look closely; among other works, of course) where the unavailable CGI is such a boon that enormous care seems to have been taken to conceptualize and create the miniature sets that they do not seem miniature at all. I think, trying to view this as an allegory that Mary Shelley had in mind when she wrote 'Frankenstein' (The replicants that Deckard is hunting down) is quite rewarding as well.<br/><br/>Observing each interaction that Sean Young and Ford's characters have, esp. in the light of the final 'reveal' is also immensely rewarding. Featuring some of the most violent imagery, completely in context with the subject material, along with one of the longest drawn-out climax sequences ever, with perhaps one of the most powerfully-motivated villains, who we actually end up rooting for (I dare anyone not to be 'affected' by the goings-on at that time, and the events leading to it); this is one unforgettable work of art that needs to be enjoyed only on the big screen.<br/><br/>Having lived in a region where this was never released theatrically, how did I get to watch it on the big screen? In 2008/9, I was lucky to be living just 40 miles shy of a few independent cinemas that screened cult classics over each weekend, for 2 nights continuously. The final cut of this movie made the grade for 2 such screenings, and I watched it on both nights, one after the other, with a couple of like-minded friends.<br/><br/>One more thing about the casting - connecting the dots between Daryl Hannah's performance here, and in 'Kill Bill'.

Olmos. <br/><br/>so in short..., we have a great ensemble cast with major Hollywood A- list actors included, great special effects for its time, a great sci-fi short story written by Phil K Dick, one of the most hauntingly beautifully shot films(in my opinion) and one of the greatest directors of ours or any time and a thought provoking and argument causing theme. so what is there not to like about the movie??? one of the great American films and in my mind a magical achievement which director Scott will never top.<br/><br/>definitely requires multiple viewings and then multiple viewings on top of that."

The multitude of other cuts that did away with it just did away with a significant part of the film in my opinion. Harrison Ford didn't like the voice-over but for me it absolutely made the film.<br/><br/>This film is the essence of science fiction and if you're a scifi fan and it's not in your top ten you'd better be able to articulate your reasons for it. The premise is a straightforward one in that androids are a threat and loose on Earth but it is so well realised and captured that the viewer is encouraged to think of the deeper philosophical points behind the plot.<br/><br/>Effects are great without being excellent but this film is not about effects, it's about deep seated matters of human ethics, wrapped up in a dark and gritty story. A film for those able to think for sure and both played to perfection and moved along by the director to perfection.

","This review is based on Directors Cut version – the version with no voice-over and no ""Hollywood-ending"".<br/><br/>The film is loosely based on ""Do androids dream of electric sheep"" (1969) by Philip K. Dick. There are several changes to the original book which itself was very surrealistic. The spirit however of Dick's book is still here. The film brings in some ideas that improve on the book and writers Hampton Fincher and David Webb Peoples deserve some praise. Philip K Dick himself approved of the film , although he saw only the opening 20 minutes of footage prior to his death on 2 March 1982. It's interesting that Ridley Scott and one of the writers David Webb Peoples never read Dick's novel. ""Blade runner"" was the first time that Dick had been adapted to film.<br/><br/>""Blade runner"" asks the same question as the book – What it means to be a human ? Philip K Dick read diaries written by S.S. men and was shocked by the sheer cruelty and lack of empathy he found in them . He thought that those Germans didn't deserve to be called humans , despite the look like ones. That's where the idea for book came from.<br/><br/>""Blade runner "" requires patience and full attention from the audience. There is little action here and the movie is very slow paced. The story seems very simple , almost thin on the surface , but underneath it there's a depth really seen. ""BR"" is so full of themes and symbols that it's impossible to catch them all on first viewing . I've seen this movie five times and I'm still discovering new things on repeated viewings. It's just as deep as ""2001 : Space odyssey"", but far more entertaining and involving emotionally thank Kubrick's movie. Who could forget the unicorn at the end ? ""Blade runner"" is a visionary movie. It pretty much pioneers much of the vision that became a Cyberpunk genre in publishing. William Gibson , considered a pioneer of that genre with his ""Neuromancer"" (1984) almost gave up writing , because ""BR"" had so much of his vision in it. ""BR"" is a rare case of movie prefiguring a trend in literature. ""BR"" also inspired many movies with it's vision of killer robots (""Terminator"" is the most known and the best of them all).<br/><br/>It's one of the most visually beautiful movies I have ever seen. The level of detail on is amazing, even though much of it is often seen on screen. It gives you the impression that what you see is only the tip of an iceberg. The future we see is an abstraction of the present. Los Angeles in 2019 is an overpopulated city, with flying cars , non-stop rain , extremely diverse culturally (punks , Chinese , Jews and Hare Krishna living together in one metropolis) and full of commercials (Atari , Coca cola). Designer Syd Mead and FX wizard Douglas Trumbull deserve every penny the studio paid them for this piece of art. The special effects are genuinely AMAZING after all those years and the movie has dated incredibly well .<br/><br/>The music by Vangelis fits the movie perfectly . It's so mythical and dream-like , with a touch of 80's feel as well. It's one of the greatest soundtracks ever . The movie gives the viewer a haunting melancholic feel and largely thanks to the superb music.<br/><br/>""Blade runner"" wants the audience to think about the impact of technology and capitalism on human society , dehumanization in world ruled by corporations and media , meaning of life , personal identity , destructive nature of humanity , lack of freedom and polluted environment.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford (""Raiders of lost ark"") is great as a burned out detective with a weakness for drinking Frank Deckard (reference to Descartes). His lifeless performance fits the movie perfectly . His dull , bored , cold character that slowly during the movie will rediscover (or discover ?) his humanity thanks to the replicants. The real star is however Rutger Hauer (""The Hitcher"") as Roy Batty. His fantastic performance is perfect – he managed to capture all of human emotions : child-like sense of wonder , fear of death , raw brutality , deep love , need for beauty. His not a simple villain , more like anti-hero who is in a way a portrait of whole humanity. The third main character is Rachel played by Sean Young (""No way out""). While very sexy and a obvious nod to femme fatales from noir movies , Young also makes her character a very delicate and likable.<br/><br/>The supporting performances are great too . Edward James Olmos (""Stand and deliver"") is really creepy, mysterious and memorable as Gaff (who could forget his little paper figures) . M. Emmett Walsh (""Few good men"") makes a nice cynical police chief. Daryl Hannah (Kill Bill"") has some Harley Quinn personality in her Pris. Joanna Cassidy (""Who framed Roger Rabbit"") is strong as Zhora , while Brion James (""48 hours"") is menacing as Leon. Joe Turkel (""The Shinning"") is a true gentleman as the intelligent Eldon Tyrell.<br/><br/>This is the best science fiction movie ever made. It might be the best movie of the 80's and it's a strong contender for the title of the best movie ever made. Ridley Scott is talking now about making a sequel . Considering how awful ""Prometheus"" was ( a semi-prequel to ""Alien"") I hope this will never happen. I give ""Blade runner"" 10/10."

","I originally intended to compile a selective list on the android (humanoid) theme as represented in Hollywood film industry. But afterwards reconsidered my thinking and decided to put emphasis on the leading 3 titles as I pre-conceive it. So 1st place goes to ""Blade Runner"" (1982) - a science fiction movie, which credits belong fore mostly to author Philip K. Dick and his successful bargain to sell copyright of his novel ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?"" upon which the film was subsequently based. Unfortunately, Dick died prematurely from heart attack at age 53 shortly before Film Premiere. ""Blade Runner"" is still a Rotten Tomato movie, which means that with score 8.5 out of 10 it remains highly unappreciated by public awareness. This is very strange and pity at the same time, since 30 years have passed and the Movie can't deliver its message which ostensibly purports the idea of World populated by Androids. Today the meaning of ""android"" is hollow and means some gimmicks or trinkets for everyday use, while the original conception came as semi-organic yet artificial creation. This is at least what lies on the surface etymologically.<br/><br/>My 2nd and 3rd choice are with Isaac Asimov's short stories on Robots. Here comes ""Bicentennial Man"" (1999) and ""I, Robot"" (2004) but maybe also some other less popular titles that I don't know or remember. The strength here comes from the fact that those are full length movies with typology Human Characters played by androids (robots). I stress here on the ""noxious"" implication of humanoids that exempt human life and became its substitutes or alter ego. This is fruitful area of thinking but needs more time for assimilation. For instance, how should be solved the problem for aging given that morbidity doesn't pose threats any longer. How do we embrace the idea of longevity and yet look shrunken, behave numbed. It seems that it's not only a matter of empathy but we have to peg it with self-centeredness as well. Things like that.<br/><br/>Let me see whether I can coin an instant story for this Movie. I owned a perfect VHS copy of ""Blade Runner"" in the 1980s with the image of apple tree from the Ladd Company. In the 1990s I throw all my VHS cassettes in the garbage bin because there was already satellite TV, PC for mass communication and rudiments of Network; so I worked a lot on sideway activities and did some traveling worldwide. In the 2000s there was slowly this Internet phenomenon that was gaining speed and also the family unification syndrome (as if people haven't seen and know each other for decades); I became strangled in mass hysteria and started to experience globalization on my own ass in the form of arrows and various phantom pains. Everything got screwed since, even my DVD copy of ""Blade Runner"" didn't look lucrative enough to watch multiple times. Maybe because of that awesome letter-box format that I don't understand to the extent why digital technicians produce it at all. Lastly, a Blu Ray version of the Movie exist from 2010s with over three hours of additional materials that I haven't seen or reviewed personally.<br/><br/>So I will continue my Poor Richard Almanac with some scattered notes. The thing that mostly attracted me in ""Blade Runner"" when I saw it in 1980s was its perfect Cast. All of them actors that participated in principal roles from the Movie were young, beautiful, daring and enterprising. Today, they are in their 50s and 60s which lump them in category ""third age"". They are not exactly retired but their performance lack the vigor and dynamism from 30 years ago. That's what the meaning to be an Android - to stay forever in your prime (if you are not bored of it some day).<br/><br/>Brian James in the role of Leon Kowalski was the worst choice for an Android. Except his excellent physique, the dramatic appearance of that Actor is very shallow. But Brian James did many secondary roles in films that I like very much. Something like Anthony Quinn less the international awards. He died in 1999, aged 54.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott is a superb Director. ""Blade Runner"" was his third successful movie after ""Duelists"" (1977) and ""Alien"" (1979). I don't understand what makes him think that the personage of Rick Deckard the Bladerunner (Harrison Ford) was a replicant. Deckard was dreaming and this sole attribute is enough to classify him as Human. Replicants don't dream, they have implanted memories in their mind. Thank You!"

But the final screenplay by Hampton Fancher and David Webb Peoples gave the whole story its dark, slow, hypnotically and unique emotional feeling.<br/><br/>The iconic futurist illustrator and designer Syd Mead created with his art the blueprint for all visuals. And the special effects by Douglas Trumbull, Richard Yuricich and David Dryer are just superb for its time. Remember the police car landing on the rooftops of L.A. or balcony scene with the cruising police car. <br/><br/>I watched this movie on silver-screen in 1982 and since then every decade following. Until today every shot in Blade Runner is just intricately detailed as anything a science-fiction film has yet envisioned and has not yet been exceeded.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is a masterpiece of its own and one of the greatest science fiction films ever made."

","Before digital revolution, it was tricky to get involved in depicting science fiction - particularly if you desired to show long scenes with futuristic technology; some directors as George Lucas even postponed some works as they found the technology was not ripe enough. Luckily, in Blade Runner, the main focus is on human(ist) values, with ""modern"" surroundings in the background. Still, let me remind that the events take place in 2019, but seeing television tubes, mildly advanced phone booths and sizable apparatuses is a bit awkward at present... Not mentioning openly visible product placement. The biggest gem of the movie is the cast, with 2 excellent (Rutger Hauer, Harrison Ford) and the rest giving good performances. Visually, the director Rider Scott has evidently influenced by Lucas and Stanley Kubrick.<br/><br/>Perhaps I am spoiled by mobile and digital technology, but as of the year of 2013, I can't consider Blade Runner as timeless creation."

","There's no sci-fi movie better than Blade Runner. It's my favorite movie of all time. The Vangelis soundtrack is perfect. The lyric scenes are so dense, so perfect. Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Daryl Hannah, M. Emmet Walsh, Edward James Olmos, William Sanderson, Joanna Cassidy and Joe Turkel (as Tyrell) are perfect in their roles. I love the futuristic visual scenes. I even love the future propaganda. It is perfection itself. I've seen it more than 500 times. Thanks Ridley Scott for this fantastic movie. It is awesome in any version. The original Harrison Ford voice-over is good too. I know that HF and RC don't like it but who cares? The last scene (Roy's death) always makes me cry. Please don't make a sequence."
"JohnGiurin","10","0","4","22 July 2013"," A dark vision that questions what it means to be a person
","Writer Philip K. Dick posed the question: ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" It seems like an odd thing to ask, but it puts into context the question of what it means to be human; does a human analog, like and android, mimic human behaviour in it's own terms? If life is electric, as opposed to bio-chemical, will that life see other life only as being equally electric? Blade Runner takes Dick's novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" and examines that concept. Set in a dark future in which robots are visually indistinguishable from humans, it forces us to ask what it is to be truly human; does humanity require a physical body that is exactly the same as ours, or is our true essence found in the mind and the choices we make? In Blade Runner we encounter military grade androids that are so highly developed, they don't know that they are not human. Or at least they aren't supposed to. At least one of these above average beings seems to develop a strong sense of self and self-preservation that is beyond what the programmer intended. As a result, these automata behave rather badly; it is up to Blade Runner Harrison Ford to stop them. This is where the line between humanity and android begins to blur. Who is more human? The Blade Runner sent to stop the Androids from running amok, or the androids that seek only to live as best they can? Where does the heart truly lie? Is it in only in the soul of a flesh and blood person born of man and woman, or is it possible that even a factory made robot can develop a sense of good, evil and morality that is indistinguishable from that of the human it imitates? Blade Runner explores those questions in a way that combines excellent story telling and taut direction. It is an excellent film."

","This is the one for which Ridley Scott should be remembered, a combination of Philip K. Dick's novel and Lester del Ray's short story, HELEN O'LOY. Certainly, few sf films have looked half as good: the smoky, rain-misted NOIR visuals put to shame most of what's been done in the genre and the Vangelis music is some of the most moving I've ever heard (and it wouldn't have hurt to have had MORE of it throughout). Harrison Ford is at the very top of his game, here, and it's highly unlikely that Sean Young will ever be this beautiful again. (And, just for the record, I think SHE should've been Catwoman in the second of Tim Burton's BATMAN films. That one, it seems to me, should've been a real no-brainer...) Scott's high-water mark."

","BLADE RUNNER: DIRECTOR'S CUT<br/><br/>This is the third time I have seen this film. I originally watched it about 20 years ago on VHS... I hated it. I then forgot most of the movie and watched it again about 10 years ago... I hated it. Again I forgot the whole movie... the only thing I remembered about this film was that I hated it. But a friend from work told me that it is a classic and it is his favourite film of all time. I know this movie is highly regarded by so many movie fans and finally I am starting to see why. I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The story is about a retired Blade Runner (a cop who is assigned to find and kill replicants) who is forced to come out of retirement to find 4 escaped replicants. A replicant is a human clone designed and created for use in colonies as slaves with a 4 year life span. These 4 replicants have made their way to Earth to find their maker to try and make their lives longer.<br/><br/>The story is very good. It is based on a book called ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" and is made really well.<br/><br/>The visuals of this is amazing. I loved the futuristic look and the landscapes were beautiful. It has an awesome 80s feel to it which is one of the best feelings in a movie for me. There are still talks of a sequel to this film which I think would be a mistake. It is not the 80s anymore and that is one of the things that made this great. The new one would feel too modern and would just not have the same effect... just like Star Wars episodes 1-3.<br/><br/>The films starred Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah & M. Emmet Walsh. Everyone did a great job. Especially Rutger. He has a real creepy look about him that I feel he brings to most of the roles he has played.<br/><br/>I loved the toys that the character Sebastian made. I thought they were a fantastic part of this movie and really helped to make the movie more fun.<br/><br/>I did find that the movie was slow in places... there were quite a few scenes where there was a lot of thinking and just looking. And the blues/jazz soundtrack was not the greatest... but it kind of felt right with the mood of the film.<br/><br/>The film was made by Ridley Scott who is a genius with Sci-Fi films as we know seeing Alien and more recently Prometheus. Ridley is a legend and I hope me makes more movies soon. Ridley is also apparently lined up to direct the new Blade Runner film... whether it be a sequel or remake... no-one knows as of yet.<br/><br/>I will give this film 7 out of 10... which is really good seeing as before watching it this time, based on the last 2 times of seeing it, I would have given it 2 out of 10.<br/><br/>""More human than human is our motto.""<br/><br/>For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"

","I first saw this on its release in the early eighties with a cynical, world-weary, Harrison Ford voice-over giving it a Raymond Chandler feel. Clearly the ""suits"" thought audiences would have trouble making sense of the barrage of fantastic images and concepts that would assail them for 2 hours, and thought some explanation would be in order. They may have been right.<br/><br/>Shorn of the commentary, the 'Final Cut' and unfolds as a series of fantastic and often disturbing images which leave the viewer struggling to make sense of it all. Just when you're ready to dismiss it however as a style-over-substance sequence of remarkable set-pieces made by a ad-man at the top of his game, the film hits you with scene of almost fathomless depth. We are nearly there, you realise.<br/><br/>Indeed the issues explored still seem hugely relevant and only the Vangelis soundtrack is curiously dated and rooted in the (retrospectively) weird 80s. The cast is tremendous, with Ford exuding his familiar country-boy charm, Sean Young touching and fragile, and Rutger Hauer stealing the laurels with his once-seen-never-forgotten portrayal of the replicant who obtains a soul, Roy.<br/><br/>The script is one of the most quotable of all time though takes substantial liberties with the Philip K. Dick novel on which it is based. The book makes a more metaphysical exploration of the meaning of humanity and ""empathy"", and is strongly recommended to those who enjoyed the film."
"jukka76543","Null","0","4","11 July 2013"," The best film ever made
","I have been a fan of Blade Runner since I saw it as a kid in the late 80's. This film is pure Magic. (Make sure you watch Director's Cut or the Final Cut if you want to view this.) Let me crudely summarize this film: the sets are Awesome, the soundtrack is Divine, the atmosphere is... I don't even have a word for that. It is something unimaginably brilliant. The plot is very complex and deep. It may appear simple for the casual viewer, but there is a LOT going on underneath. If you are an intelligent viewer who likes to think for him/herself then this would be something you would appreciate. Multiple viewings are required to start to understand and theorize the finer, multiple dimensions of the plot.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. (Well Harrison Ford doesn't have a very broad acting range but fortunately he doesn't need a broad range with his character.) The other actors too fill their roles very well. These characters feel natural and flow effortlessly. They feel like real people, just going on in their daily lives.<br/><br/>The antagonists however feel different as it should be. You may feel they lack a part of their soul somehow.<br/><br/>LASTLY A SMALL SPOILER HERE: Somebody in this film says: ""You did a Man's job, sir!"". Think about what that means. Like I wrote before, this film has multiple dimensions. Multiple viewings and thinking are required."

Contribution by each of them made this a compelling film.

"satishd1","5","0","4","22 June 2013"," A poor backdrop, a revealing eyesore to an otherwise brilliant undertaking!
","I'll just tell you the truth..this is a movie that I had heard and has been in the back of my mind for many many years..never got around to watching it. I was too young when it came out but I do catch up with some that have outlived their welcome. This one definitely did. Being a fan of Vangelis, I came across the soundtrack and my heart started pounding...I had to watch this!! My excitement mounted and my heart is beating fast as starting credits rolled..Vangelis is cluing me in to the Los Angles of 2019...But then, Harrison Ford stepped in, too wooden to move and too stoic to act, utterly bored to the core. I am wondering at this time if this movie is what it says it is..But then something else happened - the visuals! During the initial sequences, the city is presented at the very zenith of technological innovation and I was expecting that this would ensue.The breathtaking opening scene is a mood setter, is it not? But this was not to be, and therein lies a serious flaw in this movie...which had the immense potential to be a classic, but denigrated itself to be a cult. There is a difference...a classic has passed all accounts of cinematic standards..its beat them all. A cult on the other hand is one that is well liked by many...no reasons given. Most times, the reasons are flawed and this one belongs in that category. Not to digress, but the visuals that I aforementioned - relegates itself to old age cyberpunk,gets well-ingrained into a marginal subculture and becomes the centerpiece of the movie. The character is sidelined, the story goes awry, and the dreary shots of everyday urban Los Angeles, in not-too-distant future gets in your face and repeats itself with staggering consistently. The movie makes a point that despite the technology and the development, there is generally no hope for humanity. The future, my dear friends, has to be depressing and morose, especially for the poor. There is hope, but not for everyone, definitely not for the working class, not for the good only for the technically adept, the rulers of the future. This echoes consistently and is driven home at every turn that Deckard takes..it's always staring in your face like deformed face, wanting you to notice the ugliness, to accept that there is nothing pretty here and you better accept it.<br/><br/>When Daryl Hannah,a street whore stepped in and covered herself with papers on the street side...I gave up. Blade Runner,inspite of all the expectations and heart pounding excitement that it garnered within me..had let itself down. And I so..oh so desperately wanted it to shock me with sheer brilliance. But this is another attempt at science fiction, when Ridley Scott was learning his trade. At this juncture, a cinematic genius would have concluded that there is nothing that this young lad can look forward to. But alas, Scott has proved everyone wrong..but not with this one. This one needs to be forgotten!<br/><br/>A special mention of course - VANGELIS!! How could a score go so under-utilized? The genius that this score was, should have more than carried the movie...given the right back drop. But Vangelis is no match for the depression-era Los Angeles, cleverly disguised with neon boards and poorly masquerading itself to be 2019. What an eye sore!!<br/><br/>While it may be be unwarranted to do so, I take the liberty to contrast this to the science fiction movie of my time - The Matrix. It asks the same questions - What is humanity, can we beat the forces that control us, can we survive this onslaught, is there love, is this life worth it? It answers it too. The difference is - it sets a backdrop where your mind takes hold of it,takes a stand, and root for the good guys. It allows you to recognize yourself- that you are as vulnerable as Neo and yet can do something to change the world. It buys you in. Blade Runner on the other hand, keeps you aloof and at arms length, never opening the door for you to enter the LA of 2019. If does not allow you to emote,to participate, to root for, to empathize. The back drop does not allow this. It says ""stay away""...every which way it can. While there might be a cult following - multiple viewings, and reading into the flick for more that what it's worth, or going away with questions that even Deckard does not ask..is not being faithful to the spirit of a movie. If it takes multiple viewings to 'get it', it should be a sitcom and a 2 hr flick!!"

"geminiredblue","10","0","2","6 June 2013"," A Beautifully Hypnotic Techno-Thriller
","There's no other way to describe this Ridley Scott sci-fi noir. Based loosely on a Phillip K. Dick story called DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP, it chronicles the exploits of Deckard, a blade runner played by Harrison Ford in a wonderfully understated performance. He's been assigned to hunt down and destroy a group of Replicants, robots who look and act human, who escaped from an off-world slaving colony and killed some people. The group, led by Roy Batty- played icily by Rutger Hauer, has become self-aware of their four-year life limit and returned to earth seeking their creators, for more life. The story is set in Los Angeles of the future, where massive skyscrapers and flying cars tower and soar against a constantly dark and rainy sky. That equally matches the undertones of the film: marvels of modern science and technology, along with the dark side of such advances. Throughout the film, there are hints that Deckard himself might be a replicant. And the story has some interesting philosophical points to make about life, death, and memories. It even questions Deckard's job: It seems ridiculous for him to hunt down and kill creations who only want to live longer. The finale between Deckard and Batty is perhaps one of the most chilling and thought-provoking scenes in any sci-fi thriller, and the ending is appropriately dark and somewhat of a downer. But with this type of story, a happy ending would feel unnecessarily tacked on. So, if you're a fan of artistic sci-fi, watch this beautifully hypnotic techno-thriller!"
"Admiraljames11","10","0","3","31 May 2013"," A Look into the Future
","When discussing the works of Ripley Scott, it is extremely difficult at best not to use such cerebrally intimidating terms such as ""eclectic"", ""noir"", and ""dazzling technology"". As such, this review will attempt to keep such terms to a minimum. In 1979 Ridley Scotts second film that he ever made, ""Alien"", was a smash hit. (His first film ever was ""The Duelist"" in 1977, in case you were wondering). The movie Alien was hailed as a masterpiece in which he mixed visceral horror with science fiction. Its no surprise then, that Scott's third movie, he mixed film noir and science fiction in much the same way to make the technically astonishing movie ""Blade Runner"" based on the 1968 classic by Phillip Dick called ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"". Although it did not do well at the box office, it is another stroke of genius. As the movie starts off, there is a virtual tour of futuristic Los Angeles. The movie watcher is made to feel as if they have awoken from a cryogenic chamber and are observing the changes that have taken place.: The weather and environmental color is drab, there are gigantic animated billboards offering goods and services(something that didn't exist in 1982 but already exists now), and that Coke is still around. Even though the scenes were constructed using 1982 technology, they are still breathless and when viewed on a flat screen TV are close to three dimensional. Next is the introduction to the melancholic Deckard (played by Harrison Ford) who in contrast of the Replicants that he chases, appears to take life for granted. The philosophical themes in this picture are endless. One popular philosophy is that Deckard himself is a Replicant this theory is doubtful as Replicants appear to be superior in strength and maybe even intelligence to humans. Deckard is only able to bring Replicants down to retirement by relying on the one edge that humans have over Replicants: experience. Since Replicants can only live for four years, they do not have as much experience at anything as their human counterparts. In addition to the movies in depth philosophy, Blade Runner makes several realistic predictions: (1) Los Angeles/California is predicted as being culturally isolated and diverse to the point of mayhem. This forecast is even more probable today, than it was in 1982. California and especially Los Angeles has already become extremely diverse culturally. Caucasians no longer represent the majority of the population. Additionally, each ethnic group tends to isolate from the other ethnic groups. There is Chinatown, Korea Town, Olvera Street, and Watts. Each neighborhood has its own cultures and languages that are not only spoken, but seen on Billboards and even street signs. Select cultures are even pandered to by the government. Even though it is currently the law to be a US Citizen to vote and to have a driver's license, and even though it is a requirement to read English to become a US citizen, Drivers License exams and ballots are written in Spanish and many of the Asian languages Right pr wrong,. there is no need or incentive for an immigrant to assimilate into one uniform society. (2) Technology continues to advance at a prolific rate. From 1982 to 2010, technology has grown tremendously. No one in 1982 would have dreamed of DVDs, flat screen TVs, GPS systems, iPods, or cell phones that do just about everything would be in wide use in 2010. Flying cars may not be far off. It would appear that the only thing that might prevent Replicants from ever being built would be a possible ethical/political dilemma much like the one that surrounds cloning. (3) The weather and environment appears to be drearier. As global warming theories and oil and other toxic spills become more prevalent, this event is quite possible. (4) Big Corporations still exist and exert their influence. From the Coke billboards to the billboards offering a better life on a space colony, consumers are still being told that their life is inadequate but could be made better if they purchased certain products or moved to a ""better"" location. Watching the movie leaves one with the feeling of awe. The realism of situations and special effects only serve to enhance this effect. This movie is a much watch for any fan of science fiction, or to anyone who wants to get a look into the future."

It took a long time to get the recognition it deserved. Then again many great movies do. The film looks as good as anything you will see today visually. There are standout performances from Rutger Hauer and Harrison Ford. The music by Vangelis is beautiful with ""Memories of Green"" reflecting the true wonder of the movie.

","Blade Runner is a classic that I was first exposed to in high school days, when I studied it in English class. Later, during university, I was again able to study it, and I even wrote about it in my honours thesis.<br/><br/>Blade Runner presents a classic view of a very dingy, depressing future. When I think of this movie, one of the main things that comes into my head is the vision near the start of the smog- choked eternal-night cityscape with its exploding fires all over the place. Not exactly the kind of pretty future we hope for, and yet part of me wishes I could be alive to see such a future unfold. Yikes, what does that say about me? Am I perhaps an Apocalypse enthusiast? Well, maybe I am.<br/><br/>For anyone interested in imagining a dystopian world for writing or film-making or art purposes, this movie is a great place to start.<br/><br/>P.S.

I watched the film over and over again because with each viewing, the film unfolds a few surprises and ingenuity; the same effect displayed by 2001: A Space Odyssey. I hated both films equally, but decided to sacrifice the time I would never ever be getting back and re-watch them over and over again. I love the sci-fi noir mash-up presented and till this day, it still holds the very definition of so.<br/><br/>However, till now, I still feel detached from the characters. I care about them, but I don't feel the emotions they felt in the predicaments they got themselves into. The characters also seemed undeveloped and the acting is somewhat dry. Maybe, that was how they were written, to subtly inform us of their true nature: a human or a replicant. The dialogue itself also at times tend to be too cryptic and delivered woodenly. <br/><br/>For those who dislike or apathetic to this film should re-watch and reevaluate it. Like 2001: A Space Odyssey, it is not meant to be watch once. Then again, it's only MY opinion."

","Warning may contain spoilers Blade Runner is a film about a blade runner, a cop that hunts down replicants, and his journey to hunt down four replicants that hijacked a ship and returned to earth. The film proceeds to follow the blade runner Deckard played by Harrison Ford on his hunt to retire the remaining replicants that are led by Roy played by Rutger Hauer. The hunt for the replicants takes Deckard to various places, such as a China town bar, and the Tyrell Cor. HQ. Along the way, he falls for a woman and questions what he does for a living. The theme of the movie is the desire to live and be one's own person even if they are viewed by society as a slave or machine. A movie that has a similar theme would be A.I.<br/><br/>The film does a couple of things to maintain the flow and rhythm of the movie throughout. One of the ways it does this is through the editing. The dominant editing style of the film is outside/in editing. This is used since the film is quick paced and helps the audience quickly identify where the scene is going to take place. It adds to the overall coherence of the film. If this were not the dominant style, the film would be more difficult to follow and would slow the pace of the film. The inside/out style is used sparingly throughout the film. When this style is used, it causes increased curiosity in the upcoming scene. An example would be towards the beginning of the movie when the Tyrell Corp. employee is interviewing the replicant. The camera shows a building in the background, and then cuts to a man in a smokey room, then back to the exterior of a closer view of the building, then back to the man in the room, then a fluid motion up to a window in the building where one can see the fans of the room. This helps to create curiosity and tension for the upcoming scene.<br/><br/>The film also uses camera angels to give us a sense of the scale of the environment and helps us to relate to the characters. The film uses a mixture of indirect-subjective and objective points of view. The objective pints of view help us to take in the environment in all of its size and detail, as well as to view interactions between characters. The indirect-subjective viewpoint is used to make us feel like we are in the action and to get a better sense of the characters.<br/><br/>The film is entertaining and is quick paced. I however believe it is slightly lacking in character development. Other than that item, the film flows and is coherent. The movie is a good watch."

","In 1968 science fiction writer legend Philip K. Dick posed a legitimate question, asking: Do androids dream of electric sheep? Well, do they? If the thought hasn't crossed your mind yet, feel free to give it a shot... And/or try the movie version of Dick's novel, where Ridley Scott tries as well to shed some light on the matter and force us to think. And rethink again. As ""Blade Runner"" is indeed existential science-fiction in its purest form. Not mass audience compatible on its release, the film became cult nevertheless and Scott continued to make his own alterations, so the fifth cut was eventually labeled the final one. Voice-over, romance and additional side plots are either subdued in the current version or a thing of the past, while the central philosophical theme is now strongly emphasized, and the experience thus gets much more intense. ""Blade Runner"" takes place in a ""retrofitted"" future, in a society that has evolved, but where the intentions of the big corporations contrast with the squalor in the overcrowded streets of the megalopolis. This beautiful anti-future where man creates replicants in his own image in order to send them to dangerous, menial or leisure work on off-world colonies makes the perfect setting for the art form of neo-noir. Especially when some replicants are running wild. Time to make clear that their existence is limited.<br/><br/>""Blade Runner's"" cultural influence has been enormous. Its visual style constituted a model for many retro-future flics to come, the underlying themes proved fascinating and have held sci-fi fans in their grip until this day - plus there's that decisive extra where Scott begs to differ from Dick's novel. The movie version for sure brings us closer to answering Philip K. Dick's initial question: Do androids dream of electric sheep? After watching we might conclude: Yes, quite likely. But at the same time there's that new question that arises, which is: What's a replicant?"

","I first saw ""Blade Runner"" on TV, with Harrison's dull narration (which did not help) and the so-called ""Happy Ending"". I have since seen all the later director's cut versions and ""definitive"" versions. All are worth checking out, the movie is more interesting the more you watch it.<br/><br/>Set in 2019 Los Angeles, (somewhat ironically now) the film details a cop recommissioned to take out replicants, illegal clones of human beings. Harrison Ford play Rick Deckard, his initial reluctance and extreme accuracy are major clues to an essential plot revelation that is unsettling. Sean Young, arguably her best performance, is Rachael, a very special replicant made by Tyrell, the head of the corp. that makes them. Rutger Hauer, absolutely brilliant here, is Batty, the leader of a small group that hijacked a ship off world and returned to earth to get answers.<br/><br/>The visual effects and set designs are among the best ever, the fact that this was made in '82 is astounding, it is in fact so wonderfully made that one must pay attention or be lost. Apparently many have been lost. The Replicants crime is simply wanting to be human, pure and simply, Zhora is trying to hide, Leon is trying to help Batty get answers from Tyrell, same for Priss. None of them act out of maliciousness or greed. Deckard is very good as his job, doesn't mean he likes it, notice his sidekick Gaff, played well by Edward James Olmos in an almost unreadable part, he knows more than he says. Deckard could deal with the replicants and even his empty, meaningless life in a cyber-punk LA, if not for Rachael. Note Harrison's line, ""How can it not know what it is?"" Telling her this is one of the cruelest acts in the movie, but Deckard barely cares, at first. <br/><br/>One of the main points of this film, that many miss, is that the bad guys aren't bad and the good guy not really all that good. The noir feel and the mystery are spellbinding and the more you view it, the better it gets. Since I think it helps the viewer understand the film here goes for all those who wonder, Deckard is a replicant. There are several clues in the film, the unicorn that Gaff makes twice! the replicants are referred to as Nexus 5 and sometimes 6, my guess is Deckard is a nexus 4 and Rachael a 7. Note also that Batty knows who Deckard is and when he's about to fall him saying ""kinship!"" This plot point makes the whole story work, but it is rather subliminal. <br/><br/>Much has been made about the revised cuts, like I said, I like them all. The quick ending is a abrupt but more in sync with the film, the ""made for each other ending"" more intriguing and gives a nice cap to the romance between Deckard and Rachael. the unique style of Ridley Scott and the heavy-snyth score of Vangelis plus a supporting cast that includes; Daryl Hannah, William Sanderson, M. Emmet Walsh and the late, great Brion James, ""Blade Runner"" is a classic sci-fi film that should not be missed and never dismissed."
"rebecca-ry","7","0","3","15 July 2012"," An Excellent Film
","'Blade Runner' is often said to be one of the best sci-fi films ever and I can understand why.<br/><br/>The story is excellent; based on Philip K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" it talks about these artificial humans known as 'replicants' who have been deemed illegal on planet Earth punishable by death. Harrison Ford plays a blade runner whose job it is to hunt down and kill a group of rogue replicants. In the director's cut version the story is explained very well but it does drag out the story a bit too much. <br/><br/>Acting in this production is mixed. You have some really good performances; like those of Daryl Hannah and Rutger Hauer who play replicants. You also get fairly basic and wooden performances from Sean Young and surprisingly from Harrison Ford who fails to evoke any emotion whatsoever in this. In the last ten minutes of the film where the pace really picks up with the chase scene between Ford and Hauer there is no emphasis in Ford's character which really let scenes down. Hauer gives an excellent performance, particularly with his final short monologue.<br/><br/>Of course the special effects and music are now out-dated but they give the film a certain charm that means it still works today. The settings were excellent; Ridley Scott likes to do what he calls 'layering' in sets where he fills them with so much detail that they look real, this works great in this film. The dystopian setting where both night and day seem to look like the same thing and it constantly rains gives the film a great atmosphere and show just how great Scott is at his job. <br/><br/>Overall, I would thoroughly recommend 'Blade Runner'; it's an excellent film with a few aspects that let it down. The story is really interesting, the acting is mostly great with some exceptions and the settings are amazing."
"estebangonzalez10","8","0","3","22 June 2012"," 30 years from its release and still offers plenty of debate
","¨I need ya, Decks. This is a bad one, the worst yet. I need the old blade runner, I need your magic.¨ Blade Runner, Ridley Scott's follow up to Alien, wasn't a very successful movie at the time it was released. The problem might have been that it was ahead of its time, since this dark futuristic film noir sci-fi film was very different from the rest of the sci-fi films that were being released like Star Wars or E.T. The Extraterrestrial, which came out that same year and had a more light and entertaining mood. The problem with Blade Runner is that it's a much darker film and far more complicated. I really enjoyed this movie, although I don't consider it a masterpiece as most people do. This movie has become a cult film several years after its release and is among the best sci-fi films in the history of cinema. The dark screenplay was adapted by Hampton Fancher and David Webb Peoples from Philip K. Dirk's famous fiction novel ¨Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?¨ I have to admit that I watched the director's cut version without the voice over from Harrison Ford's character so I really don't know if it was better that way or not, but from what I understand Ford's voice-over wasn't very good. Although one would assume that the voice over would definitely give it a more film noir vibe to it. The best thing about Blade Runner definitely is the great artistic direction where there is a very dark mood thanks to the use of lots of black and grey and a lot of smoke. Scott's vision of the future isn't a very bright one and there is a sense of pessimism that reigns all over the film, including in its main characters.<br/><br/>The film takes place in the city of Los Angeles during 2019 where Earth is no longer the only planet humans can live on. Most people have left to other planets with the promise of a better life and new opportunities where they can achieve their dreams and goals. Technology has also advanced in such a way that human's have been able to create androids that are so similar to humans that it's almost impossible to differentiate them. These ¨replicants¨ are used mostly to do the dirty work in the colonies outside of Earth. The company that has produced these special robots is run by Tyrell (Joe Turkel) who has given his latest replicants a lifespan of only four years in order to control them and make sure they don't develop such complex emotions that will make it impossible to differentiate them from real humans. The only way to differentiate these robots is through a psychological test called the VK test. Blade runners are police detectives who specifically work on hunting down these replicants and putting them down since they aren't allowed to live on Earth. Deckard (Harrison Ford) is an ex blade runner living in Los Angeles who seems quite displeased with life. His ex boss, Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh) calls for him for one last mission after several dangerous replicants have found their way back to Earth and are causing all sorts of trouble. These replicants are searching for their creator because they want to be given the opportunity to live longer. The replicants that are still on the loose and that he has to hunt down are Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), Pris (Daryl Hannah), Leon (Brion James), and Zhora (Joanna Cassidy).<br/><br/>Despite having to hunt down the replicants one by one, the film isn't just your typical action film where you have one persecution after another. There is more depth to the story as these replicants all have personalities of their own and are very different from each other. More than an action film, this is a very dark and obscure sci-fi film noir and it works really well although I did find some aspects of the film a little too weird and bizarre. Harrison Ford was one of the best actors around in the 80's and he delivers as this sort of tormented character who really begins to question his moral actions. This is a much darker role than those he played in the Indiana Jones and Star Wars franchise. The film also raises several philosophical questions and actually plays out as a parable about discovering who we really are, the search for immortality and not wanting to know the date of our death. How far will mankind go to reach a longer life? Do the means justify the main character's acts? The film raises several questions and lets the viewer search for their own meaning and answers. It's been almost 30 years since the film has been released and it still raises a lot of debate amongst fans and there is plenty to discuss about Blade Runner, but I don't want to give away any spoilers. I still don't consider this movie as good as Alien, but it is a very well made sci-fi film noir.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"
"bobdude-2","8","0","3","21 June 2012"," Blade Runner - movie vs book
","Blade Runner is a freakin' classic of Sci-Fi. Me and my friends used to do our best Harrison Ford voice ""tell me about your mother."" Recently, I had been going through some of Philip K. Dick's work including Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?. Now there are books that are so close to the movie it seems tough to tell which came first such as ""The Princess Bride."" Other movies don't resemble the source book much at all like ""The Door in the Floor."" Blade Runner was between the two but, boy, a lot was missing from the movie. The book contains some interesting pieces of the story involving how the remaining earthlings deal with the lack of people after the wars. This includes a lack of animals resulting in... yes, electric sheep! There are other bounty hunters who work for the androids who have escaped back to earth and have actually have set up their own police department. That makes for an interesting development. <br/><br/>Rachel is in the book. She is a little different than the movie. Although the scene in which Deckard questions her is very close to the book. Blade Runner is an excellent movie, but it is only loosely based on the Book. There is one problem that leaves the movie a bit empty though. Spoiler alert for a 30 year-old movie and 40 year-old book! Later in the book Deckard sleeps with Rachel, too. However, in the book it is an empty experience. After the act, he realizes it is nothing like a relationship with a real human female. So you can see the problem. In the ending of the movie he goes off to spend Rachel's remaining years with her. Now the movie needs a new ending!"
"glypo","10","0","2","17 May 2012"," Blade Runner - Just as excellent on Blu-Ray
","First let's talk about the Blu-Ray release. The video quality is superb here, I didn't think it would make the difference that it has. Unlike a lot of films from the 90's this isn't spoilt by the higher resolution, CGI effects really ruin many older films released on Blu-Ray as the new higher resolution uncovers their flaws. Blade Runner is an old film (1982) as such relied heavily on models and matte paintings - consequently its age actually helps as it now looks better than ever in 1080p (video bit-rate varies from 16-24Mbps VC-1, typically around 18Mbps).<br/><br/>I have to watch Blade Runner at least once every 3-4 months. Ridley Scott made a very dark film, and though some aspects feel dated now (CRT monitors, printed photographs etc) the film feels as genuine as ever with an ability to pull one into the Blade Runner future. The story is fantastic and the themes are as relevant as ever.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is rightly classed as one of the best sci-fi films of all time."

This takes place in 2019 Los Angeles and Deckard (Ford) is an ex-cop sent to hunt down a group of dangerous human-like androids called, replicants. They have short lifespans and wish to meet their maker to fix them.

Roy (Hauer) Pris (Hannah), Zora (Cassidy) and Leon (James) are the replicants. As Deckard confronts them one by one, he gains a little sympathy towards them. He and Rachel also end up falling for each other. Walsh plays police captain, Bryant who sends Deckard on his mission, Olmos plays his assistant, Gaff and Sanderson (True Blood) plays toymaker, J.F. Sabastian who works for Tyrell. This is a great sci-fi flick with a good cast and excellent score by Vangelis. It kind of makes you wonder if the future could really be like this. The film is also known to have multiple versions, but I prefer the theatrical one. I recommend this 80's classic."
"bjhadse","6","0","3","12 September 2011"," A Flawed Classic
","It's easy to see why ""Blade Runner"" is considered a classic of the Sci-Fi genre. This highly stylized film sports a pervasively dark and moody atmosphere that's second only to old German Expressionist films and its art direction is absolutely stunning (particularly Tyrell's Egyptian-esque office set above the bleak LA streets). Its influence is plainly evident in nearly any ""Future Noir"" film which followed it.<br/><br/>The problem with the film (or, at least, with the original theatrical cut) is the snail-paced editing of any non-action scene. I'm prone to agree with one critic who referred to the film as ""Blade Crawler."" Despite an admirable cast, gritty, stylized realism and otherwise admirable direction, the pacing stops the movie dead in its tracks. So many dramatic scenes run overly long (most notably the scene of pseudo-rape between Deckard and Rachael). I'm told that this problem is lessened (some say absent entirely) in later cuts of the movie; maybe I'll find one of those cuts more to my liking (I can only hope), as it's the biggest obstacle between itself and a genuine masterpiece.<br/><br/>Mr. Ford evidently shares my opinion on the obtrusive voice-over narration of the film. It really adds nothing to the end product aside from a stylistic nod to Film Noir. The actions described or elaborated on are obvious to an attentive viewer. The most glaring example is the climax of the film, when, after a desperate fight between Roy and Deckard in and on top of the skyscrapers of LA, Roy saves Deckard from falling off the roof before he himself dies. Instead of a terse, contemplative silence that could have added to the prevailing mood of the film, we're subjected to a overly-sappy analysis from Deckard about the value of life.<br/><br/>Fans of Science-Fiction will enjoy the film for its bleak view of the future. Fans of Film Noir will enjoy it for the stylistic nods to the genre (strong use of lighting, voice-over, hard-nosed protagonist, moody atmosphere, etc...). Fans of both Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford will enjoy it as an early example of both men's careers (it's Scott's third film and one of Ford's first with real dramatic depth)."

"Aaron1375","7","0","2","3 March 2010"," Great visuals, acting, and some interesting story elements.
","This movie could have been an easy ten as it nearly has it all. Except for one thing that would have helped immensely. Is it the visuals you ask? No, the visuals look great even for a movie made back in 1982. It captures a futuristic city so well, a dark and grimy place with technology in areas to give it a certain color scheme. It is almost a live action anime when one looks at other films such as ""Akira"". Is it the acting you ask? No, the acting could not be better, Harrison Ford playing the lead, a man who hunts down rouge androids and Rutger Hauer is always excellent if you ask me. No one does a better job if he had a more typical Hollywood look he would have been the lead in a lot more mainstream fare. And Sean Young and Daryl Hannah look absolutely great, with Daryl looking rather hot. So is it the story? Not entirely. The story has very good elements in it and there is something there. So what is it you ask? Well I know I am going to get hammered for voicing this opinion, but keep in mind it is an opinion...the main thing I had a problem with is the lack of action. I know story and such are important and yes there are lots of movies with no action I like, but this movie was about a man hunting down dangerous androids. This alone should entail that there is going to be a lot more action in the movie than there ended up being. Though the ending was excellent and everything else in this movie was superbly done, I needed some more shoot outs, more blood, and more death. At times the pacing in the movie had me a tad bored, and while it was still nice to look at and it was nice to see the actors have some good dialog, I always kept wanting more adrenaline type action. So there I said it, and I sort of regret it as this is probably one of those movies that people will not take to kindly anything negative said about it. Overall though it was a fine movie and entertaining. I loved Ford as the hunter like I said and I always enjoy Hauer. It amazes me this movie did not do better at the box office than it did. Just the visual style of it had to be something to marvel at back in 1982. So a rather good movie that could have been nearly perfect with a bit more action."

The neo-cityscapes, the dark street life and polluted air; all paint a grim futuristic picture complimented by a Vangelis score; which is touching and haunting. The lines are memorable and there are fantastic performances from Rutger Hauer, Sean Young and Edward James Olmos. Harrison Ford is perfect as the moody ex- Blade Runner and Joe Turkel should have won an award as the Frankenstein -like creator.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is quite a simplistic tale that is complicated by the fantastic visuals and effects. Lying beneath the plot that many writers contributed to, there's heart and soul, questions of what it means to be human and even delves into our own mortality.<br/><br/>Its edgy hi-tech art-house that brings science fiction to life and while it's not the most fulfilling sci-fi film it certainly is a fantastic visual experience."
"blackmamba99971","10","0","2","25 January 2010"," The greatest Scott classic
","Blade Runner... A one of a kind science fiction movie of its time. Ridley Scott delivered something special when he directed this gem using state of the art special effects along with a unique soundtrack, which was provided by the most beloved composer Vangelis. Quite frankly this film was way ahead of its time because of specific scenes that involved flying cars, a gritty landscape or overly tall buildings that shadowed Los Angeles's citizens like dark slabs of death.<br/><br/>Beautifully crafted were Douglas Trumbulls' flying vehicles along with high tech gadgetry that Dekkard (Harrison Ford) uses in finding his targets, which are called Replicants. They are Illegal humanoids used for off world colonies as slave labour, but a group of such slaves escape, then head for earth in order to find their creator Doctor Tyrell (Joe Turkel) in order to extend their lives because each one has a four year life span. The most desperate among them is Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) who leads them through the city streets of Los Angeles finding each specialist who had a hand in creating the Replicants.<br/><br/>Tasked with finding Tyrell for an audience Roy discovers a man who is a genetic designer, and Roy convinces him albeit a tenuous request finally attains his goal of speaking with his creator. This film has all the ingredients of a great detective story. Harrison Ford delivers a poignant role as the smooth talking blade runner pairing up with Rachel (Sean Young) who only just realizes that she too is a Replicant but she did not even know it. The movie has action to a degree to keep it as a refined detective tale, with good chase scenes, clue finding, plus a moral code embedded inside to show us why it is so wrong to enslave life, no matter if they are human or not.<br/><br/>What was also interesting about this movie during the last scene was when Roy Batty who spoke to Dekkard on the rooftop of a building at the end of their cat and mouse game, was that Rutger Hauer delivered his final lines totally ad-Libbed surprising even Harrison Ford from the reaction he displayed. It worked so well that Ridley Scott decided to call it a wrap once Roy died.<br/><br/>Blade Runner has become one of the most beloved classics of all time mainly for its incredible cast, music, special effects, story line, and brute sequences of action. For the international version, which is the original theatrical release it helps the viewer understand what Ridley wanted as far as emotional content was concerned. Such as a scene where Pris (Daryl Hannah) was shot by Dekkard multiple times then started to violently spasm on the hard cold wood floor screaming beyond all measure trying to keep alive. It was one of the most potent scenes in movie history, which surprised Ford as he watched Hannah wriggling so grossly.<br/><br/>This is what made Blade Runner the most desired film of all time for viewers alike. Raw, stark emotions, gritty landscapes, beautifully crafted flight sequences provided by Douglas Trumbull who by the way worked on 2001 a space odyssey, as well as Close Encounters of the Third Kind treating us to the mind bending space crafts as well as the mother ship. Since the inception of Blade Runner Ridley has been working on a sequel, which will surprise fans all over the world with Blade Runner 2049. A new twist to the most adored sci-fi adventure in movie history. I highly recommend this film for detective, sci-fi fans like myself. Not for audiences lower than age 17 for its brutal scenes."

","I understand that things were done to the original film which I saw in a movie theater. It's been so long that I have no basis for comparison. Watching the Director's cut, I found it as engaging as I remember. It's sad when we have a hero who is basically a cold blooded murderer. The evil rest with ourselves. Can we really destroy a sentient being and have a moral justification. Once these replicants began to think for themselves, do we lose our right to them. Think of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein as Victor chases the monster across the ice. The creature cries out to him as his maker that he is part of him. These are seen as monsters, but they have no control over what they have become. Their memories are theirs, even though they were implanted. This is such a bleak view of our future and it plays very well in 2010. It is a feast for the eyes and is much better science fiction than most films made since. Ford's performance is intense and driven. This is an excellent film. I was curious why Leonard Maltin gave it one-and-a-half stars."

","Due to the complexity of this film, and it's many different versions, I've .... watching this film for a long time. Now that director Ridley Scott have released the final cut and I felt I had a better understanding of films, I decided to see it. Well it's well worth the wait, and If you haven't seen it, well what are you waiting for? <br/><br/>This movie has earned a place among the top 10 Sci-Fi films of all time, and I understand why. Like most movies from the 80's based on earth future, it has a very unique and of course wrong impression of the coming future. Some of the technology is too good, and some still looks like the 80's. But that doesn't matter, it the story that important in Blade Runner. I'm not really gonna spoil anything, but it's very deep story with many interesting parallels. Since the movie is about artificial humans it's no wonder people have said that there are religious analogy's in this film. It I would at least say that it's not impossible. There are many hidden symbols in this film, and much that I still don't understand. And this is definitely a film that must be viewed many times, before you fully understands it.<br/><br/>I must say I was impressed by seeing Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard. Since this movie is from 1982, Harrison Ford made this between the shooting of Star Wars the empire strikes back and return of the Jedi. And still Ford brings us one of his strongest performances ever. Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty is definitely a scene stealer, as he brings us a chilling performance, as well as a character we emphasize with. Daryl Hannah & Edward James Olmos as Pris and Gaff are two of the most enigmatic characters I've ever seen in film.<br/><br/>A lot of the credit should go to Hampton Fancher and David Webb Peoples for this brilliant screenplay. And Ridely Scott made sure it was handled the right way. If you're a Sci-Fi fan or like deep and meaningful films, you have missed a lot if you haven't seen this film.<br/><br/>I give this film no other rating than a 10/10."

","I don't watch this film as often as a lot of my all time favourites, because that's like trying to eat a side of beef everyday! There's so much here, it's a challenge to your eyes, ears and everything else. Some films are like an entrée, some a main course, others a dessert. Then there's this, a meal for the cinematic mind that fills me up something really fierce. I don't feel the need to take in anything else for a while, because ""Blade Runner"" stuffs me to my limit.<br/><br/>You probably know the story and have your own opinions about who is what and all that jive. Let's talk about how well this has held up for so many years. It practically looks like it was made last week! Only ""2001"" before it and ""The Matrix"" since have had the impact ""Blade Runner"" has (don't get me started on ""Star Wars"", I have no desire to see that again). And I'm still waiting for the next visionary to come along, take the baton and run with it. <br/><br/>Dick wasn't too thrilled with many approaches to books adapted for the screen, his in particular. The overall attitude towards science facts and fiction is almost 100% different than in those days when the first attempts to make ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?"" reared their heads. He outright hated what was on the initial agenda and then after seeing early footage of ""Blade Runner"", changed his tune radically (in interviews one can hear, but not see, on a supplemental disc of the special edition of this classic).<br/><br/>Harrison Ford had many intriguing parts between instalments of his mega global hit franchises. Rick is the greatest of all his dramatic ciphers, someone existing to connect the dots that can barely be seen at all. Watch him struggle to stay on two legs, physically and psycho-emotionally, as you can never really imagine Indiana Jones, Han Solo or the creepy man he played in ""The Conversation"" trying to similarly keep their heads above water. He's a man truly alone even in a crowd, that probably has a dozen thoughts competing for room in his overloaded brain all the time.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott has made a feast for graphic designers, with every shot holding some image that makes you go, ""wow!"" I was shocked when buying a video game system a while back that there wasn't a ""Blade Runner"" game display advertising all the big companies on board with cheapening the memories of this landmark for the sake of money. When you just expect any vital film now to have it's ancillary profits boosted through those markets, it's rather refreshing to not see children from ten to fifty playing ""Rick"", like his significance was just destined to be a gamer's amusement."

","This movie is great on so many levels. In terms of an urban dystopia it reminds me a lot of Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"" (Or should I say it foreshadowed ""Brazil"" since it was made three years earlier). It is one of the rare films that does not paint all in black and white, and in the end you feel mixed emotions, sorry for the replicants and realize perhaps the villain of the piece was actually Dr. Tyrrel playing God with increasingly human-like androids which, like beautiful but flawed automobiles, are cursed with ""planned obsolescence."" And who hasn't been in an interview situation like that with which the film opens where some slick, supercilious HR type is trying to pigeonhole you with a few questions? I couldn't help but cheer for Leon as he blows him away. The Tyrrel corporation is evil, as the way they are playing God with the replicants makes clear.<br/><br/>The other, less prosperous techno-nerds of the piece come off somewhat better. The Chinese eye designer in the cold room, and J.F. Sebastian, the ultimate nerd, who lives alone with his ""toys"" in a crumbling run down apartment building called ""The Bradbury"" in a tip of the hat to another great science Fiction writer. (I guess you couldn't have called the apartment building ""The Dick"" after Phillip K. Dick, the writer from whose novel this film was drawn.) Sebastian (William Sanderson) is a prematurely old genetic engineer who has created his own phantasmagorical world in his large flat. Like his creations the replicants, he has a limited life span, only in his case it is a medical condition and not as withthe Nexus 6 model replicants caused by a pre-determined limitation on their life span.<br/><br/>In the middle of this is the title character, the Blade Runner, otherwise known as Deckard (Harrison Ford) and Gaff (Edward James Olmos) who keeps Deckard from wandering off in disgust, and who has a strange habit of leaving samples of origami wherever he goes. The Blade Runner falls in love with a beautiful replicant (Sean Young) who doesn't even know she is a replicant, at first. Deckard dutifully goes about his business, tracking down and ""retiring"" the outlaw replicants, but clearly seems in the end caught in the middle of a moral dilemma.<br/><br/>In the end the story is a parable of the sadness and shortness of life, which for those of us in middle life becomes ever more poignant. It seems clear we are all programmed to die by our maker."

But it could be that the story serves as a veil to the more important aspects of the film which is its message.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is fantastic and the enigmatic nature of the film's production make it a huge draw for viewers like me."
"loganx-2","9","0","1","28 April 2009"," ""More Human Than Human is Our Motto""
","Someone asked me whats the point of this besides ""Replicants are human too, duh"". I think it isn't that in ""Blade Runner"" the Replicants are human too, they are the ONLY humans.<br/><br/>Deckard, the three scientists who are in charge of designing, the eyes, the body, and the brains, of the Replicants, and Edward James Olmos, are all just doing their job. They exist to serve a function, and to perform a task and they do so, like machines. The scientists are practically on an assembly line, each designing a piece, so as not to comprehend the meaning of the whole. ""The eyes are the window to the soul"" Rutger Haur notes, meeting the man who designed his eyes, yet this man knows nothing. The first image in Blade Runner, is a close up on eye with the city reflected from it, as if within the soul there is nothing but a dark city full of smog, fire, and billboards (eyes and screens are recurrent visual motif that come up again and again in this). The first view we are introduced to, the perspective is that of someone whose soul contains nothing, but a reflection of the world around them.<br/><br/>Deckard is a little annoyed that he has to come out of retirement, but what are you gonna do, ""your not us, your little people"" as his boss tells him. Only the replicants ask human questions and are driven by human desires like who am I, why do I exist, how can I escape death. For PKD and Ridley Scott, it would seem, these are the fundamental questions which all sentient beings must ask themselves, in order to become human. Without which we lose what makes us any more than biological furniture. ""More human than human is our motto"", as the good doctor says about his clone factory.<br/><br/>Deckard and the rest of the future, is trapped in a constant darkness where the sun never comes up and the only light comes from giant advertisements, that absorb the landscape into themselves. People scurry about like ants (unconcerned or unaware of the world around them), and even Deckard who has the benefit of not being ""little people"" spends his time, like a burn out film noir detective, in a dim apartment, killing time.<br/><br/>The Replicants have become more human than the human beings. They like Deckard used to kill for a living, but abandoned that for the possibility of something more, which he has not. Their actions are driven by a need to live as something more than an object and body. Theirs is an existential ordeal, in a world of economic determinism. Their actions though possibly futile are still authentic, they are their actions, and no one else's. Hauer killing off his creator, is a little like Don Quixote fighting off his windmills, an absurd waste of energy, though it's Hauer's awareness and Quixote's lack there of, which defines them as a character, and human beings.<br/><br/>We assume that since Harrison Ford is the lead we are supposed to empathize with him, which I imagine is where all the irrelevant conjecture about him being a replicant comes from. It doesn't matter if he is or isn't, because the real criterion for humanity is not birthright, but performance. It's only through meeting the scientists assistant who doesn't know she is a replicant, is he faced with doing something that violates his ""social programming"". By the end it's implied, that he will save the woman, risking himself for someone who will only live four or five years anyway.<br/><br/>He has recognized not just that Hauer or those he killed were real thinking people like himself, but that they in fact were better than him, closer in classic terms to being authentic people(""the unexamined life is not worth living""etc), because at least they know they are fake, and chose to struggle anyway. Only when faced with artificial reproductions of ourselves (be it robots, stories, paintings, photos, movies, sculpture, etc), do we get a reflection of what is to be human.<br/><br/>Or as one of my favorites PKD quotes, says in other words ""So we and our elaborately evolving computers may meet each other halfway. Someday a human being, named perhaps Fred White, may shoot a robot named Pete Something-or-other, which has come out of a General Electric factory, and to his surprise see it weep and bleed. And the dying robot may shoot back and, to its surprise, see a wisp of gray smoke arise from the electric pump that it supposed was Mr. White's beating heart. It would be rather a great moment of truth for both of them."" So not exactly an ""I, Robot"" film about robo-equal rights, or a Matrix cautionary 'the machines will get us"" story. Instead Ridley Scott shows us a world where human beings are less than machines, more privileged, colder, less aware, and without compassion, and does so in a visual landscape unlike anything movies had seen before"

","Blade Runner, I have to agree, is one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time. If you are a fan of science-fiction movies, this one is essential.<br/><br/>I thought the scenery to the movie was just great and I loved some of the action the movie had to offer. The way Rick Deckard was facing off against Roy Batty was a great part of the movie, where Rick was trying to run from Roy because two fingers on his right hand were snapped by Roy. Another thing I loved about it is the way the cars were moving in the air as well.<br/><br/>The electronic music score by Vangelis, I think, matched the mood of the entire film in such a great way, since it is set in the future.<br/><br/>I have heard it's a shame book fanatics seem to like this film, because this film happens to be based on a book called ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sleep"" by Phillip K. Dick, and it doesn't follow the book exactly.<br/><br/>It's also a shame Harrison Ford (who played Rick Deckard) didn't like this movie, but Rutger Hauer did. It's also a shame it did not do very well upon its initial release, but it has become a valid cult classic and one of the best science-fiction films ever.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was just so interesting, everything about it changed my life forever and made a big impact on me.<br/><br/>As of what I said, I would recommend this movie highly for anybody to watch (not children though, because of its parental rating). It's a masterpiece, a highly unique film that should be watched from time to time again. My rating: 10 out of 10."
"AlexTheGreyWolf","10","0","2","15 March 2009"," A must-watch for any Sci-Fi fan
","I'm ashamed I haven't seen this movie until now. I've been hearing about this movie for years, I always wondered why so many people have said good things about it, yet I doubted it could be really as good as they said it was, mostly because it was made in 1982. After watching Natural City which is based on Blade Runner I decided to finally watch Blade Runner and I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>From the very start of the movie I felt like I just got into a roller coaster but this was a special roller coaster because instead of many ups and downs this ride was exhilarating from start to finish. At the beginning of the movie you're given a fly-over of the city of Los Angeles in 2019, I was amazed at how beautiful it was.<br/><br/>It's interesting to note how far-off the director was with the level of technology we will be having by 2019, back then people thought we'd have flying cars by the year 2000, but look at us we're in 2009 and still no flying cars and still depending on archaic oil for fuel. However the director's error in judgement thankfully doesn't distract from the movie at all.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is about replicants, artificial humanoid life forms that are virtually identical to humans, who were created for the purpose of slave labor and colonization of other planets. When a group of replicants betrayed their human masters in an off-world planet all replicants were banned from Earth. A special police unit designated as Blade Runner were given the mission to hunt for replicants on Earth and ""retire"" them.<br/><br/>The camera-work in this movie was excellent, it makes you feel like you are a part of the movie. When the main character is walking in the city you feel as if you're walking next to him. When he's in a flying car you feel like if you're flying next to him, it's a wonderful experience, you get a sense of what it would be like to live in that city.<br/><br/>The only negative I can think of for this movie is that it only lasts two hours, I wanted it to go on for at least two more hours, that's how good the movie was. If you haven't seen it go see it now, I'd recommend watching the Blu-Ray version, the quality of the video is so good it's even better than some recent movies, and that's not just my opinion."

These are used as slaves to work off land. But when one goes ""crazy"" you could say and commits murder they are banned from earth. Punishment for them being there is death or ""retirement""! then comes the best bit you have ""Deckard"" who works for the LAPD's blade runner unit.

"chris_hopper74","9","0","3","1 March 2009"," Not to all tastes, but brilliant in itself
","Is a film great because you really like it, or because it is technically brilliant? I love Star Wars - I've watched it more than any other film ever - but, deep down, as much as I struggle to admit it, it is really not very good (effects aside). Some give it 8, 9 or 10 out of 10, yet by any real assessment of overall technical criteria (acting, plot, narrative, depth etc) it cannot possibly justify this. The same applies to music. I don't like Queen, but grudgingly recognise the quality of their music; I happen to 'like' Beethoven, while also recognising that his music is truly and almost timelessly great (albeit some will not appreciate it or like it). Blade Runner falls into that category of film that is technically great yet will divide opinion, more than many films, at the personal or emotional level. I can quite see why it will leave some cold (and hence scored at 1, 2, or 3 out of 10). There is little action as such; the plot requires imagination and reconstruction on the part of the viewer; the moral ambiguity requires a deeper, almost philosophical, level of understanding and reflection. In many ways, it is like listening to a symphony; or rather it requires a similar mode of appreciation. It could quite easily leave one cold and/or confused. I guess the usual accusation of 'elitism' or 'snobbery' or 'emperor's new clothes' might be raised at this point - i.e. I am appearing patronisingly critical of those who dismiss the film because they 'don't get it'. Actually I'm not. I return to my opening question. A fair few people won't like this film - any more than some people don't like Queen, or Beethoven, or Star Wars - and no-one denies their right to express their dislike. But, technically, deep down, this is a great film... like it or not!"
"Red_Flag","10","0","2","20 February 2009"," My favorite movie of all time
","Blade Runner posed question most of us were afraid to answer. The most predominant of which was what will become of us if we allow the media to control us. The film represents 21st century life as a dystopian wasteland controlled by the censor, were our lives are pre-determined and were we can't turn a street corner without being confronted with a garish advertisement, none of which was a real problem back in 1982 when the movie was released. Which is why today's audiences have managed to connect so wonderfully with this movie. The neo-noir classic has a visual flair unmatched by any other film, not only in it genre, but quite possibly of all time. These days, it's almost impossible to find a gritty science fiction motion picture that doesn't owe at least a small debt to Blade Runner's visual style. And yet this manages effortlessly to balance both its substance and its style perfectly. Each character is fleshed out perfectly, each giving depth and insight to the grand scheme of it all.<br/><br/>A blend of science fiction and noir detective fiction, Blade Runner (1982) was a box office and critical bust upon its initial exhibition, but its unique postmodern production design became hugely influential within the sci-fi genre, and the film gained a significant cult following that increased its stature. Harrison Ford stars as Rick Deckard, a retired cop in Los Angeles circa 2019. L.A. has become a pan-cultural dystopia of corporate advertising, pollution and flying automobiles, as well as replicants, human-like androids with short life spans built by the Tyrell Corporation for use in dangerous off-world colonization. Deckard's former job in the police department was as a talented blade runner, a euphemism for detectives that hunt down and assassinate rogue replicants. Called before his one-time superior (M. Emmett Walsh), Deckard is forced back into active duty.<br/><br/>A quartet of replicants led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) has escaped and headed to Earth, killing several humans in the process. After meeting with the eccentric Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel), creator of the replicants, Deckard finds and eliminates Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), one of his targets. Attacked by another replicant, Leon (Brion James), Deckard is about to be killed when he's saved by Rachael (Sean Young), Tyrell's assistant and a replicant who's unaware of her true nature. In the meantime, Batty and his replicant pleasure model lover, Pris (Darryl Hannah) use a dying inventor, J.F. Sebastian (William Sanderson) to get close to Tyrell and murder him. Deckard tracks the pair to Sebastian's, where a bloody and violent final confrontation between Deckard and Batty takes place on a skyscraper rooftop high above the city. In 1992, Ridley Scott released a popular director's cut that removed Deckard's narration, added a dream sequence, and excised a happy ending imposed by the results of test screenings; these legendary behind-the-scenes battles were chronicled in a 1996 tome, Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner by Paul M. Sammon.<br/><br/>Verdict: Blade Runner remains a dark masterpiece exploringandroid slavery and the decay of the human condition. Its visceral imagery of afuturistic and dystopian Los Angeles sticks with you for life. This raw, gorgeous,poetic masterpiece is one of the few films on my list that will have youreimagining the way you live your life. As time goes by, it's increasinglyapparent just how high this film towers."

","Most sci-fi movies these days come complete with a lousy story, bad plot elements, horrible acting, no-name actors, awful CGI and no back-story. Thankfully Blade Runner makes up for all of these.<br/><br/>Although I did get lost in the story quite a few times, I still enjoyed the movie quite a bit. The plot was very thick and hard to follow at times but it seemed to work out anyway.<br/><br/>The make-up and scenery were the best part of the film. It was very fantasy-like and almost dream-like. It was a utopia yet chock full of flaws. The music score helped it along very nicely.<br/><br/>Now for the acting: Harrison Ford was flawless as usual as Rick Deckard, the protagonist who is sent after the replicants. Edward James Olmos was exceptional as Gaff, the creepy officer who follows Deckard around. M. Emmett Walsh was very good as Lt. Bryant, Deckard's supervisor. William Sanderson was perfect as JF Sebastian, the lonely researcher/creator. Joe Turkel was good as Dr. Tyrell, CEO of Tyrell Corporation. Now for the replicants: Rutger Hauer was phenomenal as Roy Batty, the leader of the replicant group. Daryl Hannah was perfect as Pris, Roy's love interest and Sebastian's new-found friend. Brion James was exceptional as Leon Kowalski, the replicant posing as a worker in the Tyrell Corporation. Joanna Cassidy was great as Zhora, a replicant acting as an exotic dancer. And Sean Young was excellent as Rachael, a replicant working for Tyrell.<br/><br/>There were many small signs and symbols in the movie that represented peace, freedom, who was with who, things like that. The movie is really memorable.<br/><br/>Sci-Fi fans should like this one.<br/><br/>9/10."
"pc95","10","0","2","6 February 2009"," Favorite Science Fiction Movie imparts pure Melancholy
","Saw the original cut of Blade Runner in late 80's as a kid growing up then. It was and is an utterly mesmerizing cinematic experience - easily my favorite science fiction film. It's mixture of visuals, music, characters, and dialog rendering a future succeeds in evoking despair, sadness, and finality of something winding down. The movie is wonderfully re-watchable and fantastically brings you down with melancholy. Everything isn't always happy in the world, and it's just as valid and cathartic to experience this in a movie as any other emotion. As counter to many Blade Runner enthusiasts, I'm a huge fan of Harrison Ford's narration - beyond exactly what he's saying I think his octave and cadence lends credence to the mood - it's an enhancement. We feel comforted by his voice validating what his character is going through, unable to make sense of a world and people and replicants blurring together. Vangelis as with Year of Living Dangerously and Chariots of Fire, creates wondrous work key to creating the experience with blue-sy retreads and electronic flat/sharp chords. Ridley Scott has never surpassed himself in scope and detail - his perfectionism and vision have never been better. This is a beacon and marker for other movies to try to aspire to not only in terms of look and design but of effectiveness in evoking an intended atmosphere and mood, exactly what movies are designed to do."
"trainythyhyhy","10","0","2","15 January 2009"," Masterful sci-fi thriller from Ridley Scott
","When i first watched Blade Runner (directors cut) i thought it was a very good, superbly made sci-fi. Recently i gave it a second viewing and have come to the conclusion that it is a masterpiece. There are many reasons for this. The film follows Deckard, a so called blade runner who must 'retire' a group of replicants who have found there way to earth. Sounds simple doesn't it... it isn't. This film is so layered in subtext and moral themes it is impossible to pick up on its genius with one viewing.<br/><br/>it is an incredibly visual film filled with such memorable cinematic moments and deep symbolism, a unicorn gallops across the screen, a perfect symbol of purity and goodness in a moment when the central character, played by Harrison ford, remembers how it was before. a white dove flys off into a miraculously blue sky placing a profound importance on the defining moment of the film. not only is this visually stunning but the story has so many implications about human nature and life and death. Scotts direction is masterful as always and some of the sequences create a crackling atmosphere of genuine suspense. where Scott excels is in cutting from one scene to a striking image in the next, for example Roys inhumanly clenching fist or a delicately made origami sculpture. the score is perfectly suited to the film and so evocative of the time and place, it really enhances The scenes focusing on the wasted cityscape of 2019 LA. Fords performance is excellent and he adds an underlying sense of pain in his character which might otherwise be missing. The ending of the directors cut leaves room for personal interpretation although i wont mention what happens in case i spoil it. Suffice to say i found the true meaning of the film is both a damning comment on society and an exploration of what it means to be human.... but thats just me, it is so open to various interpretations.<br/><br/>Enjoy..... or perhaps you wont?."

"Jacques98","5","0","5","29 November 2008"," Not the generic, cliché film noir the negative reviews wanted, thank God.
","A lot of science fictionfilm, novel, whateverdo nothing but copy each other, then tack on some ""deep"" moral or generic social commentary. And they get critically acclaimed for it. The best example of this is Fahrenheit 451, which was simply a generic allegory about censorship with a kindergarten-level plotthat is now taught in our schools as one of the greatest novels of all time. What a joke. Blade Runner, at least in film form, is not like that whatsoever, and that was very refreshing to me. Unlike Fahrenheit 451 and the majority of other sci-fi titles, Blade Runner does not just bank on one moral issue. It doesn't create a world around a single issue (like censorship or the value of life or any other cliché issues sci-fi always repeats), it creates a world with ISSUES. This is why it's such superior as allegorical sci-fi and as film noir.<br/><br/>With this world that is so different from any created before it, Ridley Scott's directing really sets the stage. Though I'm not sure Blade Runner can even be mentioned in the same breath as Alien, it's obvious that the two were directed by the same man. Simply put: Ridley Scott pays attention to details that we as an audience will likely only notice subconsciously.<br/><br/>The majority of the negative reviews criticize the slow pace, but the slow pace is what makes Blade Runner what it is. It builds the atmosphere, and if you were to take out even a single scene, the overall movie would lack something. Atmosphere is something modern viewers don't understand. There is a major difference between an action movie filling space with twenty minutes of the main charter staring at a wall and another action filling the same amount of time with slow-paced, atmosphere-building scenes. The former is pointless; the latter is intentional and purposeful. For example, look at The Dark Knight. The pacing is no faster than Blade Runner. In fact, the entire first hour and a half was dedicated to nothing but conveying the one-dimensional plot that we all fully understood since we saw the first trailer. Blade Runner, on the other hand, uses just as much time to immerse the viewer in the unconventional city atmosphere. Scott understands when and how to use music and color. He understands when to give a slow pan of the city and when to blast through the city with action. I find it almost hypocritical than people rave for movies like The Dark Knight and Casino Royale then trash Blade Runner for its pacingnone of them get to the action any faster, and that's fact. If you want a fast pace, go watch Saw. If you want atmosphere, watch Blade Runner. I love both styles, and both styles have their place in cinema.<br/><br/>The casting is also flawless. Some people have trashed Harrison Ford's performance, but, really, I don't see what he did so wrong. He plays the same character he does in every movie he plays in: a brute, somewhat childish, selfish man. He plays the character traits just as well as he did in Star Wars and Indiana Jones. The other actors all fulfilled their purposes, and I didn't find their performances terrible or great.<br/><br/>Though the directing is godly, I don't judge a movie solely based on movie making quality, unlike some mindless people. The story is pretty generic, with some original facets for its time. The somewhat dull plot is the only reason I didn't give this movie a perfect score. A plot twist would really have improved the standard, somewhat predictable formula. <br/><br/>With that said, Blade Runner is far from generic sci-fi, as my opening paragraph stated. It's more intelligent than that, but it doesn't get so lost in a social commentary it loses entertainment value. The last twenty minutes reveal the true adrenaline of the story, after the movie-long build up. It's how Scott directs. It's his staple. And it works. And it's entertaining. If you don't enjoy it, then don't watch it. It's taste, not lack of quality or originality or pointless scenes. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a must-view for any sci-fi fan. Anyone who is looking for something to at least fill the nostalgia of Alien, watch Blade Runner. It's not perfect, and the shallow plot is a bit disappointing, but it's still awesome in it's own way, and is far above its imitators.<br/><br/>5/10"

","Someone once commented that most great books are either seminal or unique. The same applies to movies. 2001 is an example of a seminal movie; it gave a new start to the genre and spawned many good films that built both on its concepts and its effects techniques.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is unique. No-one has made a movie quite like it before or since. Although it has deep roots in film noir and early SF - as far back as ""Metropolis"" - and other movies such as the ""Nineteen Eighty-four"" of that year have used somewhat similar gritty near-future worlds, none have the breadth of vision and incredible, mesmerizing atmosphere of this movie.<br/><br/>I gave this film a '9' a couple of years ago, having recently read the Philip K. Dick book on which it is based; I felt at the time it departed too far from the book, and ""docked"" it one point in consequence. Watching the Final Cut with a longer perspective, I believe it deserves to be judged only as itself, a movie, and as such it gets one of my few 10's.<br/><br/>If that weren't enough, the remastering of the already brilliant sound track into Dolby 5.1 in the Final Cut would take it over the top; if I could give it an extra half-point for that alone, it would get a 10.5. Even with my bottom-of-the-line home theater equipment, at one point an air-car audibly travelled, I swear, 30 feet through the back wall of my apartment. This is almost the only movie I can think of that I listen to the complete soundtrack music - 2 CDs - for the sheer pleasure of the music and sound-scape.<br/><br/>The ambiguities and different versions and the extreme views expressed in the forums indicate clearly how deeply this movie affects people -- pro or sometimes con. It is not a movie that anyone can be indifferent to, unless perhaps they are totally uninterested in the genre. I see more in it every time I watch it."
"berryj6","10","0","1","14 September 2008"," Intruigingly detailed, tense, a great landmark in sci-fi thriller history
","THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE FINAL CUT (ON BLU-RAY ALSO) It has taken Ridley Scott 25 years of re-edits to deliver his perfect vision of the original 1980's cult phenomenon, but under the pressure of beating a world-wide marvel, delivering a better cinematic experience is a overwhelming task. The ultimate question is whether Ridley Scott's perfect vision is any good. I can emphatically say it has earned itself a place on the podium of the most extraordinary films ever.<br/><br/>Set in a dystopian and perpetually raining Los Angeles during 2019, the story begins when five replicants escape onto the streets. Replicants are terrifying androids that are visually identical and superior to humans in every way. However, they do have a life span of four years and possess no memory, features which distinguish them from the genuine article. We then discover the lonely main protagonist of the story named Deckard, played convincingly by Harrison Ford, whose job is to eliminate these replicants.<br/><br/>From here a dense noir thriller quickly evolves, fizzling from one visually stunning element to another. However, the best ingredient of this science fiction film is its wariness of not being too tedious by stuffing itself with sci-fi gibberish. Instead, it concentrates on absorbing themes, such as the question of identity or the value of being human. In spite of this, the thing that truly makes it a cult classic is the characters and environment, which are richly detailed and compelling.<br/><br/>To everyone reading this, I leave you with one of the films marvellous quotations; 'I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.'"

The four year lifespan is winding down for our visiting renegade androids. They have only scant hours in their brief lives remaining to them. Why then is it an obsession with the paranoid authorities that these ""elderly replicants"" be located and retired post haste?<br/><br/>2. In the alternate ending Deckard and Rachel drive off into an idyllic paradise that is apparently just outside Los Angeles. Here I question what prevents the residents of contaminated, polluted L.A. from hopping on their bicycles or into their ancient Chrysler Imperials, etc., abandoning their hellish city and following Deckard and Rachel's tracks to the mountain paradise of Big Bear, or whatever destination it may be, that our hero and his replicant heroine flee?<br/><br/>Are these just goofs or have I missed something here? After all I've only seen the film 5-6 times."

","Blade Runner is one of the really great movies of the past century. It has for good reasons remained one of the most cited examples for critics. <br/><br/>Most of all, Blade Runner is the visually most captivating Sci-Fi movie of all times. Its' dark, haunting vision of an apocalyptic post industrial world can even today easily compete with special effect loaded CGI movies. The rich, sinister pictures wrapped in lurid neon light create an atmosphere which pulls you deeper and deeper into the melancholic, monstrous world of Blade Runner. The music, the pictures and the deeply symbolic story create an unmatched, intense atmosphere, that has inspired countless other movies and generations of directors.<br/><br/>The rich story touches not only some of the deepest of human emotions, fears and hopes alike, but raises plenty of philosophical questions concerning the strive for an identity and moral integrity - and the sense in any life that is delivered to death. <br/><br/>Roy Batty's quest for survival throws his counterpart, Rick Deckard back to a haunting uncertainty in every single of the concepts of his life: He has to face the insane amorality of his life in an amoral world, has to question the fundamentals of his identity as a human being and finally faces the tragedy of death by gaining a deep insight into Roy Betty's world just at the moment of its' demise. In the last moments of his existence, Roy takes a deep look at his shining but all to brief lifetime and finally comes to see: ""All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in the rain."" The way how Deckard lives through this fundamental, existentialistic crisis could easily be compared to Beckett's ""Godot"" or Camus' ""Sisyphus"". And just like these characters, the story refuses to give an answer or non-ambiguous solution. It leaves you with questions to think about for a lifetime.<br/><br/>A haunting and dark, but highly rewarding journey into a fictional world, with all too real references, that is not easily swallowed or digested. But if you should try to do so, you will be working on tightening the fundamentals of your life - or just enjoy a unique trip through the corners of your mind. <br/><br/>Bon voyage!"

"tomimt","10","0","1","13 April 2008"," A visual masterpiece
","I was rather young when I saw ""Blade Runner"" for the first time, no more than 10 or so, I think. It was among the first serious science fiction films I saw and it has stayed with me ever since, for I, for the lack of a better word, love it with its flaws. As if I'd give a totally unbiased review of the film, I wouldn't give it a full ten, as I've done now.<br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" tells a tale of a man named Deckard (Harrison Ford), a detective of a Blade Runner Unit, which sole purpose is to retire replicants, human like androids, which may acquire emotions during their four year operation time, which in turn may get them to cause mayhem around them. That is the same reason replicants are outlawed in Eareth, but some of them may try to come here. That's where the BR unit comes in. So four of them are out there, trying get to their maker, Tyrell (Joe Turkel). And here's the cue for Deckard, in pursuit of those four, before they manage to do any bigger damage.<br/><br/>The first thing that jumps out is, that despite being over 20 years old, Blade Runner still has stunning visual effects, that show no sign of aging. We see views of Los Angeles, with sky scraping towers of concrete and steel, pushing out gas explosions. The humongous splendor and size of Tyrell corp, which we then can compare against crowded streets, lit with endless rows of neon signs. The city is as important character than anyone else in the movie. Upon that visual splendor is the soundtrack done by Vangelis. A soundtrack, that set the mood perfectly, along with the sound effects.<br/><br/>But even the greatest effects are nothing without a good cast, and that is something Blade Runner has. Rutger Hauer does a great job as Roy, the leader of the renegade replicants. He' accompanied by Daryl Hannah (Pris), Brion James (Leon) and Joanna Cassidy (Zhora). Out of the replicants Zhora is left for least of the attention. On the opposing side there's Gaff (Edward James Olmos), an eccentric detective and perhaps one of the most memorable characters in the story, thanks to Olmos's dedication to the job, and Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh), an old fashioned chief of the BR unit. And finally there's Rachel (Sean Young), Tyrells secretary, who doesn't fully know herself.<br/><br/>There are plot holes and such it BR, I don't deny that, but as I've said, I love the film with its flaws. The acting, atmosphere and directing is so strong, that I just don't mind those flaws at all, when I'm sucked into this philosophical tale of questions about humanity and what it is like to be a human.<br/><br/>I've said a lot, but really I have't said nothing important. I leave it for you to decide do you like it and which out of the 5 official versions you like the prefer, if you prefer any."

","First of all, i wanna say that i adore that film. why? cause it's the most clever and senseless film at the same time.. if you look it as an ordinary film it's bullshit, You will feel disappointed with the first viewing, but if you observe all signs & dialogs, then u ll realize that there is also much more depth. I believe wholeheartedly that It's just the most extraordinary and influential film i've ever seen. the most strange thing about this film is that it doesn't really state who's good and who's bad.<br/><br/>The film is directed in 1982 by my favourite director Ridley Scott & it's about future life. it's not innovative, but it's just shocking. The action takes place in LA , in November( my sweet month=/ ) and the main point is humanity VS non-humanity. it's about poor replicants<br/><br/>The replicants are artificial humans, indistinguishable from the real thing in every way but two: they have no memories, and they have lifespans of only four years. at the beginning i thought that they had no sense too, but i was absolutely wrong.. they have sense, therefore they have wishes, and only wish they have is right to live more than their limited life gives them chance.<br/><br/>Deckard is the main character. he is a retired Blade Runner, but then he's forced back from retirement and it's his job to terminate them.<br/><br/>I like Sean Young too much, she plays Rachel, Tyrell's assistant. As Tyrell says ""Rachael is an experiment. Nothing more"". She is ""New addition"" with faked memories, that are not her own, but she believes she is human, before she discovers what she really is. She has high intellect , I do LoVE her quote: <br/><br/>>>>>>>>I'm not in the business. I am the business<<<<<<<<<br/><br/>Blade Runner is not a popular film indeed. the person who recommended me to see it was my old friend:), a long-time fan of the movie Blade Runner and now we still have discussions about this film, because the questions are never ending. that's why I adore that film.<br/><br/>In my opinion the main task of this film is to think and realize what is real life. Definitely, the movie leaves us asking those most difficult & philosophical questions, ""what is reality"", ""what is my aim"", ""What does it mean to be human"" and ""Who am I"".<br/><br/>and the last words are cool indeed: - Its too bad she won't live. But then again who does? - the words which makes a person think about just LIFE!!!<br/><br/>you know after watching the movie over 4 r 5 times. i realized that Deckard is a human !!!!!!!!! & if u agreed my summary( HUMANITY VS NON0HUMANITY) u'll have to agree with my statement.. as simple as that. another reason why i strongly believe that he is a human is MEMORY..As Rachael is an experiment, Deckard, and possibly other blade runners as well, cannot be biorobotic being with false memories. Deckard cannot be a veteran blade runner, if he is a replicant and also cant believe it! he couldn't have procedual memory cause even Rachel( new edition and experiment wit memory as Tyrell says) doesn't have it. I'm studying phsicology so i see difference between declarative and procedural memory.. Rachel had only declarative memory(because it was impossible to put in her mind procedural memory without any past life and any experience) but Deckard had both.. why?? cause he's a HUMAN!!! <br/><br/>To sum up my wiew Rick is 3D person and others(no matter repl or human) are 2d<br/><br/>Finally, i wanna say it is up to the viewer to decide whether Deckard is a biorobotic being or an human... <br/><br/>thank u 4 attention.<br/><br/>MAGDA STRONFELL"

","Harrison Ford stars as a replicant bounty hunter who the powers that be hire to terminate four replicants who have come to find their creator, along the way Ford discovers his purpose in life as well as some secrets and indeed his ideals start to blur. Blade Runner does have excellent production values, it does have a complex story and it does have a complicated way it deals with its plot threads. (Sometimes too much so) But what I really appreciated mainly about this movie was the hero's conflict with his mission. It's the type of character that is overlooked as one of the many inspirations from this film. Sure the film's pretty sets and tale of robots have inspired many low grade science fiction movies but without the conflicted hero the movie would have no purpose and no real anchor to drive home the film's message. Indeed the hero essayed by Harrison Ford is why I give this 4 stars, his burned out hero sharply contrasts the lights and atmosphere of the film. Without the hero's dim perception of his home this film would be just a work in special effects. That this contrast is made, as well as the hero's indifference to the life he lives compared to the replicants he hunts is what makes the movie the classic it is. So while others will find the sets amazing, the special effects breath-taking, I really found it to be the main character to what made this movie the classic it is. Also like the best science fiction, it's vague, dense and invites you to make your own interpretations as to what happened.<br/><br/>* * * * out of 4-(Excellent, Must See)"

","Blade Runner. I remember the first time I watched it, with one of the best friends I had during my high-school years. I remember getting quite a crush on Sean Young's character, Rachel, and respecting Rutger Hauer for playing quite a dynamic, moving, and thought-provoking nemesis to Harrison Ford's burned-out anti-hero. Of course, the version I saw first was the original 1982 release, complete with Harrison Ford voice-overs and happy ending, and it satisfied me. There was about as much resolution to the whole story as we were going to get, and that was that. Some people prefer the Director's Cut, but I find the added scenes are just disjointed, and don't really convince me that Deckard is a Replicant. I'll scour eBay for the original version, on DVD if it can be had.<br/><br/>I could go on about every scene and all of the rich cinematography, the lush backgrounds and the gorgeous, perfectly-fitted soundtrack by Vangelis. But it's bad press to say less than those who have come before you, and I'm not going to go that route. Instead I'll just say that this is simply one of the best, most haunting, most memorable, and most human movies I've ever seen."

","Blade Runner is quite simply the best Sci-Fi film ever and surely one of the best films of the 20th Century.<br/><br/>From the opening dark and ominous long shot over the pyramids of LA supported by a brilliantly moody and atmospheric Vangelis soundtrack, through Roy's stunningly over the top, wonderfully scripted death speech to the final mystery or mysteries (like who is or is not a replicant) it remains a nigh on perfect piece of work. It certainly ranks with Ridley Scott's other seminal early masterpiece, Alien, in fact Blade Runner does have the edge insofar as style, script, art direction and just general artistic merit. I honestly think Scott's Sci-Fi movies are unbeatable.<br/><br/>This is ambitious, serious, well crafted, brave and intelligent film. There's no other film like this.

I'll not list all the tweaks  lists of them are easy to come by  but I'll happily confirm the general opinion that the tweaks are seamless, as they should be.

","Blade Runner is one of the oldest movies that study the relationship between men and computer. A lot of film inspired blade runner like matrix ,terminator. Artificial intelligence was investigated detail in the film with Harrison ford dilemma about killing relicannts. Spoiler*Although Harrison Ford is supposed to kill these machines; he is influenced by their will to survive with the questions about what could be the emotions of artificial intelligence. Replicates-machines-seems to be evil in the beginning of the movie but as the movie continues we understand that they kill for not to be killed.* This will to survive is the most human-like instinct that we witness. As a result, we can say that the AI is and its emotions are very close to human beings and their emotions and feelings.spoiler* We can understand this also from the saving of Harrison Ford at the end of the movie by a machine although it does not gain anything from Harrison's survival.* However, this contrary to the basic structure of the movie and it can be considered as an effort to finish the movie with a happy ending, this carries the message of the humanization of the machines.<br/><br/>The second edition of the film has some extra parts that enlighten us who is the last replicant and i thought he was Harrison ford."

","I have to agree with the great Roger Ebert; this film is visually stunning. It's a pleasure to look at the amount of art and detail that went into this film, but the inner story, the real heart and substance of this work of art, is a little thin.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I like the film. I really do. I think it's one of the finer pieces of cinema, but, I don't hold it in as high a reverence as I used to ages ago as young impressionable sci-fi fan. Ridley Scott came out of the school of shooting commercials, and applies his style to a cross-genre of science fiction and film noir. We have a film that wants to be intriguing: One that wants to show us the struggle between man and his creations. But it's just not as powerful as it could have potentially been.<br/><br/>I happen to be a big Ridley Scott fan. I think his films are exceptional. ""Blade Runner"" is no exception, but this film needs more umph to make it a real memorable picture in the vein of ""The Maltese Falcon"". What makes classic film noire memorable isn't the gun play or other violence, nor some of the incredible black and white photography and shadow play created by John Huston, but the characters and their dynamic.<br/><br/>We actually have a bit of that in ""Blade Runner"" (in fact the whole film revolves around this), yet it's never fully realized. Instead what we have is a visually attractive picture telling what amounts to little more than a ""monster movie"". The monsters can talk and act like humans, but they're monsters all the same. In this sense there's little between this and Scott's other previous effort; ""Alien"".<br/><br/>If you'r a die-hard sci-fi fan who loves this movie, and you've gotten this far in my comment, then you're probably shaking your head. It's okay. I understand. I was enthralled wit the visuals when I was younger (and am still impressed with them), but you have to understand what this film tells us about ourselves to really come to a clear minded conclusion about the quality of the story.<br/><br/>Like I said, it's a very good looking film. Yet even here some of the art direction, particularly for the technology, is a bit over stated. Note Deckard's voice manipulation of a device that scans and manipulates a photo, or the controls and general human interface for the flying cars. Even so, those are things are needed to get the ""futuristic"" feel of the film across to the audience.<br/><br/>It's a fine film, quite good in many areas, but not exceptional in all departments. Still, I like the film, and think it a piece of noteworthy sci-fi."
"im_veritas_photo","10","0","1","13 November 2007"," Sci Fi + Film Noir = Stunning, Yet Believable, Vision of the Future
","There are so many reviews of ""Blade Runner,"" most of them, mainly, positive. It forms, I think, a significant milepost in film history.<br/><br/>I just got the ""Director's Cut"" DVD... which is, they say, much better than the original ""commercial"" release of the film. I know I saw that release, but cannot remember it after seeing the DVD.<br/><br/>I would really love to sit next to Sir Ridley Scott for one good evening meal. I'd ask him just how much ""Film Noir"" movies really influenced his ""Blade Runner,"" if he studied and viewed them extensively beforehand, if they had any significant influence... Or if, somehow, his own vision just happened to coincide with that dark genre. In any case, I think it is Scott's dark vision in ""Blade Runner"" that makes it truly great.<br/><br/>There are all sorts of arguments for/against the human (and replicant) characterizations in ""Blade Runner,"" but playing them out in that apocalyptic view of 21st-century Los Angeles somewhat reduces their importance as rating factors. For example, Harrison Ford's lead character is quite understated, compared to any other role he's played, as far as I am aware. And I love his, and other, characters for that very reason.<br/><br/>Yet there is more-than-ample plot to interest thoughtful audiences. This is _so_ refreshing compared to the usual Hollywood pandering to idiotic 12-year-old brains. For example, try a super-intelligent android who, knowing he must die soon, finally comes to understand, better than anyone else in the film, that killing in revenge just makes no sense at all. Think about it.<br/><br/>Great film. I could count some factors as negative, but that dark vision just rules supreme. 10-out-of-10."

","First I have to say the version I've seen is ""Blade Runner: The Final Cut"", and I'm eager to see the other versions of this film. I can't think of a better way to start a movie than it's done here. While the credits are shown ominous music resounds and then you see the first images of ""Blade Runner"": A sight of Los Angeles in the year 2019 that looks like something as close as it gets to hell. Furthermore this foreboding gets confirmed, this film shows a bleak place, where all humans live like robots and no joy seems to have space. Many films have a dark vision of the future for their topic, but on the visual side I think I've seen nothing better than this. It is a film made for the big screen. But also the story of the replicants is great because it's filled with so much subtle sadness. Do we have the right to create robots that are able to feel? There is more than a bit scepticism about progress in ""Blade Runner""."
"trenthouseforlife","10","0","1","24 May 2007"," Thank you, Philip K Dick!
","I think I first saw this film on television when I was about 12 or 13 years old. The VERY NEXT DAY I bought it on VHS tape and watched it over and over and over again for about 3 days...why? It's a great interpretation of a sci-fi novel, an interpretation which (I believe) Philip K Dick himself approved of, shortly before he sadly died. At least, he did say that the environments (as realised by Sid Mead) were ""exactly as how I'd imagined it!"" High praise indeed. Thanks to Moebius and Heavy Metal also.<br/><br/>Personally, I saw Blade Runner before I read the novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" I love them both, they both have a very strong atmospheric feel, which I think may have been why Dick was so impressed with the visualisations in the movie. Ridley Scott has created some VERY strong images in his directing career, Alien being another good example, but this movie has had such a strong effect upon so many other movies that it does warrant a special mention.<br/><br/>It can be reduced in description to being an updated Film Noir, but that does not do it justice. A lot of Dick's themes of dehumanisation, alienation, globalisation and the struggle of individuals to exist in a increasingly inhuman world have endured and still echo in films to this day. In fact, Dick's writing (although partly inspired by his prodigious drug intake) was very humane and concerned for humanity. This theme is realised by the main protagonists and antagonists throughout the movie, resulting in a fascinating climax and, in the director's cut at least, a powerful and beautifully ambiguous ending.<br/><br/>Well, it's just great. Some people pan it for being a triumph of style over content. To me, that's a bit like accusing Churchill of being 'a touch bombastic' or Hendrix of being too fond of 'freeform playing'. You have to admire the film for what it is, a pioneering and strong vision with some brilliant moments that rival anything that world cinema has shown us. Hollywood may never make another film as special as this, and even if it was by an accident or happy coincidence of Director, Producer, Casting, Script and Design, who cares? It's magic! If I ever meet Ridley Scott I'm going to say one thing to him; ""You've done a man's job, Sir!"""

","Considered by many to be the greatest sci-fi movie of all time, the truths it teaches about our own kind are just as convincing today as they were 40 years ago. In the next 1000 years, only half the time since Jesus, humans are most certainly going to stop dying from natural causes, humans are going to hit the limit of Earth's resources and expand to other planets, and humans are going to achieve robots almost indistinguishable from themselves.<br/><br/>Sci-fi movies are more fascinating for their vision of the future world that surrounds the plot than the plot itself. Bladerunner is no different. If the future world vision falls over, the movie falls over regardless of the plot.<br/><br/>Philip K. Dick nailed one possible outcome of our inevitable future 40 years ago, and Bladerunner succeeded in bringing that truly unique vision into a convincing visual format, even by today's special effects standards.<br/><br/>In the movie, humans run out of space, build ever taller buildings, run out of natural resources, and leave Earth. What remains after humans leave is an enormous amount of affordable housing, days blocked out by eternal clouds of pollution, and nights of eternal rain as the pollution cools and condenses.<br/><br/>Then of course, is the usual plot about androids turned bad and the crazy cop waging a one man war against them.<br/><br/>For the most part, the depiction of the future world is more convincing than any modern computer animation. Closeups of cars lifting off aren't as convincing. Wide shots of the cities and cars floating in the distance are perfect.<br/><br/>The blind ornateness and overwhelming magnitude of the future buildings, the result of having an unlimited supply of free android labor, is truly unique in sci-fi depictions. The dots of super bright light in the distance growing into floating cars bring a Spielberg feeling to this story.<br/><br/>If you're into unique visions of future worlds, this movie is for you.

","It's still amazing how little some people understand of a film and what kind of comments result from such misunderstanding.<br/><br/>To be honest: I love Blade Runner, so my comment won't be ""objective"" - if something like that exists... But in previous comments the idea of the film was completely misunderstood. Thats why this film is seen as a film, where graphical/stylistic effects seem to count more then the plot. This is definitely wrong! 1. The uprising of the replicants: It was not an revolt of the 4 nexus6 replicants, now illegally on earth. The uprising took part in earlier years, when replicants were allowed on earth. This lead a general prohibition of replicants on earth. The only place they are allowed are the off world colonies - where they are kept as ""working slaves"".(There is an incoherency in the film/book, because there is at least one (or two -see below) replicant on earth: Rachael. But that might be a licence for the corporation, that is designing them. Whatever - thats not clear in the film) 2. All 4 replicants seek longer life. Their lifespan has been limited to 4 years (security reasons are one argument; another is their intellectual superiority - incoherency number two) 3. The storyline is not (as usually supposed...) Blade Runner against Replicants, due to a)Rachael. She and Deckard fall in love. Deckard (Blade Runner) himself seems to be a replicant. This is shown in comments of his police superior, which is telling him: ""To bad she won't live. But then again, who does?"" The second hint Deckard gets is a paper-work, left by the same person. That paper work is mirroring a unicorn, an animal that Deckard constantly dreams of. Due to their programming, replicants have a manufactured memory. Do his ""collegue"" is telling him, what he had to tell Rachel during their second meeting.<br/><br/>So, lets get this short: The film is working on at least two very philosophical topics. What are the boundaries of ""humanity"". Is life, that is artificially designed, less valuable than ""100% organic"" life. In the realization of this topic their are plenty of allusions to points like ""fatherhood"", the status of God, etc.. Cognitive solipsism and the boundaries of our own perception. Like Rachael, Deckard is (in the end) not sure about his ""personality"". While he is in the first place referring to Rachael as a ""machine"", he first looses this idea of his and at the end is completely unsure about his own status. To what extend is it possible, that his memories are just artificially created/designed? Is his personality just a fiction, etc..<br/><br/>Another topic are the citations or the ""hypertextuality"" of the film. There are bunches of biblical allusions (mostly apocryphic, from the exodus and some from the genesis - mostly transformed, o give them a different meaning) and bunches of romantic references (Blake's ""America. A Prophecy for instance). If they are twisted or in versed, they anyhow refer to the books, and kind of actualize their content. So a quite intelligent interpretation of the film would only be possible, if these citations would be considered. They have to be taken serious, or the interpretation of the film will be the usual: ""Quite good, but has a focus on the stylish effects and its plot does not go too deep"".<br/><br/>Sorry, but films (and their interpretation) depend on the mind, that is willing to reflect on them.<br/><br/>I would love to argue much longer and more persistent on these points but my lack of English sets quite a limitation and the more I write, the more mistakes you will find. So I'l will end with the next full stop."

","It's a very good, and very well made sci-fi classic.<br/><br/>It has it's own style and feel to it, and unlike most sci-fi films it doesn't stretch the boundaries of human knowledge and lend siege to a bunch of aliens or space fights or whatever. It lays down themes that although seem a million light years away, are in fact maybe closer to our time than we first thought.<br/><br/>It's a story of the blade runner, played by Harrison Ford hunting down 4 humanoid rebels trying to find their creator, with a bit of killing along the way.<br/><br/>With a riveting story, depth to characters and amazing memorable acting from Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Joe Turkel and most of all the superb Rutger Hauer.<br/><br/>I think it is only suffice to say that this film is a marvel of it's genre and with criticism and technicalities aside I think you cannot argue that this film is great in all proportions."

","It's true that this movie was not critically acclaimed by the Hollywood press, but I'll be the first to say that this is not your typical Hollywood movie (no matter which cut you watch). However, this movie was celebrated by the foreign presses as well as the off beat movie critics. The reason why these sources praise this movie are not for the obvious mainstream storytelling devices that it doesn't use, but for the subtle grace and style of narrative that it employs through out.<br/><br/>First off, the action in this movie, which for a science fiction piece is bordering on non-existent, is so layered with style that we tend to forget that what we are watching would be, if filmed in a typical mainstream way, not only thrilling but also jilting to the conscience because of its violent nature. However, because such style and finesse is implemented in the filming it is almost missed. This happens due two reasons. One, the entire film is extremely darkly lit, but the action scenes (except for the final scene) are all well lit which separates them from the rest of the narrative to the degree that they become isolated in our viewing experience so much so that they are subverted to the backs of our minds, to be nearly forgotten. Two, when the first action scene occurs with Deckard in the mix, it is played out in a slow motion sequence with eerily peaceful slow- jazz horns playing, so that the violence almost becomes a thing of beauty to be savored like a work of art that captures your soul.<br/><br/>The lighting (or lack there of) and the music play significant roles in all the remaining remaining action sequences. In fact, they build in a reverse crescendo which effectively highlights by way of isolation the movie's crescendo, and thus bringing film to a thrilling conclusion of both aesthetics and action.<br/><br/>Definitely what I would call a neo-noir-thriller classic!"

","I saw Blade Runner in the theater when it was first released in 1982. When we left the movie, my wife and I were equally stunned: What had we just seen? We couldn't believe it; we were moved beyond all reckoning and it haunted us for days. We went back in a few weeks to see it again and saw things we missed, and understood more.<br/><br/>When Blade Runner was released on tape, we bought it, and watched it again and again. When The Director's Cut came out, we went to see that, and subsequently bought the tape, then the DVD.<br/><br/>To this day I pull it out every few months to watch it again. No movie has moved me as much as this one. No movie or book has made me question the meaning of our existence as deeply and profoundly as Blade Runner.<br/><br/>While the entire movie, each superbly crafted part of it, has touched me deeply, I have to say that the last segment when Rutger Hauer (Roy Baty) and Harrison Ford (Rick Deckard) are together is the part that has stuck with me the most and influenced me most profoundly.<br/><br/>Blade Runner packs a lot of information, emotion, philosophy and morality into a relatively short span with little explanation, rationalization or 'comfort bytes' to make it more palatable. It's kinda like reading a 20 page version of ""War and Peace"" or something. It's a lot to swallow.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is a phenomenon: It's entertainment, but it's not. It is science fiction as it is meant to be: a look into the souls of ourselves reflected through the mirror of our imagination of what we are to be.<br/><br/>Special accolades to Phillip K. Dick for the original vision, to Ridley Scott for directing the story with such skill that it could convey the message on screen, to Vangelis for matching the soundtrack with the visual mood, and to Rutger Hauer for an acting performance which grips me to this day."

This movie cries out for an audio remastering to at least 5.1 discreet. I can't vouch for the supposed transfer improvement since I already on the previous director's cut and don't need another one. If this is released in HD (whatever the format) without the addition of an audio remix it would be a travesty. And if anyone involved with the movie ever reads this stuff (doubtful)... When the audio does get remix please no hack jobs. Upgrading to 5.1 is great only if the time is taken and the money spent to do it right.

There is a feeling of decay of the Earth and the people who qualify leave the planet to ""begin again"" on an off-world colony. Cloning is common and Harrison (Dekker) must hunt down a group of renegade replicants (genetically engineered humans) before they can meet their creator. There is good action and an excellent plot.

"Undertones27","5","0","5","19 August 2006"," Fairness guaranteed
","I want this review to be as fair as possible, citing the philosophical and ethical questions this movie raises while also noting its blatant shortcomings. First i am appalled by the reviews i read saying that this movie looked visually stunning even in today's CGI era. To all those that believe this to be true i beg you to go to your doctor and get your cataracts examined as i am fearful to drive the same roads as you. Every scene involving a visual effect was so clearly fake that it is hard to give this world of the ""future"" much credibility as a real living and breathing entity. This highlights one of the first major mistakes Scott made in directing this movie. It is impossible to have a movie that is timeless when it is so clearly a casualty of the post Kubrick sci fi era of the early 80's. Why is it that the future world so resembles the 80's with its harsh lighting, big hair, punk rocker leather, and neon signs? Wouldn't the people of the future learn from the appalling aesthetic mistakes of the long forgotten 80's? Apparently not. Although it's clear Ridley Scott wanted to make the world dystopian and harsh it is so forced and so touched by 80's influences that it loses traction in the modern era. The good scenes, the ones that highlight the timeless nature of this film, are those that are inside and devoid of special effects. These scenes call a striking resemblance to the re noir movies of old with the long shadows that are cast and the gritty appeal they lend to the lonesome detective Harrison Ford portrays. So enough with the setting and abysmal effects and on to the story. Now overall the questions raised by this movie are not in the least original (read Frankenstein by Mary Shelly) nor mind blowing but they are none the less important. I praise any director who creates a movie in search of a higher meaning, a more important purpose than sheer entertainment, but i cannot laud a film that is completely devoid of believable action or a large enough explanation of its narrative. Many positive reviewers cite the film's ambiguity as its strength but i find this most foolish as the best of movies are able to spur debate while not being lost in their own vagueness. We know very little about Harrison Ford's character and the endless debates that follow around him are not in my opinion an extension of Scott's brilliance but rather a display of his contempt for his simple minded audience. The actors, with exception of Ford, are seemingly confused and out of place and so serious and so apathetic that it is impossible to care about them just as the world they live in cares little for their existence. They are all also so clearly displaced from the 1980's into 2017 culture which, as noted earlier, obviously has gained little in the way of advances. The Chemistry between Ford and his ""replicant"" lover is so inexistent that it makes me question whether or not this was Scott's intention. Perhaps it is just another buried metaphor about the nature of love in a sociopathic future, who knows. I believe that Scott's examination of what it is to be human and to what extent our apathy for human emotions exist, is poignant and very worthy of the praise he has received from many reviewers, however, the futuristic median by which he expresses it folds under the pressure of its own outdated style. It is disheartening to so a movie that has such good intentions be muddled by its sci fi median. Something that is so often the case with 80's era sci fi filmaking. Only movies such as the original Star Wars or Star Trek series have been able to so far stand the test of time without scrutiny, despite lacking the deep philosophical questions raised by a movie such as Blade Runner. As such i'm left deeply conflicted by this movie. I am assured that this movie will not stand as a timeless classic as the next generation of movie goers will find it slow and worthlessly outdated. And yet i hope more movies such as this will be made, ones that examine human complexities and bring them to light but i pray such films are able to do such without relying on technical visual style. Sci Fi is an almost impossible median by which such movies can be made since it seems technology moves so exponentially that things are outdated the second they come into existence. This is the, above all, major problem i have with Scott's movie. Any person under the age of 30 will find it laughably unbelievable and will therefore be less impressed by its message. The movies that are greatest transcend such scrutiny because they let their IDEAS exist at the forefront, not technology. As such i believe that if i were older, or seeing Blade Runner when it was initially released i would be much more impressed with it. But given that i cannot cling to nostalgia to alter my views of an obviously flawed movie i am left with a muddled, over the top, 80's style sci fi film, that has the greatest of messages wrapped in the most absurd of packaging. If you are under 30, no matter how mature or intellectual you are, i'd steer completely clear of this movie, it will bore you and make you apathetic to its complexities."

","In this cult favorite, a detective tracks down dangerous replicants in a dark, seedy Los Angelos of the future. Scott creates a memorably bleak atmosphere, but the plot is not compelling enough to draw in the viewer. The camera spends too much time slowly panning over the futuristic sets. Ford does OK as the raider of the lost replicants but the characters are thinly drawn and too far removed from reality to be interesting. Hauer is intense as usual as the lead replicant and Cassidy shows her stuff as a butt-kicking replicant. The climactic battle between Ford and Hauer is disappointing, marked by scenes repulsive violence."

"nycritic","10","0","1","9 June 2006"," Taking a Cue from Fritz Lang
","Even when the date that the story takes place in is only 14 years in the future and automatically cancels much of the technology and events shown in Ridley Scotts sci-fi noir film BLADE RUNNER, it's still a stunning movie that has more than enough elements to make it compulsively watchable. The story of one Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter out to eliminate a handful of renegade replicants (i. e. androids), and how he fell in love with one of them, was adapted from Philip K. Dick's short story ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" and is extremely claustrophobic. One would never know that this was Los Angeles; the sun never shines, colors are muted, and there is an element of sick-green corruption all around. Stylistically it moves at a steady pace, never pausing for cute moments. Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Brion James, Sean Young, and Joanna Cassidy are quite impressive in their renditions of the replicants -- particularly Hauer and Hannah who have some truly memorable sequences of extremely disquieting violence, violence that is a reaction to their one dream, which is to live. One poignant sequence involves Harrison Ford explaining to Sean Young that her memories were implanted to her and thus, are not real. I thought that was the cruelest part of the movie, because it was like telling your own creation that he or she did not have a ""life"" until you gave it to them, and somehow that carries an undertone of inhumanity about it. There has been the speculation, by the way, that Ford's character could also be a replicant, but somehow that doesn't seem to be the case in the movie: he's just a cop with a mission to complete. That he decides to spare Rachael's ""life"" shows a human aspect about him -- that he wasn't all orders, even when the romance in itself is perfunctory to say the least. A sad, but beautiful nightmare of a film, it works whether you see it with Ford's voice-over or not."

"benoit-3","10","0","1","29 May 2006"," Best film about slavery and the nature of mortality... ever!
","These were also the themes of Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"", which is not a good film because of the casual way it exploits history to make its point. Whereas ""Gladiator"" is a film full of grand-standing and hollow gestures that disrespect the past, ""Blade Runner"" is a film that imagines, with great respect, a future that could be and uses it to stage a valid morality play about the nature of humanity, slavery and mortality. One could say that Ridley Scott is more respectful of the future that he is of the past. I only know the film from the director's cut and I find it a perfect film...<br/><br/>Here are a few things I like about this film that have rarely been duplicated in another sci-fi film and were never again put together with the same care:<br/><br/>* believable dialogue that is spare and to the point and gives away just enough information to keep things on the ""noir"" side and for the viewer to imagine the rest - dialogue that becomes poetry by Lautréamont in the mouth of Rutger Hauer; <br/><br/>* a plausible and evocative atmosphere composed of set design, lighting, photography and special effects that really gel together, combining attention to detail with sweep and scope; <br/><br/>* acting, casting and faces that help the telling of the story (Hauer is the definitive hero of the 21st millennium, a Christ figure and a much better and more complex man than anybody else in the film); <br/><br/>* music (by Vangelis) that provides both space-age lounge music, psychological density and the kind of eeriness that was formerly Nino Rota's unassailed trademark.<br/><br/>It is an action movie that opens a whole new can of philosophical worms towards the end when the humanity of the enslaved replicant is demonstrated and the hero's motives and his own humanity are questioned. The whole film is so noble that it could be about the start of a new breed of Christians revolting against the industrial-military complex and a world government gone berserk for profit.<br/><br/>It remains one of the only worthy commercial films of the 80's to come out of the USA.<br/><br/>A WORD ON THE DVD: The Director's Cut DVD has no extras and the print, while very watchable, suffers from horizontal shakiness that causes a real strain on the bitrate and indicates that it could stand a good restoration.

The movie is much more than great futuristic sets and special effects. It's a great story about the stupidity of mankind. Unlike a typical, adventure/action/science fiction movie, the line between hero and villain is crossed by both sides. Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer and Sean Young turned in great performances. It's a movie that leaves you thinking about many social issues, past and present. Harrison Ford is a ""Blade Runner"". A ""Blade Runner"" as the opening text which scrolls across your screen explains, is a specific type of law enforcement officer who is tasked with hunting down rogue androids.

The portrayal of the future looks great: dark, ominous skies and technological advancements combining to form a bleak and desolate world. What lets the film down, however, is the acting of Harrison Ford. He just doesn't seem to have put the effort in. His lines are delivered with all the panache and elan of a stroke victim. I have never seen a lead so lazy in his acting. The general pacing of the film is also a tad too slow, at times we have to suffer Ford's interminable monologues with nothing of substance happening for minutes. The film rallies towards the end and has a few brilliant closing scenes, not least Rutger Hauer's impressive turn as the chief replicant, going mad and then coming to terms with his own mortality. Hauer is the star of the film in fact. Overall then, this is a good film, but not a great one. The story promises so much, but somehow it just doesn't deliver quite how I'd like it to. 6/10."

Internal in that Harrison Ford, the best of the best in replicant executioners still struggles with that fact that he kills. It doesn't matter that what he kills isn't really human, he still feels his own humanity as he does the awful deed of ending a replicant's life.<br/><br/>It's revealed to us early on who these replicants are but amazingly we don't find out their reason for escaping their assigned occupations. In a very crafty fashion their mission reveals itself in the people they are looking for. More life, the wish of everyone, is their only true goal.<br/><br/>Outside of the movies plot, there are two things that stand out with Bladerunner. The first is that this movie's atmosphere as put forth by special effects and set designs stand up with the best out there today. They blend together in such as way as to elicit that eery aura we all feel sans The Day the Earth Stood Still.<br/><br/>But the one thing that stands out and has always stood out is the absolute perfection of Sean Young in make-up. To this day I've never seen a more beautifully scuptured face with absolute perfection in her coloring and features. She's made up in such a way that she literally pounces out of the screen. She has never received the credit she deserved for this film and it's a shame because no character in any science fiction movie has put forth a more perfect performance than her.<br/><br/>Rutger Hauer of course provides us with a performance that was worthy of a best supporting actor Oscar and had this come out today he would have gotten it.<br/><br/>Daryl Hannah, perhaps the weakest link in the cast still puts forth an acceptable performance as one of the replicants.

","Bladerunner is my favorite movie for the past 17 years. I saw it when I was 13 and was mesmerized by the story and haunting music. I still get chills watching it. It tackles the deep, dark content of androids and their place on earth. The score by Vangelis is amazing(an excellent modern composer/musician. The futuristic setting is believable and dark. Harrison Ford and Sean Young have great chemistry and their similar quiet personalities play off each other well in the movie. The supporting cast has many famous faces of today such as Edward James Olmos and others. The supporting characters make this future world come alive. I've seen the director's cut. Just skip it. If you can't see the theatrical version, then wait. I hear it may be re-released next year: 2007. It is adapted from a novel 'Do androids dream of electric sheep,' a Phillip K. Dick novel.

Despite its dated hi-technology, the film takes us into a grubby world where sophisticated electronics has done little to improve the underlying shortcomings of the human beings who live there.<br/><br/>In fact, the more their technology develops, the more difficult it becomes to work out quite who or what is 'mechanical' and who is genuinely human.<br/><br/>Some people, however, have the knack of finding out. Not the least of these is our hero Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford). When the machines go haywire and begin to start thinking for themselves, Deckard is tasked to seek them out and destroy them. Not a task that need raise any moral qualms in a civilised society  it's just like switching off the dish-washer.<br/><br/>That's until we get to meet some of these sophisticated machines.

It makes me sad that the directors cut was not the original release, if it was then I'm sure it would have gotten more respect. Warner Bros. made Ridley Scott include Harrison Ford's voice over for the final release, because they said it was'nt explained well enough without it. Harrison also did a crappy job on the voice over in hopes that they wouldn't put it in, too bad it was. Some people say that the original is better because without the voice over the movie isn't explained well enough, I think thats dumb. The Directer's cut is the true vision of Ridley Scott, and it should be treasured among all the other great films."

"fatleprechan","9","0","1","21 June 2005"," Film Noir for the 21st Century. Blade Runner has style and substance.
","Adopted from the novel by Phillip K. Dick. Blade Runner is a blend of 1940s private detective yarns and futuristic society landscapes. Beautifully shot on stunning stylized sets by director Ridley Scott, fresh off another totally original success with his earlier film, 'Alien' Scott manages to create a future as unpredictable as the actual passing of time. Bizarre neo- Victorian dance fashions. Chinese vendors and gigantic hologram advertisements, hovering cars locked on an invisible monorail, that even now twenty three years later still manage not to resemble an 82 Pinto. The main sci-fi story centers around Deckard ( Harrison Ford ) Who is a 'Blade Runner' That is a cop who specializes in one field. His area of expertise is locating and destroying 'replicants'. Android slaves with a built in four year life span, which is apparently a couple of years too long for their uptight creators when they jump an off world shuttle and slaughter the entire crew in the process. They then return to earth in an effort to blend into normal society. Where it's Deckard's job to hunt them down. Fans looking for a reprisal of Ford's Han Solo roll will not find it here. Deckard is somewhat more downtrodden than the upbeat Captain of the 'Millinaum Falcon' From the outset, Deckard seems burned out, and has to be blackmailed into doing the job. He is much more stern and serious for this sci-fi fantasy. Unlike 'Star Wars' there is nothing for children in this movie. This is a dark tale, conveyed by director Scott's stark use of pale color and shadow. Ford's quiet understatement and pauses when delivering his lines really sets the bleak tone well and he's always giving the audience the impression that Deckard isn't the bad ass he once was. It's a fine performance by Ford, but Rutger Hauer as the Nexus six android Roy Batty steals the show. As he and his gang of fugitives try to figure out how to reverse the four year life span while staying one step ahead of Deckard, Hauer as Batty makes you afraid for the people they are interrogating. In the end even Deckard seems terrified of the violent and murdering Batty. Hauer's oratory summery during one of the final scenes is moving and memorable. Also look for E. Emmet Walsh in another strong supporting role as Deckard's overbearing and wisecracking boss. All in all, there isn't too much bad you can say about 'Blade Runner.' If I had one knock, it would be that I didn't feel the date was pushed far enough into the future. Even when the film came out in 1982 it seemed that technology wouldn't have the chance to catch up to the premise. I think Dick and company would have been better served had they tried for the latter part of the 21st century rather than the first part. But this is one small bolt loose in an otherwise tight machine. Blade Runner is a fantastic marvel. 9 out of a possible 10 T.H."

I must stay objective and observe my emotions, re-actions, and perceptions in order to get clarity on what is being brought out in the film.<br/><br/>The challenge for the main character (Rick Deckard/Harrison Ford) is to find meaning in a world that has gone mad. He has tried to retire from this world and shut himself away. But life is not finished with him yet. His challenge is brought to him by a beautiful woman (Rachel/Sean Young) who is a replicant, or what we might call today a human clone.<br/><br/>The scene that sets up his challenge is when Rachel comes to visit Deckard. He drops the key to his apartment; she picks it up and says, ""Let me help."" Totally oblivious to what is really happening, he replies, ""What do I need help for?"" He soon finds out. For as he is hunting down his prey, he himself becomes the hunted and must fight for his life. He is hunted by the ultimate replicant (Roy Batty/Rutger Hauer) who has just discovered his own death is imminent. He decides that if his life is to have meaning, it will serve a purpose to teach Deckard a lesson in what it means to be alive. This becomes one of the most intense battle scenes ever recorded on film.<br/><br/>Roy is not only closing in on Deckard to kill him, he is giving him verbal clues that wax poetic. He taunts him by asking him; ""Aren't YOU the GOOD man?"" Then when he has him cornered he challenges him by saying; ""Unless you are alive, you can't play. And if you don't play"" At that point, Deckard pounds him twice on the head with a lead pipe. Roy replies; ""That's the spirit!"" Then, when he has him cornered one last time, Roy tells Deckard; ""Quite an experience to live in fear isn't it. That's what it is to be a SLAVE."" The final scene is set up when Deckard thinks he is finished with this challenge. Another cop refers to Rachel and says to him; ""Too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?"""

","When I first saw this in it's initial theatrical release, I was too young to appreciate it. This is one of the few films that has gotten better through the years. It was way ahead of it's time and groundbreaking in starting the Sci-Fi Noir genre.<br/><br/>I strongly prefer the ""director's cut"" version because it does not condescend to the viewer, and lets the viewer interpret the film for their selves. For instance, in the original version the narration speculates that Roy saved Deckard's life because he valued life so much. My interpretation is that Roy just did not want to die alone. The symbolism of the dove flying away when Roy dies is truly beautiful.<br/><br/>The cinematography and music is just as important as the story in this film. Without this film, there would have never been ""Total Recall,"" ""Dark City,"" or ""The Matrix.""

","It is popular opinion that the movie Blade Runner was altogether better than the novel on which it was based, Philip K. Dick's 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep'. Quite frankly, having read the book before seeing the movie, it seemed quite disappointing to me, when compared with the original. The importance of more interesting, philosophical subjects of the novel was cut down meaningfully; namely, the philosophical consequences of the idea of a humanoid robot that would be superior to man himself in any way. J.R Isidore (transformed into the very minor character of J.F Sebastian), Buster Friendly, Rick's wife and her eery mood-dialer, and most of all the electric sheep, the most wonderful symbolism in the novel. These were all removed. The idea of the artificial animals was only hinted, as was the unsolved question of whether Deckard himself is a replicant or not.<br/><br/>But IN SPITE OF ALL THAT -- when considered individually by its own right, as it should be (it's no accident that the film and the novel have different names!) Blade Runner is still one of the masterpieces of sci-fi cinema. Harrison Ford - though he plays the exact same character he always does - fits right in. Ridley Scott's directing is superb. His biggest stroke of genius is in his relating to a theme that was very subtle and weak in the novel - the film noir atmosphere. Scott did an incredible job creating a futuristic classic film noir, right down to the electronic-film noir musical score.<br/><br/>As an action and an atmosphere movie, Blade Runner is one of the best sci-fi films ever made. Highly recommended for all fans of the genre. Reading the novel is completely unnecessary to appreciate the film."

The protagonist consumed by his past, the femme fatale, the urban nightmarish city etc. All elements of the noir archetype.<br/><br/>b. On a second level this is an expressionist film that presents a dystopian vision of the urban metropolis and dehumanized society, but also unfolds the plot in elegant theatric images.<br/><br/>c. On a third level this is a philosophical essay on man, god and life. Much credit for this must go to Philip K.Dick, whose novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" this is an adaptation of, but also to Hampton Fancher and David Peoples that wrote the script, as well as the cinematography of Jordan Cronenwet.<br/><br/>Still, it is Ridley Scott's masterly direction that glues the whole film together, which is a bit of surprising when considering some of the drivel he's produced over the years (""GI Jane"", ""Gladiator"" etc)."

This film is from the bygone age of film making where a plot line was actually essential, and movies didn't sell based on how much money was put into the special effects. That said it also looks like somebody put a lot of effort into the special effects in this film. It is clear to me that Ridley Scott put a lot of time and effort into this movie.

","Every movie has a Text, a Context, and a Subtext. Blade Runner excels in all.<br/><br/>The easy one: the Text. Inspired by a novel of the most humanist of SF author, Philip K. Dick, the story deals with androids banned from Earth, which are tracked by humans . The fantastic idea is that the audience is caught in a constant paradox: you wait the androids to appear like robots. Error, they show the most humanity and it is the humans who act like robots(indeed, a true respect to the core of Dick's Philosophy). <br/><br/>The context: Another asset of this movie is the overloading of the senses: majestuous sets, props, wardrobe, cinematography, editing. The director takes the time in every shoot to show how humans have evolved. It is a big change from nowadays movies where in 10 seconds, you see 10 cuts. All this care for the materiality of this fiction world made Dick very enthusiast, even though he didn't see the picture.<br/><br/>The subtext: It's the message of the director, or sometimes, what the audience has understood. I always feel deeply moved by this movie, but i can't never explain why. I suppose it acts on a non-literate level. In some way, i'm sure it addresses the collective unconscious that every body share.<br/><br/>Nearly 25 years after its release, it is still a date in cinema history. It teaches a lesson to today movies, which, even with the help of digital effects, haven't still produce another milestone (my regard for the prequel Star Wars Movies).

Let's be honest here, split it into it's integral parts and you have the potential for a big-fat-turkey.

"CharlieMauk","9","0","1","9 April 2005"," Blade Runner Theatrical Release vs Blade Runner Director's Cut
","This masterful film is, of course, a morality play: Does a human have all the innate rights of a human whether (it) is born or genetically engineered? The film does not answer this directly, but it urges the viewer to draw his/her own conclusions of right and wrong. Blade Runner is almost a perfect film: perfect casting, terrific score by Vangelis, beautiful,futuristic sets that do not appear contrived, incredible cinematography, convincing acting. However, there is one thing that bothers me about the ""Director's Cut"" in any film. How can the director release the film for the general public, let it float around as a created entity for a few years, and then change it? A film, like a book, is a unique creation. The plot, the fate of the characters, the elements of the film, are unique to that film, so once the film is released, ""the die is cast"", so to speak. In my mind, something doesn't ""ring true"" about changing a film that has been in circulation for a period of time. It seems profane, somehow, to re-release it in a changed form once the viewing public has accepted it for what it is. How many books have you read where the author comes back a few years later and changes the elements of the book? If personally feel that once a film is released, that's it. The film is what it is and should not be changed. I have looked for the original version of Blade Runner, with Dekker's narration, which is smug, blunt, sarcastic, sometimes funny: it fleshes out his character. The original version more clearly illustrates exactly what kind of guy Dekker is, partly due to his narration. Unfortunately, the original version of the film is no longer available. It's obvious that the ""Director's Cut"" is a ploy to re-market the film. However, don't misunderstand me. Blade Runner is a brilliant film, the definitive science fiction film, and both versions are excellent. I just feel the original narrated version is the best one, the ORIGINAL one."

","For a time, I thought that The Director's cut was the best. The original theatrical version with the narration by Harrison Ford, who plays Decker, sounded a bit like Ford was unhappy and bored. Plus, the ""happy ending"" didn't wash at all with me. And I let the original review stand.<br/><br/>Until I recently saw The Final Cut. This was just so incredibly beautiful! I've watched it again and again over the past few weeks.<br/><br/>It is 2019 Los Angeles, which resembles a mix of Asian culture and Detroit factories. A group of replicants, led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), are on Earth. Since they are illegal on Earth, they are tracked down by Decker (Ford), a ""blade runner,"" whose job is to ""retire"" (Clean way of saying execute)replicants. Replicants are sort of hard to detect because they look and act human. But they have one flaw: they only last a few years. Batty wants more time and seeks out his creator, Tyrell, to demand more time. Meanwhile, Decker is intrigued by Rachel (Sean Young, looking very beautiful), who is one of Tyrell's creations and has no conception of being a replicant.<br/><br/>The final cut fixed a few errors in the original version, and added bonus footage, giving the film an even more impressive look.<br/><br/>Finally the intriguing question that the film raises: is Decker himself a replicant? The dream sequence and the gift that Gaff (Edward James Olmos)leaves at the end of the film would suggest that this is a possibility (My personal feeling is that he is), but then, this would lead to even more questions, wouldn't it? It's a visually stunning film (You sort of get caught up in the scenery)and the music by Vangelis is even more stunning. It's amazing how the Final Cut looks with the latest technological breakthroughs. It's worth the look."

","From the moment that I saw this film in '82 until today, it's remained among my favorites. For the life of me, however, I cannot understand why the director eliminated the narration from this film.<br/><br/>Many of you may not know this, but there once was a movie genre called FILM NOIRE. These movies usually involved a really good, loner type detective, like ""Sam Spade"" or the like. He would walk you though the film using narration that highlighted what he was thinking while you watched him perform his investigative duties with a featureless ""poker face"" to fool the bad guys.<br/><br/>Periodically, and most often impersonated, the detective would ""step out"" of a scene he was in and talk to the audience instead of narrating over the action. Perhaps you've seen old Bogart films where he'd stand under a light pole in the rain and recite a monologue to the audience about how he felt the case was going or to highlight another character's actions, behaviors or personalities according to him. THAT is E X A C T L Y what Blade Runner was meant to depict in a futuristic setting. It worked WELL, and it is sorely missed from the director's cut.<br/><br/>Honestly, and many will agree, unless you've seen the original cut of this film, you lose a LOT of information that helps you understand the story to the fullest. If I'm ""whining"" or ""don't understand the 'new school' "" and you DISAGREE blindly, then don't you EVER use the CAST/CREW COMMENTARY feature on you DVDs again. YeahI THOUGHT so!!! So-perhaps those with the ""power"" can do what many of us are asking: Give us our movie backthe way it was MEANT to be seenthe way WE remember it."

","This movie totally blew my mind when I first watched it. It is totally unlike most sci-fi movies. It shows a future world that is dirty, ugly, and not as great as most movies show it. Ridley Scott's direction and keen eye for detail helped this movie. Harrison For d is excellent, but it's Rutger Hauer that steals the show as the maniacal leader of the escaped replicants. He portrays Roy Batty with such creepiness, it's a total mystery to me why he was not nominated for the role. Sean Young, Daryl Hannah, Edward James Olmos, M. Emmet Walsh, William Sanderson, Brion James, and Joe Turkel also shine in their roles. Great cinematography and a haunting score help make this movie be great. The best line comes from Hauer's character in his last appearance after fighting Harrison Ford, when he says, ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die"""

","Blade Runner has been accepted by most as a Sci-Fi classic. However, what many people do not realize is that this film was the inspiration for many other films, including the Mamoro Oshii (I know the first name is incorrect)classic, Ghost in the Shell. Any GITS fan can see the parallels between the ""I wanna be human"" Roy Batty and the ""Acknowledge my existence or kill me"" Puppet Master. It is also possible to tie Deckard to the infamous Batou (the quiet men of action who like big guns and inhuman women). Rachael, on the other hand, bares little resemblance to the heroine of GITS, Major Mototko Kusanagi. Perhaps the most striking likeness between the two is the detail in the futuristic setting. If anyone has seen GITS 2: Innocence, it is easy to see how Sebastian's hotel/home resembles the lair of Kim, the techno wizard. Even the creepy doll-like creations are apparent in both scenes. Perhap's Oshii and GITS manga creator (his name somehow escapes me)sat down one day in 1982, saw this film, and said to each other...""Hey we could do this, in Japan... with a strong female protagonist... and espionage... and more annoying tanks (see GITS: Stand Alone Complex)""."

Scott re-cut, reedited, and otherwise restored the film to his original vision, which was compromised by excessive studio interference 10 years before.<br/><br/>Scott did away with star Harrison Ford's horrendous voice-over narration, replaced a number of shots to make up for the gaps that were the result of the narration's removal, and deletes the so-called ""happy"" ending. In doing so, Scott restored his original vision and the film was released in 1992, 10 years after a disastrous reception from audiences and critics.<br/><br/>In 1982, ""Blade Runner"" was released between ""Alien"" in 1979 and ""Legend"" in 1985, and Scott was on a wild streak and it seemed that only he could stop himself, since he was bringing the audience one visually dazzling and intricate masterpiece after the other.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, ""Blade Runner"" is still one of the only sci-fi films released in the last 25 years to really have a serious impact on audiences; Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report,"" which is ironically another acclaimed adaptation of a work by Philip K. Dick, was another example.<br/><br/>""Blade Runner,"" adapted from Dick's acclaimed novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" is set in the 21st century, and Rick Deckard (Ford), is a ""blade runner,"" special police detectives who have the authority to kill ""replicants"" (human-like androids) on the spot. Replicants have been outlawed on Earth, so they're confined to a space colony on a nearby planet, where they are forced into slave labor, and they only have four-year lifespans - so they value life more dearly than any human ever could.<br/><br/>A group of renegade replicants (Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy, Brion James) hijack a space vessel and come to Earth to search for their maker, Tyrell (Joe Turkel). And so Deckard is forced to lead a private investigation to track down and eliminate the four androids before anyone figures out they're on Earth.<br/><br/>This is Ridley Scott's most beautiful and philosophical film to date. He really taps into the emotions of the viewer by evoking such feelings using philosophical imagery and dialogue; there isn't a single wasted frame at all in this film.<br/><br/>And he also uses violence to great effect in ""Blade Runner."" Even though none of the violence is hardly of the super-graphic type, it is nonetheless effective, especially during one particularly wrenching sequence where Deckard kills one replicant as it runs away for its dear life (you'll know the scene when it happens).<br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" - 10/10"

","First, let me say, without question, I love this movie. It is my favourite scifi experience, ahead of Gattaca and K-pax, and many others which also ""moved"" me. I saw this movie on late night TV when I was an impressionable adolescent, back in the late 1980's, and so it was the original theatrical version, with the voice-overs. Over a decade later, when I saw the Director's Cut, I thought it was still a great movie, but without already knowing what Deckard had been thinking because the version I had seen before, it became a ""potentially deeper"" movie. The flipside is that the potential for deepness risked getting lost on some people without the albeit droll voice-over.<br/><br/>Such hype surrounded Scott's re-release of the Director's Cut at the time it came out that the video store I was working in at the time wouldn't even rent the copies of the original that we had, for fear of them going astray -- hell, you can't buy the original anywhere anymore, it seems. <br/><br/>I am fortunate to have my own VHS copy of the original version (no discussing how I came to possess it, considering...), but have forever wondered whether there will ever be a DVD re-release of it sometime? Even the reruns on TV now only show the Director's ""silent cut"" and I don't know why. I for one, slightly prefer the original, if for no other reason than the little speech Deckard gives as the Batty replicant passes away. Otherwise, that scene kinda feels like it is simply a lucky man sprawled on his ass, staring at a less lucky man, sitting in the rain with his eyes closed.<br/><br/>I know there are many people, not all of them avid movie fans, who like to purport the idea that the Director's Cut of just about any movie is better than the Studio Version, but I dare say the anomaly that is Blade Runner questions that. (BTW, it is also the only movie I have ever seen that I liked more than the novel -- and I am talking about actual novels here, not the movie-tie-in kind).<br/><br/>Love and rockets."

Harrison Ford is great as a modern day ""Gum Shoe"" trying to track down rebellious robots disguised as humans, but the standout performance, for my money, is Rutger Hauer's portrayal of Roy.

He was no different from humans: He had memories, feelings, doubts and fear... a great fear to death. Death would erase him, all that mattered for him in life would disappear when dying.

","Numerous books, magazines and essays have appeared on ""Blade Runner"" (1982), a flop on its initial theatrical release, and one that it's star player Harrison Ford despised making. But the film, which appears on the surface to be just a straightforward science fiction thriller about evil robots, is in fact a far deeper tale about creation and humanity.<br/><br/>In mid-21st century L.A, Deckard (Harrison Ford) makes routine cullings of rogue 'replicants', human-like robots engineered for slave purposes on Earth and off-world colonies. A small group of these robots, led by the charismatic Batty (Rutger Hauer) have infiltrated L.A. and it is up to Deckard to track them down and 'retire' them before they can do any damage...<br/><br/>That at least, is the thrust of the story, which has one or two minor problems. The set-up to the final shoot-out is clumsily handled, and the final 'happy ending' feels out-of-place with the rest of the movie. However, there are many interesting depths to this picture.<br/><br/>Batty's encounter with his doomed creator Tyrell (Joe Turkel) has a strong parallel with man destroying God in the pursuit of life. Deckard's affair with Tyrell's assistant Rachel (Sean Young), herself revealed to be a replicant, places his own humanity in an ambiguous light. Parallels are made between the replicants and their human creators in that the questions they both have are the same: who am I? where do I come from? where am I going? how long have I got?<br/><br/>The backdrop to this is laid out in fantastic production design that blends futuristic technology (and some now dated corporate logos) with old style buildings. Deckard's apartment and Tyrell's high-rise office are influenced in their own way by the designs of Egyptian pyramids. This is accentuated beautifully by Vangelis's music score, including the touching Deckard/Rachel love theme.<br/><br/>Ford is good in a role that is considerably more cowardly and stolid than some of his other action parts. Young radiates innocence and vulnerability as the gentle Rachel, and Rutger Hauer and Darryl Hannah are excellent as the two chief replicants, the former getting a memorable scene where she batters Harrison Ford with her thighs.<br/><br/>Love it or hate it, ""Blade Runner"" is a cult classic and should remain so for as long as films exist."

","I actually saw Blade Runner in the theaters in 1982 when I was just 12. I remember it distinctly because they didn't want to sell me a 12-or-under ticket because I was so tall (I started growing fast around 10 y.o.). In any case, the theater was not especially large but I remember the crowd being rather thin (though it was a matinée). <br/><br/>Beyond that, I can't say why such an impression was made on me by a movie that is way over the head of a 12 year-old. I probably merely embedded the memories to draw upon for a later time. <br/><br/>I grew to consider Blade Runner my favorite sci-fi movie. Its tone, nuances, and characterizations are subtler and more seductive to a ""thinking"" film viewer vs. the visual bludgeoning of much of modern action-/explosion-driven sci-fi popcorn movies. <br/><br/>I was so obsessed with it when I got older I actually bought a ridiculously expensive laser disc player just so I could have highest quality letter boxed version of the Director's Cut. Ah, how I wish I could recapture those absurdly-spent dollars and spend them on DVDs instead--but such is the toll of staying on the bleeding-edge of technology. <br/><br/>The pacing and action of Blade Runner will not be to everyone's liking and Harrison Ford plays Deckard pretty tight to the vest. There is none of the garrulousness of Han Solo, but, then there really shouldn't be. Deckard is a dramatically different kind of character (literally and figuratively) and Ford plays him exactly as he should. Deckard is anything but a cocky, shoot-from-the-hip cop. <br/><br/>Nearly everyone remarks on the visuals of BR, so let's get that out of the way: amazing, stunning, and remarkable. The fact that they still impress and hold up 20+ years later where our senses have become blown-out and numbed from over-exposure to CGI is all the more remarkable. It is evidence of the movie's powerful artfulness. ""The Return of the King"" is the only movie I've seen in recent memory that meshes live action and CGI in a truly believable (and astonishing) manner--though occasionally Jackson cannot bely his horror-movie director instincts. The opening scene of Los Angeles, 2021, is one of the most memorable and breathtaking in modern film. Vangelis' ethereal score seals the deal and enhances the visuals and drama perhaps better than any soundtrack ever has. I'm a huge fan of electronic music (a la the ""old school"" like Tangerine Dream, not the pure techno music of today necessarily) so perhaps I have more of a propensity for Vangelis than others.<br/><br/>If you like the pacing of typical film noir translated to sci-fi, Blade Runner is for you. Its vision of the future is bleak (aren't they all?), but that vision is stunning and powerful. If you like the lurid, music video-like editing of most modern sci-fi/action movies, then you'll probably find Blade Runner dull and anemic and will disregard its artistic achievements."

","Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece: '2001: A Space Odyssey' proved that science fiction film-making did not require ray-guns, flying saucers and alien invaders. With stunning visuals, an ethereal and haunting musical score, and minimal dialogue Kubrick explored the idea that 'we are not alone'.<br/><br/>In 1982 Ridley Scott also offered us a mature science fiction movie in the form of 'Blade Runner'. Adapted by Hampton Fancher from science fiction great Philip K. Dick's novel: 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?', 'Blade Runner' tells us a cautionary tale of what can happen if we don't keep a check on our scientific creations.<br/><br/>When genetically engineered humans (called Replicants) are outlawed on Earth, a crack squad of police detectives is created to weed out any stray Replicant visitors. This is called the Blade Runner unit.<br/><br/>Det. Rick Deckard , played with great humility by Harrison Ford, is retired from the force but is drawn back in by less than idle threats form his former boss; ""...if you're not 'cop' you're little people..."" Deckard was the best at 'retiring' Replicants and the unit needs him back. A small group of Replicants - with Rutger Hauer as their super-strong, super-genius leader Roy Battey - has hijacked an off-world shuttle and come to Earth with one goal: extend their built-in four-year life span.<br/><br/>Deckard's pursuit of the illegally landed Replicants takes place through a rainy, gloomy future Los Angeles where the Earth is being depopulated in preference the for brighter pastures of off-world colonies. The city is always wet and soggy, cut through in sharp contrast by spotlights from floating advertisements for off-world colonization. <br/><br/>The film is sombre and foreboding, with the action as exclamation points throughout, as opposed to being the main focus. Vangelis provides an exquisitely appropriate soundtrack which exactly mirrors the overall mood of the film. And the visual effects shots can still hold up to even today's high-end CGI standards. <br/><br/>Dark, moody, damp, sombre...All words that one might not equate to an excellent science fiction film, but they certainly fit here. Scott gives us a glimpse of a future that seems bleak, where Mother Earth is no longer the focus of humanity. Within this is a detective story not unlike Mickey Spilane of a by-gone era; get the bad guys while trying to hold on to the girl.<br/><br/> From the editing to the pace, from the music to the special effects, I can find nothing wrong with this film.

","Blade Runner is undeniably one of the essential building blocks of the science fiction genre. Not only does it's visual style blow one's mind and open one's imagination, it raises important questions about life through the eyes of beings that are superior to humans in almost all aspects except for life span...all with a minimal but masterful plot. Add that to the fact that this is one of the few sci-fi films that doesn't rely entirely on special effects, wars and explosions to make it's story interesting and you have a classic. And the Director's Cut just makes the original better by giving the axe to Harrison Ford's abysmally bleak voice over and removing the light-hearted ending. Basically, it makes the film is more ambiguous which makes it far more interesting in my opinion. Ridley Scott wanted it to be released in exactly this fashion, and it's easy to see why.<br/><br/>The visual and environmental similarities between BR and Scott's prior work, ""Alien"" (1979), are easy to spot right from the get go. It's fairly simple, they're both dark and use scaled Gothic models with Swiss precision, creating an entire world worthy of the dizzying imaginations of the audience. I would not be surprised at all to find out if both films had some of the same special effects people. That said, BR is a beautifully dark and futuristic world that is very convincing to the eye even though there's no CGI...which is a good thing because a lot of times models are more accurate and realistic. And believe it or not, for the most part, these effects easily hold up in today's world and look only slightly aged. And on top of it all, it has an excellent score that's a perfect fit.<br/><br/>The story and plot are very simple but hold many smaller lessons. Deckard (Ford) is sent to kill the runaway replicants, but as he progresses throughout his journey, he begins to question if what he is doing is actually the right thing. Aren't they alive and conscious too? Don't they have hopes and dreams? How different from us are they really? Simple but extremely effective. Most sci-fi's nowadays are too busy trying to cast Vin Diesel or buy the best CGI effects without really worrying about the story. It's sad, but it's all about money. It's also why we don't see films like these any more....money is more important than making a quality film, but you don't need me to tell you that. What it all boils down to is a minimal story that works wonders for the movie and the audience's imaginations.<br/><br/>Superb acting from all involved, masterful direction, incredible cinematography, world-creating special effects, and a great story make this one for the ages.

How does Roy Batty now Deckards name?.....When you realize that which Deckard realizes (he is a replicant made to kill replicants) you now can appreciate this movie on many levels. Certain lines like ""youve done a mans job"" take on whole new meanings. Each time I see this movie I see something completely different everytime.<br/><br/>Without writing an essay I will only say that the themes are not limited to animals, colors and chess. For example the chess game that Tyrell plays with Sabastian is based off of a Game known as the immortal which is also a symbol of the pursuit of Roy Batty losing everything to win the game. I could go on but I wont. If you hate this movie it is either because you have not seen it for what it is or because you don't enjoy a movie with a lot of substance. <br/><br/>This movie is number one on my list."

Number one; if there are any kids out there who have not yet met a film noir, this is great to start. it has the atmosphere it has the character and it catches it like a match to gas. the plot is; three (or four) robots trying to make it to a pyramaid were there god is while a bounty hunter wants to kill them. the second reason to see it is for this plot that ultimately goes into the look for meaning, the robots are faced with a golden calf and are  supposed to fill out there four year life span with meaningless activities but on the verge of death one of the humanoids finds meaning... At the same time this bounty hunter falls in love with one of the robots, it sounds cliched but she is something more than the one sheet hollywood heroine she raises the second theme of the movie what is real? not like the fake Matrix ""i like to explain everything in english third person' but this is a beatiful woman finding she is not real... the plot amazes the sets and the ending, when you see this film you'll either howl with amazement of the adventures taken place to sit in one place as though six knives have been thrown at your head and you will be thinking ""that...was art"""
"grendelkhan","Null","0","1","6 May 2004"," Future Noir
","The title of Paul Sammon's excellent book about the making of Blade Runner, Future Noir, sums up the film best.  In style, it bears a strong resemblance to the great works of film noir; but, with a new technological twist to it. We have your hard boiled private eye/cop sent to solve a case, characters who aren't what they seem, moral dilemmas, corruption, passionate but dangerous affairs, dark atmosphere, decay, depravity, and paranoia.  In short, all the ingredients of Chandler, Cain, and Thompson.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott, by this point, had made a name as a visual stylist.  His films were amazing to look at, even if they weren't exactly showcases for great acting.  What kept them from becoming total visual exercises was the casting of fine actors.  Here again, he assembled a fine cast, but the visual elements dominate the film.  The actors do their best with the difficult, often confusing material; but, ultimately, they are merely another component of a cinematic painting.  It's not surprising, given that Scott had been a graphic artist.<br/><br/>The design of the film owes some debt to films such as Metropolis and Just Imagine, the architectural drawings of Hugh Ferris, the city scenes of Tokyo, the work of Moebius, and the art of Edward Hopper and the futurist designers and graphic artists.  Conceptual artist Syd Mead provided blueprints that Scott and company built upon and added layer after layer. DVD technology allows you to linger on each detail, taking in all those elements you couldn't see in the theater, but helped to complete the picture.  Every piece of paper, every photo, sign, and magazine cover was created to add depth and character to this world.  In fact, the city is the strongest character of the film.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the number of replicants, whether Deckard is a replicant (is Holden also a replicant?), the nature of humanity, the role of animals, and many other themes and questions relating to the film.  The beauty of the film to its fans (and major criticism from its detractors) is that so much is left open to interpretation.  It's a film you can watch again and again and discover new ideas, or look at them from a new angle. When I first saw the film, the idea that Deckard was a replicant never entered my mind.  After reading Sammon's book, I watched the film again, both the original theatrical release and the ""director's cut"" and noticed the subtle hints for the first time.  The glowing light in the eyes never appeared deliberate before; I just assumed it was a reflection of the lights.  After reading the book, I noticed that it only occurs in certain situations.<br/><br/>The performances vary in quality.  Even the so-so actors have their interesting moments; but some are stronger than others.  The cold, dismal atmosphere of this film doesn't lend itself to a variety of emotions, so the performances tend to come off as limited.  The replicants are more alive than the humans, possibly due to their short lifespan.  They seem compelled to get as much living in as possible.  As such, the replicant actors are more interesting, if not more skilled than the humans.  Rutger Hauer is all over the place:  he is menacing, laughable, haunted, distraught, psychotic, reflective, and destructive.  Darryl Hannah, Brion James, and Joanna Cassady provide less rounded performances; but they are effective, in a quirky manner.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford brings a Chandleresque weariness to Deckard, a man who hates his life but is trapped by it.  The more he is in contact with the replicants, the more his humanity comes out.  It is not his best performance, but it exceeds more recent work.<br/><br/>Sean Young is a bit of a dilemma, she looks good, but she doesn't bring much to her role; but that is the nature of the character.  So, is the flaw her acting, the direction, or the script?  On one level, it is perfect for an artificial character whose life is an empty shell.  On the other hand, it is frustrating as she never seems to rise to the moment.<br/><br/>The Vangellis music is another source of polarization.  I personally love a lot of synthesizer driven music of this era, while many have nothing but derision for it.  To me, the synthesizer gives a voice to technology and helps animate it.  Given that the city and technology of this world acts as another character, the music acts as that character's dialogue.  I wouldn't want this type of music in a period piece or a comedy, but it works within the framework of this film.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is a film that either challenges you or turns you away. It stirs the imagination with its detail, and its omission of detail.  You are often left to fill in missing elements.  On some levels, this can be frustrating and probably the source of much derision for the film.   On the other hand, it can be extremely stimulating to the mind and take you places that you never dreamed.  It is not a prefect film, but it is an important one, from a design sense and a thematic one."

","I always think that movies are a form of story telling.  I am one of those people who believe that movies do not need great story line to be great. They just need to be made great!!!  Blade runner is one the finest example of this.  I'm not saying that story line in Blade Runner is bad, it's far from it.  But I'm trying to stress that there are so many things you can enjoy in a movie, other than the plot i.e. the visuals, sound, acting, dialog and so on.  And great movies should excel in all these aspects.<br/><br/>From the very first scene the director, Ridley Scott, sets the mood with stunning visuals and sound.  Immediately you are immersed in a dark, bleak, yet hypnotically beautiful world of the future.  We are taken through the the story, which deals with some deep issues (which I won't go into for the benefit of those who hasn't seen this movie), in a dreamy and balletic manner.  The pace is spot on and the emphasis in the movie enables you to grasp these issues while you're watching, and in the climatic finish the director leaves you with an afterthought that is both sweet and bitter.<br/><br/>
Blade Runner truly is movie making at its very best.  It does everything right; it's visually stunning, even now after 20yrs ; acting is brilliant, especially Rutger Hauer; and it also has one of the best movie sound tracks. Dialogs between the character is sparse but it is the case of 'less is more'.<br/><br/>Finally there is an issue of which version is better? The Original or the Directors Cut.  Well I like them both and I consider them to be two quite different movies.  In the directors cut the removal of the voice over and added scenes make it much heavier.  But its the case of what do you prefer? Delightful afternoon tea to enlighten yourself or a late night heavy liqueur to drown your sorrows.  Either way it's a must see movie."

"andynortonuk","10","0","1","20 March 2004"," Dark and thought provoking, with a puzzling ending (contains spoilers)
","I absolutely loved this film for several reasons. First of all, the complex narrative, that develops throughout the film through different perspectives of different characters, which includes several replicants and the blade runner, wonderfully portrayed by Harrison Ford, himself. This, in my opinion, achieves a multi-layered and never biased account of what is going throughout this film as the blade runner attempts to track down these replicants. Secondly, whenever a specific sequence is made, such as Deckard's chase for the club performer or that replicant destroying its father, it is wonderfully structured as a sequence by establishing a master shot for that particular sequence by cutting in and out of the action to its master shot. Examples of this fine method of film-making is encountered with the owl being a sort of master shot when that replicant is destroying its ""father"", and the blade runner on that train and the dancer on those stairs on that chase sequence. Thirdly, one of things that are not completely conventional of a sci-fi film is that it ends in an unusual, where Rick Deckard and Rachael are going down the elevator together. This brings out one question that has not really been answered throughout this film. Was Rachael a replicant? And if the answer was no, how come she somewhat failed that test, where they answer questions to a replicant suspect? But I am glad that this film ended this way, maybe because Ridley Scott, the director behind this cinematic masterpiece, wanted to leave that question unanswered and leave that to the audience imaginations making this film somewhat thought- provoking for the audience to conclude to their assumptions. But I will not as I might not be watching or analysing the film this way to answer this question, but, at the moment, I guess she is not. But, then again, if I ever watch this sci-fi treat again, I may come to a different conclusion. Another thing that made me marvel this film was that ending sequence, where that replicant is hunting down Deckard in J.F. Sebastian's house. That whole pin in the replicant's hand really brought a disturbing exhibition of how the replicants cannot feel death, while this one wanted the ability to die. Then Deckard gets chased out of the house and on top of the roof of that building. He tries to jump over to other sides but instead is now grasping onto that girder. That low-angle shot, where Deckard is holding onto that girder over of busy city life of this futuristic cityscape, looks well composed and a very memorable shot from that whole film. This indeed does sums up the blade runner's struggle to hunt down replicants perfectly. Overall, this is a dark and thought provoking science fiction masterpiece, with a puzzling ending that should baffles audiences for generations of science fiction film fans to come."

","""Blade Runner"", based on Philip k.Dick's novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" is not only a sci-fi movie. Ridley Scott, its director, has achieved to bring together the settings, the characters and the screenplay to create a thrilling and interesting world, in one of his greatest works.<br/><br/>In 2019, life on Earth has become a claustrophobic and nightmarish experience, and hi-tech has been developed in dirty and congested streets. The action is set in Los Angeles and Harrison Ford plays the ""Blade Runner"" detective Deckard, an android hunter, who after his retirement is assigned to hunt down a group of androids, also known as replicants. This group, who have just rebelled against humans, arrive in Los Angeles from outer space with the purpose of finding out the reason why they all must die as well as to look for Tyrell, the owner of their manufacturer.<br/><br/>In contrast with loads of futuristic films that are produced with a strong artificial flavour, the characters are completely believable and the dialogue is witty and natural. Furthermore, an important aspect to mention, which is one of the most striking qualities of the films, is the soundtrack. Scott has certainly scored his audience with the collaboration of Vangelis, the talented electronic music composer. But, over and above that, what is indisputable is that the aesthetics of the film are breathtaking. It is quite likely that the audience will get the feeling of reality with the dark and unique settings.<br/><br/>However, as I see it, what puts this film in a class of its own, is its philosophical meaning. Replicants can be compared to humans, as both are looking for immortality. But, what differentiates replicants from humans is that replicants are lucky, in a certain way, to be able to demand an explanation from their creator. So, for those who not only enjoy sci-fi movies but also a good storyline, Blade Runner is not to be missed!"
"Danny_G13","10","0","1","2 January 2004"," Stunning piece of visionary sci-fi
","I'll set out first of all by stating that this is a kind of combined review of both the original Blade Runner, and the more recent Director's Cut.<br/><br/>Set in the year 2020, the world's fallen into decay in the world of Blade Runner. Perpetual acid rain, low quality of life, and a seriously bad state of environment has led to the rich classes abandoning earth and moving to the off-world colonies. On these colonies replicants are used as slaves, replicants being engineered humans made by the Tyrell Corporation. They're physically superior to normal humans, and at least equal in intelligence. Unfortunately they're volatile too, and a Nexus 6 group of replicants goes on a murderous rampage on the colonies, and come back down to earth.<br/><br/>This is where the story begins. Deckard is a former member of the Blade Runner unit, charged with hunting down and 'retiring' loose-cannon replicants. Brought back in on this case, because he's the best, he reluctantly finds himself drawn back into the world he wanted away from.<br/><br/>Atmospherically Blade Runner was amazing. Neon skies, behemoth corporate buildings, constant darkness, and other forms of haunting futurisms compliment the theme supremely and make the world totally believable.<br/><br/>The characters were excellent too - with uniformly superb performances all round from the likes of Harrison Ford, as Deckard, Sean Young as Rachel, and the unforgettable Roy Batty, played by Rutger Hauer.<br/><br/>They made this into more than a film - it was an experience - suckered into this world we felt part of too. Ridley Scott's direction was magnificent here too, making every scene buzz with activity and ensuring the plot was always moving.<br/><br/>In the original, the voice-overs were nauseating and obtrusive, but nonetheless they were informative and educational. The Director's Cut saw them removed, which enhanced the narrative but did make certain things less clear.<br/><br/>There's also the ending of the original, which was removed from the Director's Cut and meant it finished at a much more poignant and meaningful moment.<br/><br/>Truthfully you are better off seeing both movies, as you can only get the full experience that way, but just know the Director's Cut is a superior film.<br/><br/>Overall this was an amazing film which was maybe too visionary in '82 as it was a monumental flop. It's taken some time for it to be truly appreciated, and now it's up there as one of the principal sci-fi movies.<br/><br/>Outstanding."

"Sandcat2004","10","0","1","28 November 2003"," A requirement (a canonical work)
","Simply stated, this is necessary viewing for everyone.  However, I do not believe that it has universal appeal.  Just as there is a literary canon, cinema has its own canonical works.  ""Blade Runner"" should, regardless of personal opinion, be<br/><br/>included in the canon of cinematic works. It is Ridley Scott's best work (although Alien isn't far behind).  Every aspect of the film is executed beautifully: the production design outranks almost all sci-fi film; Cronenweth's cinematography has such great depth of field, utilizes light and shadows effectively, and subtly employs colors as markers; the matte painting and special effects outclass many of today's movies; and, the music is extremely appropriate.  Given that Phillip K. Dick's novella, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,"" is a poorly executed<br/><br/>piece of writing, the script is great model of a plot structure stripped of<br/><br/>superfluous dialogue and exposition.  It is truly a masterpiece.<br/><br/>There are a number of films that are regarded to be within the traditional canon of cinema.  Many of them do not appeal to everyone.  Similarly, many works of literature do not suit the general taste of the public, but that does not mean that they should not be read by everyone.  Of course, our society does not promote the importance of being well-read.  Films on the other hand are more accessible to the general public relative to time commitment, education level, and<br/><br/>applicability to social gatherings .  Just as people should expose themselves to the canonical works of literature, they should also expose themselves to the<br/><br/>canonical works of the cinema.<br/><br/>If you don't like (or don't think you like) the genre of sci-fi, you should still watch this film.  Just as the canonical works of the earlier periods of cinema(Citizen Kane, Capra films, On the Waterfront, 2001, Rebel Without a Cause, The<br/><br/>Graduate, Casablanca, Hitchcock films, etc,) are introduced to new generations, Blade Runner must be included within this framework."
"eamon-hennedy","10","0","1","28 October 2003"," An Interesting Film.
","Whether you think of it as a cult oddity or one of the best examples of the science fiction genre there is no denying that Blade Runner is an interesting experience. I happen to think the film is brilliant, a unique insight into the future and the repercussions of what happens when we has human beings meddle with technology in the future. The film is more understated than what I thought it was going to be. Starring Harrison Ford and directed by Ridley Scott I was expecting an action packed extravaganza, but instead what we get is an old fashion science fiction detective thriller, the familiar tale of the bounty hunter looking for the bad guys. Of course like all great science fiction, what is on the outside is different to what's on the inside. In reality Blade Runner is a twisted fable, a look at what it means to be a human being, and what it means to lose that humanity when technology starts to appreciate it for itself. This leads to some of the most fantastically acted scenes in a science fiction film. He may hate the film but there is no denying that this is Harrison's best performance, the Blade Runner of the title, a man who we are led to believe may have more in common with  his prey than we realize. Further adding kudos to the film is Rutger Hauer, quite possibly the finest performance in science fiction history. Whether or not his character of Roy Batty is the actual of the hero of the film is for fans to argue about (I know I have my feelings on the subject), but I dare you not to be moved by his final words as he excepts his fare after saving Dekkard.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott shows us the versatile talent that he really is with this superb film. The direction is complimented by his unique visual style. This is one of the most visually stunning films ever made. The establishing shot is the awe-inspiring of its kind, while his portrayal of a futuristic dystopia is one of the most convincing, not to mention the most frightening, ever put to film. <br/><br/>Presented in two versions, the director's cut is the better of the two, the voice over deleted thus not spoon feeding the narrative to the audience. The more ambiguous ending is better too, thus the cop out option of Rachael and Dekkard living happily ever after can be erased (it always put me in the mood for Kubrick's The Shining). Thus the ending leaves us with more questions than answers. That is unsettling, but it is apt for an unsettling film."

""Blade Runner"" scores a slot on my ""Overrated Movie List,"" a would-be sci-fi epic with a dash of shallow philosophy thrown in that fails to excite or intrigue in any way.

""Blade Runner"" contains its share of stunning visuals (which hold up surprisingly well, even today), but its characters are unappealing (or, in the case of Rutger Hauer and Daryl Hannah, given little to work with) and the plot, when stripped to its core, is rather thin.<br/><br/>5.5/10"

","I wasn't even born when ""Blade Runner"" made its theatrical debut, and for that I consider myself lucky. Had I been alive and theater-going in 1982 I might've become jaded against the film, only acknowledging the muddled 1982 release. I come from a generation whose first experience with ""Blade Runner"" came on the various home video formats, when we were blessed to behold the 1992 director's cut of the film. The director's cut was the first version I saw, hearing horror stories of the theatrical release. Having seen both now, I can fully appreciate having the directors cut as a definitive version.<br/><br/>
SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, also called Blade Runner. Blade runners are insinuated to be elite police units whose job it is to hunt down ""replicants"", humanoid androids that were built by the Tyrell Corporation to serve humans. After a replicant revolt on an off-world mining colony, replicants are considered threats to society. When they are detected they are destroyed, or as the opening crawl takes pains to emphasize, 'retired'. Deckard is assigned to hunt down 5 replicants who have just escaped from an off-world colony and come to LA. His pursuit of the androids becomes an in depth exploration of what it means to be human, and chiefly why the humans can condemn the replicants for wanting to be like them.<br/><br/>A common complaint I here from critics of ""Blade Runner"" is that it hasn't aged well. Sadly, this is a truth I have to concede. Audiences new to the feature that go into it without predetermined reverence end up laughing at the Vangelis music, dated vision of the year 2019, and sadly even Rutger Hauer's appearance in the climactic scene.<br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" is a beautiful movie, from the opening iconic image of future Los Angeles seemingly ablaze to the scenes of flying cars weaving in between monolithic skyscrapers beneath the perpetually raining sky.<br/><br/>Philosophical overtones are strong throughout every aspect of the film, right down to the art-deco/neo gothic architecture of the city: the Tyrell corporation building is a gargantuan Mayan pyramid that rises about the pollution ridden cloud that cloaks the city of Los Angeles. In fact, the only time you see any sunlight in the movie is when it shares the frame with the Tyrell building. The pyramid shape of the building, the presence in the sunlight above the clouds, and the fact that it houses a creator of life (be that artificial) all convey the presence of a god figure. Indeed Tyrell's role in the movie is that of the god figure. This is unadulterated Nietzsche: god made man, and then man killed god.<br/><br/>Differences between the original version and the director's cut are not subtle, they are glaring. The studio thought that the audience at large would need help in understanding the film, so they had Ford record an irritatingly cheesy Bogart film-noir narration. Legend has it that Ford intentionally made the narration awful in the hopes that the studio would consider it too bad to use. Also, the studio tacked on an uplifting ending in which Deckard and Rachel escape to an idyllic countryside together. One of the most interesting changes however is the ""unicorn dream"" that Scott fought to include. Its meaning is wide open to interpretation. One possibility is the connection to the title of the Philip Dick story, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" Does Deckard's dream of an imaginary creature mean that he is in turn a fictional being? The most obvious connection is to the origami unicorn left on Deckard's doorstep at the end of the film. Does Gaff know Deckard's memories just as Deckard knew Rebecca's? Or is it a coincidence?<br/><br/>Memories are precious to the replicants. Each one has his or her own set of memories programmed in to make them believe they have lived full, human lives. This fact is another of the many clues which led viewers to believe Deckard was in fact a replicant himself. More than that, though, it explains why Roy spares Deckard's life at the end of the film. The cheesy narration in the original release of the film explains it thusly:<br/><br/>
""I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same answers the rest of us want.""<br/><br/>This is all fine and dandy if you want to take away the simplistic message that the replicants had become more human than the so called ""real humans"". The real reasoning behind Roy's grace is much more selfish. Consider the brilliant monologue he gives on the rooftop:<br/><br/>""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.

"Clive-Silas","10","0","2","16 August 2003"," The last great science fiction movie, a flawed masterpiece.
","I was growing up when science fiction films started coming back in vogue, only now with budgets to match their ambition. I was 12 when Star Wars was released, 13 when Close Encounters of the Third Kind appeared. Just as I was turning to adulthood at 17, along came this completely adult science fiction movie. Sad to say, however, in the intervening two decades, not one film has managed to handle a science fiction concept in quite so intelligent a manner. Couple the deep themes of the nature of humanity and the nature of death with Ridley Scott's absolutely inimitable visual style, Rutger Hauer's powerhouse performance as Batty and Vangelis' seminal score and this movie swiftly acquires the deserved status of a classic.<br/><br/>That was the good. Now let us briefly examine the bad. The opening establishing shot of Los Angeles, 2019 is of course a classic of its kind. Subsequent lingering shots of futuristic buildings, however, tend to hold up the pace of the movie, often at crucial points of plot development. Apart from being unnecessary they are too long for their own good, frequently extended to allow the traverse of a supernumerary flying vehicle.<br/><br/>In addition these shots don't display any of the brilliantly noir claustrophobic atmosphere of the dialogue scenes, so much so that they sometimes seem to have been inserted from a completely different film.<br/><br/>The film does have its longueurs. The second act sags alarmingly while Deckard is investigating the photograph and the snake scale until finally we get some action with Zhora's retirement. Later on when he's chasing Pris, we can see that she's waiting for him in Sebastian's flat, so the lengthy shots of Deckard making his way up the Bradbury building only serve to increase impatience rather than suspense.<br/><br/>It seems churlish to criticise Harrison Ford's performance, particularly since it at times contains some of his best work - particularly the love scene with Rachael - but for the first half of the film it is very obvious that Blade Runner is the first serious film which he has to carry on his own. There is a palpable lack of consistency in his characterisation, as if Ford hasn't decided who Deckard is, yet. In reaction to things Bryant is telling him about the new ""skin jobs"", he screws up his face in an attempt at scorn which comes across as expressing the need for some kind of reaction, but not knowing what. He apologetically calls Rachael and asks her down to the bar, and suddenly turns into the worst kind of self-regarding galoot. And the Jerry Lewis impression during the interview with Zhora - it's just *wrong*.<br/><br/>One problem with Deckard's characterisation isn't Ford's fault at all. As the ""old Blade Runner"" with all the ""old magic"", it sometimes seems as if he's never met a replicant before. In all his retirements he leaves himself almost ludicrously open to attack, and escapes by sheer luck each time. It would have been better to demonstrate his prowess when retiring Zhora, Leon and Pris and show that he has met his match with Batty.<br/><br/>Regarding the famed (not to say precedential) ""Director's Cut"". I know I'm in a minority amongst Blade Runner cultists, but it seems clear that in cutting the original version of the film the way they did, the studio evidently knew what they were doing. Shots of vehicles flying around the city go on for too long; Scott's battle to retain his ""Unicorn Dreams"" sequence is legendary, but having put a portion of it in, it's clear that the unicorn's ""horn"" is artificial, and it comes too early in the film for the connection with Gaff's unicorn origami figure to be evident to anyone other than die hard fans who already know what to look for. Elimination of the voice over certainly had many proponents amongst fans of the movie, not excluding myself, and of course it did have very many bad points - ""Bryant was the kind of guy who in the old days used to call black men ni**ers"" (they cut the very worst one, I had to read it in the published script: ""I've seen 'em laugh, I've seen 'em howl. I never saw one cry.""). However, the removal of the voice over has had one rather distressing side effect - it eliminates the character of Gaff almost entirely. Without the voice over there is no indication that Gaff is after Deckard's position, and scarcely any sign that he is a Blade Runner himself until the very end of the movie. The frustrated look on Gaff's face as he observes Deckard's survival now has absolutely no context.<br/><br/>After twenty-one years I now feel freer to express a few niggles, happy in the thought that the movie is old enough and certainly classic enough to take a little criticism. It still remains one of my all-time favourite movies, and, as a science fiction fan, one of the very very few movies to treat its genre with respect and intelligence.<br/><br/>*2007 EDIT* News arrives of ""Blade Runner: The Final Cut"" along with the real story of what happened at the time of the Director's Cut. It seems that Ridley was actually too busy with _1492 (1992)_ (qv) to genuinely supervise the creation of BR:TDC - he simply told the studio to take off the happy ending and the voice over, and they seem to have taken him at his word but in addition thrown everything else in if they had a negative of it. The result was the movie which, in retrospect, it's hard to believe anybody could have believed Ridley Scott actually had anything to do with it. With the new version, they have apparently taken note of my comments above and have even undertaken some reshoots (with Ben Ford, Harrison Ford's son) to fix the second act flabbiness. I very much look forward to the real Ridley Scott vision."

The only comment I would make is that I don't go with those who want Deckard's character to be a replicant himself...I've always felt it was far more effective to show that he, the human, relearns his humanity from those he hunts.  And it fits his weakness against Roy in the final scenes."

","To describe the greatness of this movie is almost impossible.Everything about it is amazing,from set-pieces,to atmosphere,the magnificent score to effects and performances from anyone involved.Rutger Hauer has never been better (his Time-to-die speech is simply unforgettable),Harrison Ford and Sean Young are extremely enjoyable as troubled blade runner and his love interest,beautiful replicant Rachael.It is almost impossible to acknowledge the fact that this movie is 22 years old.No CGI-images of today could top effects in this movie and look as real,believable and unique.Take a look at the futuristic world of Minority Report-it doesnt even come near the one presented in Blade Runner.The movie looks as fresh,stylish and amazing today as it did in 1982. It gets you to think,sure,so does The Matrix or Solaris but it is only here that you really get emotionally involved on such a level and care about the characters and outcome of the film. I can understand how some people dislike this movie.Lets face it,it is a little slow-paced but for people with an IQ over 80 that has nothing to say.If you like your sci-fi movies loud,over-the-top and with lots of dumb explosions and action in favor of character study than watch T2 or ID4.Dont get me wrong,I love T2,but it is completely different type of sci-fi movie and it is wrong to compare all movies to the likes of T2,Matrix or Star Wars.I love and cherish this old school movie just the way it is,with perfect balance of action,drama and sci-fi.This is (along with Alien) Ridley Scotts best work and the best work done on Philip K.Dicks novel. I have a couple of books written about the movie and it is a fact that Philip K.Dick himself visited the set of Blade Runner in 1981 and was literally blown away by the looks of his futuristic world from the novel. When you menage to impress that man (anyone who knows anything about Philip K.Dick will understand me)then it should be easy with ordinary people and Ridley Scott has done just that.This movie will be cherished for generations,and it fully deserves so..."

","I have a deep respect for Ridley Scott.  Even though his more recent works haven't been up to snuff, I admire him because, unlike other noted directors like Steven Spielberg, he takes the time to provide a commentary on his DVDs.  Even for ALIEN he managed to create an interesting side-view to the action.  John Frankenheimer also tried, but since he's gone we will never hear from him again.  How sad...<br/><br/>Blade Runner is phenomenal in writing, artistry, and casting.  In truth, the movie is probably a production designer's worst nightmare.  For the record, any and all references I make to the movie are towards the infinitely superior Director's Cut.  The visuals are dark and dazzling, creating images that are nowadays the definitive look of the future.  Minority Report wishes it were this good.<br/><br/>But all flash and no show would take this movie very low.  Thankfully, Harrison Ford proves he can be emotional and not a cynical, swaggering comic book character.  It's too bad Rutger Hauer never went on to anything better, but he's too limited as an actor.  Other than hate and empathy, he never gets any emotions out.  The rest of the cast is perfect for their obscure, crazy roles.<br/><br/>The human (or non-human) factors of Blade Runner are what sets it apart from other films in the genre and raises it to the level of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Dr. Strangelove.  While I am not as familiar with noir as I'd like to admit, Blade Runner also emits its own distinctive mood that is undeniable. It's too bad that Scott has fallen into a commercial pit that he is trying to claw his way out of.<br/><br/>Overall, an amazing film that should be required viewing by all sci-fi and humanitarian fans.  The depth and breath of this ""futuristic detective flick"" ranges from an obviously classical inspiration to the modern view of mortality and machinery.  Time is well spent watching this.  5 out of 5 stars."

","This has been my all-time favorite film for 6 or 7 years now; there have been few challenges (like Tiger Wood's reign, I suppose). I am still in awe every time i sit down to watch this film (every six months or so). To me, what makes Blade Runner so effective is the way Ridley Scott juxtaposes his technological vision of the future, as seen through the architecture, flying cars, and replicants, with the vulnerable and fragile human condition of today, as seen through Deckard and J.F.Sebastian. Harrison Ford is at his best here, playing a lonely and introspective character that is a far cry from the banal roles he played in Star Wars and Air Force One (among others). The tone of the entire film is somber (it is always raining), and this is what allow us to be so thoroughly absorbed by the fascinating characters (my favorite is Tyrell) and subtle plot development. The visuals are stunning. I can't stand today's computer-generated stuff because most of it looks fake. Ok, if you look closely you can see the models here, but when sitting back and absorbing the movie as a whole one doesn't really notice. I can't imagine that this film would do well today given its deliberate pace, but i think that this is what sets it apart from from your standard explosion-laced sci-fi fare. I like the slow pace, just as i did with the original ""Alien"" film; it gives you time to absorb the characters and study the visual component. The Vangelis score is superb.

The topic of human emotion in robots has been done to death, but this movie stands alone.  Its sci-fi, but its also an action movie, a detective movie, a thriller and a convoluted love story all in one.  And its not just that Harrison Ford does an excellent job playing the role of a mercenary (he has a habit of doing that), every part in this movie is well acted and well scripted.  But the true genius in the film lies in its director.  Watch the opening scene and you'll know what I'm talking about. No frame in this movie is anything short of flawless, beautiful to look at. It's gritty, its intense, totally convincing as a future vision, and the aspects of the plot that deal with emotion in robots (or in this case human replications) are so well done that this movie was actually mentioned in a philosophy lecture I attended on the nature of the mind."

Blade Runner not only changed the way movies were made, it spawned a entire genre of literature: Cyberpunk. As an added bonus, the movie gives ample opportunity for discussion and essay...

Visually atmospheric histrionics set the bleak setting of futuristic hell in Los Angeles of the dour ""blade runner"" Deckard bounty hunting renegade replicants led by psychopathic android Roy Batty (appropriately named and Hauer's best performance of his career) out to terminate his maker. Iconoclastic blend of sci-fi and film noir with dazzling set design. Based on Philip K. Dick's cult genre novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep'. This edition dismisses the droning narration (incidentally Ford did this on purpose when the studio forced director Ridley Scott to include it for clarity in protest but ironically appropriate for his Philip Marlowesque character) and restore its original ending. Visionary film-making at its best. My favorite lines: James as Leon to Ford's Deckard in a compromising position: 'Wake up. Time to die.' And Hauer's bemused Batty to a fleeing Deckard 'Where're you going?' during the climactic climb atop The Bradbury Building, as well as his improvised ""like tears in rain"" speech which always gets me."

","In my opinion this is one of the greatest science fiction movies ever. And perhaps one of the movies to really define an era of sci-fi. Almost every ""future society"" movie after it, tried to copy some of the same environment and the same type of look and feel. None succeeded. Blade Runner is basically a story of a man in doubt, in doubt of himself and his way of life. He used to be a hit-man, a so-called Blade Runner, who hunts down stray androids called ""Replicants"" and ""retire"" them. But after meeting a replicant called Kate, which has had memories implanted, causing her to develop human-like emotions, he starts to realize that what we see as the definition of ""life"" isn't really the only correct one. He is starting to get a nagging feeling that replicants aren't just any other machine. This movie is about taking a good look at how we define humanity, and how we define ""life"" itself. Is a life less worth, because it's not human and ""only"" a machine? The movie lacks a lot of story that Philip K. Dick's book has, but i still think they've managed to keep the most important parts. The excistential question is there, just as strong as in the novel, and the less important parts of the story isn't really a great loss, movie wise. The movie is also backed by one of the best movie soundtracks of all times, courtesy of Vangelis. The music really helps transmit the feel of this darkish future society. This is the movie that really made the concept of ""cyberpunk"" into what it is today.<br/><br/>""Replicants are like any other machine, they're either a benefit or a hazard.

He's just a damp washrag on screen, as he is in most of his roles.<br/><br/>Rutger Hauer, on the other hand, never had a better role. His Roy Batty is thoughtful, playful, poetic, angry, loving, gentle, fierce, despondent, resigned, awed, and forgiving.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I love this film, for everything else in it besides Harrison Ford. Besides, Ford is SO bland he never gets in the way of my imagining what the acting would have been like if a good actor was playing Rick Deckerd."

"funkyfry","10","0","1","20 November 2002"," Classic sci-fi
","This is the movie that all the other ""sci-fi"" films of the last 20 years have been trying, unsuccessfully, to live up to.  Some of them have achieved more compelling action, some spiffy CGI effects, but none of them can match the grandeur of this film's vision or its colorful gallery of characters.<br/><br/>The film's action stylings and detective story plot are mostly a cover for the issues it broods over:  what is it that makes us human?  How indeed do I know that I am human?<br/><br/>The answers concern a complex meditation on memory, something that previous to ""Blade Runner"" had been the strict domain of filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman.  BR took sci-fi film and pushed it into adult territory, just when the ""Star Wars"" revolution was threatening to turn the tide forever in favor of ""space opera"".  ""Blade Runner"" brought us back to the days of the German silents (""Metropolis"", ""Aelita"") in which a dark, uncertain future was coupled with doubts about the worth or meaning of human existence.<br/><br/>
There is a lot to look at here, with beautiful photography, and inspired direction and a batch of memorable performances from the excellent supporting cast.  Hauer steals the movie from the seemingly disinterested Ford, particularly in the film's stunning finale.<br/><br/>This movie is also notable for the depth of detail that was put into its futuristic vision.  Everything enforces the notion that this is an Earth we would not want to live in, and somewhat oblique dialogue occasionally hints that (as Dick's novel makes clear) Deckard would in fact not be on Earth if he was healthy enough to leave.  This is a future where you can't even order as much food as you want at a restaurant.<br/><br/>Now that we are closer to ""2019"" than we are to the production of this film, we can assess how much of what it is saying came true.  The specifics of the technology and culture aren't really what's important; genetic research and modern philosophy keep the ideas in this movie fresh and relevant -- perhaps even more so when this movie appeared and quickly disappeared (failing to capture the attention of the action movie public).<br/><br/>There are numerous inferior imitations (""AI"", ""Minority Report"", ""The Matrix"", etc.) But this one will be around for a long time after they have been forgotten."

","Complete Review. Full story told with personal comments.<br/><br/>Blade Runner quickly captures the viewer with splendous views of a futuristic city in the not too distant future. The police come to take Deckard (Harrison Ford) into custody while he is trying to have dinner in Chinatown. The police ask Deckard to come back to the unit and track down replicants, human cyborgs, and retire them. The Blade Runner unit of the police is the group that does this task, and Deckard is soon recalled into service.<br/><br/>Blade Runner shows off the great direction by Ridley Scott in the first section. A quick story ensues about one of the replicants and Deckard is shown a video where one of the replicants kills a Blade Runner who is trying to determine if he is a replicant or not. Deckard quickly takes the job and does some private investigating.<br/><br/>Deckard goes to the Tyrell Corporation for a meeting with Tyrell to obtain some information about the renegade replicants to see if he can track them down. Tyrell's friend Rachael (Sean Young) introduces Deckard to him. Tyrell makes Deckard perform a replicant-positive test on Rachael to test Deckard's skills. Deckard quickly finds out she is one and tells Tyrell, he explains she is a new and improved model.<br/><br/>As we view this section we can see there will be some future chemistry between Deckard and Rachael. This part also shows that Deckard is a hands-on kind of detective willing to go anywhere to do his job.<br/><br/>Deckard eventually finds one of the replicants in a parlor, he chases her into Chinatown and shoots her in the back. One is down, four more to go. Quickly another replicant, the same one that killed the Blade Runner in the beginning of the film grabs Decard by the neck and is ready to crush him, but he is killed by Rachael who had been following Deckard. Deckard and Rachael go back to Deckard's apartment, Deckard tries to bring out some emotions in Rachael but learns replicants have no memories of their own and they can't fully display human emotions.<br/><br/>The first real action sequence is intense and suprising here, a perfect mix to open up a movie. An interesting fact about Blade Runner that few people realize is that Deckard only uses a pistol to retire replicants, the chases and shootouts are fascinating without using a small arsenal of rockets and lazers so many other sci-fi's have used, this is truely impressive. One of the main hidden points is revealed here and will be very important to the story later, replicants don't have memories of their own.<br/><br/>The surviving two replicants, one of which the leader Roy Batty and his friend have hidden out in an engineer's house who has kindly let them stay. Unknowning of their purposes, he accepts them as friends. Roy finds out this engineer works for Tyrell. Roy gets into the Tyrell building and demands ""more life"" and it is explained all replicants have a ""kill counter"" on them, which is their lifespan. He kills Tyrell and they go back to the engineer's house.<br/><br/>Award winning cinematography from several festivals and academies are displayed here.  This part of the story is a pleasure to watch. Another main point about kill counters are made here.<br/><br/>Deckard finds out about the murder and quickly makes his way to the engineer's house. While he is searching the female replicant tries to kill Deckard. This is a heart pounding scene because the replicant has Deckard in a perfect position to break his neck, but in the nick of time Deckard turns and escapes, then he shoots her dead. These next minutes are the most suspenseful you might ever see in a movie. They are captivating, exciting, and extraordinary. Roy Batty and Deckard fight till the death in the old decrepit house where walls can be knocked down, there is nowhere to hide, it is rainy and slippery and Roy Batty has stuck a nail threw his hand as a lethal weapon. Deckard getting his ass kicked moves to the roof because that may be his only means of escape. Deckard slips and is hanging from the building. Roy comes over with little strength and helps him back up saving his life, right after this his kill counter goes off and he revrently bows towards Deckard as he dies.<br/><br/>Why would Roy Batty want to save Deckard? There is one answer, Roy Batty only hates humans, and he wants Deckard to live.<br/><br/>Deckard has finished his job and continues his romance with Rachael, but on the way out of his apartment he finds a oragami unicorn left by Gaff, a police officer who Deckard has talked to in the past. On his way out he hears ""It's too bad she won't live, but then again who does?"". And this is the scene that will absolutely blow your mind even more than the Shawshank Redemption and The Usual Suspects endings put together. I have given you the entire movie, but I cannot give you that part you will have to comprehend it yourself."

","I finally saw this movie on DVD about a year ago; Boy was I disappointed ! A critically acclaimed film ( How did that happen ? ) featuring Harrison Ford during his Hans Solo years sounded like a great way to spend an evening. A brief summary is to say this film is WAY TOO BORING. I once constantly thinking "" OK, they are just laying some important plot groundwork now and I am sure that in 5 minutes some really great action is going to start "". Those 5 minutes ended up being the last 20 minutes or so of the movie. The rest of the time you get an interesting view of a 1982 director's concept of the era which we are now living in but the rest is JUST SO SLOW. As my friend who brought the DVD over was taking it back out of the player, he turned to my brother and I and said "" I'm sorry "" and that pretty much sums up how I had felt about having wasted my evening watching this film. I did learn one thing from watching this movie ( Other than IT SUCKED! ) and that is now matter how imaginative science fiction is, without a healthy dose of action you are almost doomed to boredom. Why some of these reviewers would willingly choose to watch this movie more than one time is beyond me. For great science fiction I will cast my vote for the original "" Star Wars "", ( Good job Mr. Ford )and the original "" Star Trek "" TV series. Honorable mention also to "" The Final Countdown "" and "" War of the Worlds ""."

Attainable, logical, entertaining, visual, aural, intelligent and repeatable.  This is not a ""Hollywood date flick"" or a marketing extravaganza event of a film, which seem to be the standard to judge the recent industry, nor one of those obtuse ""sepia & white"" dubbed 16mm 'art films' that only makes sense when played backwards.  It is just a great film.  What more can I say?<br/><br/>An aside comment about the film itself, pertains to my treasured Betamax edition of the theatrical release, which includes Harrison Ford's voice-over narration.  Usually these effects are campy and ""dumbed down"", but in this application, the attitude of both the main character and the whole film are reinforced and confirmed.  However, as seeing a painting alone or with a placard of information about it, the focus is the work as a whole.  And this is one true work of art."

It's the perfect science fiction movie, it's perfect because it's believable and at the same time quite fantastic. I will give no spoilers, this film deserves to be watched, and viewers should be allowed to reach their own conclusions. However, one of the most important questions that one has to keep in mind is: ""Does Deckard have real or fabricated memories?""<br/><br/>Oh, I even decided to purchase a Bulova watch, and no other brand, thanks to this film.

Bladerunner has been a film which has defied critics and made believers to those who have never seen the movie. Sci-fi would still be a cheesy Dr. Who/BuckRogers/Xanadu cheesefest without the genius of Ridley Scott. Not only did he strike chords with Alien, he did it again in Bladerunner, redefining four genres in the process. While Harrison Ford might have been a weird choice to play Deckard, it worked out beautifully. While I am a fan of both the book and the movie, I felt this film really strived to establish a difference between the two mediums. While the book was dense and detail packed, the film did its best to fluidly portray the images Phillip K. Dick created so many years ago. Coupled with some great editing (the director's cut was far better) and a wonderful score by Vangelis, this film will stand as one of the best sci-fi films ever."

","Any movie brave enough to ask the question, 'what does it mean to be human?', deserves some credit. But not only is this a fantastically deep movie, that repays your level of attention 10 fold, it is the visual masterpiece of all time.<br/><br/>It is the common opinion that the 1992 directors cut, is the definitive vision. On face value, this may appear to be true. The dead-pan voice-over is gone, as is the 'Hollywood happy ending'. However this takes from the original vision Ridley Scott had, a vision of a classic Bogart-style detective story, set in the future. In the original 1982 cut, all of the detective story cliches are in abundance. Yellow, murky light through Venetian blinds, smoky bars and a monotone voice-over from the hero. Also, the amazing cinematography, that has become to trade mark of Blade Runner, is constantly dark and overwhelmingly moody. But in the Original cut, this dark/pessimistic view, is broken at the 'Hollywood happy ending' by a sun-drenched mountain drive, which comes like a breath of fresh air. The one instance in which the directors cut surpasses the Original cut, is the inclusion of the famous 'Unicorn Dream', which was the main clue to Deckard being a replicant. If this dream sequence was inserted into the original cut, a movie so perfect would be created, that it would rival 'Shichinin No Samurai' as the most flawless movie ever made.<br/><br/>So, for the record, Deckard is a replicant, and the directors cut is not nearly as good as the Original."

","To me, this is the greatest movie ever made.  I watched it when I was twelve, expecting complete mindless action.  Harrison Ford, future, robots, you know.... I was picturing him running around and solving mysteries, whatever.  It was a great disappointment at the time.  I later decided to buy the game, when it came out in 1997.  I didn't have enough money then, so I waited until 1998. Though the concept of RPG games wasn't fully implanted into my mind, this was one of the greatest games I had ever played.  Since I enjoyed the game so much, I gave the movie a second chance.  I watched it and was immediately intrigued.  My mom fell asleep on the couch, she didn't like it. I watched ritually after I bought the directors cut VHS.  In 2000 I went on this huge Phillip K. Dick kick and read all his books, including ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"".  Though Blade Runner is ""loosely"" based on this book, it really captured the essence of the story.  Still today, I could sit down right now and watch Blade Runner and feel like it is the first time I've seen it.  It is so open to interpretation, and god, the visual effects.  Those were top notch in 1982.  The effects still hold their own very well.  Nobody has executed effects the same since.  It was beyond convincing.  The music is killer too.  It really sets the mood.  If you haven't seen this movie, you are a cinematic idiot!  Go out and rent it right now.  If you can't watch a movie more than once and be upset because you don't understand it, than don't rent it.

Accomplished, basically flawless filmaking allows Ridley Scott to bring a fascinating tale (like Apocalyse Now, loosely based on a novel) to impress the audience. We are still impressed. A Science Fiction classic, of near future realities.<br/><br/>Like Coppola, Scott could not resist rehashing his masterpiece. The director's cut of Blade Runner is certainly a fine film.

","(WARNING:  These comments contain some spoilers.)<br/><br/>This movie is as good as science fiction gets on the big screen.  I think it suffered because the title and premise left people expecting an action flick when what they got was a dramatic, moderately paced story set in the future with a film noir flair.<br/><br/>The special effects were incredible, even by today's standards.  All of the images were beautifully dark and disturbing.  I'll never forget J.F. Sebastian's haunting genetic toys!<br/><br/>For a simple story on the surface, it had far more depth beneath.  It's definitely not a movie where who the bad guys are is really ever clear.  The Blade Runner hates his job- he feels like a murderer.  Is he? <br/><br/>
The director's cut introduces the notion of Deckard being a replicant himself.  I prefer this version.  The voice overs in the original are largely redundant and unnecessary despite sometimes providing additional insight.  I also hate happy endings.<br/><br/>My main complaint is that this probably would never happen.  Why make super-human slaves so human that they don't want to be slaves?  If Tyrell were truly so brilliant you'd think he'd have more foresight, unless perhaps he dementedly wanted things to turn out like they did.<br/><br/>Still the themes and moral dilemmas the movie presents are relevant and provocative.

","Look it's quite simple there are those who worship Blade Runner and those who just don't get it. For those who don't you're either too shallow and simplistic (sorry if I offend anyone there) or haven't given it enough of a chance yet. I myself didn't really get into it until I was old enough to properly absorb such a beautiful, complex tapestry of a movie, but now that I do, my god, if this isn't one of the greatest films of all time I don't know what is. <br/><br/>From Vangelis' incredible score to the faultless FX to Ford's wonderfully downbeat performance this film exudes a beauty and ambience that has influenced countless films since yet has never been beaten.<br/><br/>
Plagued by on-set troubles between Director Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford as well as a disenchanted crew it's a miracle the film turned out to be as good as it is. There is furious debate as to the definitive version. Personally it would be the director's cut but WITH Ford's narration.  <br/><br/>
Above all it's a wonderfully crafted tale of the hunger for life. Rutger Hauer's Roy Batty is a character driven insane by his desparate need to extend his short lifespan and preserve his life experiences. Blade Runner is all about mortality and that none of us know how long we have left. This is epitomised in Hauer's final monologue (which was apparently ad-libbed), which for me is the single greatest scene in any film. EVER!<br/><br/>""...All these moments will be lost in time...like tears ...in the rain.""<br/><br/>Sheer poetry, I rest my case."

Most ppl will agree though, that behind every good film there is a good ""story"".  The original story, Do Androids Dream of Electic Sheep, is one of Phillip K. Dicks better stories.

"seiferfans","10","0","1","10 June 2002"," What is human-a question only raised and answered by BR
","First of all, so sad that it's only the 78th...In my opinion, Blade Runner is no less perfect than the Godfather. I watched this film in my film-as-literature class, and it shocked me. As most viewers pointed out, this is one of the few movies that raises the questions not about entertainment or the society, but the very base of the human. Compare to the ending scene of Roy saving Deck, I found the theme of the movie being revealed in another way in the scene of Thora cracking through the windows. Deck shoots Thora three times: the first shot brings Thora through the windows--the invisible wall between humans and replicants, which, in some sense, only exists in men's mind. After all, running from death and fear--aren't those the emotions that distinguish a human from a replicant? After the second shot, we have the overlapping image of Thora and the background. I don't know what others feel about it, but Thora looks like an angel to me in this image. She flies, with her transparent wings, until she falls. ""Fiery the angels fall..."" Doesn't this quote of Roy's correspond to Thora? The third shot is a little ambiguous to me. Thora crackes into a snowing room...what does snow represent here? Purity? Despair? Bleak truth of death? I prefer the last conjecture though. Finally Thora dies, and her blood streams on the snow. Blood--vitality, hope, life--life! Do you feel that she's a replicant--a nonhuman, when you see her blood? I certainly don't. Like Deck says, ""shooting a woman on the back"", she is a WOMAN, not a female replicant. Roy has been credited by many viewers as the true hero of the movie, and I agree. He ""burns so very, very brightly"", like Tyrel says, that he is above all other characters--humans or replicants, in the sense of humanity. Isn't that an irony to the humans, especially that demon Bryan? Alas, having too many to say about Roy, I can't even find a way to verbalize it(please forgive me MR.

The sets and SFX are mind-blowing, and still hold up, even after 20 years. The soundtrack by Vangelis is awesome, and is therefore the perfect complement to the great visuals. The cast is top-notch; the movie's dialogue is eminently quotable.<br/><br/>
While the plot may seem (deceptively) simple & straightforward, upon close inspection it reveals hidden depths of meaning, dealing with some of the Big Questions in life. What does it mean to live, to be human? What are the consequences of creating life in our image? When the creation becomes indistinguishable from the creator, how should the creator treat it? Etc.<br/><br/>There are several versions of this movie around. Best known are the original 1982 release, and the 1992 `Director's Cut' (which wasn't a true DC, for several reasons), with a definitive version coming up sometime 2003. Personally, I prefer the 1992 DC over the original (which had a redundant `happy ending' and voice-over by Harrison Ford); my hopes are that the upcoming final version will be even betterÂ…<br/><br/>Whichever version you get to see, it is best to see it at least a couple of times before forming any opinion on it; this is one of those movies that only start to sink in, and get better, after repeated viewing."

","BLADE RUNNER<br/><br/>Most people have heard of Blade Runner but for those who haven't I'll give a brief rundown of the plot.  The year is 2019 and the location is the sprawling metropolis of Los Angeles.  In this future world the Tyrell corporation has created artificial humans known as replicants.  These replicants are better then humans in all ways except for the fact that they have a life span of only 4 years.  When four of these replicants escape from an off-world colony to come to earth it is up to a Blade Runner named Deckard to stop them.<br/><br/>For the longest time I liked this film but I thought that it had too many problems to really love it.  There were too many mistakes and inconsistencies throughout the movie, the movie had many slow spots and few action scenes, and I felt that there were many missed oprotunities the film did not take full advantage of.  After reading a book on the film I realized that many incredible scenes and ideas were never filmed for a number of different reasons.  I have for a long time believed that if they would have included some of these scenes the film would have been much better.<br/><br/>However, all of my previous thoughts have changed due to a recent viewing of the film.  While yes, there are many slow spots in the film I am no longer bored by them.  Instead I find the film almost hypnotic because of its slow, leisurely pace.  The lack of action scenes isn't a big deal either, if I wanted an action heavy sci-fi film I would see The Fifth Element or the Star Wars films, which are also good in their own right.<br/><br/>The mistakes that run rampant through the film also no longer bother me. I always thought that the mistakes in the movie were always distracting but I no longer feel that way now.  I realize that no film can be perfect and I no longer care if Joanna Cassidy's stunt double looks nothing like her or that you can see the wires lifting the spinner car.<br/><br/>I have decided that I no longer care that those deleted scenes were not included.  While yes, they look good on paper what if they ended up sucking and bringing the whole film down?  Instead I have learned to just be thankful that Ridley Scott was able to accomplish what he did.<br/><br/>While I love the film those people reading this must realize that 9 out of 10 people whom see this movie will hate it alot.  This is one of those films that immeadiately becomes your favorite film or one that you want to turn off after 5 minutes.  However if you are one of those people that enjoy a smart, intelligent films go out and rent this movie."
"OttoVonB","10","0","1","3 June 2002"," Most influential film since Star Wars
","There is little left to be said about this seminal masterpiece, but I would like to draw your attention to something different.<br/><br/>Books have been published about the era-defining visuals, the hellish production and confused post-production and release saga. This is THE future noire film, an entrancing world whose existence and ideas are much more interesting than any of its events. Harrison Ford serves as a conduit and Sean Young is the perfect synthetic femme fatale, but the center of gravity is and always has been Rutger Hauer's Roy Blatty, the first and last artificial aryan superman.<br/><br/>You should see this of course, and probably already have. If so, let's consider Rutger Hauer for a while, the man revealed by fellow Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven's Soldier of Orange and Flesh + Blood. Two very different films, in turn hopelessly different from Blade Runner. Three different characters than nonetheless all reach a state of grace, of distant peace and that sense of withholding secrets from us. That is what Rutger Hauer was at that point in time, perhaps the only male star to ever give us a flesh and blood version of the Mona Lisa's enigmatic smile, and never was that complex smile so fraught with significance than in the last minutes of Blade Runner. <br/><br/>I hold Blade Runner before not as one of the most influential and best films of all time. it is. I would like you, for the briefest of moments, to consider how it was so successful in capturing and redefining many of our subconscious artistic reference points, not just of what a modern cityscape might look like, but what modern humans and their artificial progeny might experience and feel. What Ridley Scott has done here, is not show us the future, as many people suspected: he has allowed us to touch it."

","Perhaps nothing is more consuming throughout the whole film as the feeling of the mood and atmosphere. The dark, desolate, and macabre aura is nothing less perfect. A good science fiction has good atmosphere, and good themes. The atmosphere itself makes a stark statement about the effects of technology on society. Also, the storyline of the droids held good ideas on human nature. Also, as good science fictions do, Blade Runner (the director's cut) leaves you guessing... Is Deckard a replicant? Ridley Scott, especially with the director's cut, has made a gem of of the genre. A film that consumes you and surrounds you in a dark city, makes you think, then leaves you uplifted when the credits roll. My favorite."
"ewraught","10","0","1","26 May 2002"," F--- the directors cut!
","Ridley Scott made one great film and has been trying to screw it up ever since. Barring the ""happy ending"", the theatrical release is a far more cohesive and engaging film then the director's cut, he's tried to pass off at superior in recent years. Without the voice over and with the unicorn scene, the film feels aimless and Decker less conflicted. Since then Scott continues to bash his only great work (though 1492 was a great underappreciated film, Gladiator was an hour too long). Now he's claimed that Decker was a Replicant, further attempting to alter the original impact of the finest non Kubrick science fiction movie."
"budack","10","0","1","10 May 2002"," If you get it, you love it.
","It is easy to see why this film goes over the heads of so many.  It is, at its core, about humanity, with our empathy for a being that is not human becoming part of the story's power.  It follows the classic noir form but is amazingly set in the future, blending the two genres so seamlessly and poetically it sometimes scares me to look upon its perfection.  Yes, it's pacing is slightly more conservative than most sci-fi movies, which are all explosions and space-chases, but if you understand its underlying themes and you consider yourself an existentialist in even the smallest sense, you will fall in love with the story and its characters and the movie will become one of your favorites too--instantly.<br/><br/>It is not easy to tell at first that Deckard (in Scott's intended version, the director's cut) is a replicant.  When the movie tested in the U.S., test audiences were upset by this.  They wanted him to be human because they felt for him.  What these American audiences (just like us Americans to miss the crux of the issue, isn't it?) failed to understand was this: the whole point of Philip K. Dick's novel (DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP, on which BLADE RUNNER is based) is that Deckard is NOT human- but we feel for him anyway.  This raises the questions: what does it mean to be ""real?""  to be ""human?'  and to ""feel?""<br/><br/>For those who still want to cling to Deckard's humanity, consider this: why would the government send a human to hunt down hyper-intelligent replicants with the strength of ten men, and if he was human, wouldn't Zhora or Pris's strikes to his head crushed it if his skull was made of real bone?<br/><br/>The thing that gets to me the most is Rachel.  She is different--as is Deckard-- from all the other replicants.  But does she have the 4-year lifespan, or will they live happily ever after?  You've gotta give it up for robot love.<br/><br/>The simple fact that Ridley Scott can make you feel so deeply for a couple of machines and plant a seed of hope into a dismal, dark future is amazing. Any self-respecting film lover whose DVD collection does not include the director's cut of BLADE RUNNER is not to be trusted."

","Blade Runner is a classic film. Anyone who doesn't agree with this statement should watch Metropolis, 1984 and Judge Dredd, so you get into the mood, and then watch Blade Runner. Then perhaps you will enjoy.<br/><br/>This film is relaxed in it's approach: summing up the mood of Harrison Ford's character, Deckard, who wants to retire and move at his own pace. It is also dark and mean in some respects giving a bleak vision of a dark future: a future where man's idea of playing God has no certainty and comes back to haunt him.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is perhaps portrayed from Deckards point of view that life in the dark and nasty bleak rat race is a pointless exercise and existence and that new pastures must be found.<br/><br/>Some parts of the film are outstanding in every sense: the chase around the apartments between Deckard and Rutgar Hauers character, the replicant Roy Batty, the scene where Deckard is saved from a long fall by the man he is assigned to terminate (i.e. Roy Batty), the images of the flying police vehicle, shots of the immense and gigantic Tyrrell Corp. Building, the dark and creepy images of the toys and little people in JD's apartment where the silence and eerie atmosphere combine and the final scenes where Deckard goes out to the countryside ((played by a fresh faced Sean Young) a one-off replicant who has no time limit to her life span). The sight of green fields, meadows, forests and white snow capped mountains is a thought to all who watch this film: Can there be any hope from a disfunctional bleak future?"

"Pelrad","10","0","1","26 April 1999"," An Artistic Masterpiece
","Well, with 70 user comments already, I feel intimidated to add one, but there are a few things I HAVE to say about this masterpiece. ""Blade Runner"" was unrecognised and the recipient of very mixed reviews by critics when it first hit the cinemas in 1982. It was the first big sci-fi film since ""Star Wars"" and its sequels and was unjustly compared to these very different kinds of sci-fi movies. It is only recently that it has been recognised as a great film. Its original soundtrack was unavailable until recently as well.<br/><br/>I remember watching the Academy Awards and being disappointed by the nominations and the results. Didn't Vangelis' (""Chariots of Fire"", ""Missing"") deserve a nod for best film score? ""Blade Runner"" was nominated for best visual effects and, as usual, the Academy went for the SENTIMENTAL favourite, much less deserving of an Oscar. ""Blade Runner"" had virtually a whole city created by a computer (computer graphics weren't as easy to generate back in 1982!) while, the winner of the Oscar, ""E.T."", simply had some kids ride bicycles in the air.<br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" was not a film with a complicated and original plot with surprises and twists randomising the heart-rate of the viewer sitting propped up on the edge of his seat. Nor did the film have intensive dialogue and interesting characters. Its plot was simple. Its script was concise (although there are some memorable lines). Its characters were somewhat plain (except, perhaps, for J.F. Sebastian). But all these were meant to be, for Blade Runner was not intended to be a high-powered drama; it was meant to be an artistic masterpiece, a film about ambience and atmosphere, a film directed at creating particular moods in the viewer, a film intended to dazzle the eye and exhilarate the ear. And it succeeded at these aims marvellously. It is art and film noir at its best.<br/><br/>A gloomy, dark, rainy, depressing Los Angeles, in the future, is the scene of a ""blade runner"" assigned to bump off rebellious ""replicants"" - artificial life forms created for slave labour in space. The film opens with columns of fire spouting into the air next to flying automobiles and chillingly smooth melodic synthesisers from the composer Vangelis. It is crowded, smoky, and various ethnic languages have melded together in the local Creole dialect. I liked the idea, also, of the umbrella stems being fluorescent lights.<br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" seemed to be a blessing on the actors that played in it; for, many unknowns became famous after the film and had the good fortune of winning roles in blockbusters. Rutger Hauer who plays the leader of the replicants became well known and starred in ""The Hitcher"". Sean Young, until this film, unknown, appeared in such films as ""Dune"", ""Wall Street"", and ""No Way Out"" with Kevin Costner. Darryl Hannah, another unknown, made it big in ""Splash"", ""Roxanne"", and teamed up with Sean Young again in ""Wall Street"". Edward James Olmos emerged from obscurity and acquired the role of the police chief in TV's Miami Vice series. He won a number of Emmy Awards. William Sanderson became ""Larry"" of ""Larry, Darrel and my other brother Darrel"" in the TV series Newhart.<br/><br/>I was sorely disappointed with the Director's cut of the film. One would expect a D-Cut to ADD footage, but footage was only removed - Rick Deckard's voiced over dubbing, the ending, and so on. All that was added was some silly dream of a unicorn. LEAVE THE ORIGINAL CUT ALONE!!! The D-Cut took away from the film's charm. Again: Leave the original cut alone! Why mess with it? DON'T!<br/><br/>I wish that more films were made in a similar spirit to ""Blade Runner"". Recently, ""Dark City"" re-captured some of its charm of it but lacked much of the old ""Blade Runner magic"", a great score to name but one lacking element. I give ""Blade Runner"" 10 out of 10."

I heard about the film when the Matrix came out and people were comparing it with Blade Runner. I thought a movie that is being compared with the Matrix must be pretty cool. I rented it and was disappointed. I had very little interest on what was going on and it seemed as though at sometimes that lady with the cigarette...you know the one...who Harrison Ford meets first...was just reading of the lines in front of her.

","From the start, when the somber score of Vangelis begins to thump in the backround, you are already being sucked into its thick atomsphere.  Then, the opening titles and prologue come to a close, to reveal in large print: Los Angeles November 2019. Then you are hit with it:  one the most stunning, incredibly elaborate, and dazzling visions of the future.<br/><br/>Plagued with acid rain, fog, topless skyscrapers and endless advertisements we are now into the horrendously beautiful world of retired blade-runner unit Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford).  He is forced from retirement to hunt down 5 replicants (android units that incredibly resemble humans).  His mission:  to exterminate them.  The underlying theme here is the slow, methodical, destruction of ourselves (it has not been determined whether Deckard is a replicant as well).  That being the case, the film slowly molds itself into your psyche, where it will NEVER evacuate.<br/><br/>It might as well be the most visually staggering motion picture of all time. To this day, I have NEVER seen any movie come close to the eerie reality of it's special effects (it got robbed that year by E.T.--which was one of the biggest mistakes in a long-line of mistakes that the academy has made). The visuals, writing and cinematography, EVERYTHING whisks you away into a gorgeous, harrowing world full of our own numbness to life and humanity.<br/><br/>There are two different versions availible.  The standard cut and the Director's cut.  I strongly recommend the Director's cut (widescreen, of course), because it eliminates the original voice-over (making the film more quiet and menacing), and gets rid of the ""happy"" ending (creating an amazing ominous feel to it).  I've said enough; I'll leave all of the characterizations for you to decide what you think..."

"Doc-134","10","0","1","19 March 1999"," A Question of Humanity?
","How do we know that we are human, and if we are human, what does it mean to be human? These two philosophical inquiries are explored at great length in Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" The film is based on Philip K. Dick's great novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" The inquiries that I have just mentioned were originally present in the novel, and despite much academic criticism, they are also present in ""Blade Runner""<br/><br/>In a sense, it is difficult to discuss the film without discussing in terms of the novel, so I will make constant comparisons in this review. Many critics have argued that the awesome visual effects and stylish cinematography overwhelm the content of the story and themes. This response is not entirely uncommon, despite the huge cult following the ""Blade Runner"" has accumulated. The film does not deserve such criticism. On a second viewing of the film, the spectacular effects do not overwhelm the story. We can understand that the visuals depicting Los Angeles in the year 2019 help to advance the themes. Many critics miss the human side of the story, or lack there of, and may object to the powerful visuals for this reason. It can be argued that the visuals serve to portray a dehumanized world where only subtle signs of humanity's existence are dispersed throughout, where existentialist notions such as what being human is and what being human means are not easily answered. In a way, each medium reinforces the other. There are many obvious differences between the novel and the film, but they essentially complement one another in result.<br/><br/>""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" has two primary themes, which are also present in ""Blade Runner"". The first is what constitutes the essential human being and how we distinguish the essential human being from that which only masquerade as human. And the second theme is that if you fight evil, you will wind up becoming evil. In the film, we have the character of Deckard who is becoming more and more dehumanized throughout the story, and the replicants are becoming more and more human. At the end they meet and the distinction is gone."

There are a lot of questions to think about in this movie. The atmosphere of the movie is so great, director Ridley Scott used his visual gift to create a strange LA 2019. The actors are good. It is one of the only movies that Harisson Ford is an anti-hero. Rudger Hauer play the best character of the movie. Sean Young as Rachel is good and so are the others. There are some problems with the script and the screenplay, but nothing to turn the film bad. In my opinion, this is the best movie from Ridley Scott.

","I first saw ""Blade Runner"" many years ago, shortly after it was released. I must admit, I was absolutely mesmerized by this movie.  Not only am I a Sci-Fi fan, but the added music by Vangelis enhanced the movie ten fold. The musical score puts the viewer in an almost 'euphoric' state of mind. Rutdger Hauer's performance is absolutely astounding in this movie! I've got both the Director's Cut and the original version on laser disc and as another person commented,  I also prefer the original version.  The narration that's missing from the Director's Cut is not necessarily crucial to the story line, but it does help out a first time viewer of the film. Sean Young also caught my attention as she, in my opinion, is positively gorgeous in most every scene.  I melt when she first comes on to the screen in her first scene as she is walking across the floor at the Tyrell Corp. and asks Decker, ""Do you like our owl?"" Lastly, my favorite scene is when Rachel let's her hair down, starts to play the piano and when Decker sits next to her and tells her that she plays beautifully, she gets up and starts to leave his apartment (for the 2nd time).  Decker slams the door shut and doesn't let her leave.  If you're a true Blade Runnner 'fan',  you know what I'm talking about."

","Thank God a movie like ""Blade Runner"" comes along once every decade or so and proves that science fiction movies can actually be about something other than special effects.  This film is not just a great science fiction movie, it's a GREAT FILM.  It has a message which transcends genre and makes this movie stand out against all movies.<br/><br/>It features riveting performances by Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer, and also sports a really wonderful soundtrack.  Technically, the film is a masterpiece.  ""Blade Runner"" received an Oscar nomination for best Art Direction, which it ultimately lost out to ""Gandhi"" in what may have been the most obvious example of Academy idiocy ever.  History proves the excellence of the art direction in this movie as 17 years have gone by and the vision of futuristic LA still holds strong.<br/><br/>The one unfortunate aspect of this film is illustrated by the Director's cut.  Just prior to release, after screening by focus groups (it's always an excellent idea to let the general public alter a film director's artistic vision), the final studio version had narration overlaid and the ending changed in order to appease the mass public.  While this had the benefit of allowing viewers to follow the film without really having to pay attention, it ultimately detracts from what is actually a very subtle film with a lot of unanswered implications."

","I am a big Harrison Ford fan, about 6 6'' 340 lbs, but despite that I also really like Harrison Ford, except in this amazingly awfully good movie. The acting is amazing except for how bad it is. If the acting were any better it would be too good, but if it was any worse you'd have best actor caliber for Harrison Ford. The movie captured my attention, making me realize that, well, the world in the future will be a gigantic china town...and that just made me happy. Aside from that, the whole plot, what was that, rather than a big advertisement for Coca-Cola and condoms.

","Purists and would be ""cinephiles"" have been arguing now for twenty years as to which is the definitive version of Blade Runner... Is it the studio version, with its Phillip Marlow-esque narration and it's tacked on ""Hollywood"" ending. Or is it the supposed ""Director's Cut"" with narration missing, the unicorn dream sequence and the ""what the hell"" ending... Personally, I don't know because personally I've never really ""got"" Blade Runner. I'll be the first to point out the ground-breaking visuals and the un-rivalled special effects that still stand-up to this day, but I've never ""got"" the film because I just can't buy into the central concept of a cop who, in the words of Rutger Hauer ""Mopes around then f**ks a refrigerator"", ok, that may be completely miss-quoted but you get what he was trying to say.<br/><br/>Deckard, the character portrayed by Harrison Ford is perhaps the most useless cinematic detective ever seen, not only is he slower than a bus on a motorway (if you've been stuck behind one you'll know what I mean) but he gets beaten-up by almost every one of the Replicants. He never seems to grasp the notion that these ""people"" are dangerous and perhaps he should tread carefully, instead he barges in playing it cool and ends up getting his ass kicked at every turn. Now the main reason Blade Runner left me cold (replicant sexual-politics aside of course) is the questions it raises and it's failure to give a proper answer to them. The ""what the hell"" ending I mentioned whilst talking about Ridley Scott's infamous director's cut refers to the fact that we only get half the interpretation.<br/><br/>Okay, so Deckard dreams of a unicorn, possibly one of the implanted memories that could answer the question as to weather he IS a replicant, this is THE question that gets film-geeks more excited than any other in the annals of movie history. If Deckard is a replicant then why would Tyrell implant the memory of a unicorn, I mean a Unicorn for heavens sake, why not say a family dinner or his first date, something that would make Deckard believe he was human and leave him with no doubt about it. I mean a Unicorn; it couldn't have been more obvious if they'd put it on one of the huge neon billboards that hover above the L.A. skyline, ""Deckard is a Replicant"". But Deckard isn't the only character that fails to win me over.<br/><br/>With the exception of Hauer's Batty, none of the replicants register, we don't care about them, and if they are such all-knowing works of technology then how come they're such morons, not a one of them has the sense they where programmed with (then again Tyrell was probably too busy planting memories of unicorns or bike riding monkeys to give them any brains or common sense). The world of Blade Runner is a cold, harsh and un-feeling world, a world of constant rain and darkness where people move about the multi-cultural landscape without uttering a word to anyone else (no wonder Deckard's represses). It's this vision of a crumbling old/new metropolis that makes Blade Runner what it is, but whereas the special effects haven't dated, the use of neon lights and pitch black framing would become the main visual staple for every early nineties music video and TV commercial. This becomes such an annoyance that at times we expect to see a ""Nike"" logo supperimposed on the screen.<br/><br/>The dialog shoots for profundity, but smacks of pretension, and even if the final battle between Batty and Deckard is very exciting the whole thing just stops, as if the battles behind the scenes had resulted in Ridley getting bored and just going home. I would like to hail Blade Runner as the classic most people make it out to be, but I just don't ""get"" it, and as for Deckard, how can you call the character a hero, when the only reason he survives the ordeal is because Batty lets him. Worth a look, but not a classic... 5/10"

","Blade Runner: what can I add that has not already been said said so brilliantly by others, such as Brendan's fine review on this site? This film is the limit - not just for sci-fi lovers, not only for aficionados of Noir, or Ridley Scott fans. Even if it wasn't the single most influential work in the entire genre of modern sci-fi, even if it didn't contain so many intelligent references to the Noir/detective genre, taking the legacy of Raymond Chandler into the present and future (which is why I had no problem with the voice-over version and miss it terribly)...this film is so visually astonishing that it could live forever as a uniquely beautiful work of art.<br/><br/>Indeed, the first time I saw it I thought the plot was a bit loose and bizarre, and that technically many of the predictions about the future were improbable. Now I've grown up a little and have not only learned to love the story, but in this age of cloning and genetic engineering it's easier than ever to accept the idea of ""Replicants"". Above all though, it's as a visual statement that the film delivers its greatest impact. Aided by a simply perfect soundtrack by Vangelis, each scene offers a richness and depth that very nearly overrides the story - perhaps the reason it left so many viewers confused and disappointed when it was first released. A Harrison Ford action film it is not. A very real and believable, and ultimately haunting and unforgettable statement by a master director and his carefully selected team of actors, art directors, and FX engineers, it most assuredly is."

","I thank my father for introducing me to the movies, he used to record films off the tv when we first got our VCR, and Blade Runner was one of those films. A film that has remained fixed in my mind ever since.<br/><br/>As a child it appealed to me because it was mysterious and action- packed, as an adult it appeals on a much deeper level. It is not a film that can be seen just once. If you really watch it, each viewing will show you more, as if it were made up of hundreds of sub-plots that were hidden to the naked eye.<br/><br/>A futuristic noir, the kind of imagery Edward Hopper might have painted, it's blend of science fiction, action and romance alongside the on-screen presence of Ford and the much imitated performance of Rutger Hauer, Blade Runner is perhaps one of the greatest films of all time."

","No, this movie won't appeal to everyone.  Anyone expecting an all-out action fest should probably look elsewhere; this film has a bit of that but the thrills are lugubriously spaced out in the time allotted, save perhaps for the ending.  Anyone expecting a general, modern Sci-Fi pic may be disappointed as well, in that things aren't quite as outlandish as you may be used to.  Still, this is the seminal SF flick, and it did surprise me that it spaces out the plot not as an actioner, but as a mystery!<br/><br/>We puzzle along with Deckard through the running time of Blade Runner the various themes that are laid in front of us.  He's supposed to kill these replicants, but how to find them given they are so close in manner to regular people?  And how can he reconcile that morally, since these constructs may, for better or worse, have developed some form of free thought, a soul if you will?  If he exterminates them, what will that do to his soul?  If AI keeps progressing as it seems wont to, we may be presented ourselves in reality with some of these same questions.<br/><br/>Thus, the amazing sets and feel of BR may be escapist, but the adventure and themes are chillingly down-to-earth.  The acting is quite good too-one of Harrison Ford's best, and definitely Rutger Hauer's best.  Catch it if you haven't, and think about it if you have."

Placed in this strange surrounding the fight against the Replicants turns out to be connected to the meaning of life.

","This is easily one of the best films ever made. I first saw this on video back in the early 80s when VHS movies still cost $100 a piece, and it has continued to be a favorite of mine despite my aging and changing tastes.<br/><br/>I tend to be the exception and not the norm in that I much prefer the theatrical release to the director's cut. I have always viewed Blade Runner as a futuristic detective film with a sci-fi setting, and thus Deckard's voice-overs in the theatrical release are a key part of the film for me. the director's cut lacks these and to me has far less impact.<br/><br/>I also disagree with the view that the director's cut takes. It strongly suggests that Deckard himself is a replicant that is simply fooled into killing his own kind. I feel that ruins the entire movie, as my interpretation of the film is that the replicants are the only beings in the bleak future who truly understand the importance of loving life. In the theatrical release, there is a certain amount of irony that the short lived replicants are teaching Deckard just how important life is. In the director's cut, we are lead to believe Deckard himself is a replicant and thus that irony is lost, as is the entire concept of loving whatever live we are given. In short, the director's cut transforms Deckard from the hurt and confused man (and human as he is in the Theatrical release) to simply a machine programmed to kill his own kind. Thus motives go from being emotions to programming, which kills any concept of feelings. I have viewed my old VHS tape time and time again and refuse to purchase the DVD until they come out with a version of the theatrical release. With the technology of DVDs, I do not see why they cannot have both versions on one disc- wasn't that a prime selling point of DVDs?- to have multiple versions of a film on the same disc? I have been flamed time and time again, but I think the director's cut is simply not very good in that it removes the most powerful element of the film- that being Deckard's voice overs which express his humanity and motives.

I loved the atmosphere, and the feel the game had. I also had the soundtrack by Vangelis in my possession for quite some time. I was addicted to Blade Runner even though i never seen the film.<br/><br/>Well tonight that changed. I saw it, i loved it. It lived up to all my expectations. I loved the storyline, and the atmosphere, the futuristic film noir presentation of the movie. I recognised a lot from the game, and almost the whole soundtrack comes back in the film. I was very happy that 'Memories Of Green' was in the movie, at a point where Deckard and Rachel are in Deckard's appartement. Memories of Green is my favorite song of the soundtrack. It has just the right feel, the sollitude that Deckard feels in this forsaken, lonely place called Earth.<br/><br/>The only downpoint in the movie is that it only takes 112 minutes. The characters could have had so much more depth if only there was more time to explain. For example, in the game the main character starts to question his own identity. Am i a replicant, or a human. At one point in the movie i thought Deckard had the same feeling, but you never got to see a whole lot of who Deckard really was. So you could never really fully understand his feelings or motives. Which i feel is such a shame.<br/><br/>I'm also a little proud seeing this movie. I'm dutch, and seeing Rutger Hauer (also dutch) perform in the way that he does makes me very proud to see that this little country can deliver such acting greatness. For me Roy Batty was his best part ever, the way he playes this angry replicant is so cool.<br/><br/>Blade Runner isn't just a sience fiction movie. It has such a great stroyline, it shows that being alive is a blessing, not a drag. That you should be glad with what you have, no matter how bad the world is, or how lonely you are.<br/><br/>Blade Runner is in my opinion one of the best movies ever made (if not the best).

","Probably the best film I've ever seen. What can I say that hasn't been said before? Nothing. Why am I then commenting on this film? I don't know. All I know is that you should see it if you haven't and you should see it again if you have. Oh and read the book also, it's really good too."

","Ridley Scott's powerful sci-fi thriller is a visually stunning mixture of action and telling social comment.<br/><br/>So many other films, books and TV shows have borrowed from Bladerunner that it is nearly always the look and feel of the film that is commented on. Always dark, always raining, the Earth of Bladerunner is an eerie mixture of Gothic, art deco, pseudo-Japanese high tech and downtown slum. It's gritty, it's noir...it even has a Chandler-esque (Raymond, not Friends) voice-over: apparently added to make the plot easier to understand and, in my opinion, erroneously deleted from the Director's Cut.<br/><br/>It is the basic premise of the film, however, that, challenges one the most: do machines created to be human, with human emotions and freedom of action, remain the property of their creators or should they be free. Almost subconsciously the film makes the audience deal with the question of slavery, and really makes one realise how precious the time we have to spend with our loved ones is.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford superbly plays his usual ""ordinary Joe trying to do right"", but it is Rutger Hauer who shines the most. As Roy Batty, leader of the Replicants, he achieves just the right mix of ruthless but vulnerable. He also gets all the best lines!<br/><br/>See Bladerunner on the big screen if you can:  if only for the soaring views of future LA seen from above and the post-climax ""light from the dark"" ending. I still think the original version is better than the Director's Cut: but it's a good excuse to see both in order to decide for yourself!"

","No need here to repeat how great a movie Blede Runner is. But I think it useful to explain the meaning of the dream of the unicorn : in the new version (the director's cut), Deckard dreams of a unicorn. And at the very end of the movie, when he comes bak to his flat to take Rachel with him, he sees a little origami of a unicorn, left by the other policeman, Gaff. This means that Gaff knows what he dreamt of, just like Deckard knew Rachel's personal memories. This obviously means that Deckard is a replicant himself..."

Have you ever been moved by sound,<br/><br/>One burning song, one uttered note, thunder?<br/><br/>Now shall you be shaken to places unexpected,<br/><br/>Out of the soul, to tears never cried,<br/><br/>Rendering thought useless, dead, raped by a mood.<br/><br/>
View bitter scenes with astonishment,<br/><br/>And stun at the roar of a god.<br/><br/>Note the path, upon which you're drawn,<br/><br/>Gathers music beyond one comprehension.<br/><br/>Ethereal rampage of sight and sound,<br/><br/>Lesser children of spirit awe with glee.<br/><br/>In the end we are refreshed by it,<br/><br/>Sufficiently altered by the tranquil ferocity."

","The movie is fantastic.  The book it is based on is ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?""  It's as good as the movie."
"Direct","Null","0","1","22 July 1999"," Good, but could be better
","This movie is a truly amazing feet in story and special effects.<br/><br/>Though this movie is very deep with thought and originality, it could be better. It was made in the early 80s, a time before we realized computers role in civilization. Blade Runner fails to envision computerizations effects on culture. The movie 'Ghost in the Shell' is very similar, but it understands the need for the internet and computers in your pocket. You get to see people with a computer hooked to net implanted into their brains. That is more of what computers will become some day. You will have to buy 'upgrades' for your brain. The ability to play solitare or StarCraft while your at a boring movie with your date. Just sit back and relax.<br/><br/>Even today, we have laptops with cellular phones. You can acess the internet from anywhere today. Some day, you will surf the net with your mind. Computers where unsure machines in the time this movie was made. The actual use of computer was uncertain. We now use it for everything.<br/><br/>Blade Runner was really ahead of its time. But it didn't see computer as much more than a tool. You would also expect for a Blade Runner to have special cybornetic implants to at least give them a fighting chance against the replicants. Without their guns, Blade Runners are good as dead."
