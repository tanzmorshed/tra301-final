","This is one of the very few times I have felt such emotions while watching a movie. Me and my gf cried a few times and laughed a lot. Many people ""not Icelanders"" criticise this movie saying that it's embarrassing for Icelanders and make us look stupid. Well to tell you the truth they got us in my mind pretty accurately. Made a frickin account just to write this. Thanks from iceland and have a good one."
"koparlokka","10","631","681","26 June 2020"," Thank you from Iceland
","Thank you Will Farell. We did not get a song contest this year but you gave us the best Eurovision I have ever seen! As an elf loving Icelanders I loved the silly humor and the end song brought me to tears. Rachel was adorable as ever."
"wheelers-8","9","399","438","28 June 2020"," Just the distraction I needed during a pandemic
","I had my doubts about this movie, but decided to watch it based on the cast. So glad I did. It made me smile, tap my foot and just escape a little to a happy place during a terrible time in the world.<br/><br/>Is it the most deftly acted, written and produced movie...no, no Oscar nominations, I'm pretty sure. But that's not the point.<br/><br/>What it does offer to the audience is a bit of fun and escapism, and a bunch of good laughs and cringe-worthy moments. It also left me a little lighter in spirit, and It reminded me to take the world less seriously. This was just what I needed during a pandemic, rampant racism, a horrible government and climate change out of control. There's so much that is wrong, that a little right is helpful. While I can't control the crazy world, I can control what I watch and how it impacts me. I choose to enjoy it for what it is and smile."
"DreamLighter","8","348","387","26 June 2020"," Honestly, better than I expected
","My expectations were low, I love Will Ferrel but his movies are often shallow and stupid and rarely touches you. This one is not deep and smart, that is not what I'm saying! But it is well made and has a lot of heart in it that balances the shallow and stupid quite good. Add on top of that the end performance by Rachel McAdams, the sweetest actress in all of Hollywood, and you suddenly find yourself cheering for a fictional Icelandic band in a fictional Eurovision contest in this feel good movie of crazy corona summer of 2020. Well done! Well done indeed!"

","I love Eurovision! I have no shame about this! Every year we have a get together with drinks and food and scoresheets and have the best night! This year everything changed, there was no get together, no singing our favourite songs, no voting and it was so so so missed!<br/><br/>Tonight me and my sister thought let's give this a go, it will be a laugh. Well we were given Eurovision life! It was everything that we love about eurovision! The songs, the cheesiness, the love! Watch the film, enjoy it like a weekend of eurovision and don't take it seriously!<br/><br/>The storyline is cute, its not forced it just flows and even if the length of the film feels long to you, you may not be a fan of eurovision (that show is long!!). I didn't want it to end and some of those songs are pure euro classics!! I have to say as a UK native we haven't won in a long long time so the only implausible part of the film is that it is in the UK and the hosts are not British but apart from that I will be watching this film anytime I feel sad as it has made my evening and made up the fact that eurovison was cancelled this year!<br/><br/>Enjoy the film and don't take it seriously because Eurovision is just fun and meant to be enjoyed!!"
"youngluke-32772","8","236","273","26 June 2020"," I found myself tearing up over a film that (on the surface) seemed rather average...
","I think when people see Will Ferrell on the casting list, they immediately think that it's going to be a laugh out loud movie, which I myself fell victim for. The film wasnt as funny as I had thought it would be, but instead found myself in tears at the end of the film. This is because this movie PERFECTLY represents what Eurovison is about, a proud cultural phenomenon that strives in diversity and community. This is a MUST SEE movie. The final song is beautiful, and the characters that are developed on screen become more lovable by the end of the film. There were also a few cameos too, of course there were going to be cameos! If you love Eurovision, you will fall in love with this!"

At the end she hits that speorg note which I think is the last 3 seconds of the last note. Meaning she sang from the heart. At the end, Lars finally ""sees"" Sigrit when they do their checking you out thing. There's a lot of meaningful things to dissect during this song. Love this movie."

","The storyline is not very ""in depth"" but a good ""coathanger"" to get the americans and other non european countries to learn a bit more about this crazy, weird but very popular Eurovision Song Contest. The songs in it are of a very high quality and it gives a good impression of what its really like. Also the visuals and stage performances are very realistic. I found it very enjoyable. Also a tip for the people who are new to this: there are a lot of original former contestants in hit. Also the commentator for the contest Graham Norton is in it. Just enjoy it for what it is! It's not a mainstream production but in fact a quite original one."

","Full of laughs, love, music, and happiness; this is a wonderfully entertaining movie! With Rom-Com styling, the movie is a ton of fun. It's an enjoyable satire, drawing awareness to a production that most North Americans are unfamiliar with. If you're like me, it may even bring a tear to your eye! Based on the lesser reviews, I guess some people expected an experience similar to ""Schindler's list."" This isn't that, nor is it trying to be. For those who simply want to kill two hours, this is definitely worth your time. Great job, Netflix!"
"ladyidamerethe","10","12","12","5 July 2020"," It's corny, but oh so Eurovisiony you just got to love it
","Fun film about Eurovision, love and elves. Laughed several times and loved the music, the former Eurovision winners cameos, and the elves. Dan Stevens was brilliant in this, ""he/him pronomen"" üòÇ.
If you don't like Eurovision, this film may not be for you."
"ermsie","10","27","30","2 July 2020"," A Nordic Triumph
","I'm an American who's been living in Europe for 15 years and had never heard of Eurovision before moving here. I now watch it each year and think it's hilariously kitschy, spectacular, and, every now and then, there's even a great song. This film brilliantly captures all of those elements of Eurovision in a film that's both extremely funny and moving. The song ""Husavik"" is genuinely great and there are some other fabulous musical moments as well, such as the ""songalong"". I suspect that most of the bad ratings come from Americans who've never seen Eurovision before and probably haven't ever been to the Nordic countries, so don't have a sense of what's funny about the characterizations of both. I don't say that with arrogance - I also didn't know before I moved here! In any case, I hope Americans will give this gem of a film a chance. It was clearly made with love and Will Ferrell took a risk making a film about a country he must have known most Americans have no interest in. Probably the most fun I've had watching a film this year, and I watch a lot. . ."
"andibrag","10","177","221","26 June 2020"," Better than I thought

","First of all this is a European comedy. I get it that the American press doesn't get it. But Eurovision has been the biggest contest in the EU for 30 years. And this was the best interpretation of EV you can get. Most of the winners were in this movie and the actors just nailed it! I haven't laughed this much in a long time. This is a tribute to Eurovision. Please give us a sequel!"

","This is worth watching just for Dan Stevens's portrayal of the Russian entrant, Alexander - brilliant acting and worthy of an award.

","I've watched it several times now. They were the cutest couple of people I've ever seen! Super adorable. It was funny as well but I think it is more of a feel-good movie than a straight up comedy. I was surprised with the low rating because everyone I talked to about the movie said they loved it.<br/><br/>I'm familiar with the Eurovision contest and I'm not really a fan but I was worried that this movie would be making fun of it. It is a well loved competition in Europe so I thought it would be pretty rude to insult all of Europe. But I thought it was pretty accurate and was in good taste."

","As a Eurovision fan, you often struggle to know when you can reveal such a secret with new people. If you're a Fan you love everything about it, if you're a part time watcher, you remember the silliness but forget the sublime!<br/><br/>On hearing the announcement I felt the same trepidation. But this film manages in 2 hours to show exactly what it is I love about Eurovision.<br/><br/>From the moment we hear the first bar of Waterloo, to seeing the smile on the sad young boy's face, to seeing the Duo stepping onto the stage for their first performance, you are filled with Hope and a desire to see them succeed.<br/><br/>The film takes you on the ups and downs as you would expect in a very similar way to Blades of Glory does. Every chance they have to succeed they fluff it all whilst being laughed at. Then you get to the very end, when they get it right and he mutters what will become immortal words, ""Eurovision is much more than a competition, The music is not a contest, and the perfect song isn't the winning song, but a song that comes from the heart!""<br/><br/>It is Bonkers and Beautiful and I absolutely loved it!"

","Okay the middle one hour of tge movie could have been shortened to half that time but I was in no hurry watching this so it did not matter. I give it a ten because this movie could sustain my attention during its entire length, there are several memorable jokes in it, and I like both main actors, Ferrell and McAdams who never disappoint. Regarding who sings what, I listened to Swedish singer Molly Sanden and I prefer McAdams voice (if you pay attention you can hear when she is the one singing). I had a good time, I got entertained, this is all I ask from a movie, thus a ten. I must add a sidenote regarding Eurovision. It is well known that countries do not send their best over there with the true intention to avoid having to pay for the cost of hosting the show. This is not something made up for the movie, unfortunately. Also, this is a good surprise from Netflix as I typically enjoy their series but not their movies that I usually find dull."

Suddenly a light bulb appeares over his head... Let's get to work!<br/><br/>I'm pleasently surprised about how good this movie was. It nailes the craziness perfectly. And the balance between drama and comedy was spot on.
Perfect execution. There's great insight here in how that highly entertaining song contest montrosity works. And it's done with respect.<br/><br/>I love it when I laugh out loud while watching a movie. There's an ufortunate boat incident here that i should have seen coming. But I didn't.

","When I saw over two hours long for a comedy like this I was expecting to give up after 10 minutes but this came together surprisingly well, well put together, some unexpected laughs. The 2 hours actually flew by. You may have to love Eurovision, as I do, to really like it and 'get' parts of it. It also felt like a good Eurovision fix in a Eurovision- free year."
"ssvfolder-1","8","13","15","2 July 2020"," The best Eurovision that I have ever seen
","This movie was a complete surprise. Netflix does not make really good movies. For some reason they are always lack something extra (take all of Adam Sandler movies of late) or straight awful like""Coffee and Kareem"". This time it's different. It's actually surprisingly emotional and simply awesome movie, with an amazing cast. This is one of the best I've seen from Will Ferrell in a long time, probably since Anchorman 2.
This movie is a creation of Ferrell, as he's the one who co-wrote, produced and starred in it, so the credit goes to him. The funny part is, that it felt that he was a bit of mismatch looks-wise, for simply amazing Rachel McAdams.
The music is perfect reflection of Eurovision. It lifts the spirit and makes you smile.
I would hope the'd make a followup to this one with a Rocky1 - Rocky 2 style, where the Iceland would win. I never really rooted for anyone at Eurovision, but the next time I'll be rooting for Iceland."

"Chris-742","8","6","6","5 July 2020"," The best Eurovision event this year.
","..and probably would have been even if they had had a real show this year.
For me that has watched the eurovision since I was small this was an emotional roller coaster ride. The movie is not a comedy as such, even if there are more than a handful of laughs and giggles. It is more of a feelgood drama with comedic and goofy undertones. In fact I think a lot of the movie manages to hit the goofy tone of much of the Eurovision. It parodies a lot pf Eurovision song contest, which is probably lost on a casual or someone who never watched the ESC show. Payback to the americans when we had to watch otherwise good movies against backdrops of hard to enjoy or understand stuff like american football, basketball or (snore) baseball. But as well as goofiness, there are also deeply romantic and sad parts. The music, for the most part, is excellent, better than the average ESC fare.
Good efforts from Will, Rachel and Pierce Brosnan who is great as the stern and sane father.
Bad is a stretch in the middle of the movie and any mention of p----. Why is that even there?
Ohh, and this movie makes me want to go to Iceland right now. Was there for 4 days last year and it was great, beautiful country despite having few trees and friendly people.
Ps2. There was a phone voting in my country for the ESC contestants despite there not being a big contest, and Iceland won. Iceland for the win!"

","As a huge Eurovision fan, this movie was everything I hoped it would be and more! The songs are so Eurovision and would be believable as genuine entries to the real contest. The song Husavik gives me goosebumps every time I listen.<br/><br/>The humour was funny and silly but the film has so much heart as well which really surprised me. I'm not sure if you have to be a true Eurovision fan to really feel that this film does go deeper than what's on the surface. We didn't get a contest this year, this more than makes up for it, but we did get a special on the BBC (and across the world!) where the hosts were virtually speaking to this years entries and past contestants. This programmme really moved me and it was really heartwarming to see Europe come together through this crisis, and this film gave me the same feeling knowing Eurovision fans all around the world would most likely be checking this movie out as a replacement for a show this year. If there was a perfect time for this film, it's now!<br/><br/>The only thing missing in the film was the postcards!! They could have done something so cool with these so I wish they'd been included but either way it's still a 10/10 from me!<br/><br/>The low scores really baffle me, you have to take this film for what it is. You're not sitting down to Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, this is some lighthearted, heartwarming fun.

Although Eurovision Fire Saga doesn't take itself too seriously, it still delivers a very good solid storyline, a strong underlying message about life and love and topped off with a fantastic sound track that will have you blaring the speakers at all hours on repeat.....<br/><br/>For those who enjoy Eurovision, for those who enjoy some great catchy music and for anyone that enjoys barracking for the underdogs then this is the film for you.

The story was obviously nothing original. But it's like eating your favorite ice cream. You've had it a million times and it still tastes great!<br/><br/>And to all the 1 star reviewers - you must seek help immediately because you clearly need a reality check.

","As someone who has been watching Eurovision every year, witnessing the enormous effort and money every country put to shine out as 'original', which is sooo unbelievable and can more often than not seem quite foolish, yet somehow charming and exciting, I would say this movie was spot on in terms of representing this exact spirit of the contest. I genuinely enjoyed every minute of it - laughed and cried. Also, having the opportunity to live in Iceland for a bit, I know most people there take this contest with quite an excitement, which makes the movie even better for choosing exactly Iceland as the main focus. Absolutely loved it!! And on top of that, since the actual Eurovision contest sadly got cancelled this year, this movie really made it up for that, at least to me."
"kelvynchin","8","22","30","28 June 2020"," Sweet, touching and feel - good romantic comedy!
","This is a wonderful feel good romantic comedy starring Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams as a fictitious Icelandic duo ""Fire Saga"", Lars and Sigrit, who inadvertently end up representing their country in the Eurovision song contest. Although often ridiculed by even their own town folk, they nonetheless ultimately bring pride to their country and their hometown.<br/><br/>The movie has been panned by some critics, who I felt kind of missed the point. Perhaps they were expecting a more traditional Will Ferrell comedy. But essentially, the movie is a winking tribute to the sometimes gaudy and goofy world of the eurovision contest, and also a romantic comedy (as Sigrit is in love with lars, who is oblivious to it all). Pic also features many cameos from contest winners who do a raucous sing-a-long in a nightclub, Demi Lovato and there are numerous fun and rousing musical numbers throughout it's runtime; meanwhile, Dan Stevens shows up in a slinky and uproarious turn as a Russian singer. Pierce Brosnan does a fine icelandic accent as Lars' fisherman father. There are some funny bits as well, including a laugh out loud moment involving elves. Yes, elves.<br/><br/>The songs written for the fictional band such as Volcano Man and Ja Ja ding dong are suitably silly, while ""Double Trouble"" and especially the soaring closing number ""Husavik"" is a real show stopper and a rousing capper to a completely feel good movie.<br/><br/>So best to ignore some of the critics; especially during these dreary times of pandemic and lockdowns, it is great to watch such a heartwarming, funny, tender and uplifting movie. Sure, it is schmaltz, but it's high quality schmaltz. When McAdams sings Husavik at the end, you will likely cheer."

I had no knowledge of Eurovision Song Contest and what a big deal it is in Europe. They have their share of talented singers and some that would only be appreciated in Europe. But a Big thank you to Will Farrell, Rachel McAdams for educating us on this part of European culture and giving us a little escapism. And some of the songs are very catchy too.

What really carries this flick is the charm that McAdams exudes in every scene. IMHO, McAdams is a seriously underrated actress and her ability to make you forget Ferrell's potty humor showcases it beautifully. Now not every joke lands but there are some good bits that buoy you beyond the cringe-inducing moments. There is a good deal of fun throughout and some songs contestants sing in the contest are actually quite catchy.

The atmosphere of the songcontest is perfectly reproduced. The music and performances are beautiful and Rachel is sweet, beautiful and sings like an angel. The music in the movie is beautiful.

And yeah, the songs are universally great and they will stick in your head and this is coming from a guy who gets off on hardcore.

Making fun of all the over the top acts but secretly loving every second.
I expected this movie to make fun of everything we Europeans (I'm Dutch) love about Eurovision. Made it look ridiculous. Yes Eurovision is very corny, kitchy, camp and all but that's why I love it.
This movie really did a solid though. Its definitely not the best film ever made but It's a lovely story. It makes fun of some aspects of Eurovision the same way we all do.

"MartinHafer","8","24","40","28 June 2020"," Not really a comedy...but well worth seeing.
","Although this IS a Will Ferrell film, do not watch ""Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga"" thinking it will be anything like ""Talladega Nights"" or ""Anchorman"". In fact, I would go so far as to say I wouldn't even consider it a comedy...though it has some comedic portions. Instead, it's a strange tribute to Eurovision from some folks who seem to understand and love it.<br/><br/>Now this MIGHT mean that the best audience for this movie are Europeans and folks from a few other countries that also compete in the competition (such as Israel, Turkey and Australia). After all, few Americans (apart from me and a few other strange folks) watch Eurovision or even know what it is or how it's conducted! But, if you don't know about it, you might still enjoy it...who knows?<br/><br/>As far as the movie goes, it is the fictional story about Lars and Sigrit (Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams)...a singing duo who, frankly, don't seem very good. But through an odd set of circumstances, they find themselves the Icelandic entry into Eurovision!! Do they stand a prayer? Probably not...but the film is about them and how they manage to salvage some dignity out of this!<br/><br/>What really helps this story is that so many Eurovision winners and famous competitors appear in the film. Additionally, they must have gotten permission to use the name, bumper music and more...making the film look and sound exactly like Eurovision!<br/><br/>Overall, a wonderful and enjoyable film for anyone who loves Eurovision...and a mildly enjoyable movie for anyone else."

Then I did my research and found out that it's actually mostly foreigners who think it's offensive to Iceland, while Iceland gets the joke and is having a laugh. Stereotypes and over the top performances ARE Eurovision, so I ended up being glad they ran with it. They had some good Eurovision classic references in there and it was just an overall feel-good movie.

Some fantastic vocals put together by a plethora of artists who looked like they enjoyed every second of filming this movie. I think I've listened to the songs Double Trouble and Husavik a million times in the 24 hours since this movie came out!!!

Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams have great chemistry and really play well off each other. They are both very touching in their roles.
I was very surprised to see Pierce Brosnan cast as Lars' (Will Farrell) father and tagged as the ""handsomest man in Iceland"". For my money, he is the handsomest man in the world! But who would have expected to see him in a Will Ferrell movie, right?
And then there is Dan Stevens! Wow! I had to do a double take (actually, a few double takes) because he looked so familiar. Then I finally figured out that he was ""that guy from Downton Abbey - the one whose character died in a car crash at the end of season 2""...! But geez! He is slimmer and much more buff in this movie and his role is 180 degrees away from his Downton Abbey role. And he looks 10 years younger than he did in Downton Abbey. And his last appearance there was 12 years ago! So, major shocker on that count! I love the role he plays in this movie - a young, very hip, pretty gay, popular Russian pop-star, who is not quite out of the closet yet, He puts on a great show and his whole story-line is just delicious!
I highly recommend this sweet, funny, heart-warming movie! Well done, Will Ferrell! This man knows how to dream!"

Lots of music including 12 original songs from the brilliant opener Volcano Man to the final touching Icelandic entry in the contest. All capture various takes on Eurovision songs over the years. The ""song along"" sequence is nothing short of joyous.<br/><br/>Far from portraying the Icelandic people in a bad light. A caricature yes, but I came away with a feeling of a patriotic, passionate and fun loving people with a sense of community I wish that we had and hope they still do. Some nice footage of amazing Icelandic scenery also.<br/><br/>Characters who initially seem two dimensional turn out not to be so, and there's even room for comment on some nations' semi-official attitudes to minorities.

The final song absolutely brought me to tears.<br/><br/>One of the paramount accomplishments in Will Ferrell's career how he gradually hands over the prominence to McAdams as the film progresses, as well as writing a genuinely interesting antagonist (don't want to say more and spoil it) in Dan Stevens. Amazing cast, and the music is unbelievably good.<br/><br/>But what do I know, I'm an American so I'll just go now. To Starbucks."

","Abandon any intent of a serious plot, this is pure escapism, the music is fun, the look at Europe is funny, the story is silly but so is Eurovision in reality.<br/><br/>At times so silly it's a bit flat but also at times really funny, I think it will grow as a cult film. It's quirkiness is its charm, Iceland is the star and at the end you simply think, "" well, what was that ?"".<br/><br/>Worth a look, with probably the most enjoyable 'happy ending' I've seen in quite a while."

"Blk_Ne190","5","53","104","26 June 2020"," Lighthearted Fun That Goes On and On...
","This movie i feel is two separate movies. It is one part a Romanic Comedy/love story and then the other is a Bizarre Eurovision parody/satire. And I feel like this movie gets in the way of it's self.<br/><br/>The most successful part for me was the Eurovision side. It just works better. It captures the silly, fun, cheesy aspects of the Eurovision Song Contest. People have been saying that this movie is ""weird and bizarre"" and I agree somewhat but I think it can take it self serious at times. It has flashes of bizarreness but then gets weighed down by other things. I think the best scene is at the big party where it is a huge ""flash mod/singing medley"". It is so strange but so fantastical.<br/><br/>The jokes...they are not that great. Some are like fine but others just don't land at all and to make it even worse you are forced to listen to them twice a lot of the time. Characters will constantly repeat a joke that has just left another characters lips seconds ago. I don't know if they thought it was so funny that we needed to hear it twice or if they just didn't want us to not hear it and miss out.<br/><br/>The songs are really good. They really capture that cheesy, over the top, fun energy of Eurovision. They could all pass as Eurovision songs but they are also tinged with humour so I really think they did a good job on them and someone really took the time to get that right.<br/><br/>The start of the movie is also very pretty with the shots of Iceland, it really makes you want to go and visit it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this movie is also too long. 2 hours for a story that could have been told in 1 hour 20. I think they needed to trim it down and tighten it up. It also seems paced strange as there seems to be a few like climaxes where you think ""oh it must be ending soon...oh no wait there is still 30 minutes left"".<br/><br/>So you could watch it especially if you love Eurovision. You will find something you like about this movie."

","If you are a fan of song contests and emotional success stories which might evoke your inner feelings, then you will be well entertained with this film. If you are a fan of Eurovision you will like this even more! And if you are a fan of Will Ferrell, then don't miss this! He depicts a funny Icelandic musician who is willing to give anything to win the Eurovision Song Contest, He has some great scenes together with the female lead Rachel McAdams, (also an Icelandic musician in the film), who is giving an amazingly heartfelt and sweet performance. The music in the film is great and the performances of various artists are rather notable and give that special Eurovision vibe. Also the production of this film is supported officially by EBU (European broadcast union) so the realism in the competition rules, style and overall look in the film is great. Not to mention the beautiful Icelandic scenery and some funny stereotypical comments from Europeans about other Europeans, and mentions to countries such as Greece, Russia, Sweden etc. All together, creates a kind-of magical sweet success story about true love, about following your passion and about being proud of what you do.
9/10 this was a very fun film!"

We did not have ESC this year, but we had this film! Music track is EXCELLENT loved the songs. For die hard fans of ESC, there were some triggers for them (7 onstage for Sweden-limit is 6, Spain, Germany UK in semi-finals - 4 major contributors are automatic for final), the score board, competition held in Scotland, etc.) Also one liners that are quick to catch (the comment ""nobody likes the UK"", Americans asking if it is like 'the Voice', etc.). Trivia in film that only ESC fans can appreciate, the piano used was Duncan's, Pierce Brosnan watching ABBA sing Waterloo, a song he sang 2008 in Mamma Mia, Dan Stevens stating, ""be my guest"" (he played Beast in stage of Beauty & the Beast hence the song Be My Guest), also he resembles George Michael of WHAM! whom he mentions in the film (WHAM! manager went on to manage Russian boy group SMASH!! which did covers of 'Faith' & 'Last Christmas' of which SERGEY LAZAREV participated ESC 2016/ 2019) etc. Graham Norton could have been way more snarky like he normally is, seems he toned it down for this! loved all the cameos from Jon Ola Sand to Salvador, Demi Lovato and the Party Scene was the BEST EVER!!!

Most of it is campy as you would expect from Eurovision (and I loved all of it) but there is some genuinely beautiful songs, especially one at the end (which I think will be obvious when you watch it). There was also delightful and surprising cameos from Eurovision personalities, along with some necessary scathing comments from the brilliant Graham Norton!!<br/><br/>All in all, this film had me smiling through all of it and it will definitely be one I watch again."

","I was very positively surprised by the movie. I thought, knowing Ferrell it would have been more of a parody of the eurovision contest, than what it really was. It felt so warm, and with so many positive emotions towards the contest. It was funny, but without mocking either the islandic community, or as said the eurovision. I'm European, not super-fan of eurovision, but very much aware of the contest. And it felt so accurate. Very good fun flick, pacing is good, entertainment value is great, comedy is good as well, never really a dull moment. It did what it set out to - entertain the people, without making a masterpiece of movie art, in any sense. You can of course criticize the movie for a lot of stuff, namely the dull plot, and the fact it isn't very original. But i'm choosing to grade this movie, for the intentions that the filmmakers had, and for what its worth, the movie succeeds. 7/10"

This is the kind of film you will definitely return to and watch again - I'm already penciling it in for Christmas and next year's Eurovision night.

"akcenat","8","2","2","7 July 2020"," Utterly ridiculous but wonderfully feel-good entertaining
","Netflix (123 min) new movie arrives with little buzz or advertising, yet in a world of COVID-19 pandemic it's quite O.K. to say that the world needs movies like ""Eurovision Song Contest"". Fire Saga's core of sweetness might just keep growing on you more and more in hindsight. The film is perfectly watchable, light and goofy funny. The kind of movie that is really built for viewing at home and the type of film which doesn't push the limits of this type of comedy. Some aspects work better than others, but inaccuracies do not affect the overall enjoyment. All of the musical segments were amazing and I will definitely look for the soundtrack on Spotify. Director David Dobkin's visiable experience shooting music videos for the likes of Elton John and Maroon 5 ensured staged spectacle. Rachel McAdams was both gorgeous and hilarious, while her sub-plot was very heart warming and her character overall was such a joy to watch with an almost childlike naivety on her journey of self discovery. Other highlights include Dan Steven's brilliant inspired Russian entry. Pierce Brosnan is absolutely brilliant choice for Ferrell father because the sheer irony of casting him following his role in ABBA adaptation ""Mamma Mia"" is genius. The film also features the BBC's talk show host Graham Norton as a color commentator. The finale is gloriously uplifting and guaranteed to make your heart Ja Ja Ding Dong, while 'Eurovision' itself would be proud, especially since there is no Eurovision this year which makes this film is a quite suitable replacement. I also hope to see the real Eurovision Competition in 2021 look somewhat similar to this, with Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams making a surprise appearance.<br/><br/>Rating: 8"

","Such a 'feel good' movie !
Had a smile on my face (and a few tears at times) all along the movie ... I enjoyed this musical adventure from beginning to end.
For sure a comedy, but with a big heart.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is a genius, not just comedic but also creative. He also is a multifaceted talent who can infuse his ideas and concepts in all kinds of fields ! You clearly can feel his passion for music & soft spot for Eurovision (and everything it means ; a competition yes, but with this sense of community around the passion of music). Also, the will to show this sheer 'togetherness' through this international event that is Eurovision, is obvious and enjoyable to see, hear & feel all through the movie.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams' character (Sigrit) wonderfully balances Will Ferrell's character (Lars). While Lars' only focus is music & becoming famous worldwide, Sigrit brings her sweetness and large palette of deeper emotions. Two eternal dreamers that answer to one another in the most organic way. Because the chemistry between both actors is a gem that's really pleasant to witness in every scene they are together !<br/><br/>The supporting cast (Dan Stevens, Pierce Brosnan & Melissanthi Mahut, for the most part) all nicely serve the evolution of the plot and highlight the two leads in the best possible way. And even if the movie is over-the-top at times, it also breathes multiple realistic emotions and situations that always work in this type of movie... Making you invested, cheering and feeling moved as much as you feel entertained. The movie isn't just gonna make you laugh or shed tears, because the whole soundtrack is very catchy ! The stage performances and production value pop with radiant lightings & colors !<br/><br/>Certain scenes are really efficient and worth rewatching (the Semi-Finals' scene is exhilarating, the Song-Along one is a blast, the Final's song,...etc).<br/><br/>Once again a Will Ferrell movie that might become a classic."
"debtman","8","2","2","6 July 2020"," One of Ferrel's best in years
","I didn't expect much from this film honestly, some laughs and 1.5 hours of entertainment was all I asked. After Holmes and Watson (which my kids and I have not been able to make it more than 25 minutes into) I felt that was the best I could do.<br/><br/>But, this movie surprised. Sure, it opens with Ferrel playing his typical idiot man child, but it goes beyond that to an honestly sincere and inspirational story. The performances are all great, the characters display some depth despite appearing perhaps 1 dimensional at first, and the music is phenomenal (honestly, have been falling asleep the past few nights with songs stuck in my head). The final song (my home town) honestly gives me chills just listening to it.<br/><br/>I'm not a big eurovision fan, I know vaguely of it and have seen some acts from time to time, but that didn't make this less enjoyable. It's not the best movie of course, it still has moments of crude humor (admittedly hilarious at times), but it's beautifully shot and well acted and overall an enjoyable romantic comedy.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate that it was released during a worldwide viral pandemic, as I think this film would do an amazing job for Icelandic tourism otherwise (and I'm sure their contributions to production costs were certainly hoping for this)."

Loved Graham Norton hosting it as he usually does, great nostalgia listening to his Eurovision commentary and as English person I absolutely loved the little UK jibe ""0 points""! Favorite quote 'the elves went to far!' only wish we would've heard a 'nil pois'. All in all, LOVED IT! Thanks so much Rachel McAdams, Will Farrell, Pierce Brosnan and everyone else for bringing some humour into 2020."
"Lazy_movie_watcher","7","7","12","30 June 2020"," More musically driven than comedic.
","That's not to say I didn't enjoy the movie though. Sure there were some funny parts, but it's mostly about the music and country pride. I honestly was expecting some dumb funny songs since I actually had no idea what Eurovision was. However, I found myself actually getting into the music and the contest itself. Definitely a feel good movie that we need right now and for a Netflix film, it's one of the better ones."
"tommihenttu","7","7","12","29 June 2020"," Surprisingly good
","Man, when I wrnt into this movie the only thought I had was ""Another Will Ferrell comedy. A few laughs but stupid overall."" I did not expect to cry, the movie has something a lot of Will's work lack. Heart. You really feel the character's struggle and motivations. They feel.... Real. The movie sacrifices some laughs for a genuine story and I loved it. It still has those dumb humor moments, but they are rarer than before. Hooefully there will be more like this. It captures really well what Eurovision is all about and it works as a good replacement for the canceled show this year."
"alindsay-al","7","7","12","29 June 2020"," A Good Silly Film
","This film hit Netflix on Friday and being British I know what The Eurovision Song Contest is so I decided to watch this film and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees two Icelandic Musicians given the opportunity to represent their country in The Eurovision Song Contest and attempt to achieve their dreams.
Main Character
Rachel McAdams plays one of the main characters here and I thought she was really good here. She is the character that I cared about the most here and her journey is the most interesting part of the film. She is a great actress and even though this film doesn't take itself too seriously she tries too at times. Will Ferrell plays her partner and I thought he was fine here, this is nowhere near his strongest performance but he does have some funny moments and even though his story arc is cliche it does work for the film.The two's chemistry is good and they bounce off of each other well, which is good as it is the part of the film that you have to be invested in.
Supporting Characters
Dan Stevens is one of the best actors going around today and for me he was the standout for this film. He is uber charismatic and really balances on the borderline of being super cool or super annoying but he nails it and oozes style in every scene he is in. Pierce Brosnan plays Ferrel's dad and he is good here, again he isn't the most interesting part of the film but for the role he has to do he does it effectivley. Everybody else also does good jobs and it is nice to see Graham Norton have his real life role here.
Story
The story here is pretty basic, but the chemistry between the two leads is really good plus it is great seeing the song contest being played out in all of it's glory. But there is this side arc involving the Icelandic government that had potential but it feels really out of place. Plus as I have mentioned there are parts of the film that are very generic leading to it being a predictable film.
Script
The script has some funny moments in it and some nice drama to it. But there just aren't enough of those funny moments, I am pretty sure this film is trying to be a comedy but it isn't funny enough to be a great comedy unfortunately.
Style
The style of this film is absurd, you see just how crazy Eurovision is, and what is funny is that this film doesn't even make it much crazier then it is in real life. The song sequences are fantastic, they feel grand on scale and feel epic in nature. But the issue is that you can tell that every actor is lipsyncing and it does take you out of what is happening. Also I felt like the last act is rushed a little bit and it leads to a pretty abrupt ending.
Overall
Overall, I feel like this is a very entertaining film, I think if you know little about Eurovision this might not be a film for you. But if you know about the show then this is a fun if not flawed experience that could be worth a watch."
"tglasnovic","7","7","12","29 June 2020"," Fun for Eurovision fans
","I think that the songwriters did a splendid job (good songs with the right amount of parody). I wish the movie was a bit funnier and logical. Some scenes were dying for a wittier joke (for Will Ferrell and Graham Norton, at least). It looks like some scenes were quite obviously inserted (for a reason) but not blended into the story well, characters's actions are not explained or they have a rather flat explanation. I really loved Rachel's acting. I think some foreshadowing was unnecessary (e.g. Rachel's scarf). The roles of Greek and Russian characters, I felt, needed to be less superficial (especially Dan Stevens's - I liked his acting). All in all, a fun movie, especially for those who missed Eurovision this year."
"gerardward","7","7","12","29 June 2020"," Big hearted movie
","This film is big on heart. It's long, too long, but if you make it to the end you'll be glad you did. The finale is worth the wait. It's no Anchorman, but the gags and the music make it a silly fun two hours."
"tallyvalley","7","7","12","28 June 2020"," A hilarious romp.

"RubyMouse","7","7","12","27 June 2020"," Lockdown fun
","Like Eurovision it's far too long, cheesy, camp and has additional Conchita Wurst and Graham Norton. Dan Stevens as the sexy Lion of Love is a complete treat. His performance would easily win a real contest. There is a kind of menopausal Glee section in the middle with previous euro winners doing their stuff and there were several very funny laugh out loud moments. Of course there is lots of unnecessarily filler and very juvenile humour but overall this was far better than I expected. If you don't like Eurovision you probably won't like this though."
"green_owl88","10","12","24","26 June 2020"," What more could you ask for?!
","Rarely do I ever want to watch a movie again once I've already watched it. To me this movie has it all. Beautiful locations and scenery, captivating and wonderful music, superb casting and acting. I can tell a lot of thought went into the writing and directing of this movie. I have always loved Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams. The love story between them in this movie was so sweet and real. It is now my new favorite movie."

","As an European, I truly loved this film. The Eurovision cliches are spot-on. Musical parts were extremely entertaining. You can truly see Ferrell's passion for the contest in his acting. He did a great job of revealing the entertaining part of Eurovision without making fun of it. Fantastic and a must-watch for every Eurofan!"

","This is a weird one if you don't enjoy the Eurovision Song contest, however, if you do enjoy it, you'll like this movie.

","I was only 5 minutes into the film where I had to rush to my social media accounts and tell people they needed to drop whatever they were doing and going to watch this film. Loved everything about it. One of Ferrell's best comedies, in my opinion, which I will cherish next to Anchorman. Loved the effort put in showcasing some of the nuances of life in Iceland. Ironically, the night before we had started watching ""The Valhalla's murders"" a Netflix drama detective series, but as it is set in the same city of H√É¬∫sav√É¬≠k including some of the interior sets, now I can no longer watch it with a straight face.√∞≈∏Àú‚Ä†
Enjoyed the chemistry between Ferrell and McAdams. And shout out to Croydon-born Dan Stevens whose character Alexander Lemtov gave me some of the biggest laughs and I'm sure it will do for everyone who can read between the lines.<br/><br/>Also...my 12 points go to:

","I knew the ratings on Rotten Tomatoes were low, but it stars Rachel McAdams, Will Ferrell, Dan Stevens and Pierce Brosnan, how bad can it be? So I saw it just for the cast and it's even worse than I was prepared for. What they writers had in mind could have been a satire of Eurovision, but it comes across as a parody of a parody, where the result is borderline caricature-esque. It's on Netflix, so no extra money wasted, but only give it a go if you don't fancy anything else."

","Will Ferrell movies are normally love or hate. I found this one lacking, but not terrible. The acting is okay and the jokes are very cliched, which is the point, but the problem is Will Ferrell is just being him, and without a great comedy partner, he's like Garfunkel without Simon, or Sonny without Cher.. He, by himself is not enough to make you laugh, he needs a good partner."

"themadmovieman","8","10","21","26 June 2020"," Eurovision fans will love it - a hilarious and loving mockery of the world's most insane singing contest
","I really can't believe I'm saying it, but I absolutely loved this movie. A bizarre adaptation of the annual festival of insanity Eurovision Song Contest, this is such a funny movie, complete with a delightful blend of all-out chaotic slapstick and loving mockery. Narratively and structurally, the film is a nightmare, but it's so much fun you'll struggle to notice at all.<br/><br/>But first things first: if you don't know what Eurovision is - then this film won't make a lick of sense to you. It is a funny comedy in and of itself, but the lovably chaotic fun factor of the movie really comes from its mockery and tribute to Eurovision and its many idiosyncracies.<br/><br/>On the flipside, if you're a big Eurovision fan (like myself), then you're going to love this movie. It gets the essence of the contest exactly right, not only in the way it makes fun of Eurovision, but also in the form of its musical numbers, costume design and more.<br/><br/>In all honesty, some of the songs in this movie are real toe-tappers - and far, far better than they have any business being in what I expected to be just a throwaway slapstick comedy.<br/><br/>Perfectly paying tribute to the annually chaotic song contest, The Story Of Fire Saga is filled to the brim with references, cameos and more to the best that Eurovision has had to offer, all the while poking fun at its most ludicrous characteristics - of which there are hundreds.<br/><br/>As a result, I was laughing my socks off all the way through this movie. A love and affection for Eurovision definitely goes a long way in enjoying this film, but beyond the way it mocks the contest so brilliantly, there are still countless hilarious gags throughout.<br/><br/>Though it stumbles in a fairly low-energy opening act, when the contest really gets into gear, this film steps up to a whole new level. It pounds with the same delirious and insane energy that the real life contest does every year, and it throws joke after joke after joke at you - creating a comic momentum that's totally irresistible.<br/><br/>Sure, the pacing may be all over the place, the screenplay might be predictable and structurally awful, and some of the songs might go on a bit too long, but such great comedic and musical energy hammering right the way to the finish, who really cares?<br/><br/>Eurovision Song Contest: The Story Of Fire Saga is as gleefully silly as the real-life show, and it knows it. So, while it's not a film to engross yourself in, it is one that will deliver two hours of solid laughter and, for Eurovision fans at least, a pitch-perfect adaptation of the irresistibly bizzare competition."

The storyline was just too predictable and rather meh. I did however, really enjoy the whole songs in this, especially when all the Eurovision winners gathered around at a party bursting a mix of Cher and other old skool tracks. That was pretty much it, I wouldn't call it the best tbh...."

","Eurovision is a wacky, cheesy, camp, cringe-making, over the top but also at times self-deprecating, funny, a bit wonderful - and always too long. And this film is all of those things. As a results it absolutely nails Eurovision.<br/><br/>It looks like Eurovision, the songs are very Eurovision, the presentations are exceedingly Eurovision. And what is great is that the EBU - who run Eurovision - made the film. This is Eurovision making a joke about Eurovision. And it really works.<br/><br/>Also there is a brilliant musical number midway through that includes several real winners and contestants singing a montage of Eurovision songs, which is brilliant on its own<br/><br/>It is both a homage to Eurovision and a spoof of Eurovision and as a Eurovision fan I loved it. Even if it is a BIT too long."

It's a kitschy and camp annual event that is roundly ridiculed by just about everyone in Europe and is never even heard of by the great unwashed in America<br/><br/>It's such a fine line between a funny movie and a dud. ""Blades of Glory"" had me rolling in the aisles but this one had me hitting the fast forward button every couple of minutes , trying in vain to get a chuckle. None!<br/><br/>Almost as bad as ""The House"" but really nothing could get as bad as that one, and the problem lands squarely in the lap of Ferrell.<br/><br/>He co-wrote the script (with another ex SNL alumni) and it's heavily borrowed from The House.<br/><br/>A very similar plot to ""Blades of Glory"" but it missed the mark by a wide margin.<br/><br/>Ferrell's penchant for showing us severed limbs and hacked up faces just doesn't come across as funny any more and he seems to want to use these tricks when the plot dips into a deep valley.<br/><br/>It's a pretty good premise to spoof the Eurovision Song contest but you've got to have some good satire and parody to pull it off and this just don't cut the mustard. The scriptwriters just ain't talented enough to draw the humour out.<br/><br/>I've said it before about other movies and I'll say it again about this one.<br/><br/>It's like watching a horse plowing a potato field, you know there's something happening but you're not interested enough to see what's going on.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes are so embarrassingly ""unfunny"" that they must have given the colorists extra pay to take out the red faces... just cringingly bad.<br/><br/>Netflix never listens to me ( or at least they haven't so far) but let me give the executive some advice.
Have someone check on the project during the process, someone to look at the rushes .. because it's obvious that nobody did .
If they had a quality control system then the plug would have been pulled on this bathtub of cold water, or somebody, somewhere would have said ""hit the reset button""<br/><br/>I know comedy films are very very hard to get right , it involves a lot of luck , a funny cast and a spoofable subject. This one only has one out of the three and you can guess which one it is.<br/><br/>Dan Stevens is pretty good , showing that he can shuffle off the typecasting from Downton Abbey, Rachel Mcadams is sometimes very difficult to look at.
As for Will Ferrell, well his SNL type humour is a thing of the past.<br/><br/>This movie comes across as one of those lame sketches on SNL , sketches that have you wondering how they made it on the screen.(and there's lots of 'em)<br/><br/>I just can't watch that show any more and I wouldn't be the first in line to re-watch this movie, that's for sure."

","People that have given this 9 or 10 Stars need their brains checking. Genuinely awful. Poor acting, dreadful storyline. I'm embarrassed to have sat and watched this sad excuse of a movie. Will Ferrell hasn't been in a decent film since Anchorman, and Rachel McAdams? No idea. Don't kid yourselves that this is a distraction during Lockdown.

","Sorry, no sale.<br/><br/>Yes, I know it's supposed to be goofy. Yes, it's Will Ferrell. And yes, Eurovision is over the top, and so it makes sense for the movie to be over the top, too.<br/><br/>But it doesn't work. The look of Europe is there, but the feel isn't. Iceland feels like a Disney ride. The jokes are not funny.<br/><br/>4 stars for the vistas of Iceland, Rachel McAdams, and a few good Eurovision songs, especially Salvador Sobral. (Too bad they didn't include better acts from earlier years, as 2019 was a bit anemic. Lordi, Anouk, Harel Skaat?..)"

"joshbarton15","6","11","27","26 June 2020"," Well worth a watch for Eurovision fans.
","The Story of Fire Saga is very silly, there's no doubt about that, but it doesn't feel as if it makes the most of being set amongst the infamous singing contest that has provided copious moments of entertainment over the years. Will Ferrell is as you'd expect Will Ferrell to be in a film like this while Rachel McAdams proves yet again that she belongs in more comedies. The songs are absolute belters and there are some very funny moments along the way however, it suffers from being a tad too long, comedies running for two hours or more will always find it hard to sustain the laughs. That being said, The Story of Fire Saga works too as a respectful love letter to the Eurovision Song Contest rather than the giant pisstake that I was expecting."

","I should have known.<br/><br/>Hollywood can't help it. It talks the big talk about being PC and woke, and then insults a nation with this. And it was sexist too. Making the female character a dumb doormat<br/><br/>Will Ferrel was funny. 20 years ago. Blades of Glory, Elf, Zoolander. But the jokes are 20 years old. He's blue steel.<br/><br/>If Sherlock Holmes was a low point, this was down there too.<br/><br/>Europe, And Iceland deserves an apology.<br/><br/>And the past contestants appearing in this should pause, reflect, and be ashamed."
"millerdaniel-36893","1","40","125","27 June 2020"," This is nothing short of terrible

","I could tell from the trailer of this movie already that it was going to be bad, but just how bad, I wasn't even prepared for. With a cast like Rachel McAdams and Will Ferrell, I was expecting at least a few laughs but this movie is just so very not-funny. I'm a fan of both these actors, but this movie was just plain bad.<br/><br/>The acting was OK, and I don't think that was the issue with the movie being un-funny, since we know that both actors can play funny roles... it just really comes down to the plot/story/writing being bad, and it's not the actor's fault.<br/><br/>I honestly can't recommend that you watch this movie, under any circumstances... Normally most movies would at least maybe be worth watching if you have nothing else to watch or if you just want to pass some time, but this movie isn't even worth watching if you've got nothing to do for 2hours... I'd recommend rather going outside and looking at the birds flying, or organizing your garage... This is honestly the least funny comedy movie I've watched in a long time."

THIS Will Farrell movie is definitely a ""hit"", I want to visit Iceland and the Elves, and Eurovision seems quirky and intriguing. This was a very funny, well-written, well-casted comedy. I watched it on the plane and had to keep myself from laughing out loud several times! I actually thought this comedy was brilliant. Loved Rachel MacAdams and her super cute character, and the Russian guy was perfect! Happy flick that was refreshingly non-preachy or political, just a lot of fun."
"huggie_g","8","5","10","30 June 2020"," Great mock-comedy
","The Eurovision is one of those things that almost seems like a parody in itself. This film does brilliantly to be humorous and ridiculous without going over the top.
It's an issue with plenty of Will Ferrell movies that it just becomes completely absurd and ends up being corny rather than funny.<br/><br/>The film has a very strong blend of ridiculousness with a strong plot line that isn't lost throughout. The assorted characters are well cast and add to the story fittingly.<br/><br/>Dan Stevens does a great job as a semi antagonist. Also playing a LGBT character without it being over the top and in your face. Hollywood has a habit of making LGBT characters ridiculously stereotypical to fit the ""appropriate"" casting rather than making a genuine character.<br/><br/>Overall it was highly enjoyable and ridiculous comedy. Would recommend"

","Will Farrell comes out of his bedroom in his latest role playing scenario that we are caught up into at whirlwind speed. As a lover of European music, I've watched a lot of Eurovision for a 30 yr old American. And Will nails it. I had the strangest sensation that this was like a sequel to the notebook for Rachel McAdams, she threw herself into this role in a delightfully complex way that plays really well off Ferrell's typically 2d comedic character which works amazingly well. Like, I actually connected with a will Ferrell character for once. And his dad was a stunningly well written character as well. Plus the numerous Eurovision contestant cameos and inside jokes are delightful."

The songs very accurately and in a funny way mimic the typical Euro-vision Song Contest music. They make fun of Icelanders and other Europeans in a very stereotypical and a bit inaccurate manner, but it is funny as hell, and I think almost all Icelanders will only find it funny and not at all be insulted. Recommended to all that love Eurovision and have the sense of humor to get somewhat ridiculed for it ;-)"

","Absolute grand slam of a movie. I really cant remember the last movie that I saw that brought me every emotion as Eurovision did. Rachel McAdams and Will Ferrell were absolutely breathtaking the whole movie and finished it off with one of the best performances ever. (Shout out to My Marianne for the singing) I will remember that 5 minute scene for the rest of my life as it brought me to the edge of my seat with goosebumps. Alexander Lemtovs character was absolutely perfect as the happy and charming Russian. With all of the negatives going on in the world right now this is something that will bring you joy, happiness, laughter, and take you on a great journey if you allow it to.<br/><br/>I would give it a 100/10 if I could."

Songs that could easily have been entered into the competition itself, cameos from some of the best Eurovision performers in the last couple of years and a wonderfully warm performance from Dan Stevens as a fabulous Russian with George Michael circa 1980's Wham hair. Will Ferrell perfectly plays the passion and enthusiasm that people have for the Eurovision, Capturing all the crazy but through a lens of absolute love and joy.

I am a HUGE Eurovision fan and have been for as long as I can remember - I am also a fan of Will Ferrell - this film has absolutely everything I ever wanted and more. It had so many familiar Eurovision faces, it poked fun at all the things we all poke fun about - such as getting a dig in about Russia, everyone hating the U.K. - there was a man in a wheel, scary mask wearing rockers, Graham making snarky comments and it was just as cheesy and fun as I expect Eurovision to be. Don't get me wrong - if you don't like Eurovision, Will Ferrell and you're expecting a film with an intricate plot line and a clever twist this film is not for you - but if you just wanna have fun and listen to some proper cheesy euro-pop tunes with a romantic, lovely story underneath then this is for you. It's just cheered me up so much in a time that's been pretty grim for everyone and if I could rate it higher I would! 12 points from me!"

They succeed on taking the chance to represent their country and now they have to prove to everyone that they can win.<br/><br/>I liked this movie because it had a simple, nice and very funny plot combined very well with some romantic scenes. For one more time Will Ferrell who played as Lars Erickssong was simply hilarious and his interpretation was very good. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Rachel McAdams who played as Sigrit Ericksdottir, Dan Stevens who played as Alexander Lemtov and Pierce Brosnan who played as Erick Erickssong, and they were all simply amazing.

It included some of 'The Big Five' countries (UK, Spain, Italy, France, Germany) as competing in the semi-final when they are all automatically entered into the final. I have to admit, it did annoy me a little bit. Otherwise I did enjoy the film. The songs were the type that you usually see in Eurovision. Graham Norton was his usual sarcastic self. His commentary is the best part of Eurovision every year and he was a great addition to the film.<br/><br/>Overall it wasn't a bad film. Sweet and full of heart. Enjoyed, just slightly annoyed by inaccuracies as already stated."

","Other than his Janet Reno impression on SNL, Will Ferrell is just not funny but I really wanted to like this movie. The cast is pretty good and it had great potential but it is predictable and full or recycled Will Ferrell gags that are getting old. Rachel McAdams is beautiful and I found her believable as an Icelander (though in all fairness, I have no idea what an Icelandic accent may sound like) and her lip-syncing is almost at a Milli-Vanilli level. That and the Eurovision contestants making cameos keep the movie from getting 1 star."

","I love the premise , I love Eurovision, and Will Ferrel's earlier comedies were some of my favorites. But outside of the cinematography and costumes, this was such a huge miss and disappointment on every level. It wasn't funny, or cute, or quirky, it was just a couple of has been actors mailing it in. Rachel McAdams delivered possibly the least convicing performance of a ""lead"" actress in a film, ever. I can think of 100 actresses who would have been better suited for the role, more believable... so what's going on behind closed doors? Will Ferrel is trying to be himself, and he's bored, not a character. The story of course isn't well executed, but I never expect much from a story in this satire/feel good/comedy movies - so don't take off points for it. Netflix continues to churn out absolute formulated garbage that has those with a semblance of an IQ wondering........ when will the movies be worth our time again?"
"EdwardNashtonReeves","7","7","16","26 June 2020"," Review from a long-time fan of the contest
","As someone who not only follows Eurovision, but also national finals and the events surrounding it, I was very curious on how this film would turn out. There are a lot of misconceptions about ESC, as well as many dated associations (for instance, overblown glitter and mockery has (mostly) been left in 2000s). I love Will Farrell as a comedian, even though his last film, Holmes & Watson, was indeed really bad. Thankfully, ESC: The Story of the Fire Saga fares much better. I'll break down my review in two parts. First, analyze it as a film on it's own merits. Second, to see how it looks like as an homage to ESC.<br/><br/>As a film, it's your standard story of an underdog dreaming big and seeking for approval. I found Lars, Farrell's character, slightly too selfish and rude to root for, but his partner Sigrid is much more likable. Farrell is still, as always, a very good comedic actor. Rachel McAdams really gives her best and easily gives one of the highlights of the film. The other standout is Dan Stevens as the Russian singer Lemtov. He was really enjoying himself and I liked how the film treated his struggles. Some of the plot-points were fairly predictable and tad generic to the genre of comedy. Some jokes were funny, but some felt a bit flat (his ''disliking'' of Americans, for instance). Interestingly, the inclusion of Icelandic folklore somehow works well. If Lars was more likable character, I'd enjoy his redemption arc even more. Sure, he does some right moves in the end, but I think some of his impulses are still tad selfish. Even so, I liked how they ''lost the contest, but won people's hearts''.<br/><br/>As an homage, it works okay. There are several inaccuracies of how the Eurovision, or Icelandic National final works, so here we go:
<ul><li>Semi-finals don't have a jury voting sequence. Only ten qualifiers are announced in random order to avoid knowing the presumed winner before the big night.</li><li>Spain, as a pre-qualified ''Big Five'' country would never be in the semi-final. Same would apply to the UK, Germany, France and Italy.</li><li>In the end, Lars comes on the stage and decides to change the song. In the actual contest, it would have been virtually impossible to do so, as all the music background is pre-recorded. They would indeed be disqualified for doing so, though.</li><li>Both the Eurovision stage and Songvakeppnin (The Icelandic national finals) stage look really small when compared to the actual stages of the last decade.</li><li>Songvakeppnin usually also has two semi-finals with six songs each.</li><li>There is an astonishingly low amount of security there, as Lars could just easily go inside in such a short period of time.</li></ul><br/><br/>There are also some things regarding the contest this film does right:
<ul><li>The songs chosen to stand-in ESC entries are pretty solid and with a slight shade of satire (which any good comedy should have) aren't implausible to see in the actual Eurovision stage. However, perhaps with the exception of Sigrid's final song, they would probably be considered too much of a gimmick to actually win. However, a top 10 result for Russia with televoting alone would be more than plausible.</li><li>Worth noting, the Belorussian band has a song and staging which is a direct nod to the winners of Eurovision 2006, Lordi (even though they were Finnish).</li><li>The Greek staging is heavily inspired by the staging of Moldovan representative of 2016, Lidia Isac and Ukraine's national final winner of 2019, Maruv.</li><li>There are some really nice cameos from previous Eurovision winners and contestants and are worth checking out. For instance, Portuguese winner of ESC 2017, Salvador Sobral, is featured as a street musician in Edinburgh, while his song, ''Amar pelos dois'' is playing (a hilariously mismatched song to the goofy plot which occurs during it). Also, previous contestants John Lundvik (Sweden, 2019), Elina Nechayeva (Estonia, 2018), Anna Odobescu (Moldova, 2019), Bilal Hassani (France, 2019), Jessy Matador (France, 2010) and winners Loreen (Sweden, 2012), Netta (Israel, 2018), Conchita Wurst (Austria, 2014), Alexander Rybak (Norway, 2009, also representing them in 2018) and Jamala (Ukraine, 2016) are featured in the party singalong scene.</li><li>British anchorman Graham Norton appears as himself and with pretty accurate sharp irony describes what he sees.</li><li>William Adams, the founder of Wiwibloggs, official Eurovision fan-site, also appears in the reporters' room.</li><li>Jon Ola Sand, the actual chief executive of the contest is featured in a cameo, but isn't played by himself. Still, a nice reference.</li><li>Even though nothing as huge as the hamster wheel (btw, a reference to Ukraine 2014) falling off stage did happen in Eurovision, there was an incident in 2018 where a stage invader interrupted the song of the British representative SuRie and she bravely continued to sing the rest of the song. It brought her huge respect in the ESC community.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, I did enjoy this film and I hope it brings Eurovision closer to the general audiences. I'd like if Lars' personality was a bit nicer. I'd also prefer if the cameos were a bit more scattered throughout the film and if they had actual characters to work on. Still, it's an enjoyable film on it's own and I would recommend it."
"barrycorr","10","3","5","2 July 2020"," So goofy and funny
","Yes it's goof-tastic but worth the watch.
Well researched with a couple of Eurovision gaffs.
To the uninitiated The Eurovision Song Contest is a Europe-wide song contest (erm that recently included Australia) and everyone votes. ABBA found fame from it.<br/><br/>Anyway...It's true that some Icelandic people believe in the little people!! A friend was there twice and confirmed this!
It's a little bit like Mama Mia on a budget!
If your stuck for a movie, watch this little gem."
"SnobReviews","4","3","5","1 July 2020"," Overly long with some funny moments.
","""Eurovision Song Contest: The Story Of Fire Saga"" has funny moments but running a little over two hours makes it hard to fully enjoy.
.
In this comedy, when aspiring musicians from Iceland are given the opportunity to represent their country at the world's biggest song competition, they finally have a chance to prove that any dream worth having is a dream worth fighting for.
.
I'm going to say it again and again, but the real buzz kill here was the run time. There were many scenes that could've been edited out and many scenes (especially the contest ones) were repeated over and over. Ferrell and McAdams were surprisingly good together. Rachel McAdams delivers a funny performance you don't often see her portray. The real scene stealer though was Dan Stevens as the Russian competitor; I'd watch a movie just about his story. Overall, a few funny moments, catchy songs, but way too long, making it an okay film.

"cristinasoulmates","6","3","5","30 June 2020"," A cute film with a lot of heart.
","* There is no end credit scene *<br/><br/>The director David Dobkin and crew brought a cute film with a lot of heart. The story is about two singers chasing their dreams to win the Eurovision contest. I keep re-watching the part at the beginning where they sing in the garage, loved it, and only the first seconds before he says Volcano Man, after this well its cheesy but before it's so powerful. I didn't felt this movie was aiming to get me to laugh but there were so many good humor lines. I like this kind of humor not too much and too little but it had too many cringe moments for my taste. The theme is clear as to always follow your dreams no matter what other people say. There were so many random moments in which were incredible making this film also kind of awkward in a very good way. The elves part was so adorable and fun, it made the story more magical. The song-along scene was the essence of this film, it gives the significance of unity.<br/><br/>The composer Atli √ñrvarsson brought sweet music and it goes well with this storyline because it keeps it honest and pure.<br/><br/>The cast was wonderful and it had two magnificent lead actors, Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams. Will Ferrell was also one of the writers, he is among my favorite actors, I love how serious he acts in a comedic atmosphere. Rachel McAdams another favorite of mine was the heart of this film, her character had a lot of sweet innocence and it made her enchanting how I loved to watch her sing. Their connection was so delightful and beautiful. I can't forget about Dan Stevens and Melissanthi Mahut, the ones who gave the film its intensity and spark with their performances."

After a tame start, the movie drastically improves.<br/><br/>The production quality is high.

Don't expect a masterpiece, but trust me, Will Ferrell is in his element, and the songs are actually pretty good. Just do yourself a favor and watch it, you won't regret it."
"rybfilm","9","3","5","29 June 2020"," Don't expect a Basic Ferrell comedy, wait for it!!!
","Everyone needs to watch this!! Best Will Ferrell flick since whatever you consider his last best one was (haha, I still love all his stuff, but for real, this one..) Be aware, it begins as more of a drama with comedic elements, not your basic Ferrell outing, and then picks up on every level and all the buildup pays off. Rachel McAdams is excellent and really gives the film the heart it excels with. Dan Stevens is excellent, funny but also has a real charisma and charm to what could be a one dimensional character. It's basically Pitch Perfect meets Norsemen meets Blades of Glory. Such a feel-good, underdog film that somehow treads a perfect line of ridiculous comedy, extremely relatable drama, and funny, yet catchy as hell pop-music. A rare gem that just works everywhere, but deserves patience in the beginning for the true payoffs."
"riis-tobias","8","3","5","29 June 2020"," While somewhat predictable a surprisingly pleasant watch

","If you are familiar with the contest - you would laugh from time to time. But be prepared - they are mocking everyone. And yes, it is still a stupid comedy - it is a rough parody, but it is pretty nice characters there. I really loved how they tried to express the core of the nations participants types in a comic way, of course.
I don't think this film will suit to those who don't follow Eurovision contest, so it is kind of narrowing it's target audience, but still, totally worth my time."
"jellybeanuk","8","3","5","29 June 2020"," Cheese at its best
","If you love the cheesiness of Eurovision then this is perfect for you. The songs are catchy, I defy anyone not to be singing yaya ding-dong afterwards. The story is funny and light. Eurovision isn't about serious musicians for me, its all about dodgy tunes, bad costumes and cheesy songs and I love it!!"
"Sign_Painter","6","3","5","29 June 2020"," A silly parody of Eurovision
","It's a silly comedy in the style of other Will Ferrell movies. However, if you want to really laugh out loud at times then you have to be somewhat familiar with the European Eurovision contest. Only then will it make much more sense and be that much more entertaining. This silly kind of humour is not my cup of tea and that is why my rating is only 6 stars, however the Eurovision parodic portrayal is spot on."
"blindsniper-85919","7","3","5","29 June 2020"," A very entertaining movie with some flaws
","This movie is the epitome of ""feel good"" movie. The music in it is surprisingly well done especially the song ""Husavik"" which was AMAZING. The acting was passable and the story was fun.<br/><br/>But it won't break new ground nor did it try too. The relationship was a bad point because Rachel McAdams tried to sell it but Will Ferrell didn't. The climax hurt because the relationship wasn't fleshed out. Much like the climax to him going back to Eurovision with that dad talk... oof, that fell flat too for me.<br/><br/>But everything surrounding that was amazing. I was very surprised on how much I enjoyed it and going in with very low expectation helped a lot."

"halcyonbear","8","3","5","29 June 2020"," Feel-good film with its heart in the right place.
","It's not the funniest or the most original film but I found this to be hugely entertaining and likeable. Both a tongue in cheek parody and heartfelt homage to Eurovision, it may be predictable, but it's predictable in the same sense that you know what your favourite cake is going to taste like, but you are still looking forward to eating it! Whilst there is a lot in here for ESC fans (cameos from ESC stars), it's something non-fans can enjoy too. My friend expected to hate it, but within ten minutes was completely won over. Two hours may seem long for a comedy, but I got caught up in the story and it didn't drag. Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams make endearing leads and have great chemistry as Lars and Sigrit, the underdogs who may not be as talentless as everyone thinks. Edinburgh looks great in the movie too.
My title for the review sums it up well. I can see this fast becoming my go-to feel-good film."
"thomasheaney","6","3","5","29 June 2020"," It is what it is... Cheesey, cringey fun
","By no stretch of the imagination is this a 'good' film, the plot and script are weak and the songs are not quite as funny as I had hoped.
Saying that though, this film is a lot of fun. A load of cameos, some cringey singing scenes, Jaja Dingdong, some interesting costumes and surprising disasters all create an entertaining experience, whilst also capturing the cheesey Eurovision feel.
Worth a watch, just don't expect too much from it."
"MovieNinjaGuy","9","3","5","28 June 2020"," Captures the heart, spirit, fun, cheese and most importantly the craziness of the Eurovision song contest perfectly.
","If you are going to do a movie about the craziest and biggest song contest in the world you better do it right. That's exactly what everyone involved seemed to have done.<br/><br/>Made by Will Ferrell's production company and the actual organisation behind Eurovision (The European Broadcast Union) so the research into the song contest came from the right place and everything seems very accurately executed and this is not something what you normally get from music related movies I find. There are indeed recently a few exceptions along with this film such as Bohemian Rhapsody which had a show-stopping perfect executed finale. Distributed by Netflix which sadly means there will not be a physical copy of the one movie that I think many big Eurovision fans will be passionate about.<br/><br/>The movie has a really decent background story (with a few iffy bizarre moments to be fair - but it is Will Ferrell movie after all). However the film seems to move along exactly at the speed required and hits all the beats that it needs to leave you satisfied at the end.<br/><br/>The movie has the unrequited love stuff, the trying to impress a parent thing, the missing of another parent, the inspiration of those who came before (mostly the Abba part at the start), the shock of a big event changing the stakes for the protagonists, the everything seems lost scenarios (several times), the help from a surprising source and the perfect wrap up and back to normality but with the prize in the protagonists' hearts and a bright future ahead + a new start. Good ingredients!<br/><br/>The quiet Icelandic fishing town setting, which is perfect, is the furthest one could get away from a show such as Eurovision. The stark contrast can be seen in both audio and visual beats. The shots of Iceland are beautiful. The atmosphere of Eurovision is convincing. When Will Ferrell is back in Iceland as time is running out before the Eurovision finale that contrast works particular well making you feel frustrated inside. Iceland is a country that still has to win the Eurovision song contest (although they've managed to get to second place twice) so it was a good choice.<br/><br/>Tonnes of appearances of Eurovision winners and contestants as you would expect and it is great fun spotting them in the middle musical mash up. The movie didn't come across as patronising at explaining who is who at all which is what a Hollywood movie would probably do.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell, Rachel McAdams and Pierce Brosnan all do a great job in their roles. Special mention to the extremely passionate and aggressive ""Ja Ja Ding Dong"" fan. Exactly the craziness that a movie like this needs. Executed perfectly. Graham Norton gave the movie some extra gravitas and authority and as a British Eurovision fan I wouldn't have wanted that any other way.<br/><br/>The film has a real feel good factor about it and it is very reminiscent of (and perhaps musically in a one place also inspired by) The Greatest Showman<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the song contest this movie will probably be on your repeat list for a while I would have thought. I can't wait to watch the entire thing again. A good lengthy production for this type of movie I should add.<br/><br/>The music is of quite a high production value and the songs really capture the beats one would expect from Eurovision. We have the craziness, the extreme cheese from Russia's entry executed really well by Dan Stevens and more heartfelt songs. It all seemed convincing. There is thankfully also that one show stopping moment/song towards the end that a movie of this type needed to sell itself. Ironically it harkens exactly back to where the protagonists came from in the first place rather than where they thought they wanted to be. Yes, the movie is more clever if you think about all that a bit deeper indeed.<br/><br/>A really enjoyable movie, simply a top job from everyone I reckon, all-round excellent entertainment and escapism.<br/><br/>For me the best thing Will Ferrell has been in and since he produced this himself (after he has been in love with the Eurovision song contest for 20 years) I have to say hats off to him, really (this coming from a Eurovision song contest fan for over 30 years).<br/><br/>In my book this would be an Oscar contender for best movie like The Greatest Showman should have been along with classic feel good movie winners such as Chicago, Slumdog Millionaire and The Artist. But those days sadly seem over. Ironically these are the movies that the world desperately needs right now. Hopefully this will still snatch best song Oscar for Husavik next year but I'm not counting on it.<br/><br/>If you like Eurovision, you cannot afford to miss this, especially this year. It has totally made up for the lack of a proper song contest show... but even more so I'd say."

I had very low expectations for this film, but then was drawn in by the brilliant small-town feel, where people went to grade school with the cops. The characters are generally noble, the story line has a few delightful plot twists, and some of the comedic view switches were hilarious.
Under the surface of this film were a few themes: the warmth of a tightly-knit small community and the multicultural nations of the world, the comparison of casual relationships versus lifelong friendships, and the value of perseverance, Viking style.
I can not stop singing Ja Ja Ding Dong.
This movie is enjoyable for guys and gals. Sigrit's character seemed to combine Julie Andrews (Maria), Meg Ryan (Sally), and Uma Thurmond (Beatrice). This movie is bringing."

By the end, I realized this movie was amazing and like the characters themselves, I was left stunned at the end.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams delivered a near flawless performance and I'd argue she's never shined as much as she does in this film. I won't spoil it but the last song of this movie is on a whole nother level and tugged at the heartstrings while also leaving me speechless.<br/><br/>This movie was emotional, funny, touching, uplifting, and just an all around pleasure to watch.

There are certain skits and bits in the movie that will only be funny to someone that has been following the Eurovision Song Contest and understand the true greatness of this show. Will Ferrel has been thinking about making this movie for 20 years, and he loves this show. He didn't just decide to make this movie because he needed the extra cash (although I'm sure he doesn't mind that either)
Yes, the movie is a bit long, but its nothing compared to how long the televised Eurovision Song Contest is, which is close to 4 hours and that's just the finals.

But this film is a lot of fun and one I could gladly watch again, and soon.

","There hasn't been much good news this year, but this film is part of that good news. It's honest, it is fun, it is beautifully acted and staged, and yes it is corny, but who cares! It is good clean fun, even if it is a bit on the long side. Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams are a match made in heaven. And the rest of the cast is great, especially Dan Stevens as the man you love to hate.
I am a little surprised that so many viewers thought that if you don't like the Eurovision Song contest then you might not enjoy this movie. OK, the main character is obsessed with Eurovision but on the basis of this film you have to think that maybe Icelanders are equally obsessed. But even if you don't like Eurovision you will love the songs, especially the heartfelt last song which Rachel McAdams sings so well, and the raw beauty of Iceland is a treat in itself which the camera crew clearly went all out to glorify."

I highly recommend this film as its fun, funny, and although played for laughs is not just a corny take on eurovision, as a lot of thought has obviously gone into portraying the acts in a genuine and amusing way-loved it ."

"jtindahouse","5","4","8","4 July 2020"," Ferrell's career continues to slide
","Age has really caught up to Will Ferrell unfortunately - and I'm not in any way talking about his looks. I'm talking about his acting ability and his ability to be funny. The man was almost indisputably the funniest person working in Hollywood a decade ago. These days he can go an entire film without getting a single laugh out of me. It feels like he plays it incredibly safe these days, preferring to lean on PG-13 movies and safe scripts. I understand it's a very difficult time to be a comedian with the world being so easy to offend right now, but I really wish people like him would just ignore that noise and get back to making the fabulous movies that he was in the 2000s.<br/><br/>Looking past the comedy, the movie didn't work for me as a narrative either. It was extremely clunky. There were many many scenes that could've (and should've) been left on the cutting room floor. Ferrell wrote this himself, and he's actually written some very fine scripts over the years, but this was not one of them. It felt like a kids movie, aimed at adults.<br/><br/>Everything that was great about 'Pitch Perfect' in terms of combining heart, humour and fun was missing here. The music was actually okay and probably the strongest part of 'Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga'. There were some catchy singles along the way that were a pleasure to have replace the clunky dialogue. Rachel McAdams actually went a long way towards saving the film too. She gives her best in every scene, despite her clearly knowing some of the things she was being asked to do were ridiculous and not going to come across well onscreen. It isn't enough to save this mess though. I can't recommend this one."

It helps that it's set around a music contest with pop stars who have big personalities and eccentricities. Definitely a feel good movie ( my boyfriend and I cried a few times lol).

","It's a sweet, charming film, carried in large part by Rachel McAdams' considerable charisma. Pierce Brosnan is also good in a small role as Will Ferrell's father (despite being only 14 years older than Ferrell). To me, Ferrell is the weak link. He is just growing too old for these roles -- his usual awkward man-child. He is eleven years older than McAdams and it shows -- he looks even older than his 52 years (probably 51 during filming). The character should have been only a few years older than McAdams and the film would probably have been well-served if Ferrell had kept to the writing and producing and given the spotlight to a talented younger actor."

If you go into this Netflix production with zero expectations like my boyfriend and I (because let's face it, with Will Ferrell flicks it's either a hit or complete miss), I'm sure most viewers will be pleasantly surprised. Of course it's silly and some scenes fall a bit flat, but there's also a good portion of heart and soul in there to balance it off. What I loved most was how it captures the ESC, being a parody in the best sense without being malicious. The jokes, the acts and the music (they even threw some sort of ""Lordi"" band in there), the costumes, everything was on point and let's face it, pretty accurate. Everything we love (or love to hate) about the ESC was highlighted basically.

This movie reminded me of what the competition is about; fun, over-the-top extravaganza and silliness, but also a lot of heart. Me and my wife laughed, teared up multiple times and we absolutely loved the whole thing!<br/><br/>The music (the MUSIC!!) is exceptionally well written and performed and fits the setting perfectly.

","Second hour is good, but hard to figure out what's the core of the first hour, seems just like a big tourism ads for Iceland and Europe. in my opinion, no matter what background a movie has adopted, the key of storytelling should focus on the complexity between characters that connects with the backgroud, for example, Ferrary vs Ford, we barely know the sophistication of F1 racing but the movie really didn't talk about F1 racing much. It's really unnecessary to film so many content about the contest which is easily accessable on internet. and you can notice that some emotional scene was cut too short, maybe because too many useless view and Eurovision content."

Several past ESC winners show up in cameos, Graham Norton (as usual) is brilliant, but really the best performance of all goes to Dan Stevens (of Matthew Crawley fame). He plays the ego-driven superstar who is alternately lovable and also despicable; really enjoyed watching him in this. If you can stomach > 2 hrs of Ferrell's absurdities and over-the-top exaggerations, and if you have any appreciation for the madness that is the ESC, you'll certainly enjoy this movie.

There is only 1 criticism that I have with the movie and that is I really don't feel that they needed to have the crass humor, the movie was funny enough without them. I absolutely love the songs and especially the voice of Molly Sanden. Rachel Addams was lipsyncing. Molly Sanden's voice was haunting and sent a chill through my whole body, it was super.

Her Smell is an exception, and this is another, but I usually don't like movies of the ""Zoolander-type"" (no offense to Zoolander).<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams was the best person they could've got for this role. I'm literally trying to think of someone else who could've done an alright job, but just can't. After I saw Game Night, I think I wrote in my review for that movie that I thought they should use McAdams in more funny roles (since she was great in that), so it was a nice little surprise seeing her in this.<br/><br/>The song for the contest is awesome. It's like ""Never Enough"" in The Greatest Showman.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast did an exceptional job as well, especially Pierce Brosnan and Will Farrell.<br/><br/>I didn't even know about this movie until the day it came out, oddly enough. Netflix should really have a section that shows just the AAA movies they added since your last visit, since that's all I'm really interested in (big budget, polished, unique, movies like this).<br/><br/>Along with Black Mirror, Unsolved Mysteries, and Disenchantment, and movies like this, Netflix has most of my favorite content now (HBO now comes in second place, in my mind -- they've been too hit-and-miss lately).

The main thing that brings this movie down is the story in between the songs. If this movie was 90 minutes I think it would be much better, but instead we get these drawn out conflicts that we all know the ending of and all we can do is just wait for them to resolve it and sing another fantastic song.
I would still recommend this movie if you want something stupid and fun, but not much else.

"gallopman","7","2","3","26 June 2020"," Eurovision works in spite of itself...
","This new offering from Netflix is a weird, wacky romcom starring Will Ferrell, Rachel McAdams and Pierce Brosnan.<br/><br/>While this movie never really treads new ground, it steadily reels you in largely because of the three leads. Ferrell and McAdams play two grown childhood friends who sing together as a duo/band with aspirations(mainly Ferrell's) to hit the big time and make it to a singing competition in Europe called Eurovision. McAdams happily does most of Lars' bidding because she's not so secretly in love with Lars. Truth be told, she's a far better singer than Lars by an Icelandic icy mile(I have no idea what that means). But, it's Lars' ambition that propels them to keep it through gigs.
They both decide to enter into an Icelandic singing contest that's sort of regional qualifier for Eurovision. Through some tragic, but funny plotting they both find themselves in the big show as it were.
Once in Eurovision they find they're just small minnows in a pool of big time sharks, hungry sharks at that. Enter the lusty, sexually disoriented Russian pop heartthrob Lemtov, lustily and tongue in cheekily played by Dan Stevens of Downton Abbey Fame. Now, we've all seen the plot mechanics where situations arise that place our heroes in romantic peril. This flick also mines that well trodden territory as well.
That said, this is where all of a sudden something strange takes place. The movie creeps up on the viewer and makes them start rooting for Sigrit and Lars. So much so, it's quite perplexing to figure out. That's why as someone who's seen countless RomComs, I whole heartedly must recommend this film because towards the last third of the film you actually care for the main characters and the entirety of their whole Icelandic crew. I think you'll find this weird kinship with how Icelanders must feel about their country and their little corner of the world. 7 stars..."
"jesuseduardo-83998","2","8","21","28 June 2020"," Eurovision being cancelled is not the worst thing, but this is
","Ive been a fan of the ESC since 2008 and I have a good understanding of what Eurovision is. Once I heard this movie was coming out I got very excited, until I found out will Ferrell was appearing in it, and as the main character... I was expecting a big amount of screaming nonsense by Ferrell for most movie and boy, was I right... Pretty much he is in all of the scenes, hoarding the screen time with dull conversations that don't go anywhere. I felt really cringey the whole movie.. But that's not the worst,
there is more.. I believe the way xenophobia is exploited in this movie is quite big, the main Icelandic character screams (no shocking there) at Americans and telling them to go back to their country.. Now, I dont know anyone from Iceland but I'm guessing they are not particularly filled with hate towatds tourists.. I'm giving a 2 out of 10, only for 2 particular reasons: the sing along from former contestants was actually fun and enjoyable, (I wish they would have made thus a musical type of movie instead) and the 2nd reason : the songs and performance from a few countries were really cool to hear, specially the swedish one.. kudos to them... Now, going back to the main actors of this movie: I wish anybody else would have taken the Male role, Ferrell didn't convince me not even one in any of his multiples repetitive scenes that he was Icelandic or an Eurovision performer.. and Rachel, I wish they could have use her in a way to address the impossible love story between the Russian performer and Kevin Swain, now, that story caught my eye right away, but we didn't hear most of it.. overall a great idea and mediocre results.."

","GRADE: C+<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: Entertaining but light-weight comedy about dreaming your dream.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga is a very long title for a very long movie. The film is a goofy and slight satirical comedy. Its easy target is an international song competition that promotes pop ditties representing various countries with lavish staging, pyrotechnic effects, and garish costumes. Call it a underdog story or an amusing Rocky rewrite with purposely bad music.<br/><br/>Written by Andrew Steele and one of its stars, comedian Will Ferrell, the film tells its Icelandic tale of a middle age loser named Lars Erickssong whose dream it is to win the Eurovision contest, the musical equivalent of a vocal Olympics Game. His singing partner is Sigrit Ericksd√É¬≥ttir (a very winning Rachel McAdams), who, for some unknown reason, idolizes her bandmate. Their pairing is an imbalance, not only script-wise but as an acting team.<br/><br/>The movie is silly fun, although, Mr. Ferrell is miscast in his own script. The actor does have some nice sight gags and pratfalls, but most of the time he belabors his character and lets his performance go off kilter. He plays Lars as if he is still performing on a SNL skit. There is no real chemistry or depth of character here and it's hard to believe his ""middle age status"". (He is a bit long in the walrus tusk for this role.) In all honesty, his performance simply lacks the light comedic charm needed to pull off this part and he weighs down all the joyous buffoonery from others in the cast. The miscasting is very obvious as he acts opposite the talented Ms. McAdams, who has a natural flair for comedy. She is a perfect fit, almost a 10. Also providing humorous moments are Pierce Brosnan as Lar's disapproving father and Dan Stevens as the narcissistic Russian crooner.<br/><br/>Actually, the best parts of the movie are the snippets of the half-baked musical numbers. These fleeting moments are on-target spoofs with the typically over-produced staging and sexualized performances gyrating in full satirical view. Highlighting these scenes would have made a much funnier film. The filmmakers should have considered making this intriguing concept as a mockamentary instead of the formulaic rom/com that it is. If they had focused more on the outrageousness of the competition and shown the musical entries in their entirety, leaving out much of the predictable story, the movie would have been more laugh-out-loud funny than merely diverting fodder.<br/><br/>Directed by tongue-in-cheek ill reverence by David Dobkin, Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga barely makes the semi-finals."
"halseyalison","9","1","1","7 July 2020"," so bad, makes it so good
","It is brilliant, it has big belly laughs and huge cringing moments.
if you are a european, you will watch this and totally understand it and the humour behind it, if you are american, you may not fully understand the humour.
it is a must watch for the really wonderful cringe moments.
the characters are fab, they take everything we have seen and heard for i don't know how many years and and make us laugh. it will never put any of us watching eurovision, in fact it gives us the excuse to watch it and party more."
"pepeksz","8","1","1","7 July 2020"," Great ode to Eurovision and Scandinavia.
","I was a bit scared at first. I believe many of us have an understanding of Ferrel's movies and how they are usually broken into two groups: the ones that are 'hit and miss' (The House, Semi-pro, The ladies man, Get hard etc.) and the ones that are hits (The Other Guys, Stepbrothers, Talladega Nights etc). For some this is a blurry line, for some this is the same type of movies, and for others (like me) each mean something very different and often something special too. So I was eager to see what category this movie falls into.<br/><br/>Disclaimer:
It is important to point out that those that have been following Eurovision for years, often entire lifetimes, will see and identify with things that those who have never heard of let alone seen Eurovision will have trouble with understanding.
Also, I am Danish, and as many of my Scandinavian neighbors might agree with me, we have our own special connection with Eurovision. What is more, as the two main characters are Icelandic, it is naturally very easy for Scandinavians to identify with these characters and the cultures they portray.<br/><br/>Review:
I was eager to see what type of Ferrel movie this is but other than that I had zero expectations going in. It was laugh out loud funny. It was a silly movie, just like any other Ferrel movie would be. However, it was, great ode to Scandinavians not taking themselves too serious, the Eurovision song contest, to the singer's choreography, songs, theme of songs, subject matter all clicked with how the actual Eurovision would go down. Believable participants and solid story that somehow neatly fits with what Eurovision is all about. Well worth a watch to any that has had Eurovision in their lives at one point or another."

","Not my words, but what Rachel McAdams said on her press tour about Eurovision itself. She would never be so self centered to claim that about the movie or herself.

An explosion that is quite horrible (with body parts flying around), is being made fun of. This obviously is not for the faint hearted or easily offended or squeamish. If that is not something that is applicable to you and your humor alligns with that of the movie - there is quite some fun you can have. With a mesmerizing Rachel McAdams - in case I hadn't made that point clear already. Will Ferrell is nice too, but she (and even Dan Stevens as ""Russian"") steal the show - no pun intended!"

In the end, of course, they overcome all the obstacles that really matter, and it's an enjoyable ride along the way

I was only minutes into the movie when I found myself laughing. A lot.

Its full of insider jokes and observations with many guest appearances from real eurovision. It does pack a lot in although why they chose Edinburgh as host City whilst joking correctly the Brits never win! The amazing theatre used is from Israel so why not base it there?<br/><br/>I didn't get the anti american thing either.

But the song Sigrit sang in the actual competition is brilliant. Apart from being a funny film I actually found it quite moving and had a headache at the end from trying to control my emotions and not get laughed at by my wife for crying at a comedy film.<br/><br/>It is a classic loser underdog who comes good in the end film. And a love story. And a comedy film. And a great observational film on the Eurovision; it captures the quirkiness of the competition brilliantly. I can also see why Icelandic folks would love it; I would if I was from Iceland. Made me want to go visit. And I will again be supporting them when they are next in the World Cup competition.

I liked this movie very much. It's very noticeable how much fun the cast had while doing this movie, and it's super contagious.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is not the most faithful adaptation of the ESC, and you should know that going in to it.
But most of the songs sound like they could appear in the ESC and their staging is very faithful to how Eurovision usually looks, and I'll admit that the last time Fire Saga sung (you know which song) it actually hooked me. I'd love to buy the soundtrack of this movie.<br/><br/>Yet, it is not without its faults. The movie is riddled with weird cuts, deus ex machinas and plot holes, and the third act is utterly insane.
But then again, so is the ESC, and that is what we all love about this show. The cringeworthy hosts and numbers, the ridiculous middle acts etc. - and it is kind of poetic how the movie portrays that in a way, intended or not."
"piperjake","7","1","1","3 July 2020"," 2hrs3m of confusing Americans
","Firstly, before I have even watched the film, I absolutely love the audacity of its existence. Literally no one asked for Eurovision 'The Movie', and yet what a strangely great premise for a story. I liked this even more upon learning that Will Ferrell himself is a big fan of the contest, and was a major hand in getting this film from paper to living room TV.<br/><br/>I feel that I should pre-empt this review by stating that I watch Eurovision religiously every year, and that the date is CLEARED from my diary as soon as I learn it. The film itself does a pretty good job at explaining why Eurovision is so popular - the whole thing is a caricature of itself, and I love that Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga continues this tradition. From the get-go, it knows exactly what it is and should be - cheesy, campy and over-the-top. Eurovision was wise in seeing its own indulgence and being able to self-deprecate for a large portion of the movie, which I fully commend. Being directed by David Dobkin, who appears to have directed mainly music videos, was probably a good choice for these reasons. Also, the fact that the film has a subtitle makes me think...is this the start of a saga?! Forget the MCU, from now on I'm attending midnight screenings of the ECU...<br/><br/>After Holmes & Watson (2018), things could really only go up for Will Ferrell, and this film has its fair share of welcome Ferrell-esque slapstick and humour. As with his other films, some of the quips fall flat and some tickle you for hours after the credits have rolled - it's always a mixed bag. Unfortunately, Eurovision had a few more duff notes than you would usually find, but thankfully the film moves on quickly enough to forget about it, unlike films by a certain Sandler that often crack a joke and leaves silence after it as if it's a comedy set, but even the tumbleweed doesn't feel like interrupting.<br/><br/>I digress.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the annual contest, the inclusion of a few familiar faces is a nice touch. The effort gone into the production is truly commendable - I'm told that a full song was written and performed for every country that would usually compete in Eurovision. The ironic thing is that pretty much every song heard could quite easily pass as a winner of the contest. The 'song-along' (essentially glorified music video/karaoke) about halfway into the runtime was a fun little showcase, however did feel a little shoehorned in for the sake of a single to release with the film. Upon checking Spotify after, my hypothesis was confirmed. This could have been done better and be less incongruous with the pacing.<br/><br/>The, for lack of a better word, 'villain' was a little bit of a concerning choice for me. Of all of the European countries to choose from for a 'bad guy', they decided to go for... yep, you guessed it! Russia. It really is a lazy film trope in 2020, made even more of a bizarre choice when the 'booing' incidents of Eurovision 2014 and 2015 are still fresh in the minds of many. Casting a person from the UK as the villain might have been a funnier choice and a little more tongue-in-cheek as, and I quote the film itself, ""everyone hates the UK"".<br/><br/>I was told by a friend before watching this film that if I like Blades of Glory (2007), I'll enjoy Eurovision 'The Movie'. Perhaps this kept the memory of Chazz Michael Michaels fresh in my mind, but I couldn't help noticing the almost uncanny similarities between the two films throughout my viewing. For starters, both films feature Will Ferrell with long hair and a big personality, and not to mention explore the subject of underdogs in a big competition. However, even the smaller plot beats match scene by scene - one conversation that includes characters that may or may not have had sex with each other for the sake of sabotaging a rival duo could have been stripped word-for-word from Jimmy MacElroy for all I know. Yes, if it ain't broke then don't fix it - but also try not to create a carbon copy that ends up being inferior to the original!<br/><br/>Wow. I've really written all this on a movie in which Graham Norton stars as himself. Regardless, everyone needs a feelgood movie from time to time, and truth be told, this movie made me smile a lot in a time when doing so is quite a rarity - and there's nothing wrong with that, right?<br/><br/>Very much enjoyable Ferrell-style-flick. 7 stars.<br/><br/>EDIT: It's the day after I've watched the film and I have listened to nothing but the soundtrack, so they must have done something right in that department. It's definitely filled my Eurovision-shaped hole in 2020."
"catrionawatsonbrown","7","1","1","2 July 2020"," A couple of hours of pure, silly escapism
","Is this movie cheesy? With some plot holes? Yes and yes.
Did it offer me and my family a couple of wonderfully silly hours with laughs, cringes and the sort of songs that only Eurovision can offer? Yes, yes and yes!
Will Ferrell (whom I'm not normally a fan of) was great as the Eurovision-obsessed Lars, Rachel McAdam was sweet as the talented but naive Sigrit, and Dan Stevens was a revelation as Alex, the '100% not gay' Russian. I know neither Rachel nor Dan sang their own songs, but it was pretty good lip-synching!
With minimal bad language, no violence (apart from the hamster wheel and the baddy getting knifed by the elves) and no nudity (though there were a few slightly risqu√© references to Will Farrell's 'ding dong'), this was a film we could enjoy as a family and came away joyfully singing 'Ja Ja Ding Dong' (which my daughter (unsuccessfully) tried to put on my phone as a ringtone).
Ignore the critics. If you approach this in the same way as you would Eurovision itself, you'll have a blast."

The jokes and references were on point. The songs were really good, and I know I'll be listening to the album later. This could be an annual viewing essential for those Eurovision parties!"

"edwoodscorp","10","4","9","30 June 2020"," I Hate Eurovision !!! and LOVE ""The Story of Fire Saga""
","I had reached the bottom of the ""Lock-Down"" barrel. So I threw caution to the wind and set to watch the movie.
Immediately the opening sequence lay the plot before me. A bereaved child is lit up by ABBA and ""Waterloo"", his childhood BFF joins in with his father trying to stop his son in this ""Non Macho"" act of embarrassment to him. Lars sets his and Sigrid's future declaring to his fathers friends and family that one day he will win the ""Eurovision""
Like any good book I was hooked within the first pages. In classic Will Ferrell style the story expanded to this hapless character and his childhood BFF (who is clearly in love with Lars). Their dream to become Eurovision winners in their hearts.
Needless to say the path is not an easy one, the story flows seamlessly and hilariously forward.
I found myself lifted in scenes, close to tears of laughter and sadness. This movie is totally unexpected and yet also so predictable but the journey is what makes it.
This will I assure you become a timeless classic."

"Barnton_K","9","4","9","30 June 2020"," Will Ferrel doing Will Ferrel.
","Whether you enjoy this film or not depends entirely on how you feel about Will Ferrel because he does what he does in every film - plays a developmentally-arrested man-child. He's like AC/DC - it works so keep doing it - nobody wants to see AC/DC doing an unplugged session or a jazz album.<br/><br/>Personally I find him hilarious so I loved the film. Plot-wise, despite being totally formulaic, it somehow still managed to ramble. You could tell what was going to happen and what the ending would be but none of that mattered because Will Ferrel's hilarious. Rachel McAdams is excellent and a perfect match for Ferrel's 'naive dreamer' shtick - romantic fools that you can't help warming to.<br/><br/>If you like Will Ferrel, you'll like this film.

And he did a great job capturing the contest, a love story, family conflict, and a true underdog story people actually care about. I thought it was delightful. The music was catchy. The last song was AMAZING. Rachel McAdams was on point. It's definitely the best movie I have seen in 2020. So let's give credit where it is due.

The supporting cast was good as well.<br/><br/>As someone who had never seen Eurovision, any little inaccuracies or creative license didn't matter - in some ways it's meant to be irreverent - though one BBC music reporter found dissecting it's inaccuracies worthwhile so if you are a stickler for accuracy and details you might cringe a bit. It's a goofy movie - loaded with little gags - perhaps not quite to the level of Elf - but anyone who usually enjoys a Will Farrell movie, will like it.<br/><br/>The tempo of the production kept things moving along so it didn't feel like a 2 hour film. The music was goofy where it needed to be and half decent elsewhere. We've probably seen this all before in general but the familiarity is part of the appeal.<br/><br/>As pure fun entertainment and no thinking, it's better than average but not an instant classic.

Here he is determined to represent Iceland in the Euro-vision Song Contest.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is less Will Ferrell than he normally is and shares the spotlight with Rachel McAdams who is very good.<br/><br/>The characters are entertaining enough and they make a cute ugly-couple.
The comedy is a warm and fuzzy pastiche of the contest in the whole and pokes around at some national stereotypes - all in good humour.<br/><br/>Most is spot on: half the fun of watching Euro-vision as a Brit is to see the U.K flop and then spend the next day moaning about it.<br/><br/>At one point it felt like the film was coming to a head so I paused to grab a cup of tea and was alarmed to see there was over an hour left.
I was barely half way through!<br/><br/>This is my gripe with this film.
It is much too long.
There are only so many ways you can depict Scandinavians as reserved, polite and naive before it gets boring.<br/><br/>This film should have got in and out before you could think too hard about it but it massively over stays its welcome.

Dan Stevens is great, and Graham Norton as the Eurovision commentator is a perfect fit as well. Lots of big laughs, dumb humour (in the best way possible), and fun music, this is light and funny and uplifting."

","Will Farrell movies in the last 10 years have not been the greatest. I think many people were expecting that to be the case here. The movie certainly had some campy parts and it's far from perfect but I was pleased that it actually was good. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish, it was a fun ride!<br/><br/>The movie does feel slightly too long and yes some of the accents aren't all that great but overal it's not a bother.<br/><br/>Enjoy the movie, it's worth a watch."

","I didn't know if I would like this movie. As an European and someone who has watched a lot of Eurovision without being a hard core fan, I kind of liked it. I appreciated they used a good amount of Icelandic actors, I enjoyed the musical part of it and all the silliness that is Eurovision in itself. I didn't real mind the accents either and I thought Rachel Adams was great. If you enjoy Eurovision and just want to watch some light fun I would recommend this."

","The movie is alright. It has some really nice moments. Will Ferrel is always funny and Dan Steven brings alot to this movie that jokes about this somewhat strange European phenomenon that is Eurovision and some fun political punches to countries and people who doesn't accept that people are of different beliefs, sexualities, origins and more.<br/><br/>Now its not amazing but hey its worth the watch. And they even use the cheap trick of music where a powerful song can wrap up most anything and whatever happened before it still feels quite alright afterwards. Cause the song Husavik is a really powerful ballad that could to be honest. maybe it should win the Eurovision."

I did like some of the Eurovision caricature's which again were quite good, but then they arrive in Edinburgh & the auto tune kicked in & it lost me from there. However, it does slightly redeem itself towards the end, Rachel McAdams gives a great performance & the film is bookended by 'Ja Ja Ding Dong'... so gets a 3/5 for that."

(I blame the writers but also blame his for excepting such a bad role) A stupid character which really doesn't make you feel sorry for him.<br/><br/>Some good scenes though when you get an array of previous winners sing together, probably the highlight of the film - other than that, a waste of time."

","I'm a long time fan of the Eurovision Song Contest, and it's nice of Will Ferrell to make a movie about it. But it really is a bad movie. I liked seeing the previous participants (of recent years) and he got the gist of the contest down. However, the story was a bit to far fetched for me and it didn't do much for me humour-wise. I guess that's just me not really enjoying Mr. Ferrells type of comedy. I did laugh, but mainly it was hard to watch and a good half an hour to long."

Any pierce Brosnan makes a movie worth watching but with a very believable Rachel McAdams and Dan Stevens coupled with enjoyable music throughout, it is elevated even more.
Will Ferrell may be a tad too old for this role but his relentless anti American quips made up for it.

If you've seen the bizarreness that is eurovision and the music, culture and art that comes from Europe then there's plenty of clever detail in this to make you laugh. I loved the clothes choices, the hair, the mannerisms language and accents.
It was very european and didn't go so much for the slapstick and nasty.
Even for Will Farrell who often does work in those tones this was something quite subtle.
The musical numbers were very well done and impressed while making fun of the topic. They were excellent examples of the things they were parodying and were pulled off with style. The Lyrics were hilarious.
Yes it was cringe humor, but it was done with style, heart and affection for the topic and people."

Anyway, after watching a dutch tv reporter (I'm Dutch) said that he'd never seen such a bad movie, as a big Eurovision fan I wanted to see for myself if that was true.<br/><br/>And it's not. The movie isn't that bad. It actually, when Sigrit sings her song in the finale, brought tears in my eyes. The title of the movie says it all: Eurovision Songcontest and if you're a Eurovision fan this movie us a must see. And Will Farell? The role of idiot becomes him.

There's few inconsistencies.
1. People would not laugh at the chosen artists if the rest of the competitors would have died in an explosion.
2. Husavik is located in the northernmost part of Iceland, which takes around a day to get there by bus, and around an hour to get to Reykjavik Airport, from which Lars would need to transfer to Keflavik Airport - which is around 40min if travel.
3. Flight to Edinburgh takes around 2:30hrs
4. Icelandair doesn't fly to Edinburgh, but Glasgow,
5. To commute from Glasgow to Edinburgh takes around 1hr
6. Lars would have not make it to get to the contest considering that he left Husavik in the afternoon"

The film did a great job in capturing this in a parody but also showing the little things that still make the ESF worth wild. It's rapped up in a story about love, friendship, trust and overcoming everything life throws at you because you just need to reach your potential. Rachel McAdams and Will Farell do a fantastic job in portraying two sweet and innocent people with big dreams and big hearts trying to maintain their integrity in a world determined to take them down.

We used to gather around the television, and kept our own scores, as it went on for hours on end. I've fallen asleep so many times! My first viewing was without colour TV, so it was in black and white. And we used to buy the Grand Prix cassette tapes later on. It's a crazy show, with often crazy costumes and sometimes crazy songs. You laugh and you cringe, but sometimes you get amazed by a truly awesome song. Norway lost so many times and we all cringed, but the times we won were truly wonderful! It's not unusual to throw a party the night of the Eurovision Song Contest with that as a theme.

"gazzalodi","7","0","0","5 July 2020"," Will Ferrell is himself, Rachel McAdams shines
","Will Ferrell always plays a doof, no matter his characters background or nationality they will be a doof. Sometimes good, sometimes cringe inducing. Lars is one of his more mild ones so the movie was not as terrible as it could have been. Rachel McAdam's Sigrit is the star of this show for me. The humor from her isn't about playing a fool, more like playing an innocent who tries to see the best in people and her running gags are never overdone. I would have rated this much lower if not for her. The supporting cast, including former Eurovision participants is serviceable and is a benefit to the film as well. After living a good part of my adult life in Europe this brings on a bit of nostalgia. If you can stomach Will Ferrell you will enjoy this. If you don't like him this film won't change your mind."

","Okay, first of all, a couple of disclaimers:<br/><br/>1. I am european, and have been watching Eurovision SC until 2011. I stopped watching because it stopped being about songs, and started being about politics<br/><br/>2. I am not a Will Ferrell fan. I usually don't enjoy his comedy type.<br/><br/>The review:<br/><br/>When I first saw the ""Volcano Man"" video, I thought that I should probably see this movie. I haven't seen a good comedy in ages, so I kind of hoped to get surprised.<br/><br/>Fast forward to today, and I started watching it, with no hopes whatsoever. Just the usual ""let's spend two hours"" mindset. I can say right here that I was surprised. The movie was a very fun watch - it had just enough comedy, drama and music. Nothing seemed forced, and all the Eurovision references were awesome to see/hear!<br/><br/>I love the lesson the movie is trying to send into the world, and hope that as many people as possible will actually understand what it is - music should be the no. 1 priority of not only this contest, but all music-shows around the world.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the movie was quite emotional from time to time. They nailed the 'humanity' part of it, and I loved every second of it.<br/><br/>I understand that the IMDB score isn't as high as it should be. Many people, especially americans, have no actual idea what the Eurovision Song Contest is, and how much it used to mean for European music, so for them this is probably less interesting and fun.<br/><br/>
As I said in the title, they should make a franchise, and each sequel should follow another European country on their path to the ESC."

Even for someone who does not watch any reality shows like the voice, etc. (that's me, too). It's really quite fun.<br/><br/>I'm sure someone who is well-versed in the Eurovision universe will probably enjoy it more... get all the insider jokes and such. But it was a great way to spend a few hours during a lonely holiday weekend (July 4) .<br/><br/>I actually laughed out loud a few times - once when Lars yells out the line I use for the subject of this review, and again (and several times) when he makes fun of the americans (what he says is really quite pointedly accurate).<br/><br/>This movie reminds me a bit of Momma Mia, a bit of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. Both are movies I enjoy and which make me happy.<br/><br/>I am an ABBA fan. And the very beginning makes my heart skip a few beats Silly me, being a dull american I didn't realize ABBA has some sort of history with Eurovision.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you are looking for something fun to watch, here you go. Don't worry if you are clueless (like me) about Eurovision. You'll still like this. It's funny, emotional, romantic, cynical, and lyrical. A little something for everyone.<br/><br/>I guess I don't give it a perfect score because something really needs to blow me away to get a 10 and this does not do that. It also is a little long... not a problem on the (sic) lonely holiday weekend during the pandemic, but (and again) there you have it.<br/><br/>PS it was nice to see Mikael Persbrandt.

","This is one of those films where you can't help wear a smile while watching it (aside from the times when it tugs at the heartstrings and draws a tear or two). It's just one of those films that's so tongue in cheek, full of life and joy you can't help but love it.<br/><br/>I was very sceptical of this film going in, not sure whether the satire would be too much, making the film ridiculous and cringey, but I could not be more wrong. It was absolutely spot on! Now that I think of it Eurovision is so ludicrous, outlandish and lavish anyway one would have to try quite hard to go over the top with it. There was a lot of care attention in this film to recreate the live Eurovision shows, as well as the songs. I'd be lying if I said I haven't had them on repeat since watching, its a genuinely great soundtrack with some amazing songs on it. Another huge surprise from this film.<br/><br/>The characters felt so Eurovision, and its clear that all the writers, producers and directors did their homework on the bizarre behemoth that is the Eurovision Song Contest. I found myself really invested in their relationship and their story arc, yet again another surprise to come out of this!<br/><br/>One thing that wasn't a surprise was the performances. Will Ferrell is a comedy goliath so its no surprise that he smashed this role. As a Eurovision fan himself I think he pitched his performance perfectly. I think he was actually eclipsed by Rachel McAdams though! She was amazing in this film, so funny, emotional and charming. Dan Stevens as well played a blinder as the Russian entry.<br/><br/>This film is an absolute treat to watch. A tongue in cheek love letter to Eurovision which will leave you grinning ear to ear!"

What I did not expect was for the songs to be actually good. Granted, it's impossible to take Will Ferrell singing seriously, but the music in this movie was a actually good. Especially the finale song in the Eurovision contest performed by Rachel McAdams.
Any movie that you mix a lovable Will Ferrell with a stunning Rachel McAdams, you are bound to have success no matter the story. This movie does not compare to the Likes of Step Brothers or Talladega nights, but unlike those it is considerably cleaner and perfect for a Netflix movie night. 6/10 (solid for a goofy comedy) would recommend!"

","After seeing the reasonably high rating on IMDB for this film, I figured I was in for a Will Ferrell comedy up there with Anchorman (which really grew on me quite a while after first seeing it), with a lot of laugh-out-loud moments. After watching it though, I feel that the high reviews must have been due to a Eurovision fan thing. I'm not really a fan of Eurovision at all so I watched this without any real investment in that aspect of the story. There were a few moments that were amusing but I felt that there was a long patch in the middle of this film that felt really un-funny and awkward to me. I was contemplating turning this off halfway though as I was embarrassed for having chosen to watch this with my family and everyone was starting to look at me and question my choice. This was sitting on a 2/10 for me but then thankfully
the film picked up with some comedy highlights and better pacing toward the end. I think if this film had been trimmed to a 90 minute run time, tightening up the story, it would have been substantially better. If you were a Eurovision fan, you may have appreciated the finer details more than I did."

The comedy at times is on point and at others feels out of place adding nothing to the story (don't even ask about the cgi whales).

Watch the actual Eurovision song contest and you will get more than enough of the same hilarious, over-the-top, eurotrashy goodness.<br/><br/>I like Will Ferrell and I'll always give his movies a chance. But this is C-list material at best. The jokes are tired, rehashed....tired. If anything, Will Farrell and the always charming Rachel McAdams with their fake Icelandic accents make things worse. Casting a pair of young Scandinavian actors in the lead roles might have lightened things up a bit, but of course that would miss the point that this is a Will Ferrell movie.<br/><br/>Get hold of old Eurovision song contests.

Let's see where this goes.""<br/><br/>And then off course they involved us (Iceland) and came here and shot stuff and have Icelandic actors and stuff. :D The thing that annoys me the most really is THOSE WERE NOT ICELANDIC NAMES. lol. They were Swedish or Scandinavian, but in my head-canon it's because like they come from like Swedish immigrants or something.

Maybe sometimes too seriously. XD Because I also want a good song to win and not a too gimmicky of an act. But yes, ugh, i can't wait for ESC next year.

As an Eve Online player I can recognise the Icelandic accent, so it was pretty easy to spot the odd Swede, but overall it did not matter. I guess as long as everyone speaks funny it's perceived as Icelandic.<br/><br/>Dan Stevens is the highlight of this movie in the portrayal of a gay Russian (purely fictional as there are no gays in Russia of course). From his bio here on imdb he seems the typical classical actor, but his accent and manners were spot on. Also nice to see all the Eurovision cameos and of course the ""stupid americans"" who do not understand this cultural phenomenon at all. As a dutchman who did not get to go to the event in Holland this year, the movie makes up for a lot."
"RichardBJ-1","8","0","0","29 June 2020"," Brilliant, if you always watched Eurovision, but always despaired of it!
","So this was a tricky act to pull off; Eurovision itself is so ghastly parodying it seems impossible. You could just mildly edit a version and have something that to all intents and purposes would seem like a spoof. But I watch it every year anyway as a tradition. The movie, for me successfully delivered such a parody however. It was stupid, but kept to the simple plot just fine.
To enjoy, you have got to be onside with Ferrell. It is typical Ferrell. I think you probably have to be one of those people also, who always watched Eurovision and always thought it was awful!
If you either liked Eurovision (Annually) or didn't watch it I think this would be waisted on you. So that is probably a reasonably small catchment window.
Watching the Eurovision ""stars"" popping up throughout was great. If you didn't recognise them ...this movie would be waisted on you! Sorry!!
...so I have no idea how this would go down in the USA, where, presumably you don't have Eurovision? ...but if that is the case how did Will F. Even find out about it?<br/><br/>Go forth enjoy, may be have a few drinks first...."
"gondiken","10","0","0","28 June 2020"," I didn't expect this movie to be this good
","Personally I don't even watch Eurovision that much, maybe if I happen upon it once in five years. Still when I first saw this movie on Netflix, I thought it'd be another attempt for Americans to make fun of European stuff because it's easy to sell ""different"" as a comedy to audiences that don't demand much. I like Will Ferrell, but him being in this movie was a red flag in that sense.<br/><br/>I was absolutely wrong! The movie was funny (not in an arrogant way), emotional and it had a lot of culture! The music in the movie is in no way ""mocking"", many songs could easily compete and potentially win in actual Eurovision. The comedy comes from the naivety of the characters, absurdity and hilarious running gags. Add the beautiful views of Iceland and you have a genuinely nice movie.<br/><br/>Since there is no Eurovision this year due to COVID19, I suggest enjoying every bit of this beautiful movie."

","After watching this film with my wife, I thought this was just a made up premise, no way it's real. Well, I read other reviews and then asked my neighbor from the UK, he confirmed with me that Eurovision is a real thing. It's like watching a super karokee contest, it's cheesey as heck but so entertaining.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams steals the show, she is so adorable and sweet throughout the movie, it's hard not to route for her. The movie is super funny and perfect for the Covid-19 world we currently live in, hopefully the major networks pick up the Eurovision broadcasts in the future so North America can join the fun.<br/><br/>This movie will make Eurovision a global phenomenon that it deserves, many thanks to Will Ferrell."

Some of the jokes full flat and the accents are dodgy but it's just a fun story that you can sing a long to and forget any sense of age or logic to the relationships!
There is a sense of the magic of Iceland that shines through and it's just a nice story.

It understands the cheesiness of Eurovision but this tired character he keeps churning out is out of place and out of time.

Like, Songvakeppnin is one of the strongest national finals and it's said like a 'joke final for TV', it's not a nice thing.<br/><br/>But well, somehow (no spoilers here) they made it to Eurovision in Scotland, I would love to see that again, and it was 50 minutes of the movie when I actually started caring about how it would end, then I stopped again knowing the rules and how unreal they are in the movie. But well... it all a long, LONG, a little horrible and you wanna quit, road to the end.

","As the other reviews said, it's goofy as to be expected, half of the jokes don't land, it's twenty minutes too long. But it is also a film that the world needs right now. Americans regard Eurovision as a horrible trashfest of bad music, but they also envy us Europeans for it because it is a festival of unity in the face of all that divides us. That's what it's for, and that how it works. The film brings that across quite well, especially in the singalong scene with former contest participants.<br/><br/>The best part are the ""you stupid Americans"" jokes- it's funny because it's true! We really don't like you, and we slurp Starbucks cinnamon latte - very good roast! We are such hypocrites! Almost as much as you are! The puns on Russia are also pretty good. The worst part is Iceland. Iceland is not Ireland, so why are Brosnan and elves in it? I know it's just a one letter difference but be careful when you rip on us Europeans.

I am a BIG Eurovision fan and this just made up for it not being on this year. It was filmed so well, from the songs, backdrops, dances and camera angles it WAS like watching Eurovision (especially with the added touch of Graham Norton!). Sure there were things that weren't accurate to the real contest (like how the hell did the UK host the thing? We never win! And why were we in the Semi's when we auto go to the final) but it's a film and they needed some license to do certain things. I forgive them.<br/><br/>My husband who will sit and watch Eurovision just to make fun of it (hey at least he watches it with me!) actually said that he had to keep reminding himself that it WASN'T the contest when the performances were on, the camera work, the staging were that accurate.<br/><br/>I was left with a HUGE smile on my face (and Volcano Man stuck in my head) for hours after watching this.

","""Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga"" follows two Icelanders (probably not siblings) who dreams of entering the eponymous contest and as they do, personal problems risk tearing them apart. Featuring a more downplayed Will Ferrell with a comedic style lacking much of his trademark insanity, he and McAdams gives the film a surprising emotional weight with quite tender performances. Most Europeans will most certainly also enjoy the quite spot on depiction of what Eurovision is, a rather tacky but highly entertaining campy event, an aspect that Ferrell, an American, managed to pull off gracefully well. What this Eurovision odyssey would need to make the two hours it takes to watch it more worth the while is a few more dramatic turns, and perhaps daring jokes. This take on the pan-European music festival might satisfy hardcore ESC fans hunger for the festival slightly, but ""The Story of Fire Saga"" doesn't do much more than that."

"mvahidalizadeh","7","2","5","27 June 2020"," A nice comedy with an important lesson to learn
","I enjoyed watching this comedy. The story is about a boy and girl who grow up with the dream of winning the Eurovision song contest. They grow up and get a chance to compete in this competition. The story is well-written. I saw nice acting from Will Ferell like always. Also, Rachel McAdams was great at acting. The movie shows a lot of nice locations in Iceland. However, almost half of the movie is on stage. The movie shows different plays and auditions for the contest. Those songs are exciting and fun to watch. In my opinion, comedy movies teach us important lessons most of the time. The lesson in this movie is to never give up and try hard for your dream. If you are a fan of comedy, you have to watch this one."
"Mynameisroman","7","2","5","27 June 2020"," Pretty Good for a Netflix Movie :-D
","Usually i'm not very fond of most netflix movies. they make great tv shows but for some reason they rarely make a good movie. this time its finally something good. It a Will Ferrell Movie so you already know what to expect. He's not overdoing it in this one though. Not too much over the top. the jokes work well for me.
Of course you pretty much know where the story is going so there are not too many surprises. Except maybe at the end. They found a pretty good ending for the movie. the female lead Rachel McAdams is also great. the have good chemistry together on the screen.
So overall without spoiling anything give it a try and watch the movie! even the music is good!
A solid 7/10"
"IndyTed","7","2","5","27 June 2020"," All the bad bits are Will
","It's a sign of Will's power that, despite being old, tired and icky looking he can force his way into a romantic lead. Peter Sellers could pull this off, not Will. This would have been a sharper, hipper and more powerful movie played by a younger, attractive comedian who can sing. Yes, it would have been a different story, but a better one. Instead, Will can only play the weird guy card. Ewe. This shtick grew tired a long time ago."

This movie was so much fun,considering we didn't get the real show this year.To see all my favorites-the winners of previous years!Ah..it was amazing and a Russian villain?!
The costume design,the sound production and casting-all on point.
The movie is Will Ferrell classic silliness. If you know you know.
At times it's dragging and there are a few unnecessary scenes.
The concept with elves killed me! My favorite part)

","I went in this with low exceptions, but found this surprisingly good. Rachel McAdams is so cute in this movie. It's the perfect mix of cheesy and goofy.

","Il be upfront, the dialogue was poor; but I went in with my Hope's low and was not disappointed.<br/><br/>This director deserves alot of credit, it was not a great script and he turned it into a decent movie. The music sequences were pretty fun and catchy and for a 2 hour movie it didnt come across as longwinded.<br/><br/>The acting was also good but given the poor dialogue seemed to fell short, Special mention to Pierce as the angry Icelandic father; he was great!<br/><br/>Overall I was surprised I enjoyed the movie and that is one of the very few Netflix original 'movies' I have enjoyed (I emphasize movies because Netflix has some great tv series)."

","Will Ferrell's latest twist on competition falls flat. You haVe the same tight flamboyant costumes and physical humour as in previous movies like Blades of Glory or Tallahassee Nights, but it all feels a bit old and dated.<br/><br/>Some of the casting is very good. Pierce Brosnan is good as the father and Rachael McAdams often steals the scene with her presence and voice.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it's not enough to lift the movie out of mediocrity and during the 2 hour runtime, it only made me laugh once."
"CinemaAmazing","7","2","5","26 June 2020"," A watchable movie but...
","Rachel McAdams for me, in terms of acting, was the high point in the film, but I don't detract from the work of other actors like Brosnan or Dan Stevens. The soundtrack is super catchy and has songs that get stuck in your head and you might listen them again later. And Demi Lovato's cameo is something I'm going to have a hard time to forget.
For me the worst of the movie was the screenplay and Will Farrell's performance. I thought the screenplay (written by Farrell) was completely based on stereotypes and lazy comedy. Farrell's performance, on the other hand, sometimes costs a lot to look at the screen and see him perform. In my opinion, he should stick to sketching on SNL and leave films for anyone who knows how to act."

","It's perfect if you have nothing else to watch. In Greece we have a saying amerikani√° which basically means classic american movie and it perfectly describes this movie. The story doesn't make sense most of the time and is always super predictable, many of the jokes don't land, the actors are super awkward trying to speak English in an Icelandic accent and even the competition of the Eurovision is portrayed wrong in the movie ( for example the points are given in thr final not in the semis ) which makes the movie hard to watch even for the fans of the competition. Some of the past winners also make an appearance in the movie but it just so happens to be at the most awkward scene ever. Anyway, it's on netflix so it might make sense to watch it with the family if you have absolutely nothing else to watch. I've seen worse movies than this but you'll definitely forget all about it about 10 minutes after its over"
"qui_j","2","3","11","4 July 2020"," Could not get past the fake accents
","It would have been better if they had made the story not require Will and Rachel to use fake accents. That was a huge turnoff and an insurmountable barrier to finishing the movie. In addition, the casting is really off since Pierce Brosnan and Ferrel look about the same age. Overall, you would need an IQ of less than 5 to give this a high rating. It's sad and pathetic when good comedians and good actors produce and star in rubbish like this."

"southdavid","5","2","6","29 June 2020"," That's Why Mum's Gone To Iceland
","Although I know it's a big deal to some people, I don't really enjoy a Eurovision event that much and I worried before seeing this film that the contest was beyond parody to begin with. I think I was right and I wouldn't say I enjoyed this film, but I find it hard to generate any real venom for it either.<br/><br/>Since childhood, Lars Erickssong (Will Ferrell) has had one dream, to win the Eurovision song contest. To the chagrin of his father (Pierce Brosnan) and the majority of the Icelandic town he lives in, this dream has stayed strong, and along with his childhood friend Sigrit (Rachel McAdams) they have submitted a song each year to be the Icelandic entry. When all the remaining options are killed in an explosion, Lars and Sigrit head to Edinburgh to represent the nation. But there, as their affection grows, the Russian entry, Alexander Lemtov (Dan Stevens) begins to make a play for Sigrit.<br/><br/>So there are, for my money, three things wrong with the movie. Firstly, it's far too reverential of the Eurovision Song Contest itself to operate as a parody. None of the performances are that over the top, compared to what you'd actually see. This is probably because Ferrell is a fan of the show, and that it uses many of the official logos, themes and presenters of the actual event - and in order to secure that, they can't then poke too much fun at their hosts. Secondly, Ferrell himself. I know he's the only reason the film gets made in the first place, as he's the fan, but he's strikingly older than McAdams. Distractingly so and I felt the character could have done with more genuine charm or naivety that Ferrell didn't provide. But thirdly, and most crucially, it's just not that funny. It doesn't try for enough jokes to get by on the hit rate that the film has. It's not even prepared to allow for Fire Saga to be a bad band. Accidents befall every performance that they have, but they can sing as well as anyone else on the show.<br/><br/>That said, I can't bring myself to say I hated it like I did ""Holmes and Watson"" say. Dan Steven's is great, the Demetriou siblings are both in it, though not given enough to do, and the resolution of the Demi Lovato ghost subplot made me chuckle. It's all very amiable - just not funny."

"alanpriest-53916","9","2","6","27 June 2020"," Eurovision Treat
","Of all films which you would perhaps not expect to like, this one is an unexpected treat. Moreover, the power behind it is an American in Will Ferrell. Then add that wonderful Canadian actress, Rachel McAdams - both coming at this subject matter from 'left field'.
At the start you think to yourself ""is this film for me"", but it then draws you in, such that by the end you become totally engrossed. This is thanks in large part to the Ferrell script but in even greater part to McAdams playing a difficult role to perfection. What a great performer she is.
No small amount of credit is also due to the effects department - the hamster-wheel scene is both hysterical and brilliant. Oh, and the music throughout is both so Eurovision and yet great to listen to.
Well done all involved."

2020

Director: David Dobkin
Starring: Will Ferrell, Rachel McAdams, Dan Stevens, Pierce Brosnan, Graham Norton, Demi Lovato, Mikael persbrandt etc<br/><br/>Overall rating 74/00<br/><br/>Eurovision story of the fire sage is abut two aspiring musicians called Lars (Will Ferrell) and Sigrid (Rachel McAdams) get the opportunity to represent Iceland in the Eurovision song contest, but things don't go smoothly, and the group, their friendship and relationships with others are at stake. This movie was crazy and far from perfect, but if you accept what it has to offer then like me you should have a great time with it let's talk about it more in detail.<br/><br/>First of all, there was great parent/child relationships and likeable characters and main performances. I thought the relationships between the two main characters was really interesting and provided good motivation for the characters, the fact that both parents didn't believe singing should be something that there kids should be doing gave them the motivation to prove them wrong and earn there respect so this was well done. I thought the main comedic performances from Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams were fantastic. They were both so odd yet charming and really loveable that you couldn't help but fall in love with them throughout. They were both also hilarious with so many laugh out loud moments during performances or Will Ferrell being his usual hilarious self. The whole film had likeable characters which made it so much fun to watch, and gave you ads an audience member more people to connect with.<br/><br/>However, my first two negatives will sadly have to be that the movie was fairly generic and there was some very predictable set up of conflict. The movie and it's characters was definitely something we have seen been done on multiple different occasions and sadly the film didn't do much to get away from that which was a shame because it shows a slight lack of creativity with the plot. The film also had very predictable set ups of conflict. It was obvious from the beginning that Sigrid had a much better voice then Lars that came as part of the comedy, so it was obvious that her going solo and people trying to separate them was the obvious plot point and set up of conflict was going to be before it even happened.<br/><br/>My next few positives would be the soundtrack and the set pieces. The film's soundtrack was fantastic, it provided some funny moments, some heart-warming and breath-taking moments, and some pure moments of joy. There were some really good songs as well which I was pleasantly surprised at, they had many fun scenes playing with different songs so this was great. Also, the film actually had some really nice set pieces. The location of Iceland was beautiful and well explored throughout multiple scenes. The staging of the competition was also great and as expected wild.<br/><br/>My final few negatives would be that there was some odd creative decisions with the characters, with a lack of depth to them and the plot, whilst also having some out of place characters and conflicting tones. I thought that some of the creative decisions for some of the characters were slightly odd and didn't really fit with the desired tone of the film. The man in charge of picking the competitors for Iceland was strangely obsessed with making sure Iceland didn't win which just didn't work. And some of the decisions made for Lars and Sigrid I also didn't agree with and either made the film more generic or made you not like Lars as much. The whole plot and characters also didn't really have a lot of depth and were very one dimensional with there personalities and their development throughout. I also found the combining of musical and comedy genres at times very conflicting and not always consistent. I felt like the comedy was slightly out of place with some of the songs. Will Ferrell also felt out of place sadly sometimes as well, he couldn't sing which was funny but tarnished some of the soundtrack and his humour when used correctly was great but sometimes wasn't needed.<br/><br/>My final few positives would be the funny set up for the competition, the heart-warming tone and satisfying ending. The whole set up of fire saga doing dreadfully and obviously not being good enough to get to the semi finals but the boat with all the other contestants on, was slightly controversial but for me absolutely hilarious and gave both of the characters the motivation to work harder. The film also had a very heart-warming tone. The charm of the characters and the bond between the main performances really made me feel all cosy inside and constantly put a smile on my face. With that being said the finale was very satisfying. When Lars and Sigrid finally reunited it was worth the conflict, it also introduced us to the best and most powerful song in the film. I also liked that they didn't win the competition, but they won the hearts of everyone in the film and I am sure everyone watching.<br/><br/>Overall , despite issues with the tone and some creative issues. Eurovision story of the fire saga. Is one of the most charming and heart-warming comedies of the year, making me a fan of Will Ferrell once more."
"nick-615-60770","6","1","2","4 July 2020"," It's ok, despite Will Ferrell's best efforts!

Will Ferrell milks every potential joke past dry<br/><br/>Will Ferrell looks as old as his father, Pierce Brosnan<br/><br/>It is unsaid but alluded that Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams May never have had sex with each other or anyone else ???<br/><br/>It's odd, quirky, but quite watchable"
"mwltrz-743-56021","6","1","2","2 July 2020"," Overstays its welcome
","Eurovision has some quality highlights and memorable scenes. The scenes that poke fun at the real life event are genuinely entertaining, and both Ferrell and McAdams put forth great comedic performances. The large ensemble performance featuring artists from the real event, which also served as a trailer for the movie, is easily the best part. Eurovision is 30 minutes too long however, and one too many jokes fall flat. A less forgiving cut of this movie could be great. Has it's highlights, but definitely not in the top list of either of these great actors. There is certainly potential though, and a few good laughs are definitely there."

","I am not a big fan of Will Ferrell's comedy but I did enjoy some of his past films with other actors such as Mark Wahlberg, Mel Gibson, John Cena and the Rock. If this weren't on Netflix, I probably wouldn't had gone to watch it. But it was an eh, what do I have to lose scenerio.<br/><br/>I ended up liking it. I thought the film had a lot of production value for a made for tv movie. I did enjoy the cinematography and the beautiful landscapes. Some of the musical performances were good too even though they were meant to be comical. There were a few good jokes in it.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell, Rachel McAdams, Dan Stevens and Pierce Brosnan belted out good acting performances. The film also had a lot of heart.<br/><br/>I think it's worth a 6 out of 10."

","I suppose your view on this will very much depend on whether or not you like (or at least appreciate) the Eurovision Song Contest - much of the humour derives from decades of the subjugation of Europe by this: the epitome of campness, talentlessness, political bias and general tone deafness! If you do, then this will work; if not - then don't waste your time. Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams are good as a couple who ever since Abba won in 1974, have been inspired to take part in the competition, representing their home nation of Iceland. After an exhaustive selection process - involving a bin and some CDs - they find themselves auditioning and well... you can guess the rest. It swipes at just about everything from the corny looks/lyrics; huge - frequently calamitous - staging; dodgy judging and just about anything American but it also manages to tap into what makes the whole event work - it's gentle sense of national pride; of silliness - epitomised by a superbly smouldering Dan Stevens as ""Alexander Lemtov"", the gorgeous, super sleazy Russian candidate - who is clearly enjoying himself. Graham Norton (who hosts the real BBC coverage in the UK) is as taciturn as ever as the event is showcased in Edinburgh. It is not, however, particularly well written; the jokes are a bit low-brow and the romance between the two characters is, frankly, quite distracting from the point of the whole thing. I have to admit that it did take me a good half an hour to recognise Pierce Brosnan! Oddly enough, there just isn't enough music in it - but it is still fun, if forgettable"

"cruise01","6","1","3","30 June 2020"," Weird, fun, and a little too long for a comedy film.
","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga (3 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>Eurovision is a comedy film about two best friends since there childhood. Had a dream about going into a singing competition in Eurovision. Lars (Will Ferrell) and Sigrit (Rachel McAdams) are a duo that sing in local bars in Iceland. While they enter a competition presenting there country. They face against Alexander (Dan Stevens) a Russian singer who has a flamboyant style. And others. While Lars father Erick (Pierce Brosnan) is disappointed with his sons talent.<br/><br/>Eurovision is a film that feels like a stylish 1980s music video with its European celtic like music and costumes, lighting, and visuals. One wonders if the writers and director was high on something from its trippy and weird style. It does have its fair share of comical moments. I did find the film to have its charm with the performances and decent story about Lars and Sigrit trying to chase there dreams.<br/><br/>The performances are fun and weird in a good way. Which is what it is trying to be with its stupid humor. The film does run a little too long with its running time. Running at 2 hours. The direction does have an uneven pacing. Lars and Sigrit singing and having their musical duo is a lot of fun and flashy with its songs and set design. When the characters are not in a musical moment. The direction can be a little dull and slow."
"davedees","9","1","3","29 June 2020"," This movie really grows on you the more you watch it.
","I was initially disappointed as I love when Will Ferrell has no leash, and allowed to riff and improv in all of his glorious comic absurdity. This movie is more of a slow burn. It has some lighter comedic absurdity but what it lacks in that, it more than makes up for in a fascinating culture rarely seen. There are so many little subtle lines and dynamics that are comic genius, but not in the often loud over the top antics Will Ferrell is known for. Rachel McAdams nailed her role, as well as Dan Stevens playing the utterly masterful role of Lemtov. So much great music. It did a great job of capturing the quirky characters both in Iceland and the Eurovision contest without disrespecting either. If anyone took a beating it was the American frat guys ha. A great cameo by Demi Lovato. Molly Sanden from Sweden providing the incredible singing voice for Rachel McAdams. The last song notes were hit i did not know existed. It made me laugh, it made me cry. What more can you ask for. Best Will Ferrell movie in a while who co wrote the screenplay."

If a soundteack came out, I would gladly listen to it while driving somewhere or having a sit down party at home with friends after watching the movie together.

I remember a whole country in ecstasy, and all the love and unity it brought. I really believe that this song contest, has always made Europe, and the world, a better and more open place to be who we are, and it celebrates diversity and glam. 2020 is the first time the contest was cancelled ever, because, well you all know why. In the alternative show, most of us agree that this would have been Iceland's year to win it for the first time. And here comes Will Ferrell, of all people, and gives us an amazing and funny movie, where Iceland is in the center of all this. I think the elves had something to do with it. What a great way to celebrate and show the world what Eurovision is all about. Togetherness, love and great music. And of course the crazy, but entertaining parts of it all. Love it!

I don't know if the producers just thought, ""What's whiter than Iceland"" and figure it was okay to make fun of them for an entire movie, but that's pretty much what they did.<br/><br/>I can't say if it's accurate, I don't have a lot of Icelandic jokes in my pocket, but SO MANY people had to endorse this that it is just sad this was made. This could have been a great American Idol style of movie, none of the nationalistic humor was necessary.<br/><br/>They took the ""Off the bus from Kansas"" trope, and set it in Europe, barely anything particular to it, let alone special.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the singing is all great, but that's what audio programs are for, and they certainly had the budget to go the extra mile with this one.<br/><br/>The writing is actually pretty good in this, it's just coated in herring (see, that's probably a Swedish joke).<br/><br/>I'd really like to see an American version of this so we can let two top notch stars like Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams loose and not have to feel bad about it."

I honestly don't know why they didn't just cast the actual singer in the role (I'm guessing it's because Molly Sanden, the actual singer, is even younger than Rachel is).<br/><br/>I also thought the pairing of Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams as a romantic couple was very hard to believe, for reasons that should be apparent to anyone with eyes.<br/><br/>Disregarding potential chemistry issues, though, this was a fun movie, and far better than most anything Netflix puts out."

True Eurovision fans will love it, the story is contrived but moves along nicely. Quite a few recent Eurovision winners turn up for a sing along which is fun, and Mr Graham Norton talks us through the contest itself, so for us Brits it's a bit like the real thing.<br/><br/>My only criticism is that they didn't get Mans Zelmerlow and Petra Mede in for a cameo; they were amazing hosting the 2016 contest and would have lent some extra sparkle.<br/><br/>If you love Eurovision you won't need much persuading to watch this, if you don't love Eurovision, give it a try anyway, it will bring you a smile, and maybe a tear as well."

However it doesn't take long until it looses it's mojo, and the tone gets over the place, there are some melodramatic moments, cheesy moments which I didn't expect, as it does to make fun of cheesy at the same time. Also it felt like they were quickly left out of jokes to make , like Lars being late for the song, storming on the stage, it was ok the first time, but then that happens again in the final act.

","Sweetly goofy and joyous, ""Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga"" could be considered a comeback film for Will Ferrell, even if his co-star steals it from him. Once one of the comedy genre's biggest stars, Ferrell hasn't had a hit in a years -his recent comedy ""Holmes & Watson"" nearly killed the critic we assigned to cover for this site (on Christmas Day!). One could argue the last comedy he headlined that really worked came a decade ago (""The Other Guys"").<br/><br/>Premiering on Netflix today, ""Eurovision"" reunites Ferrell with ""Wedding Crashers"" director David Dobkin, and presents the ""SNL"" alum the chance to be silly in that endearing way that built his fanbase in the first place. For the most part, it works, assisted greatly by the perfect comic timing of Rachel McAdams, who can sell ridiculous behavior with a straight face in ways that deserves way more critical attention. (Her performance doing exactly that in ""Game Night"" is one of the best comedy turns of the last few years.) Like a lot of comedies, it relies a bit too heavily on a romantic relationship that doesn't make a lot of sense and the running time drags right when the movie should be building up steam, but there's an infectious charm to most of what works about ""Eurovision,"" not unlike the international competition itself.<br/><br/>Ferrell plays Lars Erickssong, an Icelandic man-child who lives with his father (Pierce Brosnan) and whose life was changed the day he saw ABBA perform ""Waterloo"" on the Eurovision music contest, a long-running, multi-country affair that's kind of like a European ""American Idol"" if every contestant was from a different country and it had a lot more fire effects, dry ice, and general spectacle. Obsessed with getting on Eurovision himself, Lars and his BFF Sigrid (McAdams) form a duo called Fire Saga, sending in their audition tape, which is randomly chosen by a group of Icelandic producers to fill out a roster for their country's finals. They have an obvious winner in a talent named Katiana (Demi Lovato), so they just need another act to meet the contest requirements. Of course, Sigrid and Lars have other plans.<br/><br/>Through a series of funny accidents that are best left unspoiled, Fire Saga ends up making it to the main show, and ""Eurovision Song Contest"" allows Dobkin, a music video director, to stage some elaborate numbers, including a singalong at a party that blends together hits like Madonna's ""Ray of Light"" and Cher's ""Believe."" It's an undeniably goofy moment that captures the overall tone of the film well. ""Eurovision Song Contest"" is at its best when it sings its silly heart out, embracing the power of creative expression in a way that is familiar but can be undeniably enjoyable when done with this much exuberance. If anything, it feels like Ferrell's greatest hits in the way it reflects things he's done well before, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Like the contest itself or the lip-sync number to the pop hits, the amount of pure heart goes a long way in selling the familiar. And there's something refreshing about a modern comedy that doesn't feel cynical about human nature or manufactured by a focus group like so many have lately.<br/><br/>Ferrell's skill with goofy man-children is well-documented but this comedy should remind people of the underrated range of Rachel McAdams, who once again just nails a comedy role. Her timing is never off and often inspired-she has a reaction beat after an explosion that's just perfect. And she even finds a way to sell the thinnest aspect of the film in its underdeveloped love story. There's something underwritten about how Lars can't see that Sigrid is in love with him because he's so focused on his career, but viewers will struggle to figure out what she sees in him other than a musical partner. It's also worth giving a shout-out to Dan Stevens, who plays the super-macho Russian frontrunner to win Eurovision in a way that walks that fine line of being exaggerated without veering into caricature.<br/><br/>Like way too many modern comedies and a lot of Netflix movies, ""Eurovision Song Contest"" is just too long. There's no reason for this movie to inch past two hours. It's a film about spectacle, so maybe it makes sense that it's a little bloated, but there's a tighter version of this movie that works significantly better, lessening some of the lulls between laughs. Still, with nowhere to go and little to do this summer, a comedy this defiantly silly could be coming along at just the right time for people. We can't actually reunite with old pals, but something like a reunion with a funny friend could be the next best thing."
"minutolo","5","1","7","4 July 2020"," Wow, is this mediocre!
","Ferrell and crew working on a musical rom-com about two Swedish(I think) outcasts whose only dream is to star on and win Eurovision, a European song competition. The movie... is okay.<br/><br/>There are huge flaws weighing this movie down, however. For starters, most of the jokes are about the crotch region. You can figure that out on your own. I'll spare you the deets, but they go into GRAPHIC lengths (no pun intended) about their... yeah.<br/><br/>The acting is atrocious at times and Ferrell just sounds like a generic Borat-type satire of foreign people. Side characters like Ferrell's dad and some rival character that gets killed off 10 minutes in were most likely added in for filler.<br/><br/>Demi Lovato, while she is talented, is STILL not a good actor. She has very little lines to work with.<br/><br/>And now, the songs.
Holy crap.<br/><br/>Some of them are oddly good. ""Lion of Love"" is something I would totally hear Jason Derulo or even Maroon 5 singing. That being said, a lot of the songs are EXTREMELY sexual. The writers must've had their La Croix spiked Viagra. Flirting and implied sex is shown throughout... a LOT.<br/><br/>Don't watch it. It's lowbrow and doesn't stick with you at all after watching. It has no replay value whatsoever. Just watch Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping if you want satire on pop music."
"Cineanalyst","4","1","7","29 June 2020"," Auto-Tuned
","The auto-tuned songs aren't bad, whether they be melodic or parodic, but as a comedy-drama, ""Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,"" it's a cluttered series of miscues. Even the title is an overlong and questionable attempt at humor with both the words ""story"" and ""saga."" I can can count on one hand how many moments in the movie gave me mirth. Any attempted exploitation of cultural differences becomes a lost cause. Only the anti-American ranting from the American Will Farrell in an American production somewhat works. Trying to poke fun at homophobia in Russia, for instance, is just depressing. Besides, why every hack piece of slapstick needs a love triangle in the first place is beyond me, although, still, the drama here manages to work better than the comedy. The ghost and elves stuff is stupid (albeit, the line, ""The elves went too far,"" is kind of funny). A lot of the rest is the usual dick jokes. Perhaps, my favorite gag is Farrell's blas√© response to the beauty, leaping wales included, of H√∫sav√≠k, Iceland. Indeed, ""Eurovision Song Contest"" is in stark contrast to the usual cinematic leveraging of nature in the better pictures set in the Nordics. This one spends more time in a pub watching TV than, say, beside snow-covered mountains, more time swirling the camera around actors lip syncing than on any battle between man and nature.<br/><br/>Oh well, at least, Molly Sand√©n can sing--providing the voice for Rachel McAdams's character. Additionally, since the real Eurovision event has been cancelled for the first time in its history due to the pandemic, streaming this movie on Netflix may offer fans a substitute, pale as it may be, to the real thing, including cameos from several past Eurovision participants."

","Review:
'Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga' is a musical comedy film directed by David Dobkin. The film follows Icelandic singers Lars Erickssong (Will Farrell) and Sigrit Ericksd√≥ttir (Rachel McAdams) as they are given the chance to represent their country at the Eurovision Song Contest.
A movie that has a better soundtrack then it does story, that's this movie. I didn't go into it with the highest of expectations, the trailers didn't get me excited at all, but the star power of Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams was strong enough to get a viewing from me.
With me basically watching this movie because of its stars, I was hoping they would be as good as they are in other films, but they are a massive let down in this. Will Ferrell's comedic presence was very flat, and he was not his charismatic self he can be. Rachel McAdams was better to watch her work on screen, but her Icelandic accent was horrid, and it always throws me off when they get an actress that doesn't sing the material with their co-star. Will Ferrell was singing in the film where Rachel McAdams parts to dubbed over by a professional singer. This was also the case with Dan Stevens character, but he was able to provide a better and bigger on-screen presence then the two leads in the film, and that's another problem.
This may be yet another film that just wasn't made to be viewed by myself. It is getting very good reviews both critically and by audiences saying it is a good representation of how important Eurovision is. I just don't feel that it was made to be a comedy because it didn't have any jokes that landed to me and they possibly should have had actual Icelandic actors in the film. I will say that the ending of the film was beautiful and had my eyes glued to the screen, but it also feels like it should have been in a different film.
Overall, this movie was a miss for me, but am I only one of many reviewers. There are also some sad moments in the film which I love, but they are very subtle, and you will miss them if you don't pay attention. Maybe if you don't go into this movie expecting it to be funny or a typical Will Ferrell film it will come off as a better film. It was better than 'Holmes and Watson', but that's the best thing I can say about this film.

","This has many of the hallmarks of a typical Netflix movie. Solid production values, some big names - but basically past-it stars (Will Ferrell and Pierce Brosnan) and a bad story/screenplay. Ferrell somehow manages to look older than Brosnan who is playing his father.<br/><br/>The concept of a comedy based around the Eurovision Song Contest is actually quite a good one and in better hands it might have worked well but the jokes don't land.<br/><br/>This sort of feel-good light comedy is probably better off closer to the 90min runtime mark as well and it feels stretched at 2 hrs."
"z120511","6","0","1","5 July 2020"," Not funny, but the music was good
","Will Ferrell is pretty hit or miss in comedies and this was right in between. The jokes are pretty weak, but the songs alone made this watchable. Being not familiar with Eurovision, it was very interesting to learn about it as I watched. While there are some laughs for sure, the accents throughout are impossible to ignore. Both Will and Rachel would jump from Icelandic, to German, to Swedish, to sometimes just plain American accent. I enjoyed the story, but the corrupt city official subplot trying to randomly kill Will Ferrell in the end was completely unnecessary and added nothing. Which was followed up by a ghost warning him about the official, only for Will to say ""oh we are good, I already killed him"". As far as the music every song is catchy, and I've already got JaJa Ding Dong stuck in my families heads by playing it ad nauseam. I would definitely recommend this, it's a fun time all things considered."

(Where are my baking grannies, singing horses and other nutty acts???)<br/><br/>I have questions about the fairies, but I'm just gonna accept what I saw...<br/><br/>However, all that aside, the film tackles the themes of blind determination and admitting being wrong, THEN DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT - which aren't things that come up too often in this kind of film.<br/><br/>If Will Ferrel didn't join in the final performance song, I would have given a 6 or 7, because I really felt like that stomped all over the meaningfulness of the previous half hour of an already over-long film."

It made me laugh, it entertained me and it was good.<br/><br/>Now if you are looking for a deep story, a serious movie, then look elsewhere. are you looking to relax, laugh and have a good time, then go watch this movie, most of you have Netflix anyways so."
