"Icecreambenjaminelliott","10","1778","2718","4 July 2019"," Traumatic, Surreal, Bizarre Masterpiece
","I'll start this off with a warning. If you're a mainstream horror fan, you will not like this. It is not The Conjuring, it does not have jump scares, it is a slow movie. It's not scary in the way that most horror films are scary. It doesn't frighten you. It felt traumatic. This is an artsy movie for sure. If you don't like that, don't see it.<br/><br/>Florence Pugh is absolutely phenomenal. She provides the heart for the film and is what keeps the audience emotionally invensted in such a disturbing film. It's one of the greatest horror performances that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The cinematography is stunningly gorgeous. I've never seen a film look so gory and grotesque and yet absolutely beatiful at the same time. It's some of the best cinematography that I've seen in years. The art direction is also phenomenal in providing us with a floral, candy colored, nightmare world.<br/><br/>And Ari Aster's screenplay and direction is what makes this so special and separates it from other horror pieces. It's slow, methodical, eerie. But the characters are psychological and deep. The dialogue is real and colorful. The plot is surreal and disturbing. He let's the scares crawl at you as opposed to jump at you. He allows you to see what will happen, process it, feel the shock of what's about to happen, and then still shock you even more when it happens.<br/><br/>This film will be divisive. I have no doubt that many people here will hate this. However, while this is a challenging film, it's also a great film. Halfway through a character says something along the lines of ""That was so messed up, but I'm trying to keep an open mind."" I suggest that audiences take this advice.<br/><br/>PSA, this movie is extremely violent, bloody, and gory. It's pretty horrifying and it could have stuff that is triggering."
"schuelererik","4","63","88","31 May 2020"," Not for everyone
","Let me first say, this is not a ""bad"" movie. It utilizes creative camera work and cinematography to add to the narrative. But I personally still didn't like it. Its main goal in my opinion is to disturb the viewer as much as possible through the use of sound, gory visuals and the feeling of isolation and insanity. While I can see how this can speak to a certain audience, it didn't appeal to me and made me want to turn of the movie quite a few times. If you are into these kinds of films, definitely give this a try but if you, like me, enjoy being scared by a horror movie instead of weirded out and disturbed, this might not be for you."
"palistineroyal","7","769","1265","6 July 2019"," This movie was a trip
","I'm not sure how but the movie had me on edge the entire time. You have to enjoy cinematography to really enjoy this. I left the movie like I just came down from a high. The whole thing felt like a bad trip afterwards, I was pleased and not at the same time but I think that's how we're meant to feel. It's a good change from super hero movies and terribly made horror movies."
"sumtim3s00n","Null","729","1231","2 September 2019"," Long meandering story that doesnt deliver
","Not sure what this is supposed to be. Its definitely not a horror movie. Its not even that scary, has a few unsettling moments but thats it. Its just weird and doesnt really have any dramatic arc or raising the tension. Basically the whole movie is a few strangers saying WTF? constantly and everyone else telling them "" 'ts ok ! guys""
Also besides that, its revolves around a traumatized, annoying and totally without self respect girl that slowly starts benefiting from this weird place. Because of course, we cannot have a film these days without it being a ""personal journey"" of some sorts. Writers trying to be smart and ""deep"".
Yeah nothing beats a bizzare and crazy rituals to make you sane.<br/><br/>If youre expecting horror and monsters or supernatural, keep going. Its just a weird film with no real ending, resolution, interesting character or events. Albeit with nice filmography and quite good actors it has no real dramatic structure or captivating story."
"mctsunemori","2","1034","1778","16 July 2019"," What a piece of crap, waste of time
","I originally review this as a 5 but changed my rating to 2. Because yes, this movie stuck with me, but not in a good way. I kept wanting more, wanting answers, but it failed to produce. I think I get what the movie was trying to be, but it took such a slow and choppy path to get there. It's a drama splattered ( pun intended) with moments of shocking gore and some misplaced humor. And to think this was a shortened version? I got tired of watching people eat, stare, wait to sit, drink, dance.<br/><br/>I think the way Danny was ""trapped"" into flowered dress at the end WAS symbolic f how the audience was TRAPPED into this suffocating boring film.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time!"
"danedk","1","743","1269","3 July 2019"," Watch ""The Wicker Man"" from 1973 instead...
","I suspect that reviewers who believe this movie to be the weirdest, most deranged and tripped-out film they've ever seen have not watched many movies. I recommend you watch ""The Wicker Man"" from 1973, Alejandro Jodorowsky's ""The Holy Mountain"" and Sergei Parajanov's ""The Color of Pomegranates"" before you watch this watered down, pretentious murk in order to get a sense of how movies can truly be mind-altering.
The ""story"" is essentially every cliché of the slasher genre mashed together: a group of young people naively go into the wilderness (Sweden, very scary place lol) and encounter messed up stuff. They each die one by one and, SPOILER ALERT, there is a ""final girl"" who survives in the end. The rest of this cliché story is fluff. If you think, based on the trailer, that much of this film will mirror the original Wicker Man, you are exactly right. There is even a big fire at the end where a guy gets burned alive.
There is a fine line between homage and rip-off and this may a great example of a film that slips over the edge into complete rip-off territory. I won't even go into all the logical loopholes in the story and the scenario, or point out that none of the customs line up at all with ancient Scandinavian rituals (thus making one wonder why this even takes place in Sweden to begin with, like, why couldn't this be a cult in upstate NY?) because there's no point. The script doesn't even attempt to be deep, the research here is sub-Wikepedia level, and the characters are cookie-cutter types you've seen before in a million other horror movies. One logical question I would ask, however, is how come all of these people are anthropology PhD students going to research Scandinavian paganism but none of them speak Swedish??!?!? Has the writer ever even talked to someone with a PhD???
All this said, Florence Pugh is a talented actress and does a great job with the shallow script. She transcends the material and shows that she can be a powerful dramatic actress. The cinematography is gorgeous too. The editing and sound are pitch perfect. I was especially taken by the set design, the use of furniture and quirky wall paintings to give the film a sense of intricate beauty to contrast with the horror. This is all really fabulous and the people who worked on these aspects of the film should be commended. It is all cosmetic, however. Without the mask of beautiful production and a gifted actress, the director/ writer Aster has absolutely nothing going on here.
""Hereditary"" was a very good, solid horror film and I wonder if Aster didn't rush into this sophomore effort too soon. This seems like a script he could have banged out in a night, especially since it feels like something made out of other films. It also seems that Aster repeats some of the same tricks from ""Hereditary""- using shocking, Gaspar Noé-like violence and relying on making his audience feel uncomfortable at the sight of incongruously naked people running around. These stock images are going to get old really fast for him, he needs to work on building up to scares that really pay off.
There will be people who love this director, who are swept away by the cool style and photography of this film or who have simply never seen any of the hundreds of other movies out there with strange imagery and creepy paganism, and these people are going to think this movie is a mind-blower. That's nice, but please watch ""The Wicker Man"" from 1973 first before you fall in love with this dumpster fire."

","I rarely write reviews here. But this movie was SO bad...<br/><br/>The opening sequence was very effective. But the next two hours were unbelievably awful, filled with empty cult drivel and scenes that had no connection. It was as if the director had some great ideas for visuals and thought he could put them all together, hoping it made sense. Well, it doesn't. One of the rare movies where I've wanted to yell at the screen, ""This is so stupid!"""
"sarahbokc","1","234","393","27 July 2019"," Cinematography can't save the narrative
","This film can't be saved even by the undeniable cinematography. It's unbearably slow, the violence is gratuitous, and it epically fails to be a horror movie on any level. Midsommar tries to be psychologically terrifying/disturbing, but misses the mark because the characters are hollow, and flat.<br/><br/>The theater burst into loud laughter at several points because the film becomes so absurd.

","Save for the beautiful scenery, costuming and cinematography, this movie was a head trip! I went into it knowing it was weird but WTF!? It would call it horror but a creepy thriller. It was a bit cliche, boring and slow at times. *SPOILERS* It comes to a slow burn, literally. I suspected human sacrifice, but why include it? And the cult was just a bunch of emotional wack jobs who enjoyed getting high. This movie is deep emotionally,but also funny at inappropriate times. Like at the end, Dani's humongous flower ""dress"" hardly allows her to move.<br/><br/>So in summary, if you want a head tripping, nonsensical way to spend over 2 hrs, then this movie is for you. If you dislike movies with an ambiguous ending, some gore and millenial age drama, then avoid it. wished I did"

"DjMethod","9","493","879","10 July 2019"," An Operatic Catharsis On Emotional Dependency
","""I have always felt held. By a family... a real family. Do you feel held?""<br/><br/>One of the most universal and innately human desires is a sense of belonging. The human brain is not meant to be alone; we are evolved to be a part of something. Belonging fundamentally allows us to form our own sense of identity, establish social connections through community, and provides us with love, attention, security, and purpose. Perhaps more importantly, a lack of belonging is when we begin to lose sense of ourselves and who we are. This loss of touch with who we are when the world around us suddenly disappears... this slight loss of footing, dip in reality, always feeling somewhat displaced and perpetually unsettled... this encapsulates the mood of Ari Aster's Midsommar.<br/><br/>Aster has delivered a psychedelic genre-defying horror fable that wins its audience by creeping into our darkest corners of angst, longing, and loneliness. At its core, the film is about a young woman who copes with crippling anxiety rooted in a desperate and fearful need for love as she comes to terms with the end of a relationship. It's about anxiety, fear of abandonment, and moving on. It is a meditation on human belonging; an operatic catharsis played on the strings of emotional dependency; a journey both inward and outward, to finally let go of something that was never meant to be.<br/><br/>Midsommar is not a mystery or suspense movie. It unveils itself unapologetically, as if the filmmaker has no intention of hiding anything from us in the first place (the entire movie is visually depicted almost constantly in the background on walls or tapestries). Yet the film establishes its own rhythm and pacing. As the characters embark on a mushroom trip and grow weightless and spacey, so do we get entranced by the beautiful Swedish settings and sounds-at times indistinguishable from flutes being played by characters on-screen, and at other times, woven with a spell-binding aural hypnosis (listen to ""Attestupan"" without falling into a meditative trip).<br/><br/>Like Hereditary before it, the casting is exceptional. Florence Pugh portrays and embodies isolation and anxiety so effectively that the ideas feel nearly concrete. Her part as Dani demands an incredible range and her commitment to the role is apparent. Her character has an air of desperation to her. A perfect casting for a lonely soul. Jack Reynor, a critical piece to this opera as the unlikeable and detached boyfriend, also delivers in a solid performance that leaves us conflicted, or at the very least, challenged.<br/><br/>If Satan and Cannibal Corpse got together to shoot Blue Valentine in Sweden, I'd imagine it would be something like Midsommar. Aster taps into a dark and vulnerable place-he opens the door to chests you may have locked away and have had no intention of coming back to. If you've gone through a break-up recently, it may resonate even stronger. It's uncomfortable, unpleasant, but ultimately, cathartic.<br/><br/>The director goes on to describe the film as almost a perverse wish-fulfillment fantasy. You see what you want to see. The inclusion of this overarching idea bears a universal relevance to how we can behave in the midst of the most toxic relationships. Entering the ethereal fog of Hårga perhaps a metaphor for willfully indulging in our clouded judgment to escape our fears.<br/><br/>If Hereditary was a thematic exploration of inescapable fate, Midsommar is a tighter, more centered thematic reflection on emotional dependence. The thought given to the characters and script and the details within the various shots, symbols, and sounds will all surely leave many viewers coming back for more.<br/><br/>Plan to watch it twice, if for nothing else, to drink the tea again."
"srgymrat33","1","235","408","20 October 2019"," This was just...bad
","I love horror. I love disturbing. I love indie film.<br/><br/>This was all of those things, and not really anything more. It was disturbing and gross without any point, it did not need to be over 2 hours, it did not need the mating ritual to take 15 min, it did not need to have dead bodies all over the place, it did not need to show the smashing of the head with a sledgehammer or the smattering of blood after the apparent suicide. The same effect would have been created by the suicide itself, alluding to the fact the the mating was happening, implying the bodies were around(the foot was a nice touch, up out of the garden). That would have added to the horror, the mystery and the feel.<br/><br/>I understand the appeal, a light colored movie with a dark theme, a time when light is most apparent leading to the most dark, the fact Americans impose their own values everywhere they go, without seeking to really understand and they therefore miss out. Its a good start, a good idea, with absolutely no follow through.<br/><br/>I left feeling angry, disgusted and disappointed in a movie I had looked forward to for some time.<br/><br/>So many good movies out there, spend your time on something else."
"benclifford","1","462","828","13 July 2019"," Unbelievably terrible
","All of the people who enjoy the film praise it for the cinematography, which was uninspired, for it's breaching of multiple genres, which was done but rather poorly, and for being about the breakup, not just the horror, which, it was, but had a ridiculous stance on the break up.<br/><br/>The positives in the film were the acting and the FX department. I wish I could give credit to the production designer but putting the tune for sacrifice on the sacrificial character's costume isn't clever, it's tacky. It's like having a name tag saying ""Hi, my name is Murderer"" in a slasher film. The lighting decision to have a horror film be in broad daylight is neither original (Wicker Man) nor well done (it is very straightforward camera angles other than a singular upside down windshield shot).<br/><br/>The breaching of multiple genres is a good thing and could be praised, if it was done in a way that complimented the strengths of the genres involved and conveyed the message. Neither of these happened. Instead, random lines of humor were included interspersed between gratuitously graphic on screen killings. Then there were completley purposeless orgy sequences with explicit nudity that I have read were included as comic relief according to the director. How is disgusting nudity of about 15 elderly women for a full minute on screen funny? Are you trying to shock us into laughter because we have no other way to respond to something so depraved? And if it wasn't meant for comedy (even though Aster publicly said it was) then what could have been the purpose when the same plot point could have been covered by them being clothed onlookers? The perversion and level of gratuitous filth in this movie were terrible, but the fact that they didn't even progress the story or theme was what was the most disturbing part. It wasn't even for something valuable to the production.<br/><br/>Lastly, this whole 'its really a break up movie' gimmick could have been okay, if you weren't asking us to side with the girl who murdered her partner of 3 and a half years instead of a cult member who has killed all of her friends. And what was the boyfriend's crime? Wanting out of a relationship that was toxic, but waiting to break up because the girls entire family just died? I get that he is a jerk about the thesis thing, but in terms of the relationship, he was beyond supportive. She was the one who cheated with the swedish friend first and who accused him of forgetting her birthday, which, he actually didn't do. So what exactly is Aster wanting us to enjoy about his take on the break up where the 'heroine' murdered the one person who didn't think he should break up with her right after she lost three family members?<br/><br/>Beyond all of that, the movie was underwhelming in terms of scares or terror. It was neither a thriller nor a collection of jump scares or chase scenes. Now those have been done to death (pun intended) by the horror genre, but what was scary in this movie? The people killing themselves of their own volition? The off screen disappearances?<br/><br/>I was disgusted by the depravity of this film and entirely disappointed in it's lack of any statement about the views or choices of the characters or situation. It was a movie with plot points and then it ended. That was as deep as this film got."

","Midsommar
Century 16 Theater
Watched 7/16/19<br/><br/>Horror is my favorite genre to see done right, because it's so rarely done right. Director and writer Ari Aster had something very special with his first film Hereditary. Perhaps the film most recommended to me in the last few years. I have yet to see it, but after last night's screening of his 2nd and newest feature: Midsommar; I made immediate plans to rectify that.<br/><br/>It's easy to just say a group of friends travel to Europe to write their college thesis on European pagan traditions but that would be a disservice to the early story Aster creates. I want to keep the plot description mum, but the early parts of this film are stricken with grief, angst, and some of the most realistic portrayals of gaslighting I've seen on film. These are the emotional bricks the story is constructed on. I never found myself waiting for them to just hurry up and go to Europe because the story is so effectively written and performed.<br/><br/>Once they arrive to the small Swedish commune, the entire story starts shifting into something else entirely. We just get a feeling in our gut, all these smiling white people. Their all white garb, white teeth, white hair. It's an uneasy amount of white and cleanliness, positioned on gorgeous green hills speckled with bright blue, red, pink and purple flowers. Aster's use of color brilliantly fills the screen. It's a rather unsettling feeling: all this natural beauty and we can't take comfort in any of it.<br/><br/>When we learn about the Midsommar festivities planned it seems like a big party for the students, we in the audience see the madness through the flowers. Things get turned to 11 quickly. We see people jumping to their deaths from towering cliffs, faces get smashed with hammers, faces get cutoff and worn as masks, menstrual blood consumed, incredibly graphic, brutal violence.<br/><br/>Tonally it's a trip because there is also so much humor injected into the script. Mainly the joke of the kids freaking out and their smiling, white (oh so white) hosts calming them down; assuring them that this is all merely tradition. Smashing someone's head open with a large mallet is simply setting their willing soul free, it's not a big deal. You see? He likes getting his brains bashed in! It beats growing old in a nursing home! The things these kids get put through are wonderfully dreadful.<br/><br/>Midsommar is a splendid display of young talent. Florence Pugh's portrayal of Dani is incredible. Her expressions are mesmerizing, she conveys so much emotion with her face. I felt a little less compelled by her boyfriend Christian played by Jack Reynor. We're very clearly not supposed to like his character, but I didn't like him due to his performance. It felt stiff and at times a little forced. Physically he was perfect for the role, but his delivery and timing left me feeling sort of...meh. Luckily the writing is so strong I never get too caught up in that. Even if one performance feels a little less compelling, the important part is the gang of young friends' performances and personalities work as a whole.<br/><br/>Aster's ability to pace a 2-and-a-half-hour film and make it feel short is the genius. Every single scene feels important, there are so many details and carefully crafted instances of foreshadowing. Not heavy handed, but deft and nerve racking. In a time where attention spans are shrinking it's rewarding and refreshing to see a film not only take it's time but to do so in a way that makes the film work even better. It's not self-indulgent, it's vulnerable and enticing. I want to see this one again just to see exactly what he sets up earlier in the film. Midsommar is upsetting, grotesque, beautiful and humorous all at once. It's a great horror film and being as though it's only Aster's 2nd feature, the next step in his career is an exciting thought."

So for a whole hour the girl is crying, complaining and being so insecure it was annoying. Why did she even go on the trip, why did the friends let her if they hated her so much? If I was planning a girls trip and one friends annoying, needy boyfriend hopped on at the last minute, I would have something to say. Nothing these people did was logical. Weird creepy cult or not. Friends disappear, no one is concerned. Find a red hot pubey in your soup and you know who did it but continue eating and drinking. Grandma and Grandpa jump to their death and everyone still stays. Grandpa did it wrong, so the other children of the corn, helped him out, not once, not twice but a few times. Yeah I think you got him. The weird love making scene.... I was shocked and I also laughed. All the moaning and screaming while some weirdo physically helps you out because let's face it, they're tired of screaming. When the friend gets it, for taking pictures of the coloring book/Bible, the sloth from Goonies, pulls a house of wax/ house of a 1000 corpses and is wearing another person's face.

","'Midsommar (2019)' takes a very long time to get to a very predictable and, frankly, uninteresting point. It's just so slow and, honestly, boring. There's nothing all that engaging about the story, and perhaps its most - or, maybe, only - intriguing thematic aspect is reserved until the very end - the final shot, even. This seems to be as spur-of-the-moment for the film as the decision that leads to it does for the central character. The general theming of the feature isn't all that strong or cohesive and its events don't act as an 'allegory' for the theme, either. This leads to an aimless vibe, a sense of almost making things up as they go along. This creates some issues when everything starts tying together, especially in terms of overall motivation. I mean, some things in here just aren't believable. Plus there's no actual mystery driving the plot, so there's never any tension or suspense. I will say that one sequence is properly horrifying, punctuated by gruesome imagery not for the faint of heart, but it stands as the sole example of something that comes close to getting under your skin and, as such, feels sort of out of place, in a way. It's also brushed off quite quickly, despite being revisited a few times. Still, the film isn't scary. It's not disturbing, either. Most of the 'horror' just comes from the unfamiliarity of the situation - that being a foreign festival presented as a long-held, normalised tradition - from an outside perspective. On top of that, you don't care about the characters - who often make odd, audience-distancing decisions - enough to be affected when things inevitably take a darker turn. That's a bit of an issue. Obviously, the piece is well made, no-one's debating that. It has an effective, if slightly obnoxious, score and makes some distinct visual choices. However, technical competence cannot make up for narrative failure. The opposite of this seems to be the erroneous basis for most of the movie's somehow glowing reviews. Of course, if you really like it, then you like it and that's good for you. I'm just saying that there comes a point where you have to stop awarding, essentially, participation points to well-made but empty fare; most pictures are at least competently constructed and even those that aren't can be enjoyable - or more enjoyable than something like this, at least. The film isn't engaging, entertaining or even close to terrifying, despite its undeniable technical competence. Also, the influences of 'The Wicker Man (1973)' are unmistakable - it actually has quite a bit in common with 'The Wicker Man (2006)', as well. Look, horror doesn't have to scare, as such, but it should do something. This doesn't really do anything and it takes a very long time to do it, too. 4/10"

","I have never written a movie review before, but I felt like I needed to for this movie especially after its hype and good reviews for which I don't understand.<br/><br/>The good:
To start, the movie was filmed beautifully. To be honest, that's basically what kept me in the theaters. The camera work was stellar and the death scenes were pretty good. The beginning of the movie did draw you in well, giving you important info about the girl's troubles which gave me great hope for the rest of the film. As a thriller, I could see how some would have slightly more to say here, but for me, this is basically all to the good section.. sadly.<br/><br/>The bad:
First off, seeing so many trailers of this movie had me so excited. It always was showing creepy images, describing how disturbing it'll be, and how many critically acclaimed people ""loved"" it. However, the movie delivered none of this. I wasn't disturbed in any way throughout the entire movie. None of the weird dances, deaths, rituals, runes, settings, or dialogue had me feeling awkward. So for me, that was definitely the biggest let down because I was expecting even just one scene (like Hereditary when the girl's head comes off or the bugs etc) to have me on the edge of my seat due to the way the movie was advertised. Secondly, I was BORED. It was like one of those netflix movies you try out and watch for 30 minutes and decide to change it because of its sheer inability to develop into anything. This movie could have been an hour and a half and done the same exact thing it did with it being two hours and thirty minutes long. For the length of the movie it failed to develop any of the other characters and it failed to connect any of the ideas and underlying meanings together. You basically watch something where you can predict literally everything that will happen (seriously, everything) and then watch it's pathetic ending of the main female character smiling. Really? No twists and we also close with that sad ending? Lastly, I love movies with underlying meanings and symbolic pieces. However, what's the point when the symbolic stuff is in another language? You see all of these runes depicted that mean something for the characters, showing a piece of them and foreshadowing, yet, you can't understand any of it. I had to look up an explanation of the movie, not cause I was like WOAH WHAT JUST HAPPENED? But because I was simply saying, wtf and hoping the symbolism would make me think better if the movie. Even when discovering the runes meanings I was still disappointed in the lack of depth.<br/><br/>Conclusion!
The movie was fine. Based on the display it was amazing, but the over drawn story with its lack of depth, predictability, and sad attempts of ""disturbing,"" were extremely disappointing. There are many things I missed and I can see how one may like it a bit more, but for me this movie was pretty terrible and I can't see how one would ever love this film."

It was way too long, the acting is an abomination, and no matter how good the cinematography is, it can't possibly make up for the ludicrous mess of a film I just saw. DO NOT listen to the critic reviews, or headlines. This movie is not scary, and it's certainly not suspenseful-because there's no climax to lead up to. What's worse, the ending smacks of repeat from Aster's previous film. He's a one-trick pony, and this film seals the deal. I didn't care about any of the characters, despite unresolved and totally unexplored backstory. They are complete idiots for staying for the entire pagan festival. Every activity, every scene is based on drugs, and why would anyone do any drugs while isolated in a village that seems to glorify death?<br/><br/>The entire premise of the movie is predicated on an event that, had it not happened, none of the ensuing events would ever have taken place. Is this a yearly festival, or is it every 90 years? There sure were an awful lot of pictures of May Queens...the plot holes are endless. Out-of-place movie references (apparently this electricity-free village has a TV and access to movies from the 90s!) Rituals and games that make no sense and are never explained. Characters standing around in silence for no reason with bizarre looks on their faces. Gross shots of old naked people. Stupid jokes that made no one in the theater laugh. In fact, the entire audience was laughing at all the parts that were supposed to be serious moments. This is usually an indication that the film director has FAILED MISERABLY.<br/><br/>So many missed opportunities for a good horror film that were totally abandoned. And don't give me this garbage that the movie was supposed to be some sort of metaphor for a failed relationship. That just insults the intelligence of everyone who makes the unfortunate mistake of viewing this film. This movie was a waste of time, money, and my intellect.

The film was basically a perfect example of things happening slowly with no climax or resolution but they get away with it because the director decides to put in trippy elements that make no sense to fake the audience out with a false ""deeper meaning"".

My thinking at the start of the film was a wonderful group of young people going to enjoy an outdoor festival in the middle of the summer in a beautiful location only to find things weren't quite as they thought they were going to be. This is the case with this film but instead we are quickly introduced to some elders whose lives never pass their early 70s, then wonder what on earth for and what happens to them? Soon we find out and the results are pretty damn horrific and not for the squeemish. After stomaching that, we are then held on tender hooks as to what is going to happen to our American friends in the movie and as the film moves on in all it's dreary tedious progression, i really wanted out of the cinema. To cap it all we are shown a mysterious pyramid shape building which no one is allowed to enter and by the end of the film we are shown why.

","This is one of the most boring movies I have seen in a long time. One one side, a group of extremely stereotyped American students. On the other side, a sort of utopian fascist society. It could be interesting but none of the actors have any depth in their acting. The movie is painful to watch as the camera is frequently moving without purpose. And then, it is an endless series of scenes more ridiculous than the other. I was frankly laughing at some point as every scene seemed predictable to me, even though they were purposefully meant to be weird. The gore scenes frankly do not add much to the movie. The final shot is the only interesting thing in that movie as it adds a depth to one of the main characters but these five seconds are not going to save the two hours and a half that I spent watching this. Do not waste your money."

","If you like Saw, or slasher movies, don't bother with this, it's a slow burn, it's beautiful to watch, breathtakingly shot, and is sinister as hell. A lot of haters must have expected something else, it is a story of extreme loss and sadness, thrust into a increasingly disturbing folk ritual. Yes, you can predict something bad is going to happen, that's the point, so how can you say it's predictable? Isn't that what you expect? None of that takes away from how the story flows, once things turn weird, you know you're in for a wicked ride.
There's a sense of helplessness that is terrifying, Florence Pugh is incredible, the humanity she exudes makes her critical in her role.

","I love Ari Asters work, so I booked a ticket for midsommar very early. After i'd already booked my ticket I began seeing a massive amount of negative reviews for this movie. Naturally I was a bit worried, but after seeing this movie last night I couldn't disagree more.<br/><br/>This is one of the most beautifully shot movies I've ever seen. Asters use of bright sunlight stands out from most modern horror movies which are far too often dominated by darkness. The themes of white and green in this movie juxtapose with scenes of gore and blood, creating haunting imagery that will stick with you after you leave the cinema.<br/><br/>This movie isn't exactly thrilling but it is scary despite what many people say. I think the key to finding this movie frightening is to really try and put yourself in the mind of the characters. Something I didn't expect walking into this movie is how funny it is, throughout the first two acts the whole cinema was laughing together. The way in which Aster competently weaves together horror and gore with scenes that will make you smile is truly phenomenal.<br/><br/>Now i'd just like to address some of the main criticisms I've seen in other user reviews:
<ul><li>many people think that this movie was predictable, although some key plot points could be described as predictable I don't think anyone could have predicted anything that happened in the third act. if you really new from the start that Christian was going to end up inside of a dead bears skin and burnt to death in a temple then kudos</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>many people think that the main character, Dani, makes unrealistic decisions, without considering the fact that shes on strong psychoactive drugs for most of the run time, her sister has just killed her mum and dad and herself and then her boyfriend of four years cheats on her during the festival. Personally i think that under these circumstances I might act a bit different too</li></ul><br/><br/>

","I had heard good things about this but at no point did they say that the movie was an uncredited remake of far superior Wicker Man. Like Darklands this is pointless retread of familiar themes of paganism and renewing the land by the sacrifice of blood.<br/><br/>The Plot.<br/><br/>A really miserable frumpy woman repays the kindness shown by her boyfriend with hate. She is simple and misguided throughout. The best bit of the movie is the guys hanging out at the start. They all chat and say, hey why are you hanging out this that woman, she is miserable and just no fun to be with. Also she does not like sex. So this frumpy woman emotionally bludgeoned her man into taking her on a trip to Sweden. At no point do you understand why he would date her, she is really horrible to him throughout the movie.<br/><br/>They get to Sweden and the place is so boring you would leave immediately. They decide to say on and it is all downhill from there. Also as soon as you see the Pyramid house, you know it is the wicker man.<br/><br/>Thoughts
This like his last movie was a slow predictable movie for people who have not watched the originals. I watched it and thought it would never end. This is the wicker man. Okay they replaced the aforementioned man made from Wicker with a house but the effect was the same. The stupid games that they played on Woodward they play on all the characters. Also there is a switch to the May queen as the final denouement. Apart from that it is basically the same movie. Also there is a couple of bits where they steal scenes from Hershall Gordon Lewis's 2000 Maniacs.<br/><br/>Watch it, if you want to watch a chick flick version of The Wicker Man. If is for the fans (if there are any) of the Neil La Bute Wicker man or the sequel to the original movie The Wicker Tree. Or the Welsh version Darklands.<br/><br/>If you liked the original movie do not bother with this pointless remake."

","I believe that even after just his second feature Ari Aster's name will be synonymous with bizarre/polarizing/dreadful cinema; his name might even become an adjective/verb or a categorization for film altogether (Lynchian, for instance).<br/><br/>This movie kind of left about the same impression Hereditary left me with after the first view. After my first viewing of Hereditary I felt that it was just good, after a few more viewings and analyses, I now consider it a genius take on trauma and grief. I have a feeling this is what I'm going to come to realize from Midsommar. It was definitely insane with surreal imagery, but I honestly wish there was more backstory to Dani and her family; if there was more of a fleshed out concept about Dani and her family I feel like the movie would've have a more circular conclusion. But now knowing the kind of filmmaker Aster is shaping up to be, I don't think closure is what he aims for at all, leaving just enough to the imagination to push your buttons even further.<br/><br/>Florence Pugh humanizes the surreal scenes with her presence. She's a great anchor for the plot.<br/><br/>Definitely going to be taking another look at this."

"cory_j_adams","10","31","50","4 January 2020"," A surrealistic look at what it means to hurt the ones you should care for
","First and foremost, let me start off by saying that this film will definitely not be for everyone. Most people who see this film will more than likely not understand what it's saying, which is fine. That's part of the beauty of cinema, it's subjective. And people are entitled to their own opinions.<br/><br/>In my personal experience with this film, Midsommar effected me greatly. The first time I saw it I found it bizarre and grandiose, surreal and visceral. The kind of film that is saying something, but not so loudly that it overwhelms you with it's themes. In fact, it more so invites you to discover what it's saying. And it says a lot. I saw the film 3 times in theaters and I feel like I still haven't grasped entirely what the film means because much of it is very ambiguous. Ari Aster is smart in the regard that he knows what we don't see is much more terrifying than what we do. With that being said, I don't know if I would necessarily categorize this film as a horror movie. It's more of a psychological drama with elements of horror. But genre is merely a pigeonhole that we place films in based on how they make us feel. Regardless of genre, Mr. Aster has made a supremely effective look at a victim's complicated response to those who have hurt her.<br/><br/>Visually, this film is a feast for the eyes. I don't think I've seen a better looking film in 2019 (besides The Lighthouse but in an entirely different fashion). It's use of color and lighting pretty much engulfs the viewer in this strange world that our protagonists have entered. It's some of the finest cinematography I've seen all year. The camerawork is very seamless and vast, as if painting a picture for us. Revealing things through use of imagery is no small task, but Aster and his cinematographer, Pawel Pogorzelski, pull this task off almost flawlessly (which is why I recommend multiple viewings of this film. It has a lot to say through its use of imagery. I'm sure there are some things I still haven't noticed and I've seen the film about 5 times now). This is awards-worthy work from this cinematographer, and I hope he gets the recognition he deserves.<br/><br/>The costume and set design also thoroughly impress, with the small commune appearing to be a world uncorrupted by the outside. We're meant to be fascinated and fearful of this place and the design of the buildings and structures as well as the way they're presented evoke these responses effortlessly. It makes us wonder what's going on behind the walls of the sacred temples that appear so strange to us.<br/><br/>The script for the film is also impressive, though I will say it is definitely not to the magnitude of what Aster did with Hereditary. But Hereditary is entirely different monster altogether. That film was what I would call claustrophobic. This film is vast and wide. Sparking our curiosity while also simultaneously alerting us that a certain danger lurks just beneath the bright exterior. One critic commented that this film is staged more like an opera than a horror film, and I wholeheartedly agree. This is a very well written film but instead of assaulting us with its themes it asks us to look for them ourselves. To interpret them in our own way, which is one of my favorite things about this film (though I can understand why some audiences will be turned off by this).<br/><br/>Now let me get to my favorite aspect of any film: the acting. I'll start off first with the woman at the center of it all, Miss Florence Pugh. I've been watching her ever since I saw her impressive debut in 2016's Lady Macbeth, where she delivered one of the most unnerving performances I've ever seen given by an actress. Here she delivers one of the most vivid performances of the year. In every scene she's in in this film, she is open and vulnerable. As if she has no where that she can hide what she's feeling. And in a way, she doesn't. She's a fountain of emotion, sometimes bursting with an energy that fills the entire screen. It's a mesmerizing performance that allows her to put her full range on display. The supporting players are also very good, with Will Poulter in particular being a standout for providing much needed comic relief (making this film actually surprisingly hilarious at times). Jack Reynor also holds his own as the manipulative boyfriend who doesn't know when to leave well enough alone. Vilhelm Blomgren as their native Swedish friend, also impresses, his performance being sympathetic while also being entirely enigmatic. And William Jackson Harper (of Good Place fame) gives only what I can call a driven performance, advancing the plot towards the insane finale that we all know is coming.<br/><br/>Some people have said that they have found the film tedious and with a few plot holes and I can see why. Some things are left ambiguous, but not outright unanswered. And I think that's the point. It's all part of what your interpretation is.<br/><br/>Regardless of it's flaws, Midsommar is a complex study on grief and trauma. It will effect many viewers (some more than others), and will more than likely be a film that will be talked about years from now as a cinematic phenomenon that people will always be entranced by (similar to Kubrick's The Shining). And though it's not outright scary, it will unnerve you. Which is almost better than being scared."

The movie has no story, no development and no meaning. You can call me shallow as you want, I have seen good movies which are hard to understand at the beginning.
First of all, what does Dani's family situation has to do with what happened in later part of the movie? Her sister could be healthy and her parents could be alive and still have no effects on the movie.
Secondly, what's the meaning of other two guys of that london couple ? They give no push to the story, they don't even have to be in the movie.
Thirdly, it's very unnatural how Dani and Christian's tension built up, like what really happened besides they just keep being drugged?
The whole movie just seems very pretending, trying so hard to be arty and different. It's like a kid's storybook, just have several nice pictures and then it becomes a story?
I can't feel I get devoted into the story at all because there is none. And the unnecessary bloody scenes just purely uncomfortable. The whole movie is more like a documentary of daily life of a cult.

","I was like a lot of them-I had this sucker reserved for a spot in my top ten this year as soon as I stopped watching the trailer half way through.<br/><br/>This is a movie with empty promises. There might have been a wonderful idea at some point, but this made water torture sound like a delight. These characters don't have a breath of life in them from the first boring introduction. After all they are just senseless cattle being led to a finale stealing (not even borrowing) from the likes of Texas Chainsaw, Antichrist, Silence of the Lambs and Picnic at Hanging Rock, but in a 2 hour and 20 minute run time, you think there would be time to break from 2 dimensions....well you'd be wrong. The entire cast (lead aside for now) has an acting range from A to B with this rough draft of a script.
Remember Toni's devastating performance in Hereditary? The pain felt in words after that scream that you'll never stop hearing? Well Aster must have just thought the scream worked, because that's the most you get from Pugh for the first 45 minutes. Screaming. Her introduction couldn't have been more boring, (it's her having a Facebook style panic attack on her cell phone and laptop simultaneously in a one woman show that last 6 minutes) and there is no mercy or attachment to her or her loss we can give her by just seeing some fancy aftermath. She's introduced to us without life or charm and we're asked to feel terrible for her because of two grizzly images?
And this is the problem with the entire movie if that's what they're calling this. I am not opposed to the grotesque or gore. I'm opposed to using it when you have nothing else. This film rises its crescendos, reaches its breaking tension points and you feel like you might as well have been watching a brick wall crumble. There is no effect on the audience, no matter how artsy this geek show gets. When you get to these scenes that are supposed to take you over and arrest you...you feel...nothing. And to be asked to take this so deathly seriously, is almost offensive on how poorly this was done.

"bangbang_yourhead","10","32","53","29 January 2020"," Great entry into the ""Folk Horror"" subgenre
","Not sure what all of these bad reviews are for....probably written by people who have never appreciated films like the original Wicker Man. Very stylish, beautifully shot and very well done. It has some truly haunting imagery...anyone who says this isn't horror has a very narrow definition and pedestrian expectations. Suspenseful and makes you think about the nature of relationships as well as the power or religious belief over the human mind. Could also fall under the ""breakup movie"" and ""revenge film"" subgenres. One of my favorite more recent Horror/ Suspense/ Thrillers. There is a lot of black humor laced throughout and I found it intentionally funny at times (so buzz off: people commenting that there were laughs in the theater). The psychedelic episodes were enough to give anyone who has experienced hallucinogenic drugs a flashback. Only criticism is, like most (if not all) films of this nature, it relies on characters making poor decisions in order to advance the plot. But that is the nature of many a Horror film and you could argue those bad decisions and judgments are the crux of films like this. Comes across like a beautiful, folky, waking nightmare. Highly recommended."

Artistic license exists and to get upset by slight discrepancies in dress and, I can't believe I have to say this, the position of the sun in relation to Hungary and Sweden. Most movies aren't filmed in the location that they are set in for tons of reasons to many to list here. If you complain about stuff like that I've got news for you people jumping off cliffs because they reached the age of 72 isn't happening in Hungary or Sweden so blow your cork about that and not costumes and placement of the sun . This movie is garbage nearly as bad as the Nick Cage version.

"cerviusiratus","1","9","12","30 May 2020"," A bad film than can be entertaining
","Why?<br/><br/>The lack of verisimilitude leaves you two options: 1-. Run away or 2-. Keep watching.<br/><br/>What about if you choose 2?<br/><br/>You will be confronted with stereotypes recurrent ad nauseam in films of this genre: a group of youngsters killed one by one; of course we are talking about human sacrifices carried by members of a pagan community with excellent taste when it comes to the decorative arts - it shows the production department made a huge effort at this. Politically incorrectness would have set the stage among a group of dark skinned natives living in Tropical Land, but, in this case the natives are Swedes, namely, humans as white as ghosts and dressed in white (women with flowers in their heads, jutys to add to the stereotype), happy to the paroxysm of cherishing ancestral customs that are for the ""Babes - in - the - Woods - like"" visitors, simply ghastly.<br/><br/>Where does the lack of verisimilitude lie?<br/><br/>1-. Members of the group of American doctoral students in Anthropology visiting the community are of such naivetÃ© that one cannot help feeling exasperated: they are simply stupid. Even worse, they don't even talk the language of the group of people they will be observing, either with scientific or entertaining purposes.<br/><br/>2-. The setting: how can such a community exist in a state like Sweden's? You don't have to be a Political Science 101 student to realize that the mere existence of such a group would mean Sweden would be a failed state. Yap, it would have been less politically correct, but sticking to the old formula would have add verisimilitude to the plot at the risk of eliminating sarcasm - I think this could have been solved setting the plot in a fictitious country.<br/><br/>3-. The host, Pelle, a member of this pagan community, happens to be a student in an American University and a friend of the would be victims - something is wrong here: if this were true, he would have known that his friends would not bare the customs of his people, so this would rule out any invitation. But Pelle is indifferent to this, so I assume he does not care as to the practical consequences the clash of cultures might have - this does not make sense at all, even more so taking into account Pelle is an Anthropology student. Or, maybe, after all, he was after victims... regardless of his intentions, his presence in the USA and his contacts there would not rule out consequences after the facts portraited in the film.<br/><br/>3-. Cross references to the Silence of the Lambs: I would say there is an abuse of bodies set in a theatrical scenery when trying to convey the idea of maximum horror. Same here.<br/><br/>4-. The effort put at the description of rites: this was, to be honest, the most unbearable passages of the film. Not because of the anxiousness around horror unleashing upon viewers, rather how ridicule all these rites looked, a torture, really, for these rites take a significant amount of shooting time - for fun, I could not avoid imaging the film's team thinking outlook how these rites were to be. Notable: I even felt pity at how Swedes were portrait, even more so at the extras.<br/><br/>Recap, I think it is a good option if you are into the genre and if you don't mind these things. If you do, you will end up doing what I did: fast forwarding just to end the fim as soon as I could."

"abisio","1","94","175","4 July 2019"," An unnecessary long and boring remake of The Wicker Man and The Wicker Tree
","The original Wicker Man (1973, with Christopher Lee) was not a terrifying movie until the very end but the suspense kept everybody guessing. The movie become a cult sensation (at least some of the final cuts of the film) not as an horror movie but as a metaphoric view of religion and society; there was some legends that the movie was based on real facts about Pagan cults, north of UK. The Wicker Tree has the same original director and a very similar story but instead of a Christian Police we have an Evangelical couple on a difficult relationship.
Midsommar takes basically the couple in crisis and a couple other characters, moves them to Sweden instead of UK.<br/><br/>After a family tragedy; a girl joins her former boyfriend and some other friends, a group of grad students working on a thesis, on a visit to a Sweden community to appreciate the summer solstice celebration.<br/><br/>They meet there white dressed community; quite inclined to drugs and rituals (and strange music).<br/><br/>Ari Asher already showed he prefer style over substance (and story) on Hereditary (a movie that copy a lot from Rosemary baby's and other horror classics) but at least that movie was shorter.<br/><br/>It seems he loves to film but hates editing; basically in love with his own scenes. Here, the continuous display of white dressed people dancing, playing instrumental music and doing strange rituals (in eternal daylight) becomes tediously repetitive without adding anything to the promised intrigue. Characters reactions became so absurd that even the movie laughs about some events. Clocking over 140 minutes the movie will be too slow even cutting an hour off. It is incredible that with such unnecessary length the resolution is rushed and confusing.<br/><br/>There are couple of violent deaths shown, and a few others not. Everything quite predictable and not very engaging; because the director keeps distance with the main characters avoiding any empathy. In fact it is never clear if anyone is worth saving; specially Puig characters who is borderline obsessive and perhaps psychotic.<br/><br/>In brief; there is no horror, the movie is tedious and far from entertaining. Critics praised it because its pictoric values, but people run out of the cinema after a while or start snoring. Skip this one and go to see something worth like THE FALL OF THE AMERICAN EMPIRE"
"shiftingmoments","1","17","26","9 May 2020"," WHY
","Literally, all I can say is WHY? Who funded this? Why make it and why did I watch it.
Immediately after, I pulled up a video of the Director's trailer commentary to explain the plot, inspirations, and the genre/direction. My reaction to his explanation was a constant eye roll!<br/><br/>He said it's a break up move, yet there is not enough character development before the tragedy and distasteful gore to even care about the characters, let alone remember their names. THEN he equates the human life of her boyfriend to a 'box full of toxic memories to throw into the fire to burn it all away'...an Oddly literal statement and very unsettling plot for a movie Ari but now I understand, the goal actually was to leave the audience with a sick depraved feeling in their stomach. But wait, the director said, ""he wants to leave the audience confused."" Sure, but the only thing I'm wondering is why I invested any of my time into this film. It just feels so unnecessary. Not my style. Ironically we recently watched the original wicker man-not knowing the 'influence' here, while viewing my husband and I both agreed it felt unoriginal and shallow. I almost want to apologize because I've never hated on a movie so much but I'm not sorry."

","Not a shred of continuity throughout the entire movie. Will Poulter, the only actor you'll likely recognize, is the only redeeming quality of this disaster, and his screen time is minimal. Apparently I'm thick, because I'm not seeing the value that so many others are professing. Sure, it shares the same cinematographer as Hereditary, but this isn't a silent movie, and that's where the similarities end. See it if you feel you must, but I wish I would have waited for it to go to Red Box or streaming and saved myself the extra money. I was duped by the glowing reviews. I should have delved into them a bit deeper and saw through the layers-""can only be enjoyed high"", ""bizarre..."".
If you're looking for a great mind-f#%! movie then you really cannot even raise this movie to that plane. The only other enjoyable moment, aside from Mr. Poulter, was the explanation of their view on the cycle of life, but that's not saying much. Otherwise it seemed that a bunch of buddies sat around a table with a very loose idea - ""it's going to be about a cult"" - and then tried to weave every single idea that someone threw-out into this poor effort."

The CH element is from studying ""others"" in their native surroundings, and yes - there is cannibalism here, or at least implied. While a step up from Hereditary, and be honest - did you really expect the cheep jump scare / Annabelle type action at the end of that movie, Aster still can't figure out how to construct a film where viewing it isn't an ambient experience. The music was great (like his previous film), the visuals impeccable (you might have another Kubrick in waiting here, I'm not kidding), but he can't write. The dialog is clunky, and the plot telegraphed pretty early on. While I knew what was happening and how it will wrap up, I just didn't care. At some point you realize that you are just being moved from space A to B, etc. and turn your brain off, there isn't much you are going to discover. I'd say save your money and watch it at home, but even then you might find something else to do - at least in a theater you have to sit still."

","I admit, I went in withfairly high expectations here. I had thought that the film would be less a horror and more based on an analysis of the psychology of being in a cult. The film while initially intriguing becomes abruptly, about halfway through, very painful to watch, probably to compensate for it's lack of substance. If you are intrigued by Midsommar because you're expecting it to be like the Wickerman (original film) you'll be disappointed. The characters are very passive. They are irritatingly idiotic and there are no redeeming features about any of them by the time the film is reaches it's paaaaainfully slooooow conclusion. Believe me, it is painful.<br/><br/>The truly bizarre aspect about Midsommar, is that initially the film carries a sense of impending morbid sort of dread, which is very effective.<br/><br/>However, the writer/director seems to, later on in the story, drive this morbid dread into overkill, as if to deliberately outrage the audience in an attempt to rival other films that carry a similar genre? Who knows. But this is what ruins the film.<br/><br/>It comes across as unnecessary because you are just watching what I have already described in the review's title. It's as if the diretor/writer made it their personal drive to make the film so unbearable in the hopes of outraging the audience. However, it is this drive that ultimately paints Midsommar as a film that is trying to comes across as something more than it is. Unfortunately it is ultimately nothing more than a standard format of a horror film hiding in the clothes of something profound sounding and feeling."

Now, i perfectly understand why he gets such a high score for such non sense. people in general rate a movie higher when it takes itself seriously(from the beginning to the end), when there are strange visual objects(the triangular building) and when the subjects of the film act seriously. also when its a bit of a strange plot. But the thing is this director is a one trick pony. There's no suspense in his film like hitchcock(think of the scene in psycho where the lady crossing the road in the beginning recognizes the driver)those scenes that makes you perk up for a moment. There's no ultimate sense of satisfaction in a film(comes in many forms, too many examples to mention). There's no actual scare or horror in his film.(think of when silence of the lambs Hopkins escapes his jailer, there's a moment of horror. think of when in psycho the mom comes from upstairs really quickly and stabs a person, that's a scare.) again, there's none of those scares or horror in this film. i saw the plot pretty early, they are all getting whacked one by one. There's probably one flicker of light that flickered for a moment, it's when they showed that grotesque inbred creature for the first time. For some reason when i first saw him, my movie mind took me to a place of films from the 70's era, where dark creatures devoured human subjects in films. I thought the film would expound of his character, but not at all. And then, the elephant in the room, show gore visuals of people getting whacked, i don't know if there's a sadistic group of gore movie fans that have formed to follow this movie director around, but i don't see why they would. if i want to see gore, i can go to these websites and see mexican drug cartels blow some's head half off with a shotgun up close. Thus this director fails, and yet he has somehow found a niche where he now resides. he hasn't shown me anything yet other than he likes to treat his film seriously and show lots of gore."

"kiaragajo","4","48","86","1 August 2019"," Unsatisfying
","I just finished watching this movie with a few friends so maybe I need a little more time to analyze and discuss the movie, but as of right now, I think it's safe to say that Midsommar was one of the most nauseating and unexplained pieces
of work of all time. Based on the trailer, I was quite excited to watch such a thrilling, interesting concept with a disturbing cult and likable cast members like Florence Pugh and Will Poulter. However, 20 minutes into the movie and there are already so many open ended questions that are, not only unanswered and unexplained, but are unnecessarily long and unsettling in such a sickening way.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I love horror films as well as how this one had more of an indie, contemporary vibe instead of straight up thriller, but the way some of the scenes were played out, especially with how there was little to no explanation or any backstory as to how the cult formed or how it got to be of that current point was simply unjust to storytelling. The focus of the movie was just to show how creepy and strange the people in the cult were at the time and in comparison to the foreign, yet normally civilized, Americans that embarked on the trip for either a thesis for a PHD or just to hang out and mingle with women. However, the movie failed to show how the cult was brainwashed, if it was mainly the drugging of foreign people or if they were all just born messed up but it really was just odd. Not to completely squander an idea and a set of customs that could as well be a real thing, but by showing one messed up thing after another, with little to no information, justification, or explanation as to what was going on, the vibe of the whole movie itself was just strange and grotesque.
It is interesting that all of the horrific scenes were done in broad daylight, taking a turn from the traditional ""dark and stormy night"" setting of horror, however, the actual plot was extremely overshadowed by shoving scenes of drugging and rape, gruesome deaths, and physical human deficiencies into audiences faces that questions remained unanswered. Audiences are unaware of the death specifics of protagonist, Dani's family and if that was related to the cult or her involvement on the trip. Characters like Josh, Mark, and Pelle are all left in the dark of their true characteristics for 2 of them die and are written off and Pelle's past is so unknown and mysterious, we don't know whether to trust him or to hate him for his allegiance to his cult.
The cult is also extremely violent and are seen eating little to no food during the whole film, none of which is explained. We don't know who the leaders are, how they are chosen, how and why the cult formed, what the May Queen resembles, how long they have been a community, what their motives are, whether they just hate foreigners or Americans, and many more. Although having this mystery to the movie is common and typically fine, leaving the movie so open ended was so strange and unsatisfying to accept.
There are many possible explanations to this film, whether it was all a figment of Dani's unstable mental imagination or if it was a political statement to America or religion, however, I felt lost on so many aspects and found myself wishing so many scenes could be cut out or altered.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the cinematography, I thought the shots of Sweden were gorgeous, the soundtrack was creepy and constantly had excellent build up. Florence Pugh's performance was great and convincing and characters were made either likable or not right off the bat which was fantastic. The vibe of the movie was just so unsettling and downright disgusting that I left the theater wanting to vomit instead of being intrigued in the characters and the story. Not to mention that the plot was so undermined by the overly extended need to implement something creepy that had little to do with continuing the storyline.
I just wish a lot of things were explained in the film better rather than ending it with more questions and a confusing state of mind.
I honestly wish I liked it better as well considering the concept was so interesting and fresh, I with the storyline was better thought out."

When I watched the trailer my expectations were high and I was pumped, however after seeing it I realized that the trailer was better put together than this two and a half hour written waste of time. Nothing about this movie was thrilling, it just droned on and never reached any kind of goal. The plot never went anywhere and literally everything is either a half-assed explanationor is left as is. The Room was better written than this but at least The Room was laughable and had somekind of end, while this movie left people in our theater with an ""okay?"" and ""So what?"" reaction.

","I'm sorry. I actually had to renew my membership on IMDB just to vent my thoughts on this film. I'll be short and to the point. Ari's sophomore try was nothing more than Hereditary meets the Sound of Music and dear God, these village folk could take a few singing lessons from the Von Trapps!<br/><br/>Without giving away too much, the premise started to evolve into something relatively interesting early on but quickly fizzled out into some brain-sucking, simple-minded plot. Please don't call it art. Please don't praise it as craft. Definitely don't call it horror. Some scenes are viscerally shocking, actually nauseating sure, but it's not a good sign when people are laughing hysterically at what is supposedly a horror film. Admittedly, I stuck it out to the end though, albeit with a hell of a headache, only to find out that even the credits sucked with soundtrack choices that made no sense at all. On another note, the volume track was over-proportionately loud, perhaps on purpose in order to annoy the viewer into submission. The ONLY redeeming value here was Pugh's performance. In this case, it literally took a village to destroy it. M. Night Shamalayan immediately came to mind, trying incessantly to repeat that Sixth Sense cherry high over and over again to no avail. Let's hope this isn't the case here.<br/><br/>It never ceases to astound me that movies given budgets large enough to feed a small nation can literally suck so bad. Just sayin.<br/><br/>Thanks for the forum."

","Good: Hands down the production and cinematography are amazing and truly comes to life over the course of the film to emphasize the film's purpose/themes. The cast overall is great, each one playing their role respectively whether it is an outsider or a cult member, especially Florence Pugh who goes through a lot over the course of the film.<br/><br/>Bad: The film moves relatively at a great pace until near the 3rd act and then takes its time to craft its ending and at times dragged and started to get stale. There are so many clues/culture traditions learned through brief images of paintings and drawings in the community. Although this serves great for analysis and more viewings as a first watch it is a lot to comprehend and can be confusing near the end if you do not remember some of the drawings. It goes without saying that the characters do not make the smartest of decisions and there are quite a few horror cliches.<br/><br/>Overall: The film triumphs in creating a beautiful yet disturbing atmosphere in broad daylight. There are powerful performances filled with emotions. However, the run-time goes a little past its run time and an ending that was not the most satisfying. Although I'll be back for more viewings to see the easter eggs and hidden clues, I personally prefer ""Hereditary"" over this one.<br/><br/>3.5/5<br/><br/>*Pro-Tip look at the painting/drawings from right to left

","Be first thing I wanted to do after leaving the cinema, was to discover what the swedish thought of this film, in general they saw it with humour, and an open mind, as I expected.<br/><br/>It's pretty much split right down the middle, first half, dare I say it, normality, drama, with a heavy focus on grief, and the harsh way it can affect someone, particularly if there's trauma involved. The second half is very trippy, and we delve into the world of pagan ritual and bizarre rights, which makes The Whicker Man look like a tea party.<br/><br/>The main leads, Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor, were terrific. Pugh had impressed previously in The Little Drummer Girl, it was obvious she was destined for big things, she played Dani with a real sense of torment, very impressive. The cast had a realism, it was refreshing not to watch a cast that look set for a Dior catwalk.<br/><br/>It won't be for everyone, and I must point out that some scenes are painfully long, needlessly. Some amazing special effects.<br/><br/>Violence and nudity, but neither are gratuitous or simply for shock. A few laughs, several times the cinema erupted in laughter.<br/><br/>Very good. 8/10"

It feels like somebody obsessed with violence just wanted an excuse to kill people in gruesome, almost exclusively ""massive head trauma"" ways.<br/><br/>The movie has multiple underdeveloped plots that all lead nowhere, and scenes that drag on seemingly just to lengthen the films run time, I was starting to fall asleep, and when leaving the theater heard the same sentiment repeated from most of the audience.<br/><br/>Have you ever watched a scene in a movie that made you feel a sense of secondhand awkwardness or embarrassment? Well guess what ? Thats the first hour of this movie after the opening. Uncomfortable conversations and awkwardness are rampant, leaving you itching for scenes to end.<br/><br/>The acting from the cast is great, but the characters are pretty much universally unlikable and killed off too quickly for me to care about, at one point a couple that I didn't even realize were part of the group are killed off and the only reason I knew the mans name was because the girlfriend kept asking about him after he was already gone.<br/><br/>Overall I would recommend not soending money to see this one in theaters, wait until it comes out on video if you plan on seeing it."

I cannot describe with any combination of words in the English lexicon how terribly repulsive this film is. Throughout the movie, there are ever more traumatic scenes, and when that culminated in the main character's boyfriend being seduced in some bizarre sex ritual, I thought to myself, surely this must be the most extreme things get before someone starts explaining the significance. But no, only more grotesque things were to come.<br/><br/>In short, if you want to feel a divine combination of repulsive emotions that make you feel physically ill, like you've been morally assaulted, then this is the movie for you."

","This is a type of movie that has it's audience in extremes. You either love it and can't stop talking about how beautiful the movie is or you absolutely hate it and think that people who do like it need to get into a mental institution. The movie starts with a plot which leads to what happens next, it might seems unnecessary or time consuming but it's extremely vital to understand and appreciate the ending. The movie deals with complex relations and the need for the two main characters Dani and Christian to stay in their unwanted relationship. Christian is somewhat an antogonist in the movie. The beautiful scenery , breathtaking cinematography is 10/10 no doubts. My only problem was that some important key events weren't explained any further(that just adds on to the eerie nature of the film since it leaves you with a lot to think about). Dark things happen in the movie while everything that surrounds those events seem so beautiful, spiritual and light. Amazing contrast! What makes this movie brilliant for some is something that makes it terrible for others, which is just the understanding of emotions and the ending. Nothing can make someone like this movie if they don't, it's just one of those impossible strong opinions. And there's no way to say that someone whose thinking about watching it would like it or not. It's a masterpiece by Ari aster. A lot of people watch midsommar after watching hereditary (aster's) expecting similar stuff but do not be fooled by that. While hereditary can be categorised under horror midsommar can't, this is not your movie if you're looking for another hereditary experience. It's just one of those movies that you can get so deep into and realise new things EVERYTIME you talk about it. Do not watch it if you can't handle some amount of gore. And DEFINITELY don't watch it when your mind is not ready to process all that's going to happen. I loved this movie, it takes time to appreciate it since from the second you watch it all you can do is think about it and the more you think about it, read others opinions (not the ones who didnt give it time to get to them) the more you have an opinion of the film and the more you start understanding it; it all leads to you just loving the experience and emotions that you felt ."

Expect to get bored several times in the movie.<br/><br/>2- Most of the time is wasted on marginal details, while the most important scenes are passed quickly.<br/><br/>3- Very stupid behaviors of some characters who are supposed to be smarter. This is frustrating in the movie.<br/><br/>4- A main character who can significantly enrich the movie died early. This makes most of the remaining of the movie revolve about poor repetitive ideas.<br/><br/>Now my personal opinion. If the movie is shortened to only 90 minutes, and postpones the first dying character to the end scenes, I can rate this movie easily with 8 or 9 points. But getting bored several times in the movie with a lot of repetitive ideas, this will decrease my rating to 5."
"mpearlma","8","16","25","3 July 2019"," Swedish Meatballs, Breakups, and a really bad trip
","After walking out of a late night screening of this movie I felt something I had not felt from a film in a long time, genuinely disturbed. Ari Aster's work in this film is simply stunning. From the beginning you are hit over the head with a gut punch, and the film isn't quick to relent. The themes in this movie are heavy: suicide, grief, bad relationships, and violence. Where Midsommar excels is in its ability to draw you into its world. The commune community in Sweden is so well portrayed and executed you begin to understand its language. Like the protagonist Dani, by the end of the film you ""feel like you can speak Swedish"" in that the symbolism of the commune all lines up nicely.<br/><br/>This is a ethereal film in every sense. Cameras shake and pan in unusual ways. Transitions are creative but not repetitive. The violence and sex in the film is both shocking and uncensored. The result is a movie that clearly has a vision and purpose and hits the ideas its trying to convey effectively.<br/><br/>The cinematography and production design are Oscar worthy. Truly the world created here is so believable and well done that alone is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Why this movie is a 9 instead of a 10 for me is that I felt it was a touch too long and could have cut a character or two. Some of the auxiliary doesn't serve that much of a purpose in the greater story of the film.<br/><br/>That being said, I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers, horror, drama, and character drama. It is a reminder that the human spirit is weird, disturbing at times, and tragically chaotic. Nature is naturally violent, and as is said in the film ""nature is effortlessly in balance"" and human beings are part of that balance."

","This was not a horror movie, and there was nothing supernatural about it, despite what the trailer may lead you to believe. Most people have probably heard about the idiot plot, where the plot requires that one or more characters behave like complete idiot. There was a hint of the idiot plot in this movie was well, but most of all it was what one could call ""the completely unrealistic human behavior plot"", for the lack of a better description.<br/><br/>So this is a cult that have existed for god know how many centuries, where all the members commit suicide by jumping from a cliff once they reach a certain age. As part of their preparation , they first cut open the palm of their hand with a knife, a habit that we see in every other movie and TV-show these days.
This horrible tradition of killing yourself is something everybody is perfectly fine with. Everybody smiles and all is well.
They even travel out in the big world for some years, and each and every one of them eventually return home and continue their life as a cult member. Not a single one of them consider not to return or tell anyone about the cruelty that's going on? Not very likely.
And they find new friends and gain their trust, only to betray them by killing and sacrificing them. Which they do without the slightest hint of regret.<br/><br/>We also have the magical dust these cults somehow often seem to possess, where they just have to blow it into your face to paralyze you. This is combined with the famous teleporting villain, where someone is suddenly standing behind you without making a sound. And you have the (mostly) off-screen killings of the characters, one by one. Because they all think they, as outsiders, will be allowed to witness all the repulsing traditions and then return to the outside world again to tell about it.<br/><br/>I judge a movie by how I feel when I leave the theatre. Based on my feelings when I left, I would have given zero stars if possible. The director said this was probably the last ""horror"" movie he would ever make. For that I'm grateful.<br/><br/>This is a film that feels like an attempt to profit on emotions like hopelessness, despair and human cruelty. If a movie makes you feel bad, then it must be good, right? If you disagree, you probably just didn't ""get it"".<br/><br/>If you want to see a short version of this movie and save some time, just watch The Landlady from Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected instead."

","The film started badly for me: the opening scene in which Dani's sister committed suicide and murdered her parents contributed nothing to the plot. I also did not like Dani as a personage, she came across as a weak and dependent person, not an attractive character for a horror film. After watching the opening scene I hope it would get better, but unfortunately: the story didn't seem to go anywhere and creepy moments didn't come, partly due to the sunny setting. By the way, I had expected that the non-setting sun would make the atmosphere in the film more intense, something that did not happen. some scenes (the forced sex, the elderly people jumping off the rocks, ...) made me very uncomfortable but did not feel threatening or scary. ""Feeling weird"" is not something I'm looking for in a horror movie, other reviewers (see the positive reviews) apparently do. Midsommar left me disappointed."

","I've spent at least 30 years watching great art films that are out of the box in every way imaginable.<br/><br/>Here is the first thing - if you're going to take people on a ride of intense experiences, the ride has to GO SOMEWHERE. This movie has you wondering where things are going to go, and then - surprise - it goes nowhere and the director absconds with your money and 2.3h of your time.<br/><br/>Nothing in the film's plot makes sense. A lot seems to be invested in the main character's family murder/suicide. Then the film basically asks you to put it behind you and only reprises it with a cheap walk-by of her mother near the end.<br/><br/>Nobody who loves this movie appears bothered by:
-Why a Swedish person living in America would invite his circle of friends to be murdered by his cult family in the first place. Nothing is explained about what he gets out of having done this.
-Swedish dude starts working toward a relationship with the main character, and then that thread gets dropped like a hot potato.
-The idea that the host who has lived in America just seems to be unable to predict that seeing people jump to their gory death and get smashed in the head with a hammer might disturb his guests.
-Everyone except two of the guests finds their way to get cool with the public suicide.
-All this ritual, in aid of successful and prosperous farming, might have been paired with some EXAMPLES of prosperous farming?<br/><br/>What do we get by the end? A thoroughly uninteresting lead character who has a completely implausible breakdown-epiphany upon her boyfriend being burned to death in a bear suit and finds a way to smile. Seriously.<br/><br/>What is so annoying is that even I could have fixed this movie. All you had to do was wow them in the end. After the ridiculous fire ritual, just throw some special effects scene in where something truly alien happens, showing that all these bizarre practices are actually grounded in something actually convincingly celestial. These people aren't crazy after all, they really have the direct line to some sort of divinity. Boom - better movie. Main character still has her epiphany, but it's because she sees some form of god-like intervention.<br/><br/>As it stands, the apparent love for this movie only provides another example of the increasing failure of the state of art cinema."

The cinematography is also good. My only criticism with it is that most of the scenes in Sweden or overexposed due to all the White Wardrobe. From my experience when shooting white, So much white, Pure White, needs to be taken to a to a pale beige as to not absorb everyone surrounding it. Also, all the flowers used was unrealistic being there was never a flower growing anywhere in sight. Where did they come from.They were clearly artificial for the films purpose for the many takes and set-ups. But that is only Due to having been in the film industry for 40 years. The average Pedestrian audience member would not be concerned over this. In short It is fantastic film making and not for your normal Horror Fan. It is so much better than those sort of blood and guts fanatics. Also for the people saying the film is slow, It is meant to be slow, most religious ceremonies and rituals are slow ,"

"view_and_review","1","115","229","3 July 2019"," Midsommar a Miss
","What would you think a movie involving white clothes and head wreaths would be about? If you said creepy pagan rituals then you're right.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Midsommar was about what I thought it'd be about. Pagan rituals. Were the rituals more extreme than--let's say--Wicker Man? Yes. But extreme wasn't what I was looking for. I was looking for truly different. Truly scary. This movie wasn't scary it was just disturbing. There were ugly nude bodies, some gore, and overall disturbing ceremonies but it was still a pagan ritual movie.<br/><br/>But it was also slow. Exasperatingly slow. Slower than a constipated sloth. There were too many silent mood-setting shots. I've been programmed to know that silent shots in scary movies are for build-up. It's upon the movie maker to deliver on that build up. I can't count how many slow-moving shots in this movie were building up to nothing. I get it. You can't have something ghastly happen every time or it will become mundane. But not at all?<br/><br/>When these five friends went to Sweden for a getaway and decided to stop off in some remote village for their nine-day festival you knew something was gonna go down. But did it have to move so slowly and drag on forever? Did the scenes have to last so long? Between crying, moaning, singing, dancing, and panting they added so many nerve-wracking noises. Yeah, they made the movie more disturbing and also more annoying.<br/><br/>I remained patient throughout the entire film only to NOT be rewarded for my patience. As I suffered through the main character's neurosis and moping I couldn't help but think, ""There better be gold at the end of this rainbow."" I hate to say it, there was no gold... nor silver, nor copper, or any precious metal. It was just a fire being fed with two and a half hours of my precious time."

","This movie is just brilliant. There are so many complex layers to what is going on here - at face value you could think of it as a trippy, bizarre adult fairy tale. But when you dig deeper, you'll find a lot more under the surface.<br/><br/>I initially thought the opening was an emotional ploy to help us empathize with Dani, but now I see it is the thesis of the entire movie. Ari Aster himself said it was an ""operatic break up movie"" and that is a perfect description. Through her personal tragedies, Dani finds meaning and community again - she finds people to hold her, to cry with her - things she should have had all along.<br/><br/>The cult setting is clever - it's ritualistic shock and gore at every step, seeming to underline Dani's heightened sense of foreboding and horror and her struggle to process the tragedy with her family and with Christian. But by the end of the movie, Dani embraces the ritualized gore and sees it's necessary for moving on (in more than just one sense). The cult has shown her how to cope and given her a community to do so. Their tragedies are planned and measured; they have responsibility for their own traumas. It's pure art.<br/><br/>It's a raw, sometimes uncomfortable roller coaster ride that gives you plenty to chew on. 10/10"

"dannypasquarelli","9","12","18","6 July 2019"," Midsommar is an unsettling work of art
","Ari Aster left quite the impression on me with Hereditary as it was one of the most unique and well crafted horror films I've seen in a long time, making Midsommar one of my most anticipated films of the year. It is safe to say that Midsommar is a great follow up from Ari Aster making him one of the most creative and passionate film makers in the business. One of the things I noticed right off the bat was the realistic and relatable nature of the mundane conversations and the more intense moments with the characters. Dani is an extremely relatable protagonist as her struggles with mental illness and family ground her in reality making for a really engaging first act. The group of ""friends"" that are set up at the beginning travel to Sweden to attend the Midsommar festival where the majority of the movie takes place. Character motivations are paid off in great ways, and the events that transpire are so disturbing that I couldn't believe that this movie is being played in major theaters across the country. One of the most impressive aspects of the film was the set design. Buildings have cultish artwork and symbols carved into walls, and all the architecture has a unique look to the point where you can tell a lot of work went into the design of them and I commend the whole art department for doing a fantastic job. The only real problem I had with the film was it's running time. It was 2 hours and 27 minutes and definitely started to sag a bit in the middle so some trimming wouldn't have hurt it. Although I really loved Midsommar, I can't recommend it to everyone. The film is off-putting by nature and I can see some more casual film goers really hating it, but if you like slow burn thought provoking horror that really leaves an impact after seeing it then I would highly recommend Midsommar and I can't wait to see what Ari does next."

Next time you read about a moving being ""The most..."" just know it means the exact opposite. The beginning of the movie made no sense and did not really work in with the rest of the movie. The scenery was boring and the setting/props looked like something out of a high school play. The characters were totally annoying (the lead actress spends 90% of the time crying and shrieking) and I was glad when they started disappearing one by one. I kept waiting for something outrageous and shocking to happen, but nothing ever did, aside from two people leaping off a cliff. After that scene the movie just snowballed and went from bad to worse. The last scene where the lead actress was wearing a pyramid shaped flower dress was hilarious, it was not even a dress, but more like an inverted cone covered in flowers.

All these 10/10 ratings...are you kidding me?! These people need therapy. Midsommar is painstakingly slow...without any payoff. And I wouldn't have minded if someone would have tried, at all, to develop and make me feel anything for these obnoxious characters. There are no surprises. Nothing new. You'll have most of the movie figured out in the first few minutes. But a lot of it makes no sense. It's almost as if these weird noises and scenarios going on in the background are just there to distract you from the terrible acting. Florence Plugh is just an adult toddler in this. And I'm pretty sure a team of high school drama students did the practical effects. All that budget and not one person thought, ""Should we use real flowers? They're supposed to be picking them but they are so obviously fake."" Or ""Shouldn't the dead bear remotely resemble the bear when it was alive?"" And how is anyone is supposed to accept the fact that when you're 72 you ""give"" your life when throughout the entire movie there are at least a dozen people well over the age of 72. It's just stupid.<br/><br/>Even if you cut out all of the fluff, to any common sense viewer, it would still look like a college project made with homemade effects. Some parts weren't meant to be but they were hilarious. Hilariously bad. Like a full leg sticking up out of the garden. Seriously?<br/><br/>I also think it's offensive to anyone who is bipolar and had ever suffered loss in their lives. Not everyone grieves in the same way but most people don't join cult. This movie is not a metaphor for grief or the end of a relationship. It's about a group of idiot ""visitors"" that don't ask any common sense questions and a psychotic ""family"" that murders people for whatever insane reason their purposefully inbred prophet dictates. It's not about culture or belief systems so I don't understand why some viewers would try to justify murder. It's murder. The characters died terrible deaths. Just like this script should have."

","From the start, the film reflects our fears, inhibitions, desires.
We all are curious by nature.
We all want to be held and seen, don't we? Hence the crave to be part of something, where everything is clearly planned including grief and joy, birth and death.
This one taught me to be responsible for my own traumas and weaknesses for there's always a line where you can say to yourself once you approach it: I'm not crossing it. I'm good.

"tigerfish50","1","22","37","9 November 2019"," A Mild Case of Midsommar Madness
","Cinema audiences' admiring response to 'Midsommar' is the most mysterious aspect of this ho-hum 'horror' film which shamelessly copycats ""The Wicker Man"". The story begins with the murder-suicide of a female college student's parents and sister - and this tragedy supposedly motivates her to accept an invitation to visit the religious community where a fellow student from Sweden had been raised.<br/><br/>Accompanied by her semi-estranged boyfriend and a couple of disposable pals, the visitors arrive at their destination and the narrative immediately goes downhill. Instead of growing tension and menace at the remote hamlet, the creepy cultists offer long-winded rituals, tedious chanting and absurd occult beliefs. The story never develops the witless students into sympathetic characters, nor the peasant-costumed pagans into truly sinister villains. As a result, when bad things start happening, it's impossible to care about any of the rustic weirdness or the ultimate fate of the fall-guys."

"adnanmal-92987","2","39","71","28 August 2019"," When will people understand there is no such genre as ''Psychological Horror'' ?
","Hello there<br/><br/>I see that Midsommar depends on psychological horror aspect heavily as a horror movie but the thing is we got a problem here. Psychological horror can not be the main theme of a movie and can only and only be a side aspect of the movie make it better. Just like the ''Red Room'' scene from ''Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark'' or maybe ''Spahn Movie Ranch'' scene from ''Once Upon a Time in Hollywood''. Psychological horror works with these 2 titles because in Scary Stories everything is just clear, you know there is something wrong and you know how that scene will end but you keep watching, it frightens you slowly and slowly. And in OUATIH, the movie itself is far from what you'd call a psychological horror but Spahn Movie Ranch scene is a standalone scene that's main focus is psychological horror that is thrown to the middle of a movie and when everything was going fine you just get that scene and it does what it is supposed to do and frightens you very well. But in such movies like ''Midsommar'', aka in movies which has psychological horror as its theme, it just doesn't work because you know that there is something wrong there. Let me give you a metaphorical example to understand it better. Think it like you are in the universe of ''Cabin in the Woods'' and participating in the events as a spectator. There is a one sided mirror between you and the victims. You just watch ''scientists'' release the monsters upon the victims and they die. They were the ones who did not know that something wrong was going to happen. And in a real movie it works exactly the same; You are the audience and you know there are some stuff that is wrong but the characters in the movie don't.
And when there are some stuff wrong you just prepare yourself as the audience. Unless the movie is very successful about making you feel for the characters and have some empathy for them you won't really have any psychological anxiety when something happens in the movie because you were waiting for that anyway. You knew that there were some wrong stuff happening around everywhere in the whole movie before that point so you were prepared for it. How is that supposed to give you psychological anxiety or whatever it is? Also this movie is way too long and which makes it predictable because you will have time to predict every possible outcome and then pick the one that makes the most sense (which is not very hard to choose tbh). Pretty sure they thought if they make the movie overly long and slow it would help to create that ''psychological horror and anxiety'' world they wanted to build for the movie but no luck, not this time.<br/><br/>EDIT: Forgot the sex scenes of the movie. Lmao what was that cmon.. I really don't know what director was thinking when he decided to do that. Everyone in my saloon was basically laughing hysterically at those scenes. They absolutely did not stand for anything else but just some great chuckles. Gotta give it to it tho, was the best chuckle I had in a movie this year.<br/><br/> I don't accept psychological horror as the main theme of a movie so this movie belongs to no genre at all. There is no mystery in the movie because movie is way too easy to predict thanks to its runtime. There is no other horror elements other than some heavy gore in 2 scenes and some ''psychological'' horror elements so it is not a horror movie as well. I don't even know what this movie is... But damn sure it is something overy long, predictable and slow."
"gregoire-fifis","3","39","71","13 August 2019"," Slow, deja vu and not as good
","It is boring, not necessarily because it is very slow but due to the transparent, unrealistic and artificial characters with whom only of few of us would relate. As an example who would stay in a place after witnessing a murder ? Well, all the characters did. Let's laugh together.
The story is highly predictable in every way. The first deaths are obvious and you could see them coming 10 minutes before they happen. And so on and so forth.<br/><br/>Well, if you have not seen lots of good movies of the same trail e.g. external people to a community get killed one by one, then maybe this one will be a surprise. If you have, then pass your way: encouraging lack of storytelling is not what will make the movies better.
Nice photography though, not enough still to make it worth."

"deandraslater","8","24","41","4 February 2020"," Unforgettable
","I'm not one of those people who thinks every horror film should be 80-90 minutes. There are too many brilliant horror films that have pushed (or exceeded) that 2 hour mark so I can't say that's a wise barometer of a film's quality. However, Midsommar could stand a few trims here and there to tighten things up.<br/><br/>The issue with Midsommar is this - we've all seen movies like this before. We know what's going to happen, yet the characters don't, so we spend an awfully long time waiting for the inevitable as we have to see ancient cult rituals carried out in real time. It can make for an exhausting watch.<br/><br/>It's not the story that Midsommar is telling that's interesting, but the way that it's telling it. With its focus on a toxic relationship between Dani and Christian, it colors a familiar story with something altogether different and unique.<br/><br/>When Midsommar really hits its stride, though, it's off and running and better than just about any other horror film in recent memory. Ari Aster has rounded up another phenomenal cast just like with Hereditary and the film is drenched in dread from the first frame all the way to the unforgettable final frame.<br/><br/>It's, without a doubt, worth seeing."

Maybe it's all metaphor that I'm not connecting with. Maybe if I could understand all the un-subtitled Swedish I'd understand more. But, any movie I have to do research on just to understand it has failed on a fundamental level to convey its story in the allotted time.<br/><br/>Beyond all that, the performances are awful. I didn't buy into any of the characters or the emotional journeys they went on. Florence Pugh is trying to give some emotion and at times full on heartbreak but all she really manages is a lot of ugly crying. Jack Reynor, the love interest, is as stiff as a board with all the personality of cardboard. He's supposed to be with this group for a reason but that barely even comes up until 2/3rds of the way through the movie, like they suddenly remembered, ""Oh yeah, he's supposed to have a story too.""<br/><br/>The movie just made me mad. It's 148 minutes of boredom and agony. It's pretty sometimes. That's about the only positive to me.<br/><br/>Steer clear."

","Like most of the other people commenting here, I watched Hereditary, liked it, and had high hopes for this director's next movie. But the only thing Midsommar proved to me is that he is not artistic, pretentious, and obsessed with his work.<br/><br/>Making this type of film, in my mind, does not require any talent. All you need is a shallow, half baked script, a beautiful geographical location, good set designers, and anything you can add to make it as weird as possible. Making bizarre scenes is not hard; it's incredibly easy. What is hard is making a movie that makes the audience feel equally as weird as the characters who are experiencing the scenes. I did not feel that here. I could not relate to any of the characters. The characters were no different from the quintessential horror movie character who acts the most idiotic way possible and is so disconnected from any natural human reaction. I would not be this upset if I only spent an hour, a max hour and a half watching this. A bunch of idiots travel somewhere unknown and willingly kill themselves because they are incredibly stupid. But I wasted two and a half hours.<br/><br/>Ari Aster, do us all a favor and stop making nonsense. You are not a talented horror movie director/writer, and please don't think your movies are at the same level as Rosemary's baby.

I'll be frank, I don't like horror movies. But this isn't one. There's really no drama, or a mystery to solve.

So, sadly, I don't think anything in it pays off at the end.<br/><br/>I'll give it a 2 because it is not completely incompetent.. at least in cinematography. There are some good set-design choices, and some good shots. But, did it have to be over 2 hours long? Practically nothing happens in it, and it is too slow (even if they wanted to set the mood or a tone, or suspense? or whatever) and too boring to be entertaining.

""Piss on a canvas"" would show more respect for the viewer.<br/><br/>I am worried that by saying these things, some of you will reward the makers of it with your money. Don't. If you have already done so, I think you should go back to the theater and ask for your money back.
If they give me mine back, I am going to burn it.<br/><br/>I hope Ari Aster's career fails. He does not deserve to have one."

This movie tries way to hard to attempt to be something it is not, and misses every mark it tries to hit along the way... no suspense, no build up. This was in no way a horror/thriller film. At best it's a dark comedy.
There isn't a single likable character in the film, and zero development of those unlikable characters.

I was expecting horror, but instead I got people tripping on drugs, weird mysteries and some kind of cult. When the movie was over I was left with a really weird feeling - I could not define the genre, I felt drugged. I was a bit disappointed with the movie, and that's a shame. I was expecting more after the very, very good Hereditary, Worst horror movie ever it was so slow , dragged on and it was so boring. I didn't like Midsommar and the main reason is because I felt lost during the whole film. The community or ""the cult"" just acts to weird, I struggled to understand their behavior in almost every action. I think this movie overrated ,,, i like hereditary,, but Midsommar just to slow and predictable. some scene just wasted time. To be totally honest I thought it was a bad movie. To me they tried to make another Hereditary but failed miserably. Their friends are disappearing one by one. And it didn't phase any of them. Out in the middle of nowhere, eating and drinking whatever was put in front of them. And how did they keep those white clothes so clean?

There are six imbeciles who arrive in a field and there are people all wearing white and offering them drugs. Keep in mind they still have their car. Do half of them freak out and leave? No. I think all of them would. But they take the drugs and move on to the main ceremonial grounds the next day. More strange stuff happens but no they are unphased. Then the horrifying ritual suicides happen. They freak out a little but no its just culture shock. I would wager anyone would have run by that point. Later they don't even run when their friends disappear. Don't ask any questions. Take the weakest explanations for why they are gone. ( my boyfriend when to the train station without me? We've been dating for years. Oh I see only room in the truck for two? And I couldn't sit on his lap because traffic laws? What our bible is missing? Must have been your friend who is researching us. And he left with it.<br/><br/>Speaking of ritual suicides why so gruesome? If it's to put old people out of their misery why does it have to violent? Why not inject them with morphine? And why the hell doesn't their hippie friend warn them about what's going to happen before they step on the plane? He was with them in America.<br/><br/>And no one in all of Sweden knows about these idiots? Millions of people living there but not a clue.<br/><br/>Then the girlfriend wins an idiotic may queen dance and the boyfriend gets peer- pressured into more drugs. Then after a bunch of silly ceremonies and planting rituals he gets to cheat on his girlfriend cause of culture.<br/><br/>Finally the slaughtering of nine people two of whom chosen by a an bingo machine.

"SPSicilia","10","13","20","17 November 2019"," A brilliant second film, works on every level if you give it your full attention!
","Midsommar is the first 10/10 film I have seen in 2019 (with Three Billboards and He Won't Get Far From Here being the only straight 10s from 2017 and 2018 respectively.) This is a film that deserves a clean viewing. Put the phones in a different room, get your food and drinks beforehand. I do not like films where you need to read a book about the film to understand the significance, this is not that, just requires that you do view the whole thing carefully.<br/><br/>The opening is not the greatest I have seen, most recent films have good opening and then loose steam over the halfway point. This one is like a boiling over teapot, it just railroads through to the end. It is not chocked full of action, but has just enough to propel the story forward. In fact, the longer passages, in a 2:20 run time, add to your feeling of being immersed in the characters situation. There is lots of foreshadowing in certain scenes that basically tell the viewer exactly what is going to happen, but I was still shocked and enthralled each time. There is some over-the-top violence and a semi bizarre scene for those that are easily offended. Notable cinematography shots that I have not seen before, The scene where the camera goes 180 degrees upside down and follows down the road. And the circular dance scene, which I know, were a nightmare to get right in post production.<br/><br/>Themes that I have not read others talk about- I believe this film has a healthy dose of criticism for blind faith, traditions, the idea of going along to get along and religious institutions, of all stripes, The main male leads name is Christian, after all."

It was made painfully clear she was not wanted on the trip yet she went anyway so I felt no sympathy for the way the guys were treating her.

So I watched Midsommar with an open mind as much as I could.<br/><br/>It was awful.<br/><br/>The main character didn't help as I could not empathize with her at all. I found her annoying and a blank canvas to be honest. The other characters ranged from equally annoying to uninteresting. So it's very difficult to engage in a movie if the main characters have no endearing qualities or acting qualities leave you cold.<br/><br/>The plot? Telegraphed and Cliched I am afraid. It felt like a Swedish rip off of the Wicker Man. There is no real discernable reason for the climax. Yes the main characters were annoying and frankly I could not care less what happened to them but why? Is it a sacrifice to the Gods or a blood lust? Nobody really explained why their customs were such other than a cringeworthy explanation of the suicide of the two elders.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was clunky and made you wince. The cinematography made you nauseous but I guess that was deliberate. The ending was bland and at no point during this or any other part of the film did I feel peril or menace. I sat there waiting for it to end as it meandered along like a drunk walking home on a Saturday night. You knew what was going to happen and when it did?

Midsommar, on the other hand, not so much!!! I waited months to see this and even watched the trailer several times just to psyche myself for the full 2 and a half hour run time which, I thought, would contain stunning visuals, visceral violence not before seen on film, amazing cinematography, atmospheric chills (a la Wicker Man, The Innocents) and an absorbing soundtrack which would further unnerve me and have me on the edge of my seat.....absolutely none of these aforementioned traits were apparent and I was left totally let down and disappointed with the whole thing. Unexplained missing people, suicidal pensioners should have been a massive red light to these reasonably educated younger persons but, ""No""....crack on and it'll all be alright in the end!!!! How wrong they and we were.....Nothing is right in the end....and I mean nothing.....I can appreciate good visuals and I do think the initial ""pensioners throwing themselves over a cliff"" build up worked well and did include a sense of dread but, what follows is just plain nuts....then....nothing...just poor decision after poor decision. Ironically, as soon as the film finished (badly) I turned on the TV and there was an advertisement for the original Wicker Man at weekend....just the 30 second ad beat the 2 hr 27min complete film I had just watched.....swerve this and re-watch that again....now that is a film that builds dread using stunning visuals and music...often imitated but, still not beaten....albeit Ari had a go.....nice try but, no cigar....."
"valexanderartist","10","13","20","11 July 2019"," A delicious nightmare that leaves you wanting more
","A review of Midsommar - I intentionally watched this movie without seeing a trailer.<br/><br/>To say the least, I thought the film was extremely unique. I appreciate the symbolism and artistic licensing being used at every angle. I believe that thrillers in general are a tricky genre to deliver well and authentically - and folk horror is no different. That being said, I could understand some foreshadowing being done and didn't know if it was supposed to be that blatantly obvious for suspense reasons or if I just prepared myself to watch the combination of my imagination and foreshadowed expectations. Nonetheless, it didn't take away from the shock factor that was provided - very frequently. Allow me to elaborate that the R rating was well deserved.<br/><br/>Visually, the film was done very well. I really liked how terrifyingly beautiful it was - from the scenery to the realism of said shocking events. Their art department should win several awards; as a Coroner, everything looks believable.<br/><br/>I can somewhat compare it to M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" meeting Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"". The movie truly was an experience; it was like a delicious nightmare - you want to wake up but you also are enjoying the ride and somewhat amazed that the human mind could imagine such an abstract narrative. I also enjoyed the little snippets of humor that made me feel comfortable, awaiting the rug to be pulled out from under me. I am very patient when it comes to ""building"" in a movie, so the length of the film was personally fine for me.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was great; I loved the cringe worthy moments between characters, their relationships, and the relatable aspects of human nature. I enjoyed the trauma of the unnatural aspects of human nature in this film - it poignantly reminded me how impactful tradition, society, and in general learned behavior/desensitization is. Loved the looping effects and symbolism from start to finish. It was a refreshing way to spend 2 hrs and 27 mins although I was a tad antsy towards the end.<br/><br/>To me, a ""good"" movie hits me in three categories: it affects my body in some way (gotta love the psychology behind that), it makes my mind race between trying to experience/question/predict it at the same time, and it leaves me wanting more/wanting to discuss it. I can say this movie did all of the above for me.<br/><br/>Yes it was bizarre, shocking, and most of the time uncomfortable, but I appreciated it for what it was ...and like most memorable nightmares, a one time viewing is definitely sufficient."
"Serenityinaz12","10","13","20","11 July 2019"," Loved it more than Hereditary
","The pacing of Hereditary and Midsommar are very similar, a slow boil and a chunk of people complaining about how slow it is and this and that. I loved it personally and liked that the supernatural type stuff that existed at the end of Hereditary isn't present here.

"tonypeacock-1","10","13","20","6 July 2019"," Aster at last provides 2019 with a decent film
","A 2019 new release film from director Ari Aster that evoked memories of a 1970s film banned for 20 years or so.<br/><br/>Only Aster's second feature, following 2018's Hereditary, a film that for many (not myself) brought comparisons to The Exorcist.<br/><br/>Midsommar instantly evokes comparisons to the classic Christopher Lee film, The Wicker Man with pagan cults and a palette of colour throughout.<br/><br/>The colour is provided by a midsummer festival in Sweden, not the usual dark photography of a 'horror' film.
The film also avoids the usual horror film cliches of jump scares and mood lighting.<br/><br/>A rather long run time for a film of the genre at over 140 minutes. The extended run time allows for some plot development surrounding the characters which I will come on to.<br/><br/>Without bringing major spoilers to the review the film involves a group of American students, two of whom Dani (Florence Pugh) and Christian (Jack Reynor) are a couple experiencing relationship issues involving a family tragedy.<br/><br/>Christian has a circle of Inbetweeners like freinds some of whom provide comic relief throughout the film. I'm thinking of Mark (Will Poulter).<br/><br/>A 'lads' break to the festival is planned but Dani, inadvertently is tagged along.
What follows is a 'trip' the group could not imagine. A drug induced, time confusing period of some quite disturbing scenes.<br/><br/>The film does have some gory sequences yet members of the cinema audience did snigger.<br/><br/>Featuring some quite scary lookalikes including Bjorn from Swedish pop group Abba and Jeremy Corbyn!<br/><br/>2019 has been a poor year thus far cinematically, probably as of July 2019 one, if not the best film.<br/><br/>The Wicker Man had a legend in the late Christopher Lee. Midsommar doesn't. The casting is pretty low key but effective.
Not a conventional horror more a psychological drama with a smuttering of comedy."
"thetyvonlesure","8","13","20","5 July 2019"," Disturbingly Stunning
","Midsommar is an incredibly wild ride that gives a new meaning to Cult Classic. This film is artsy in the sense that every camera shot in this film is masterful, by presenting another dynamic to the film. The plot is incredibly sinister and deceptive. While the film lacks in the same intrigue as Hereditary (Aster's previous film), it thrives in visual presentation and organized chaos. The acting is phenomenal, as each actor presents their character with a sense of suspense. The pacing is like watching a slow car wreck. From start to finish, this film is disturbing and uncomfortable to watch. Overall, Midsommar is a unique horror flick that leaves the viewer feeling like they've seen the birth of Satan himself."

","I went into this movie expecting nothing. The first 10 minutes made my skin crawl and I knew that the rest was going to be interesting and maybe lead to something good. It got disturbing. VERY DISTURBING. I anticipated everything that was going to happen and I don't know if that is a good or bad thing. The anticipation felt normal with all the foreshadowing Ari gives us. Yet it was the weirdest thing I have ever seen but yet I feel like I enjoyed it. I have never felt so terrible about a film and yet think it was good. I don't know if that makes sense but if you watch it you might feel the same way. I can tell you it looks amazing though. The story and just everything that happens I am so confused and indifferent about that it just baffles me. Do I like this movie or not. The reason I'm giving it a good rating is that because immediately after I thought that was just god awful but as I thought about it it just brought chills all through my body. That's the point right? Go see this movie and maybe you will understand how I feel. No movie has made me felt this way.

","A shallow and empty exercise that mistakes vagueness for complexity and change for character work. The opening 10-20 minutes of the film is brutal; extremely well made and extremely true to life, but completely unnecessary and somewhat contradictory to the main points of the rest of the movie. Then we move into a slow burn look at a group of friends as they travel to Sweden to visit what they slowly discover is a murderous cult. Slow burns work best when there is mystery present, when the audience has questions they want answered. This movie doesn't have that. The characters are mostly *less* than two dimensional, other than the boyfriend who is an interesting character to watch but awful person. Every one of the main characters acts against what we know about them; this is especially rough in the climax where an important female character makes a decision that doesn't fit what we know about her at all (although the fact that all of the friends stayed after a horrific act occurs early on already destroys any sense of character that exists). There's also a character with a disability put there entirely to be ""weird""; way to go, filmmakers - let's use a disability to show how weird these people are.<br/><br/>Shallow, empty, pointless - but apparently well-researched, so I guess that's something to think about during the 2 1/2 hour runtime"

","1 star for quite good cinematography and competent editing. -9 stars for everything else. Perhaps it's supposed to be black comedy but those are generally funny. Nothing in this movie is intentionally funny. Very little happens and you will have next to no reason to care when it eventually does. Really boring characters take a really long time to make dumb decisions in very predictable ways. This is only because that in order to have a movie, you have to have at least a few things happen and so they do but only very grudgingly. Occasionally there is a bit of mild to heavy gore.

I really hate it when people put their own issues into movies because it comes off as pathetic. Two films called ""Mother!"" and ""The House That Jack Built"" are great examples of this since both are equally pretentious and nonsensical. While better than those two, this film suffers from similar issues.<br/><br/>The film is way too long, the acting, for the most part, is pretty bad, the music is enough to hurt your ears and there were actually moments where I was laughing at it and not with it which is not a good sign.

","All summer long, I've had people breathlessly tell me, ""You need to see this movie.""<br/><br/>I've been down this road before. It was called Hereditary, Ari Aster's last film.<br/><br/>I debated never watching this film, but then I reasoned that as much as I detested It Follows, I loved Under the Silver Lake.<br/><br/>Maybe Aster would hit paydirt in this one. After all, I love folk horror films like The Wicker Man and Blood On Satan's Claw. How bad could it be?<br/><br/>Woah boy.<br/><br/>Dani Ardor is dealing with a lot. Her sister has killed her parents and then herself. This has also pushed her already failing relationship with her boyfriend Christian. Somehow, they stay together the whole way to summer, when she learns that his Swedish friend Pelle is going home to his commune family for a once in every ninety years ritual and is taking Christian and his friends Mark and Josh.<br/><br/>Christian had no intention of telling her about the trip. In fact, his friends want them to break up. But then she's there in Halsingland along with them as they trip out and settle in. Hours later, two of the elders leap off a rock to their deaths, but when the male doesn't die, the others smash his head with a rock.<br/><br/>The elder Siv explains that this is how life goes here in Harga, with every member dying in the same way at the age of 72. This would also be the point where anyone sane would get out.<br/><br/>Two other guests, Simon and Connie, try to leave but miscommunication separates them. And to top things off, Christian decides to steal Josh's thesis on the Harga. That's when we learn that the commune' runic religion is based on an oracle who is conceived every few years via incest.<br/><br/>Oh, where do we go from here? Mark pees on a tree and gets skinned alive. Josh tries to take photos and gets hit with a mallet. Dani takes more drugs and dances around a maypole whole her boyfriend eats pubic hair before impregnating another girl while the rest of the females all watch and push his butt in deeper. Yes, it may have taken Quentin Tarantino a few films before we all realized he has a foot fetish, but Ari Aster took all of one film and a bit of this one to show us that his go-to horror is obese and aged nudity.<br/><br/>After finding Christian and Maja having sex, Dani has started screaming and all of the women turn it into a song. I laughed the kind of mad guffaw that Max Cady only reserved for classics like Problem Child. Somehow, this film, much like the last one that Aster essayed, has descended from horror into comedy through no fault of its own.<br/><br/>If I told you that the cult members all disembowel a bear and shove Christian into it - get it, his name is Christian and he's being sacrificed? - would you believe me? Well, you better, because that's exactly the kind of ridiculous ending this movie has. Can you believe that some people were upset by this and how intense it supposedly got? Then why was I holding my sides and struggling to breathe as I chuckled with the kind of volume that I had once only thought possible in my wildest dreams?<br/><br/>This film is a joke, told with false significance and no small fury, all screaming and yelling and singing and wishing and praying and hoping that someone finds it significant and important and worthy of notice. In short, it is everything that is 2019 - a country that asks for prayers on social media one day and shoots one another in the face the next. A sad moron screaming, ""Notice me.""<br/><br/>Somehow, thirty minutes of footage was cut from this movie before release. I have no idea how this is possible, as it felt so ponderous that I fear that it's being over is just a surprise ending and the truth is I will soon wake up and still have forty minutes left to watch. It's the kind of movie that The Lord of the Rings films would tell to wrap it up.<br/><br/>There are no surprises. I mean, the opening mural literally tells you everything that will happen in the film. And another piece of art shows a woman falling in love with a man, placing flowers under his pillow and then hiding her pubic hair in his food. This is exactly what Maja does with Christian.<br/><br/>There is all the subtlety of a sledgehammer in this film. Every single story beat is so hammered home - yes, that's a horrible pun but this movie in no way makes me want to try - that you become wistful for the simple days of Toni Collette flying around without her head.<br/><br/>The funniest thing about this movie is that it sees the Nicholas Cage The Wicker Man as more of an inspiration than the original. That might be all you need to know about this utter turd in the punchbowl."

"kastchei2112","2","14","22","16 September 2019"," Simply boring
","Two thoughts came to mind as I watched this:<br/><br/>1) ""This feels like Melancholia"": more a meditation than a movie. It's so boring. Surprisingly little happens, yet it takes 2.5 hours to do it. The camera lingers too long on everything, and not just a few seconds too long, but 10, 20, 60 seconds too long. It's probably a conscious decision to try to heighten tension and make the audience feel the frustration and disorientation of the characters; but instead, it instills boredom. Symbolism has a weak impact when pulled across such a long frame; and the symbolism is pretty sophomoric (pun intended!).<br/><br/>2) ""He's already M. Night Shyamalan'ed himself."" There are so many laughable parts of this movie that are intended to be intense. I saw some reviews which said the comedy was intentional. It doesn't come across as intentional, though, so you're laughing at the director, not with him.<br/><br/>I was checking my watch and debating when to cut and run nearly the entire movie after the introduction which was really cool but had no bearing on the rest of the film. It's up there with Melancholia and The Thin Red Line as probably some of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't judge bad movies by outrage or morals: I judge them simply by how much I wish not to be watching it. I spent nearly all the movie debating how much my friends would be mad at me if I left.<br/><br/>Save yourself the time, or at least wait for it to come on TV somewhere so you can play on your phone at the same time. Trust me, you won't miss anything. Like a soap opera, after finishing writing that work email, they'll still be on the same shot."

Florence Pugh's performance at times made me feel as if 10,000 ants were having an ant independence day parade over my entire body.<br/><br/>The horrifying opening sequence, which features Dani (Florence Pugh) being talked down by her boyfriend as a hopeless worry bug, constantly concerned about her biopolar sister who sent her a very ominous e-mail and then stopped responding. Right before the reveal that her sister not only took her own life, but killed their parents as well. This is just the first five minutes. After that, it starts to get really dark.<br/><br/>This movie made me so uncomfortable so many times. At one point I started to notice some discomfort in my face and realized I hadn't blinked in at least five minutes. My eyes stuck wide open, glued to the humanistic horror unfolding onscreen.<br/><br/>All I really want to say is that Ari Aster belongs in a psych ward. He should still be allowed to make movies. And I will watch all of them. I just don't want the guy who wrote and directed this movie to be able to roam free in society. It's just not a good idea."

","Midsommar: The Paganism in this film is very much of a Shamanistic type, differing in many aspects from the Celtic varieties. The ingestion of magic mushrooms is central to the rituals portrayed in the film and how the mushroom tea is filtered is made clear in a banner panel. A ""May Queen"" is chosen at the Midsommar, the winner of a dance around a pole, you dance until there is one woman left standing. In the old days The Dark One forced the young to dance till they died, now the young women dance in defiance of Him. These practises are carried out by a Cult in Northern Sweden at Midsommar when the Sun never sets.<br/><br/>The contrast between the dark and snow of the U.S, as the film opens and the eternal sunshine of Sweden is vividly conveyed. Another darkness clouds Dani's (Florence Pugh) life as her sister kills their parents and commits suicide. Her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) wants to break up with Dani and is encouraged to do so by his friends Mark (Will Poulter) and Josh (William Harper) but Christian feels a responsibility towards her. When classmate Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) invites Mark, Christian and Josh to join him at a midsummer celebration that occurs once every ninety years at his family commune, the Hårga, in Hälsingland, Christian cannot exclude Dani from the trip. When they arrive, they are all welcomed as if they family themselves. But there are warning signals which should have screamed ""Get Out Of Here"" to them, especially to Christian and Josh who are Anthropology postgrads.<br/><br/>The Midsommar Ritual begins placidly enough but soon takes on an aura of strangeness. By the time the first scenes of violence occur they are perhaps not so shocking because of the developing eerie mood but they are quite gory. There are episodes of savagery and sadism throughout the second part of Midsommar but they are all related to The Ritual. Far more import to the the narrative's development is the uncanny feeling which permeates the entire the film. What happens to the characters after they arrive at the commune is perhaps preordained, every action they take is in some way related to The Ritual, In this manner, ritual development, Midsommar resembles Kill List and The Wickerman though the storylines and outcomes differ.<br/><br/>Midsommar is not a film you will easily forget, several viewings may be necessary though for you to catch every fine detail. Director and writer Ari Aster has delivered another Folk Horror masterpiece. 9/10.

","My better half and I went to see this today.<br/><br/>I just asked her what she rated it? 5/10. This is partially my fault, as she asked me what it was about. I told her ""horror, but it's by the creator of Hereditary... So slow burn, and likely more creepy than jump scare type."" For whatever reason, she went in expecting something else.<br/><br/>For me, this movie was creepy. Occasionally you run across something so different and foreign, that you are almost forced to be creeped out. Skin-crawling creepy. I couldn't stop talking about it afterwards, and was still putting things together as of writing this.<br/><br/>I will say this- I don't like jump scares, or murderous horror.

","If this film had been a drama/horror about the sister's mindset leading up to her awful end, I think I could have enjoyed it.
As it was, there are no reasons given for anything except perhaps to infer that the protagonists are stupid and near-catatonic on drugs the whole time.<br/><br/>Two old people throw themselves off a cliff. One of them survives and is murdered by several people with a maul. The protagonists accept the ""oh, this is our custom here"" speech given by a village leader, not exactly calmly, but without running like hell and calling the police as soon as possible.<br/><br/>There's not a lot of subtlety to be found here. Every point in the film is clumsily foreshadowed. If we are to believe the apathy with which the protagonists meet their fates, it would have been nice to see some sort of gaslighting or emotional numbness.
What we have is a group of people each of whom behaves like a normal person, if a little one-dimensionally. Except for when circumstances would cause a normal person to flee for their life. Then, they scream and cry a bit, but continue drinking down that precious Jonestown Flavor-Aid.<br/><br/>Ugh. When I writing this rambling nonsense of a review I had given Midsommar a 3/10. I'm revising that down to a 2. The setting was beautiful, much of the cinematography was gorgeous. The sound design was adequate but not of any particular note. The writing was terrible, the concept was The Wicker Man, but with 100% more Swedish, the actors were aimless and uninspired."

"salmon62","1","15","24","16 October 2019"," Sickness and depression for the sake of it
","THEMATIC SPOILERS AHEAD:
This movie is about a Swedish death cult living in a modern day commune outside of Stockholm somewhere. The film set is a grass field with brand new- built structures that look exactly like a movie set or re-creation of some sort of historical village.<br/><br/>The theme, I believe is that cultural communities regard aging and death differently, and this movie goes way over the top in displaying suicide and violent mercy killing. You will be hit over the head with this message until you realize that the violence depicted is totally gratuitous and not redeeming in any way.<br/><br/>Despite earlier reviews that portray the female protagonist, Dani, as ""transformed"" by the carnage in this film, there is no such journey depicted. I know the writers were trying to make a high-minded culturally shocking film about loss, grief, depression, and death, but this movie fails to generate for me any interest in the American or British visitors to the commune.<br/><br/>First of all, the casting is poor. The young actors are flat, juvenile, and if they are supposed to be representative of Graduate students in America then we are in more trouble then I thought. The characterization of the young Americans in particular is poor. One young man is seen ""vaping"" during the cult festival, and constantly obsessed with sex and hedonistic pursuits. Hardly a scholar. He acts like teen from ""American Pie.""<br/><br/>Another character is portrayed researching his thesis by taking cell phone images, and being as intrusive as possible while ceremonies and deaths occur. Yet, he expresses no real outrage at this! He's concerned his pudgy, flat, dopey friend might now declare his thesis as the exact same study! In fact, none of the American students seem scholarly, of course maybe that's what happens when you choose ""European Summer celebrations"" for your Master's thesis. I was not convinced that any of these actors were academics.
Simply poor casting, and mediocre acting. If the basic background presented is not believable, I cannot buy into the subsequent acting.<br/><br/>The suicide theme as some sort of graceful ""cross-cultural dying with dignity"" is grossly distorted and excessively portrayed. It's simply too much. In fact, any of the lofty themes presented here are not pulled off at all. Despite all the gross, gratuitous shots of suicide, death, and mercy killing, we are supposed to believe that the protagonist Dani, whose family have recently died in a murder-suicide, and is ignored by her pudgy boyfriend throughout, is somehow transformed and at peace and accepted into the death cult. It's terrible and ludicrous.<br/><br/>The cinematography is very good, despite taking place on a glorified ""Little House on the Prairie"" film set. There are excellent costumes and elaborate rituals portrayed---- and that presents the final problem.<br/><br/>This movie is about 15 minutes too long and you should blame the overindulgence of the editor and writer, or director.
There are way too many gratuitous ""open field"" scenes with the cast and extras milling or dancing about.
Without any true transformation or redemption, even a maladaptive one, this film is profoundly and purposefully flawed.
Its pure depression and sickness with a faux happy ending.
I enjoyed ""the Witch"" and ""Hereditary"" immensely. Each was restrained in its presentation of dark themes. Midsommar is not like those films and I couldn't tell the same producers or team was behind it.<br/><br/>Sometimes with success comes bigger budgets, bigger egos, and overindulgence."

"josheyboy29","10","16","26","27 July 2019"," Ari Strikes Again
","After watching last year's terrifying and unnerving Hereditary, I thought ""how is Aster going to top this?""<br/><br/>Well his sophomore effort Midsommar doesn't necessarily top Hereditary when it comes to the scare department, but as a work of art and a general sense of unease and deception, it is a triumph.<br/><br/>The plot concerns a couple on the rocks (Dani and Christian) and their group of friends who travel to Switzerland for a special festival in an off the grid community in the middle of nowhere. At the same time, Dani is mourning the loss of her family (a VERY disturbing opening) and the growing distance between her and Christian. While at first entranced by the community, the trust the group of outsiders had in their hosts begins to fade as they see the very unorthodox and extreme practices committed by said group.<br/><br/>What Aster does so brilliantly is that he puts the audience right alongside the character of Dani (a courageous and strong performance by Florence Pugh). When she panics, we as the audience panic, and that connection continues when she breaks down, feels betrayed etc. Jack Reynor also delivers as Christian, by the end of the film I couldn't help but hate him. We also get treated to a comedy relief in the form of Will Polter. His sarcastic, joking manner is expertly placed to counter the growing undercurrent of unease.<br/><br/>The cinematography? Every frame of this film is perfection, plenty of shots that will stay with you after the film is over. The music is expertly placed too, cheerful, but with a touch of menace.<br/><br/>The film has no jump scares but really capitalizes on the combination of atmosphere and disturbing visuals (there is gore involved). What I appreciated is the growing sense of dread that was so well done. If a film can get under my skin like that, it deserves only the best notices.<br/><br/>When the film was over I thought to myself ""what the hell did I just watch?""<br/><br/>Art, I just watched art by a master artist in his prime"
"dillon_tumble_dude","10","16","26","6 July 2019"," Disturbing, bizarre, and excellent.
","When you finally get to the end of Midsommar and realize what actually happened and why, it truly is quite the shocker it was meant to be. Throughout the film, the creepiness of the setting in which it takes place continues to be intriguing, made only weirder by the rituals that are seemingly normal and ""fun"" to the outsider. But from the moment when the cult women bizarrely mimic the sounds/cries/emotions of certain characters to the jaw-dropping climax, the viewer slowly realizes the horror that has taken place all along. The leading actress (Florence Pugh) plays a convincingly grief-stricken young woman in a relationship that is essentially falling off a cliff. As she realizes just how far they've fallen during the 'cultural outing' they embark upon in Sweden together, the sinister reason for each of their presence becomes more evident. The excellent part about the film is that none of this is fully recognized by the viewer until the very last frame. Great film for horror buffs with a taste for the bizarre and shocking."

But in this case the high rating it got from more then 100000 voters made me watch it, and I can't say I regret it. The cinematography is great, the acting is pretty good, and the story is captivating. I'm normally not a big fan of long movies, and in this case I even watched the director's cut that is 30 minutes longer, and never did I get a boring feeling. For that the story is too suspenseful, there is an evil dark ambiance to it that wants you to watch more. Movies about cults are most of the time interesting to watch as those people have a complete different lifestyle to ours, and mostly because they're deranged and/or brainwashed. Watching crazy people act weird, isn't that entertainment? To me it is for sure. Ari Aster did a very good job with this movie, that slow building tension all a long is brilliant. Personally I would have put a more oppressing and dark soundtrack to it, to make it more evil but that's just my opinion. Midsommar is a good movie in this genre, better than I thought it would be."

"mbyrne_1664","3","9","13","29 September 2019"," Overhyped
","A movie about a trip to stay with a pagan cult. It does not explain why the cult decides to torture people or kill others just because they want to leave. The movie is far to long and the plot is paper thin. Some people will say it is bizarre and great because it is different. Others will say the film never ever reached it's potential and tried to hard to provide alternative horror."

","Wow! If I could sum up the film in one word to display how great it is, it'd be ""cinematography""! I don't want to describe to you the specific shots that I'm talking about, because all I'd be doing is suppressing your FILMGASM when you actually see them. There's a vast array of beautiful transitions and establishing shots, along with unique camera movements splattered everywhere.<br/><br/>Each character is interestingly twisted and broken in their own unique ways.<br/><br/>In many films that take a weird and non cohesive route with their story tend to fall ill of losing itself towards the end like Midsommar does. There's seems to be no over arching narrative that pieces it all together. It's lacking a true narrative like Hereditary.<br/><br/>The average movie goer will most likely not enjoy or appreciate certain aspects this film or will enjoy it simply because it's weird."

"movieman6-413-929510","3","21","36","3 August 2019"," An unclear film about a Swedish cult with strange traditions.
","Midsommar is a new horror film directed and written by Ari Aster, the director of Hereditary.<br/><br/>In the film, Dani (Florence Pugh) decides after a family tragedy with her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) and his friends to go on holiday to Sweden to deal with her tragedy and try to forget.
They travel to a remote Swedish village where the villagers celebrate a midsummer festival during the days where the sun keeps shining. The villagers invite their American guests to join in with their traditions.
For example, the group of friends starts celebrating the traditions where they first eat, dance and get high, but with the days the traditions of the village become darker and more bloody.<br/><br/>This film is unclear because, just like the characters in the film, you do not know what exactly the villagers are doing during their festival. With the many things that happen in the film, you as a viewer miss a form of explanation. The explanation you get in the film is conveyed in a way that is too unclear, so that you still do not understand everything clearly after the film ends. That is how some moments come across as comical
Another problem with the film is that it takes too long for the dark actions to start, because the first strange moment in the film only starts after about an hour. This is how the film actually starts with a lack of clarity and also at a slow pace.<br/><br/>This film also looks a lot like the film The Wicker Man from 1973 and because of the use of a bear in the film itself also something like the Nicolas Cage remake of The Wicker Man. In these films, an outsider also comes into contact with a cult and their strange habits. With this film you only got a clearer explanation as to what exactly happened in the films.
Despite the film's unclear story, Ari Aster has portrayed the film in a beautiful way. Every scene is almost clear, because the sun never sets in the film. He also makes nice use of what the movie looks like when the characters are high or when they are drugged. The film sets are also beautifully decorated with drawings and paintings of the traditions of the Swedish sect and these images also give away a bit of what is going to happen in the film.
Unfortunately, lesser effects have also been used, because with the dead bodies in the film you can see that they are cheap fake dolls as they used in old slasher horror films in the 1980s.<br/><br/>Because the characters themselves do not know what exactly is happening, the actors also appear somewhat unclear in the film. Florence Pugh does good acting in the beginning after the family tragedy that her character is experiencing. Once in Sweden she comes along with the rest of the cast that the American teenagers play more confused about. Will Poulter knows how to create some comical moments in the film, but his character sometimes disappears and then comes back a while later with new comic comments."
"melissagt","3","21","36","14 July 2019"," Laughing in the audience
","I honestly can't say that many films I've watched have left me this bored.
It really felt like a couple of people found a pretty location, some cool props in an attic and half whipped together a sort of storyline.
The whole time it felt like the film was ticking boxes to ensure it was 'weird' or 'disturbing' or 'artistic' when all it achieved was laughter from the audience at what were meant to be serious scenes or severe boredom as there was no compass to the story.
Characters died and you felt no connection to them, nor was it super clear who was who.
The whole film felt like the first 10 minutes of a good horror or psychological thriller before you delve into an edge of seat storyline. It was also way too long. Upset I wasted the money to be honest!"

"vengeance20","1","21","36","10 July 2019"," Extremely Disappointing!
","From the writer & director who brought you the, ok but slow & boring Hereditary comes this 2.0 version bore of a film which makes that film seem Oscar worthy.<br/><br/>I didn't exactly have high expectations of this film due to the writer & directors previous film, Hereditary being pretty boring & slow. It had the same poor directional, bad cinematography & overall poor editing seen in this film, but it was ok & had some creepy things going on in it. Hereditary at least was a horror film & executed that well throughout, plus it was shorter...<br/><br/>So with that film comes another from the same writer & director, Midsommar. Long story short, the film is about a group of young 20 something's who head off to Sweden & part take in a wicker man like cult.<br/><br/>While I knew this already from the trailers & previews, the film had little else to go on, but you'd expect a film that is 2 hours & 22 minutes to at least have something to go on if not a lot. But the film didn't sadly. The film for 3/4 is basically the group milling about this compound, sleeping, eating, drinking, drug taking, sitting, dancing & part taking in the weird activities this cult have for them. Only 1/4 of the film was horror. It's pretty sad to be honest. I felt the film was way too overloaded with the various activities you saw in the film if not extremely repetitive. The film could've been shorten down by at least 40 minutes tops, saving the rest for either a home release or keep them as deleted scenes. Slow burner or not, this just took the biscuit for pacing & was more frustrating, if not annoying to watch if anything else. Not entertaining.<br/><br/>There would be a lot of scenes which dragged & dragged awkwardly for no reason, even the cut clips themselves in the said scenes. There would even be suspenseful scenes which would take forever in a day to get to the ""point"" or ""pay off"" it was ""supposedly going to until it would then cut to another scene. Annoying & yet this writer & director claims this is a horror?<br/><br/>
The opening was bad too, not very bad, but not very good either. Don't get me wrong it was sinister, but it dragged & you felt it after the 3 minute mark. Even the part after the phone call sequence when Dani discovered her sister had killed herself & their parents via gassing from a gas exhaust from a running car dragged. You'd be sitting there thinking ""come on, just get to the point what's happening!?"" a lot of scenes did this in the film as I stated above. Not to mention the scenes that did do this cheated you & lead on into nothing. The opening was 12 minutes & 30 seconds long. You get over the opening at around 5 minutes, but to see title of the film & the opening credits roll after that long seems very tedious if not ridiculous.<br/><br/>The film itself was just filled with a lot of ""what the hell!?"" moments, even funny ones to be honest. The scenes would either be random, out of place or just badly put together with little to no narrative whatsoever. Not even in the obvious in terms of narrative.<br/><br/>Annoying parts included excessive wailing, crying, yelling & nauseousness. This again has a lot to do with the pacing & poor editing this film had. Even the parts which were suppose to be visually artistic got on your nerves as you just wanted them to get to the point & move on, the film travelled at a snails pace & felt way to over padded. Watching slugs race to even paint dry would be more fun than this. The film didn't even scare me at all, little to no horror. The film was more annoying & bizarre even for its own good to watch. I don't get the entertainment value. There was no plot to speak of & the film simply went nowhere. It fizzled out after the first 40 minutes.<br/><br/>However the acting was good, the gore effects were ok but nothing which in my mind would warrant an 18+ certificate from the BBFC. I seen more gore & violence in this year Superhero Horror Film, Brightburn which was only 15+. Crazy.<br/><br/>The director & writer himself claimed that Hereditary wasn't his first horror, but this film was? What? Ari Aster said that Midsommar was his first (then) going to be his first as Hereditary was just a ""family drama"" type film. The statement itself couldn't be more pungent in irony as Hereditary was more of a horror than this film would ever be.<br/><br/>Overall the film was flat out terrible & one the worst horror films of 2019 & one of the worst films overfall for this year alone. Ari Aster shouldn't make anymore of these films unless he looks at what went wrong with this one. Critics, cinema snobs & Rotton Tomatoes especially will praise this mess for either biased views on what makes a good horror film alone, to what makes a good film in general. I disliked this film & found it to be disappointing in the extreme. 1/10"

","Fortunately, I rented this while I was working from home so it wasn't a waste of time, but it was a waste of $5. Horrible. The preview is better than the film itself. One good thing about the movie is the cinematography and back drop. It's stunning. That's it. The beginning of the movie looked promising. Once they got to Sweden, it was all downhill from there. There was zero character develop. We don't even get to know Dani really well and the story really focuses on her. Christian and the other Americans, I could not have cared less what happened to any of them. Mark couldn't be more annoying if he tried. But we don't even get to know them. A big focus of the movie is supposed to be about the relationship between Dani and Christian. What relationship? They spend almost no time delving into any of that. The British couple actually seemed really interesting. Again, we don't get to know anything about them at all, even in death. Even the villagers are left strangers to the viewer. There's so many of them, but there isn't a single one who you end up caring about, except for the disabled Oracle. Now that was a storyline and it went no where! They could have even done more flashbacks to her life with her parents and sister which is the whole reason Dani was so messed up and went with them in the first place. Another thing that really got me is once you turn 72, you're supposed to jump off the cliff every ""May Day"". There were many characters clearly over 72 years of age running around after the two who killed themselves bit it. Don't get me started on the barn scene with Christian and Pelle's sister. It was more disturbing than anything. Actually a little gross to be honest. At the end, I was happy Christian ended up as the bear. Thought it was weird there was no closure. Just brainwashed Dani standing there with a creepy smile. And if you don't want to hear a lot of wailing and screaming and strange noises people should never make, definitely avoid!!! If the 9 sacrifices are only done every 90 years, everyone really seemed to know what they were doing. They must have rehearsed extensively!"

","I settled down to watch this in anticipation of being creeped out by a brilliant film (according to some critics). Instead I was bored senseless, and actually amused to the point of laughing in parts.<br/><br/>It starts well enough; the sense of dread and panic as Dani struggles to contact her family is beautifully done, and her grief at their deaths is palpable. Then the action moves to Sweden (actually Hungary) and the film falls apart.<br/><br/>Every action is signposted, the shocks shocking only for the amount of gore. Not one character is likeable, not even Dani whom we are meant to feel sorry for. It's like a teen slasher where characters make bad decisions and everyone just shrugs. Two people jump to their deaths because ""it's what we do"". Oh, that's ok then.<br/><br/>It's two-and-a-half hours of beautiful looking tedium that meanders to it's obvious conclusion. From the moment Pelle tells Dani about losing his family, you know she is joining the cult as a way of making up for her loss. And for those who say the haters ""don't get it"", I went through a spell of defending bad films as art. I eventually grew out of it.<br/><br/>Side note; the wailing and singing and dancing of the cult members gets very annoying very quickly. Get through it by watching some of the extras overacting as though their lives depended on it."

","I've previously seen Hereditary and it was one of the best movies in 2018 so seeing this movie from Ari Aster, my expectations were high. Although I have to say it is not on the same level, it is still a pretty good psychological horror. The cinematography is so gorgeous which makes it all so much more contrasting and horrific. The sound is always spot on but Florence Pugh was the true heart of this movie. She has such a wide range of emotions, is subtle when has to be subtle but makes a big perfect scene when she has too. Demonstrating all her skills, she'll go far in the industry! Still think she should've been nominated for this role instead of Little Women but I guess the important thing is that she's nominated. The screenplay is fantastic, setting up the movie in a suspenseful way. It didn't feel slow-paced to me, more like medium-paced, if that's a thing, since it always had something to grab my attention, Truly recommend it you go see it and like ""he"" says, try to keep an open mind about it!"

Neo-pagans send out some recruiters to bring outsiders into their closed community to participate sacrifice in a very weird neo-pagan ritual.<br/><br/>There are absolutely no mysteries or surprises with this one, it's a slow burn with some disturbing things thrown in. I wouldn't call it a horror movie, I'd call it a creepy boring movie. I found myself just wanting it to end. It really dragged on and on. In my opinion, at two hours and twenty-seven minutes it was at least 50 minutes too long.<br/><br/>I've no idea how this one got over 7 stars. It's box office at 11 weeks was just $27 million domestic, and $8 million worldwide. So, it wasn't a blockbuster by any stretch. However, I imagine it was fairly cheap to make, so perhaps it was profitable at that revenue level, I don't know.<br/><br/>I'd tell a friend to pass on this movie, or at least wait until they could watch it for free on a streaming service.

However starting with some fantastic camera work on the journey out to the festival, we are completely thrown into this new world, and before we know it we start to see the americans as the insane ones in the story.<br/><br/>Despite some dodgy prosthetics, the film is 100% immersive and through the use of a fantastic script, great direction and even better acting, we are taken through 2 and a half hours of the story before we even realise.<br/><br/>With a a beautiful ending to a fantastic film, it leaves us questioning our own understanding of community."

It was a good looking picture too. Great cinematography. The story is similar to the Wicker Man ( not the 2004 Nick Cage movie), it's a similar story of human Scarface.

Turns out it was a masterpiece, but also one of the most sickening, demented and sadisticly bothersome films I have seen to date.<br/><br/>At the end when the credits rolled, I sat in my seat, unable to think or speak, not wanting to stand up or do...anything, really. Midsommar is one that will leave a permanent mark on your soul. It's not happy. It's not moral and it's certainly not one to share with friends, unless you're ready to watch them grow sicker and sicker as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>In the end I gave this 8 stars because I am a huge fan of Ari Aster's directing, and Midsommar was an excellently shot film.

The movie does start off quite slow until they arrive at the cult. However, the film picks up after this and really gets going, but still not a lot of horror elements happen, which is kinda a good thing.<br/><br/>When the film tries to be scary, in my opinion it works. There's some scenes in the movie that really scared me. But there is only some, that's why I don't really believe this is a horror movie. It's more of a dark fairy tale. Which I loved!
There is a few comedic parts within the movie as well which also derailed it from being a straight up horror movie. The shots are beautiful and the score is Fantastic. The only reason I won't give it a 10 is because the beginning did start of abit too slow for me."

I put a lot of expectation on your new movie and I can say that it did not disappoint me.
Ari Aster handed me a movie that deals, between the lines, the relationship is worn out.
I like the beginning of the movie, because it uses time well to establish the relationship of the characters, both the main and the supporting.
The movie is also in no hurry to start acting like a thriller and horror.
The scenes that claim to be shocking take time to happen, but when they happen it is chilling.
While in Hereditary the dark environment prevails, here in Midsommar we have daylight remaining for much of the film.
For thinking that in horror movies bad things happen only at night, in this movie, it doesn't matter if it's clear.
Things happen the same way and have the same impact if it were overnight.
I loved the final scene and found it a bit like the Hereditary ending.
The triangular geometric form appears again here and the symbology it may have is quite understandable.
An ending that may not be seen as a happy ending, but in the eyes of the protagonist, is a perfect ending."

","10/10<br/><br/>What a delightful experience. I am so happy I got to see this incredible piece of art. This surely is one of the best films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Plot: After the tragic death of her family, Dani an emotionally unstable girl is invited to see a mid-summer festival in Sweden by her boyfriend. What started as a drug fueled, fun adventure in an otherworldly place takes increasingly darker turns with the passing of each day.<br/><br/>From the first scene of the film two things stood out. One is the cinematography and the other is the background music. And these two gets better and better until the end. I have never seen such a beautiful film. There are parts of films that looked incredible but to make film this beautiful is truly a work of art. The music and visual creates an ambiance that clearly gives a hint that this is going to be a tragic film. Once the friends make it into the idyllic village of the Harga the cinematography becomes even more awesome. It felt like a trip. The music always kept the tension even while nothing of unease was unfolding.<br/><br/>The first time we get to see the bizarre and possibly dangerous nature of the pagan ritual the characters are part of comes almost after an hour. The scene is so shocking that I had to look away from the screen. This is not a film for the faint of heart. It gets grotesque and bizarre from this point on.<br/><br/>The acting was superb. Florence Pugh did an excellent job portraying the emotional journey of Dani. The other members of the cast was fantastic.<br/><br/>There are so many good things to say about this film. I did not see the trailer nor read anything about it. Wanted to see it with an open mind. I am glad I did that. I found this film way better than Hereditary which is an excellent film as well."

","Seriously this is the question I am asking at the end of what appeared to be the promotion of Pagan ritualistic Satanist Sun worship to Mainstream Society.<br/><br/>Take the beginning sequence for example. What purpose did it serve for her sister to do that to her Parents and herself when it had absolutely no bearing on the plot as a whole? There was no reason given for it even happening.<br/><br/>The entire plot can be summed up here. Swedish guy is part of a cult and invites his friends in America to what he calls a Festival that is only celebrated once every 90 years (strange re-occurrence of the number 9 in this movie from the 18-36 both equal 9 in numerology, 36-54 again 9 and to the death at 72 again 9) when we know by now the real purpose of inviting his ""friends"" was to sacrifice them to the Pagan Sun God Horgus (not far from the real practices ritual sacrifice to the Sun God Horus).<br/><br/>So he invites them and one by one they go missing or are killed for breaking the rules. Then they get the main character into a competition perhaps purposely allowing her to win to distract her while her boyfriend is being bewitched by the love spell and forced to have sex with a girl while a load of other girls/women watch and repeat the grunts and groans.<br/><br/>Then the main character returns only to hear this going on and sees her boyfriend getting busy in the temple which makes her pick him for the sacrifice at the end? Why? Is she that twisted that she would happily see someone she was way too hooked on burn in a pyramid shaped barn along with 8 other sacrificial offerings? But just burning was not enough apparently because they had to gut a bear and get him to wear it as a animal costume!<br/><br/>And the worst thing of all? People actually follow this Pagan worship of the Sun God religion! No doubt when you saw it you were thinking the same thing as probably 99% of the audience. That this community were absolutely bonkers.<br/><br/>You'll have some people saying this is a masterpiece. Make your own minds up but to me this was absolute trash with a plot line that seemed to only exist in order to make this into a mainstream movie."

The simple answer is, this film just isn't good. It isn't an intellectual film. The emperor isn't wearing any clothes.<br/><br/>Sure, it was beautifully shot with bright sunshine and bold colours. It was also unnecessarily long. I know the concept was to set the monstrous against a backdrop of smiling villagers and quaint customs. But the characters were flat, the acting unconvincing. Any actual progress in the plot was painfully spread out, and like those much maligned mainstream horror films still had to rely on outright violence and some shoe horned nudity.<br/><br/>I think it tried to emulate the wicker man and capture that creeping sense that somethings wrong, but it just didn't manage it."

","NOTE - Obviously everything below is only my opinion. Anything involving creativity (e.g. music, movies, art, etc) is always subjective.<br/><br/>WARNING - Spoilers ahead!!!<br/><br/>I wanted to give this movie 3 stars because the cinematography was really good, but the story and execution was so bad I had to give it 1 star. Any good director can do cool shots. It's knowing WHEN to do them.<br/><br/>There are multiple factors that play into my 1-star review, and coincidentally they are the same factors that can be found in his previous movie ""Hereditary"" (which I like more than this movie, but still thought It was poorly done).<br/><br/>One factor is bad marketing. They made this out to be a horror movie. Which I didn't think it was AT ALL. I have no idea what movie genre to put this under. Maybe Drama/Folklore/Religious with some Gore tossed in there. (The gore was awesome)<br/><br/>It also felt like a Wicker Man (Nicholas Cage one) rip-off. Wicker Man pissed me off, but I still loved it. ""Midsomnar"" pissed me off, and I hate it.<br/><br/>Another factor was the beginning. Beginnings of movies are so important for me. They set the tone of the rest of the movie and help seal the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The death scene of the girls family was AMAZING, but COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY!!! I don't understand why it had to be so over-the-top. Is it because the Director/Writer wanted this already messed up girl with a messed up sister to be even more messed up by having her entire family die? Thus, giving her the reason to fit into this new ""family""? I'm fine that her family died, but that death scene was so intense, it made me think that HOW her family died was going to tie into the rest of the movie. Which it doesn't. The family should have just died in a car accident and call it a day. Maybe Ari didn't want to do that because he already used a family-car-accident-death scene in ""Hereditary"".<br/><br/>I can go into everything wrong with this movie, but I'm going to say just on more thing: Who in their right mind decides to go to Sweden and take shrooms right after your family dies by carbon monoxide poisoning where your sister taped a hose to her mouth and taped hoses into their parents bedroom?!?!?!?<br/><br/>They should just call this movie ""White people"". Because they are crazy. (This is coming from a middle-aged white guy. So I know these things)"

","Oh dear.
This film has annoyed me more than many other in recent history. After enjoying the intrigue and greatly nuanced debut of Hereditary, I was eager to watch this. But oh my, what a let down.
While I was enjoying the cinematography, and the colour palette and even the pacing of the action which is ponderous at best, I awoke the next morning with a feeling I had spied the emperors new clothes.
Every time I think about this film, it annoys me more. The premise is not new but certainly showed early signs branching out, however this is stifled by some awfully clunky dialogue and poor character development. Did anybody care about all the new bloods at all?
And even as some of the more graphic scenes are those that may linger long within the memory, surely what will stick more in the craw of many horror aficionados are the many unnecessary genre tropes, film school McGuffins and trippy visual effects that are crowbarred in to carry the action along, when they are jarring and at odds to the overall narrative and consequential ethereal feel to the piece.

A death scene early in the movie was gross for the sake of being gross, and bodies are suddenly revealed on screen a short time later, just in case you didn't watch the brutal deaths themselves. A ritualistic sex scene was about as awkward and unsettling as it could be, and I'm fortunate to have watched this one alone.

"GiraffeDoor","2","6","8","3 April 2020"," I think I'd rather help Greta Thunberg pick a prom dress for two and half hours.
","I feel very similarly about this movie than I did with Hereditary by the same writer.<br/><br/>I feel this could have been a majestic, compact, efficient 90 minute chiller that was a masterpiece of its genre. But sadly this movie drowns in its own over ambition with way too much thrown at us and the ultimate effect is portentous, messy and inelegant.<br/><br/>The detail in realizing the picture is certainly very impressive: the rich sense of place and local color alone could almost have made this movie worth seeing if it had been 25% shorter. In short, the thing looks fantastic and very professional (until it gets confident but I'll get to that).<br/><br/>Ari Aster is... a lot like David Lynch. By this I mean that he is a film maker that has a marvellous imagination, a rich mind for stories a certain boldness that some people think has gone in horror. But he really, really needs to learn how to self edit. He is surrounded by too many yes-man (and women) for some reason. Like Hereditary, it's hard to verbalize exactly what is wrong with this movie because it takes the form of so many little things that wreck the mood like wrong notes in an otherwise well composed piece of music. Seriously, someone who call tell him ""Ari, baby, you're script, she's phenomenal! Just take out this, this, this, this, that and replace this with something less convoluted and we've got gold!"".<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes alone gave me so much to chew on: the way that tetraptych flies open like it's a preschooler's show, the way they cut away from the intense Nordic Winter with that phone ringing as if it were a comedy. The word ""scary"" twice! (show don't tell) and then something I've been seeing in more and more horror movies that really gets to me: we begin with a something horrible happening. Which would be fine except it *has nothing to do with the rest of the frickin' movie*. And no, don't try to tell me that it's thematic and part of the character's journey. This movie had 150 minutes to sell this to me and I still don't buy it. Dani Is a bland, one dimensional character with no personality beyond feeling sorry for herself which she has every right to do, given the circumstances, but it makes for tedious cinema. She is not an interesting protagonist. That should have been Chidi. He is the one character who really feels like a character, rather than target practice and the acting probably played a part in that.<br/><br/>Other bizarre cinematic choices like a strange obsession with reflections which might have been atmospheric if they'd spaced them out more but there's two scenes in the first act where someone talks to someone off screen but we see their reflection...if there might have been good if there were some theme of self discovery in this movie, but there really isn't any more than any movie. And another time when they match cut going into one room and into another...it's so obvious they used a trick set it ruins the mood. And when the camera says ""screw it"" and goes upside down...now I'm a sucker for stylized cinematography but there needs to be a physical justification for it. Maybe a character leaned back and saw the world upside down for a moment...but no...ellipsis, ellipsis, ellipsis....<br/><br/>Another issue is how it seems to be Dani's story and yet we keep pulling away from her. But she annoys me so I'm not sure how much of an issue this really is.<br/><br/>The film is a blur of excessive plot points, obnoxious characterisation and misjudged dialogue. I don't care about Dani. I just don't and she is played irritatingly. The thing I really like about this picture is curiously the thing everyone who likes it hates: the slow atmospheric scenes where you can't resist the sense that some unseen terror is coming. We so don't get enough of that in horror, not now, not in yesteryear. It does feel a lot like rip off of Wicker Man sometimes but that's it's strongest element. And that sinks in all the other stuff...<br/><br/>And the ending...well, I won't spoil it but wowee I have not been ticked off at an ending so much since Knock Knock. I raised my middle finger to the end credits and told movie exactly what I think of it.<br/><br/>in conclusion, some magnificent film making is wasted, even ruined, in a hubristic attempt to make what could have been an admirable horror movie into an exploration of the human condition. An expertly made cake with 3 grams of human excrement is still a bad cake, and that is sort of how I feel about this movie.<br/><br/>I did stick with it for the full 150 minutes to be fair and I'm sure there was fun along the way (best sex scene ever...) but my final emotion was not boredom or frustration but white hot anger. You'll understand why when you see it. Or maybe not...<br/><br/>Fudge this movie. I love that it's trying to be something beyond the cookie cutter teen scream horror but a film needs to do more than look the part."

"Hallelujah289","8","6","8","7 February 2020"," Brightly lit, underplayed, slow burn horror
","This is the first film I watched by this director. Having no expectations, and not having watched his previous debut film Hereditary, I was impressed with the skillful storytelling, the way the shots were staged, and the use of various cutaways and CGI effects to show the characters's states of trauma and drug induced disorientation. The cinematography and use of color is amazing, I believe filmed in Hungary but set in Sweden. The overexposure does lend itself to a feeling of being off kilter, as well as the smiling good humor of the Swedish commune, as they distribute unknown drugs and perform terrible and disturbing rituals. All of this is very numbing and a good kind of commentary to the tolerated unease in the relationship of the principal characters Dani and Christian, who are on the brink of break up.<br/><br/>The director has said the film Midsommar was a way of his trying to navigate the feelings of his break up. He has said there is no specific correlation but that he most identifies with Dani and that he has a lingering attachment to ""dead things,"" perhaps meaning to dead relationships. He offers no further specifics, but watching the film you get a sense of how, perhaps, those in our collective ancestral past dealt with cycles of life and death, be it by ritual or sacrifice (extremely literal in this movie), and the kind of depth of emotion that goes with those ceremonies of beginnings and ends.<br/><br/>Midsommar is one part neurotic, hyper articulate and hyper aware relationship drama, portrayed very relatably, and then one part drugged out, mythical, pagan sunshine nightmare. It at times feels it's budget with some of its editing choices and choice of cast (familiar faces who don't quit gel together), but at other times it has the look and sound of incredible filmmaking, if very sparse in the absence of more sounds, and the gore it sometimes does show exorbitantly and then other times not at all.<br/><br/>Horror isn't my genre, but I admire this film for its originality and the type of catharsis it does begin to induce. I don't think it went quite all the way for me in this department. I was expecting more. This film probably needs a very specific audience. Please do appreciate it for its staging and cinematography in any case."
"leefreeman99","7","6","8","6 February 2020"," Once in a lifetime
","There are some wierd beliefs about that have filtered down through the ages and some are explored in this movie.
The pace seems a little slow at first but it is about right, gently luring you into what seems to be a curious observation of an old society before exposing you to something you feel you weren't expecting but actually you were. As the story progresses you know things aren't as they should be and it is this hook that keeps you intrigued. Even when you know what's going to happen, you feel compelled to watch.
If you watch closely, at one point you are made aware of what is and going to happen. With this in mind, the tapestry of lives both intrinsic and external to the community of Midsommar, are forever intertwined and weaved by a good story teller.
If you've seen Hereditary then you have some idea of the director's ways. Both Hereditary and Midsommar stay with you, lingering in daydreams and dreams, of which I'm undecided if it's a good thing or not.
The end is reminiscent of other films but it can be forgiven as it is a natural conclusion, even though quite chilling.
This film will not be forgotten if you dare to watch it."
"zkonedog","7","6","8","3 February 2020"," Perhaps The Strangest Movie Of 2019
","When the credits rolled on my ""Midsommar"" watching experience, my first thought was ""that was the strangest movie I've seen in quite some time"". I probably should not have been surprised, seeing as how this was director Ari Aster's next project after the equally quirky ""Hereditary"". While I can't go so far as to say that the strangeness of ""Midsommar"" made it one of my favorite films, I did--aside from one fatal flaw--enjoy the overall experience.<br/><br/>For a very basic overview, ""Midsommar"" sees young adult Dani (Florence Pugh) going through a hard time. Her entire family is destroyed by an incredibly traumatic event, and to top things off boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) is waffling within the relationship. Somewhat reluctantly, Christian and his fellow dissertation-searching friends invite Dani on their trip to Sweden to study Midsommar festivals. What they all find is an experience unlike anything that has ever been witnessed.<br/><br/>The setup in this film is generally very solid. The whole process sort of reminds me of films like ""Get Out"" or ""Us"", where the filmmakers do a great job of creating authentic characters while surrounding them with an air of mystery. In the journey to the actual festival, all the characters here seem like they could be playing out a very believable scenario, and that makes them ultra-relatable.<br/><br/>Once at the crazy Swedish festival, the film is sort of a combination of ""The Village"" and ""The Wicker Man"". While the proceedings start off as fairly innocuous, the bizarreness of the whole thing slowly unveils itself. Very well-paced in terms of not getting too crazy too fast, while also getting in enough scares/thrills to satisfy the audience.<br/><br/>A lot of praise so far, so why the seven-star rating? Because ""Midsommar"" suffers from one fatal flaw:<br/><br/>(Warning: Heavy spoilers ahead!)<br/><br/>This is very much a metaphor film. If taken literally, the events make very little sense. Only after looking at it from a certain lens do the pieces begin to fall into place. Essentially, the entire movie is Dani's grief experience of losing her family and then not being supported by her boyfriend. In order for that to ""work"", though, the film needed to make it more clear that Christian was indeed a dead-beat, lame partner. In all honesty, the down-to-earth quality of the character writing might have actually hurt the film in this regard, as I never got the sense that Christian was an out-and-out villain. As the film itself expressly states, ""maybe Dani is being too clingy/needy?"". While surely not ultra-supportive, I just never got that sense that Christian was the ""big bad"" here, and without that the overall metaphor (especially the ending) falls a bit flat.<br/><br/>Overall, though, ""Midsommar"" fascinated me enough for me to give it solid marks. The major misstep described above prevented me personally from totally buying in, but I can easily see others not having that problem (provided they recognize it for the metaphor journey that it is, of course)."
"Mike_Devine","7","6","8","1 February 2020"," The kind of horror that gives your mind a workout
","On the heels of the deeply disturbing 'Hereditary,' Ari Aster returns with the equally unsettling Nordic nightmare that is 2019's 'Midsommar.'<br/><br/>Graphic. Gruesome. Trippy. Twisted. All adjectives that can be used to describe this film. The events that unfold throughout can be interpreted in many different ways, but at the center of everything is a fractured relationship between the two young American twentysomethings - Dani (Florence Pugh) and Christian (Jack Reynor). Unfortunately, the fragile bond that ties them together is not much of a match for the centuries-old barbaric rituals that take place during their summer adventure in a remote village in northern Sweden.<br/><br/>Seeing how the relationship between Dani and Christian weathers the storm during their stay on this compound is something that doesn't really register until after the credits roll. 'Midsommar' messes with your mind and makes you question how things got to the way they end up. How much of the storyline is impacted by outside factors, and how much of it originates from within? This is a question that is up for much debate.<br/><br/>But among the drug-fueled highs and the depressing lows of 'Midsommar' is the frighteningly beautiful fantasyland in which the film is set. The natural wonder of the Swedish (or Utahan) landscape sets an incredibly stark contrast from the horrors carried out by those who inhabit the area, and the incredible cinematography warps things even further. Maybe it's the midnight sun, maybe it's the use of color. Perhaps it's the use of sound (or lack thereof). Whatever it is, it reaches out and grabs you, and doesn't let go.<br/><br/>Before you are finally able to move on from the final 15 minutes of 'Midsommar,' you wonder why you just sat through it. But the more you think about it, the more you recognize the metaphors and themes woven into the script, the use of foreshadowing and visual cues. The film is heavy, yes, but in a weird way it's like abstract art. Some love it, many hate it, and others are still trying to figure it out."

The cinematography is beautiful and tone is so unsettling that it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire movie. Some people say it's boring, but that may be because this isn't your typical horror movie. If you're more into slashers and mainstream, as other reviews have stated, then you probably shouldn't watch this movie."
"vahidrak","9","6","8","12 December 2019"," It is not a horror movie !!!
","I spent one hour in youtube after watching this movie and it was so beautiful, there is so much information about this movie that every channel was implying something new. well except for Ari Aster saying that ""this is a break up movie""
First of all, this is not a horror movie. Why people watching it expect horror? it wasn't even written in the movie's genre. If you watch it and expect a horror movie it's going to be a very long and boring one. so just watch it as a thriller drama.
Second of all, I think the development of characters was one of the strongest points about it, Dani is a girl with no family and then in the village she eventually finds one, her boyfriend, Christian, is a senseless not-caring boyfriend who pretends to care about his 3/4 year relationship and he also ends up with the consequences of his decisions. it was perfect
Honestly Ari Aster became one of my favorites after watching Midsommar, I can't wait for his next title."
"LnineB","8","6","8","9 December 2019"," Horrifically Wonderful
","This is by far the best horror film I've seen in the past five or so years. I've actually seen it three times since it's release and will watch it again shortly after buying the extended version.<br/><br/>This film isn't perfect. It could actually be a bit too long and the middle sequence after the mid-act climax is WAY too long for such an intense climax. With that said, there are a few things that completely make you forgive those mistakes.<br/><br/>1. Florence Pugh's performance : She's absolutely amazing and captures the intricate details of a person's psyche after experiencing a traumatic event. Her performance also justifies her actions later in the film. We are constantly reminded that she is broken and fragile. In that state she could be easily manipulated and should'e been nurtured instead of patronized.<br/><br/>2. The first sequence, Mid-climax and finale. Like I said earlier the parts in between these sequences are a bit too long but these scenes are masterful, especially the build-up to the middle sequence. Aster reminds us , in the beginning of this film , that TRUE horror comes in the form of depression, suicide, murder and supreme lost of a loved one. The beginning scene is almost too much to watch, especially if you've experienced similar horrific acts. The Mid-Climax is just simply horrific. There's nothing symbolic about it. It's just something that you almost don't want to see ever again. The ending is tamer in comparison to the first two sequences but it does successfully wraps up a surreal experience in the most perfect way.<br/><br/>3. The cinematography: The beginning of the film is dark and appropriate for the theme,but the rest of the film, almost 2-1/2 hours of it , is represented in a wash of light and colors. It literally looks TOO perfect , of which is exactly the feeling you should get once you meet the cult. By the end of the film the light and colors become annoying. Too me that's a good thing, because, also by then, you are finding out how horrific of a setting the land is. This is a perfect way carrying out a concept through the details of a film.<br/><br/>4. The deeper meaning: This is of course my interpretation but the deeper meaning of this film makes it a masterpiece. I've seen reviews saying that the film is unrealistic and that there is NO story or mystery in the film. I actually think the exact opposite. it's unrealistic to some because it's an analogy of something that is very REAL . The complete disconnect we as humans have with trauma is represented clearly in this film. The story to me is about this disconnect with trauma or the lack of meaningful relationships. This is the reason someone can be drawn to cults or negative influences. The supporting characters in this film represent the everyday reactions and responses to horrific trauma by a lot of people today (ie thoughts and prayers). The main character represents the person that is truly grieving and is often left alone or made to think that their grieving is actually wrong. To me this analogy makes this film VERY realistic and actually more scary than other horror films.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved this film and can't wait to watch the extended version of it. It's the well crafted, thought provoking, type of horror that we need in this day and time. 8/10"
"tdrish","8","6","8","5 December 2019"," clever, unique horror film
","This movie was amazing. It's an emotionally surcharaged, disturbing, and yet visually striking film. I've never quite seen a horror movie as such. First and foremost, maybe its important that the viewer gets a heads up on what they will be expecting, without giving any major surprises away. I will let you know, this is INDEED a horror movie, but you're not going to get anything violent right off the bat, so if patience isn't one of your traits, Midsommar may be trouble for you. The film patiently builds itself and its characters, uniting them as one, and with clever camera work and cinematography, we are woven into the lives of such characters and we are emotionally attached to these characters. The film is strategic in all its design. Every scene, every sound, and everything you see. The director knew what he was writing and directing, and he does such a damn good job at it. On the negative side, not everyone will appreciate Midsommar for what it is. What it is, is a surreal, very moving film that captures mystery with, how do I say, an uncomfortable feeling. If at any point, especially in the beginning of the film, if you every get uneasy or that unpleasant feeling....that's wonderful! That's EXACTLY what the film is intended to do. Does it seem to bombard the viewer with visual? That's debatable. While there were times I felt this attribute was abused, on the same token, it cannot be denied that it works for what its intended to do. The film doesn't want to keep you up tonight with nightmares, it just demands to be remembered, and if you're in the right mood, and you can appreciate it for what it is, you will remember. Again. Not a movie for everyone. It's the wrong movie to watch if you're already feeling sad. Although the films latter moments has many, many lighthearted scenes in the sun, filling it with a sense of joy and happiness, it's important to understand that Midsommar is a movie that is not here to cause you to want to hug your neighbor and bake them cookies after your done watching. This is a surreal life horror movie. That's what it is, and from what I've seen, everything here was done correctly, and passes with flying colors. Most of the bad reviews on this film, from what I've seen, is just because they don't understand, or they don't want to understand. Story goes as follows: A tragic suicide rattles a small family, and they decide to make a special vacation trip overseas to ""keep them together."" The aftermath is unpredictable and unspeakable acts and acts of violence. I've said too much. The film must be seen to be believed. And just try to understand, the film stands in its own catagory. It is unique. I praise A24 films for being a very successful movie industry that doesn't believe that its audience has to settle for less then perfection. Job well done, team!"
"Cinemagoer77","8","6","8","25 November 2019"," Excellent horror film about a cult
","This is generally a disturbing film. Some people say it was funny perhaps because they were uncomfortable with some scenes yet so many people were offended or hated it. So my guess is the movie made people uncomfortable. Again, it was a disturbing film which many horror films are not these days. I welcomed Ari's latest effort as horror is becoming non-horrific lately with so many tropes that the genre is lacking these days. The 1 star reviewers ignore the story telling, ignore any of the characters, ignore the symbolism that exists through the entire story, and ignore the creepiness of some of the sociopathic members. You should rewatch it just to see how evil their foreign friend actually is. It is atleast a 4 or 5 star minimum. I say this is a thinkers horror film because i had to rewatch twice. Although the movie is gory it doesn't glorify the actions of the cult members. You get the feeling the cults are indeed the abnormalities we know they are and it's a visceral feeling to see them carry out their rituals. Cults can be argued as the anti-thesis of progress/freedom and how they possess the means to attract people is just as baffling. Well Midsommar offered a glimpse into the cult via codependency and loss. Add in charming sociopathy who tell people what they like to hear and we have some poor people who get lead into horror and loss of freedom/love. As a cult film this is atleast 8. Also, The wicker man comparisons need to stop. How many posession movies are there and how many times need they be compared? Cult horror is a sub-genre like zombie films are also a sub-genre. This is an excellent film about the horrors of a cult for modern times. I really think Ari is becoming a true master of horror. He leaves many viewers disturbed but also with warnings and lessons about what evil really is. He does not glorify horror..rather he reveals
consequences..8 out of 10 for me.."
"Pretentious_Viewer","8","6","8","24 November 2019"," Ari Aster is a genius.
","People have already said this countless times before about this film, and I'll say it again; this film is not your typical horror film. You might like that, you might not. I loved it. I watch a lot of horror films, and it's always refreshing to find a film that attempts to do something different with the genre.
It's not set in some creepy location like an asylum, or an old mansion, or a camping site in the middle of some dark woods. Instead, it's set in a bright and sunny village in the middle of Sweden. Visually, the film isn't dark. The scares don't play off a nighttime setting (in fact, I think only two scenes in the film take place during the night), but instead everything is set in the middle of the day where it's light and there's no shadows or chilling wind. The film is visually quite beautiful and aesthetic, with colourful shots of nature, and an overall amazing cinematography. And yet, every shot and every take of the flowers and the mountains and the trees feel so eerie and unsettling. It's something you have to watch to experience.
The characters are well-built, and most importantly, they feel real from the way they talk to the way they interact with one another. I'll take this moment to highlight the main character, Dani, a well-written character who is brilliantly portrayed by Florence Pugh.
I could keep praising the film, because I loved it that much, but I don't want to spoil too much. Just go watch it. It's definitely worth it."

","A group of American college students who have never seen the Wicker Man travel to Sweden to visit their friend's rural hometown for its fabled midsummer festival, but what begins as an idyllic retreat quickly devolves into an increasingly violent and bizarre competition at the hands of a pagan suicide cult. Ari Aster's follow up to Hereditary has been described as both a 'Wizard of Oz for perverts', exposing the rotten heart of western civilisation, and a bad trip comedy (the hallucinations the characters experience while tripping on magic mushrooms are some of the most realistic ever portrayed on film). Midsommar is an ambitious movie, impressively crafted, and above all unsettling, further enhancing writer-director Aster's credibility as a horror auteur to be reckoned with."
"bea37","6","6","8","2 November 2019"," More like a painting than a narrative *spoilers*
","I think the film, while beautiful to look at, has simple storytelling problems: 1) we don't feel much for the characters, hence we don't feel much at all; 2) it has no climax.<br/><br/>The characters are not developed enough for us to feel that invested, and Christian, specifically, is too generic for us to care about him.<br/><br/>POV keeps changing, which may work for slasher movies, but here... not so much.
The worst moment in this sense is showing the red-haired girl getting ready for seduction: shouldn't we be always ""with"" the outsiders? Why are we ""alone"" with her? Bad scene.<br/><br/>And... no climax. As we know everything that is going to happen (foreshadowing is largely used in tapestry, wall paintings, and dialogue), there are no surprises or reveals.<br/><br/>Also, to work as a fable, it should be more distant from reality; to work as reality, it should be closer to it. There are many contrivances - are the boys really PhD students? If so, why are they so completely lost regarding methodology, ethics, theme definition and all the basics of which common researchers are aware?<br/><br/>The festival happens every 90 years, but the May Queen is elected every year. So her role in the other 89 years is to bless the crops, and this one time (what a coincidence that Dani got to win!) is to decide who dies. Oh well.<br/><br/>As others are commenting, Midsommar does less with what other movies did more.
For loony pagans and their rituals with a somewhat anthropologist character, The Wicker Man.
For white-dressed girls dancing in trance, Picnic at Hanging Rock.
For cult craziness and the effects on a girl, Marcy May Marlene.
For a detached, superficial boyfriend, Legally Blonde ;)"
"Martinito_08183","9","6","8","18 October 2019"," One of the best and unique horror films that i've seen this decade.
","Midsommar was a giant surprise for me this year. I didn't read any reviews about it and didn't saw any trailers, since i like being surprised and watching films without knowing anything is not something new, since i prefer it that way. I loved the film after i saw it for the first time and after seeing it for the second time - i loved it more from the beginning to the end. Ari Aster brought us something that was unexpected and masterfully made film with some problems that i have that did hurt the film and lowers the score down a bit. Aster proves that he is a person that will deliver greatness and i hope in the future he experiments with other genres other than horror.<br/><br/>I love Hereditary so much. It was a breath of fresh air, since every year Hollywood continues to be so unoriginal and releases so many films that rely so much on jump scares (and being poorly made) and very rarely do we see masterfully made and original horror films, since those films show the strengths of the genre as a whole. After loving the experience of watching Hereditary, i was excited for the next film by Ari Aster and see in what direction he will take with Midsommar and like Hereditary - Ari Aster didn't disappoint with his new film.<br/><br/>The story was great and it keeps you interested all the way through, but it may be very slow for many and unfortunately the pacing is not as smooth as Hereditary, since the difference between them is 20 minutes (or 44 minutes, if you compare it with the Director's Cut), so the film takes it's time and doesn't rush anything, but in some moments it may feel way too long. The film takes elements that were done before and does them in a new way or should i say: it takes them in a new direction. I'm not going to mention anything that can be considered as spoiler, but watching it you can tell what film inspired it and in some occasions - it's very obvious, but for me it wasn't distracting all that much. The strongest aspect of the story is the relationship between the two main characters (Dani and Christian) and the way it was presented felt very real and you witness how their relationship falls apart throughout the film and it's interesting to watch. The only complaint that i have towards the story is that there are scenes that were supposed to be serious, but they came out very comical at times.<br/><br/>There is a lot that you can appreciate about it and it also succeeds in many of the aspects, but also a few things that are unsuccessfully executed:
<ul><li>The characters are very compelling, but there are some that are not very well developed in the whole film.</li><li>The acting is very good. Everyone does a great job with the material they are given. Florence Pugh was the one, who stands out the most for me and gives one of the best performances of the year.</li><li>The cinematography is fantastic and the choices of where they placed the camera is great and there are many shots that are beautiful.</li><li>The music is great: it's beautiful and in some moments it's haunting and the composer did a great job of building the atmosphere with with it.</li><li>The dialogue is great. The way it was written is fascinating and the interaction between the two main characters was so interesting and felt so real, but there were times when the dialogue wasn't great. The character Mark (played by Will Poulter) did not have good lines at all.</li></ul><br/><br/>I learned that there are two versions of the film and because of that comes a question - which version should i recommend to everyone: the Theatrical or the Director's Cut? I had the chance of seeing them both and the Director's Cut was supposed to be the original version that Ari Aster wanted to release, but he didn't had the change, since we rarely see a 3 hour film in the cinema and Hollywood doesn't make long film all that much today. I can understand why some of the scenes were cut, but there is a scene which shows a ceremony (or ritual) that is set at night and after that shows more of Dani and Christian's relationship. After watching that scene, i don't know why it didn't make it to the Theatrical Cut. If you were expecting some gore or disturbing moments in the Director's Cut, then you'll probably be disappointed. If you don't have any plans of seeing it or you won't have a chance of watching the The Director's Cut - the Theatrical Cut still feels complete and doesn't feel like something is missing in it, so it's still a better option, but if you enjoyed the experience like me, then it's worth the watch.<br/><br/>Midsommar is intriguing, disturbing and frightening and i highly recommend it to everyone who is a fan of the horror genre or even a fan of psychological horror in general. It's a film that after watching it, you will still be thinking about it and for me it's one of the best films of 2019."

","I haven't seen Hereditary yet, but judging from Ari Aster's short films, I knew I was in for something weird and weird is what i got. Midsommar is a strange and twisted film about grief, the hardships of being in a relationship, and how cults prey on the vulnerable. This movie has incredible cinematography, and the way it builds up and goes absolutely bonkers at the end was fun to watch, but the main standout of this film is Florence Pugh. She gives a very raw performance and perfectly portrays the grief of her character."

And the performances are GREAT. Especially the main character played by Florence. She maybe deserves an Academy Award nomination for this movie. That's how good she is. Like I said this movie is disgusting and hard to watch at times. A lot of ""what is going on"" scenes and I respect Ari for not holding back. As far as issues. It's a little lengthy. I love long movies but I feel this movie suffered at times and could've easily been chopped down to exactly 2hrs and it would've been fine. Last but not least the way this movie looks... Is AMAZING. This again deserves a Oscar nomination for best Cinematography. It's just gorgeous. I recommend this movie for anyone who really wants to see a weird bizzare movie that is still very good."

The goal of being daunting in daylight works primarily at the beginning, once we get used to it it loses strength. ""Midssomar"" is being loved or hated, I think it's a good movie, nothing more than that, but if I had to choose between loving and hating, I'd rather love. It is also important for the viewer to embark on the long wave to feel its tension and despair, otherwise it will be a long, boring and tiring trip.

"berndgeiling","9","6","8","29 September 2019"," A consequent and convincing artistic vision
","I can't remember having seen such a strong artistic vision from an american director for a very long time. Ari Aster continues exactly where Hereditary, his former movie, finished.
In sharp contrast to the beautiful cinematography he presents a cult society, friendly in the beginning, a bit weird maybe and sometimes unintentionally ridiculous, but with strict rules and regulations, a Horror Vacui system which is totally convincing for those who believe in it, and absolutely murderous for any stranger unable to read the signs around.
And it transforms the viewer into exactly this kind of stranger.
It left an intense impression on me, i was shocked, stunned and speechless after the end for quite some time.
It's definitely NOT a conventional horror movie! It goes much further even on a subconscious level."

And I was right. If you are familiar with the original Wicker Man, this movie will not surprise you in the slightest. But is it any good?<br/><br/>Well, it is beautifully photographed and there is some excellent sound design. There is a sense of creeping uneasiness, and some general nastiness here and there - it is a horror film, after all. The direction is sometimes very good, and sometimes a bit too much like showing off. And Florence Pugh is jaw-droppingly good.<br/><br/>There is nothng by way of made-you-jump moments - not a bad thing, in my view.<br/><br/>But there are a number of plot points which are inadequately dealt with which, to me, means they shouldn't have been there to start with - crass college pal Mark, for instance, whose attitude towards Dani has no payoff whatsoever. And this is particularly relevant given that this rather slight tale runs for 140 minutes. This tale unfolds at a pace which is a bit too leisurely.

","It's easy to forget, as you reach the end of this shattering horror story, that it opens with a moment of trauma. Before the central characters leave the U.S. for their trip to a seemingly idyllic commune in Sweden, one of them is visited with profound, shocking grief. Once they're in Sweden, it takes a good while for earth-shaking events to take place; not that these are not hinted at, of course. But as the scene is set, we are treated to something like a Robert Altman film. Multiple characters on the screen deal with each other as they relax on hillsides, play music, settle in, etc. In short, the sheer realism of this movie makes its sheer terror all the more plausible. Describing the plot can never do justice to the first-rate acting, cinematography and editing. Hitchcock once said, ""I wanted PSYCHO to be a fun picture."" MIDSOMMAR is fun, as well. But PSYCHO wasn't a documentary. MIDSOMMAR has something of a documentary about it. It is very much about cults.
You have to bring something to it when you watch it. The audience I saw it with (in its first week here in the U.S.) began laughing about two-thirds of the way through a particularly detailed sexual scene. There was grim humor in it, but this was the laughter of discomfort. On the way out of the theatre, though, I got the sense that even people who said they were confused by it were entertained. THAT said, I'm not certain entertainment was intended. MIDSOMMAR is scary because much of what it depicts is the essence of cult life."

On the other hand, it had some pretty unsettling moments, some of which were actually pretty funny (probably unintentionally), and the movie had a very dreamlike quality to it, which is a plus.

","Hereditary was one of my favorite films of last year. it was such a unique and unsettling film. If anything, it showed that Ari Aster was a force on his directorial debut. We all wondered what as next. Midsommar quickly became my most hyped film of the summer and I vowed to see it as soon as it comes out. Midsommar is exactly what I wanted it to be and more. This will be a polarizing film, I feel but I already know that I want to rewatch it because it is truly a mesmerizing experience.<br/><br/>The film is about a group of friends who travel to Sweden for a celebration that occurs every 90 years. The protagonist (played by Florence Pugh), recently experienced a traumatic loss and goes on this trip with her boyfriend in hopes of repairing their very distant relationship. Everything seems beautiful and serene at first but the group soon realize that this festival is not normal at all and the bizarre cult-like events are actually a lot more dangerous than they seem.<br/><br/>Ari Aster shows that he is already an expert in filmmaking. This film is a very loose horror as a lot of it is comedic, abstract, visual, and more unsettling than scary. Its perfect that way and shows the range Aster has. The lighting, setting, and cinematography in this film are absolutely stellar. It is an absolutely beautiful looking picture. Someone else who really shows range is Florence Pugh. From playing Lady Macbeth, to a WWE wrestler, to a girl going through an absolutely traumatic experience.<br/><br/>A lot of this film is humorous. Its hard not to burst out laughing at the uncomfortably bizarre sequence of events in this film. The pagan like rituals in this film are just so engorging to behold and you just want to know more and more at the mythos behind this cult. The film is so unique in its nature but the creativity and imagery flow through, much like with Hereditary.<br/><br/>This is pure unhinged ambition from Aster. He takes the reigns off from what he did with Hereditary and explores a beautifully terrifying event with people who are darker than they seem. The film is a slow burn but its fun to just stare at every frame and behold the transpiring of absolute madness. Its an absolute psychedelic trip from start to finish.

Needless to say, this film is disturbing, moving and mortifying on so many levels that you can't help but be blown away by the narrative and it's after-shocks; especially since it burns slow in such a way that, even if you see the punches coming beyond the normal sense of anticipation, it remains punches that knock the wind out of you in spite of itself.<br/><br/>And what's even more terrifying is that the horror therein lies in its solid footing in reality. It almost all takes place in broad daylight, which is also scary as hell.<br/><br/>Yes, my stomach churned more than once due to the less often gore there, but, as a Bi-polar myself (it playing a small but significant role in the story), this is a film that sent my mind racing from the get-go.<br/><br/>Realistic, psychological terror and dispair you cannot look away from. This one will stay with you and may even haunt you a little if you let it.<br/><br/>For my part, I love this film for probably all the wrong (or maybe right) reasons."

","Why do so many movies and TV shows nowadays try to be edgy and leave things unexplained with abrupt endings?! Unfortunately this isn't even the worst thing about Midsommar. I was really excited to see this movie and it was absolutely horrible.
The main character is the worst character I have ever seen. It wasn't the actress's fault either. 80% of her lines are howling and crying. They make her seem terrible to be around and no one liked her, not even her boyfriend. Her whole family dies at the beginning, but that is never explained. I kept thinking they would tie it back but they didn't.
For the next 2 1/2 hours we slowly move up to nothing. They show a disabled person here and there, and 1 of them writes stuff, but never explain. They show 1 over and over but never incorporate it.

"DinosaurAct86","10","20","35","3 July 2019"," Shock and Awe
","Perhaps one of the best films A24 has ever produced and surely one of the best horror-thrillers ever made, Midsommar is a slow-working poison that eventually takes you whole. There are moments of stomach-churning shock that leave you breathless while at the same time leaving you in absolute awe of the sheen of the film's construction. The cast is perfect, and Ari Aster is destined to make great films, horror or not.<br/><br/>However, this film is not for the impatient or the faint of heart. There is unsettling violence and imagery throughout juxtaposed with stellar beauty. I will be rewatching this as soon as I am able."
"reubenstojan","4","19","33","11 August 2019"," A Strong Concept Let Down By Poor Execution
","What a letdown!!! Not that I had strong expectations for Midsommar, the latest Ari Aster film (Hereditary I still haven't finished but doubt I will), but it generally hooked me in for a time with its strong start and concept of a couple dealing with loss and suffering in a genuinely touching and poignant way.<br/><br/>Florence Pugh totally sells it as the protagonist of a distressed woman on the brink of collapse after a personal tragedy and is by far, the strongest element of the film. Which is a pity when attached to an overly long, pompous and incredibly disappointing rip-off of the English horror film The Wicker Man. Yes, there are films that will inspire directors and new films for decades to come. Yes, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. However, Midsommar just can't seem to escape the familiar confines of it so desperately wanting to be the Wicker Man with its creepy tone, corruptible pagan society and unsettling ending.<br/><br/>Yes, it seems the best form of medicine for dealing with grief and seeing how far a relationship will go after a sudden tragedy is a good old pagan festival. At first an intriguing premise when dealing with the troubled relationship between the main protagonist and her boyfriend (who is certainly not of the same acting chops) then turns into a silly farce where a strange Swedish cult slowly turns sinister and to incredibly ludicrous extremes. The Wicker Man cult may have done terribly wicked things, but at least it felt natural to them why they would harness such evil power. The cult in this film however just seem to go crazy one day just to benefit the plot and not have a very deep or meaningful reason behind their brutality. There is a pagan ritual involving pubic hair for example which never feels justified and is simply done for shock value. By then, the film loses all credibility and its purely the good performance from Florence that keeps it limping forward.<br/><br/>On a technical standpoint, Midsommar fairs decently with a pleasantly creepy feel to the whole proceedings (there's an inspired 360 degree shot as the team head into the festival and one still shot of a few characters outside the sleeping quarters was strangely offputting in the right sense). The soundtrack was nothing to write home about but it worked for the tone.<br/><br/>I suppose my main gripe with this film is literally the letdown the film becomes after such a promising start. What could have been a powerful look into loss and tragedy just falls apart into a unintentionally funny, silly. over-the-top mess as its tries to shock you with its scenarios. Looking forward to seeing more from Florence Pugh. Not so much Ari Aster."
"RforFilm","2","19","33","8 July 2019"," Overlong, pretentious, and unoriginal, Midsommar is a dull and boring followup to Hereditary
","Why is it that we have no problem of watching people on Instagram having the vacation of a lifetime by themselves, and yet get squeamish whenever we think doing the same solo trip. It because a lot of us share the same fear of being alone, especially in an environment that's alien. We've all had the situation in which we're at a party we don't want to be at and you latch on to a friend so that your not sitting alone in a corner. It's a part of the natural boundary we set up whenever the bubble we've chosen to live under becomes challenged.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, a lot of horror stories have tackled the idea of being alone. This could be a slasher killer coming after someone or a group of travelers coming to a castle not knowing a monster lives there. Don't tell me you would be in further agony knowing you were the only one facing this. Today's movie deals with a group of people coming across a cult, which isn't new, but can still be scary if done differently. So let's see if director Ari Aster (Hereditary) can bring something new to the table with Midsommar.<br/><br/>A young woman Dani (played by Florence Pugh), who already has depression and anxiety, is pushed further to the mental brink when her sister commits a murder-suicide on her parents. Her boyfriend Christian (played by Jack Reynor) has been under pressure from his friends to dump her, but he doesn't want to leave her while she's this vulnerable. It's no secret that he is uncomfortable with what's going on, and is unsure about a trip to Europe. To help her get away from her problems, he invites her to come along, much to the chagrin to the rest of the group. The Swedish student inviting them, Pelle (played by Vilhelm Blomgren), has no problem and they all fly over.<br/><br/>The group, Dani, Christian, Mark (played by Will Poulter) and Josh (played by William Jackson Harper) arrive in northern Sweeden to Pelle's commune home which consists of farmers and families who seem nice. Their all getting ready to celebrate a midsommar celebration that only happens every ninety years. From the start, things go bad with a drug trip, along with creepy rituals that the commune say is normal and a part of their traditions. As the ceremonies go further and further, can Dani keep her sanity long enough to make it through?<br/><br/>I was looking forward to Midsommar as I really liked Hereditary. But not only is it bad, it was really bad. This is a prime example of no matter how interesting the visuals and imagery is, everything goes back to story and character. It's overlong. It's pretentious. It's dull. It's a downer in a bad way. It's... ugh, let's go through the problems.<br/><br/>The story is nothing new. Cults are a good source for stories and study on group mentalities. The Wicker Man, Sound of my Voice, Mandy, and The Sacrament are examples on how secret societies can make an idea scary more then the people themselves. Midsommar taught me little about cult other then typical Pagan stuff that's been done already. As I said, much of the attention is put on the rituals and ceremonies, which are shown...so...slowly. This can be done to dip audiences in a pace to throw them off, but the group of people already seem so creepy that any human, especially a college student would have taken off in the other direction.<br/><br/>Even the history around their commune is dull enough that I felt like I was in school.
This might have been forgivable if the characters were at least interesting, but their no more developed then your typical slasher story of the 1980s. At first, it seemed like they were going to play different parts within the rituals and each of their personalities were going to be challenged. But the movie not only pulls a ""bait and switch"", but goes down the path that you could predict before walking in. I'm not sure if the creator thought this would be seen as new, but it's an even bigger insult when it takes forever for anything to happen.<br/><br/>I'm gonna give this one Swedish tapestry out of five. If there's anything I'm scared of, it's the idea of having to sit through Midsommar again. I already saw Hereditary as a polarizing movie, but I can't imagine this appealing anyone other then people who like sick images, sad people put through sad things, and a pace slower then Heaven's Gate. Otherwise, this is going to be a definite skip."

Why did these ""American Guests"" not further question the death by fall of the elders of the community. To me that would be something to discuss and a reason to leave immediately.

","To say that I had huge expectations for this one would be a simply understatement. A surreal indie-horror by renown director and with interesting premise? Sounds like a no-brainer to me... Well, not exactly.
First, this is one hell of a slow movie. And I mean sluggishly so. Sometimes, that kind of approach does work, sometimes it just doesn't. Midsommar is hiding its pretentiousness behind its deliberate pace, it tries desperately to present itself as a slow-burn clever movie, but the problem is - it simply isn't! Yes, it is better than abysmal Wicker Man (Nic Cage version, of course), but only marginally so. You see, the story, the setting, everything...is strangely similar to that pile of crap, but intelligently presented as a ""thinking man's horror"". Nah, fellows, you can't fool me! I grew up watching true legends of the genre, Carpenter, Cronnenberg, Craven, Hooper, Romero, Lynch...so I know a thing or two about edgy and thought-provoking horror film, right?
The story is extremely predictable, the pace isn't deliberate, it is decidedly slow to the point of suicide and the ending...I mean, c'mon...it was telegraphed some two hours and 15 minutes before, right after the initial 15 minutes of this long, pretentious and above all boring movie.
I'm giving it (generous) two stars because 1) it is very difficult to make a movie these days, especially if you're not a studio player; and 2) the actors are very sincere in their performances, they try really hard and it deserves respect.
Anyways, Midsommar is a huge disappointment and I would really like to have my two and a half hours back after this trainwreck...."

"jmholmes-73727","10","35","68","5 July 2019"," Satire of Religion Masking as a Horror Film
","Can a movie be creepy, funny, horrifying and enormously entertaining throughout? This is the cornucopia of delights Ari Aster has produced in his second offering. Two ingredients that seem to have fueled his inspiration are, of course, the original British version of The. Wicker Man (quite an achievement itself) and the scores of Friday The 13th slasher movies where groups of youngsters go on a vacation to be killed off one by one. His movie rises to the level of the first and transcends the level of the second formula. One of the most remarkable things here is the first 20 minutes or so which create a traumatic situation that causes the young couple to appear annoying and psychologically questionable - so that as the story progresses we do not have the compassion for them that would otherwise make their ordeal unbearable to watch.
Important to note is that there is not one scare or ""jump moment"" in the entire movie. This is not a complaint, merely a warning to viewers who might see this as a failure, which, of course, it is not. The horror here, as it turns out, is all-pervasive and throughout all the bright sunny faces and clear landscape of the Swedish countryside. It is in the cult members' drinks, their food, their soil and their beliefs. The horror is in the way they live.
Hopefully Swedish people with a sense of humor will not be offended by the script's locale. It would be interesting to see how the movie ""plays"" in that country's press. One comes away from it eager to avoid the next chance one gets to attend a prayer service or join a group seeking some kind of so-called enlightenment - regardless of the country.
Hat's off to Ari Aster as he boldly goes down his dark, clever path."

","This is not really a horror film with jump scares and shadows and hidden figures, it's a psychological study of a person named Dani (Florence Pugh) who is enormously traumatazied, grieving her loss and is willing to seek refuge to anything possible. Such circumstances occur when Dani travels to Sweden with her emotionally distant boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) and his buddies to engage in a festival called ""Midsommar"". What she will find there is a cult who's members are living as a big, wholesome family with great love and care towards eachother.<br/><br/>Now it appears that director Ari Aster is unable to reach this climax. Dani can never accept the cult's extreme views on life, death and sacrifice. Instead of exploring the cult's beliefs and delving deep into it's core doctrines, what we get here is use of LSD, mushrooms and other hallocinative drugs everytime a charcater needs convincing about something.<br/><br/>Another method that Aster uses to get to his climax is to make Dani's boyfriend and his friends as unlikable, selfish and arrogant as ever possible. These people were competetively nauseating to the point that one couldn't care about their ultimate survival.<br/><br/>I think Midsommar suffers greatly from writing.

The movie it's amazing for the eye, the cinematography, the sets are on point but they all serve a really bland plot with no surpises and slow and boring pacing .

","This movie is super intense! A girl seems to be traumatized by an event that happened to her before, she seems like she feels lonely n depressed, and her relationships are not working well. Everything changes when she got the news of her familys death. She calls her boyfriend and he rushes to the emotional rescue. The girl is now even more shocked and uneven. A friend of his boyfriend suggest that they accompany him on a mid summer trip to Sweden where they'd chill n spend some good time. He also says sorry to the girl and invites her to come with. As soon as they step there they are welcomed with open arms and smiling faces. Their first activity there was a form of meditation where they relax n lay on their backs breathing deeply time n again. This meditation was effective that they started hallucinating things happening to them. After couple of days they start realizing weird thing taking place. Things took an unexpected turn when two of the group of people wearing white tunics sacrifice themselves by jumping from a ver high precipice and the impact was graphic. Things start escalating down from here to become even more scary n violent. Two of the group get killed unexpectedly and weird customs started making things even worse. The girl gets seperated from her boyfriend to participate in a dance the winner of which gets to be a queen. She won, became the queen. Meanwhile the boyfriend is screwing someone in the presence of naked attendees emitting similar moaning sounds to the girl being, you know,.. Long story short, it turns out that the guy that invited them here brought them as part of the 8 sacrifices custom that will be burned to complete te cycle of life. Insanity to the max Reminded me of The leftovers. Really scary the belief systems that determine how some group of people behave. This film shows how powerful beliefs are. Also, some shots in the film are amazing!"

","A group comprised of three friends and one of their girlfriends goes to Sweden to witness and take part in a pagan ritual that is celebrated once every 90 years. As the ritual progresses we see the American visitors coming under duress and having terrible things happen to them. That is the movie in a nutshell. I watched this for a couple of reasons. I love Florence Pugh. I think she is as talented an actor as she is beautiful. I had also heard some very good things about the movie. This has been marketed as a horror movie, and my friends, this it is not. I would say that there are some tense moments that would make this a thriller/drama. There is little here in the way of suspense as you can pretty much forecast the fate of the outsiders. I feel that they were going for a better, updated version of the wicker man and they did accomplish both, but with less drama. This is still a good movie with some interesting story points. I would probably not watch it again and would definitely not call it a horror movie. My apologies to Ash from Whatculture, as I know she had included this in some of her horror movie lists."

I left with about 45 minutes left and it was not getting better. Your just sitting there watching other people do shrooms and along the way their friends keep coming up missing. (They were killed by the cult members). At no point do the 2 main characters ever get the itch to leave the grounds as their friends just stop showing up at the dinner table where everyone is sitting in a blank stare high on drugs.
If you were to take every element from movies and rate them separately, ex: acting, storyline, cinematography, etc. the only thing that scores above 2 points is the acting for the main characters. The rest is several ideas for a horror movie tossed in a bowl with an LSD inspired adventure."

","Be prepared for graphic, disgusting, violent depictions. The orgy, ritualistic sex scene is disgusting and disturbing as well. There are many times when you avert your eyes from the screen. One can overlook such depravity (think Tarantino, Scorsese) if there is a substantial story justifying the violence. While Midsommar does have a story it is told in a prolonged laborious fashion. One could easily edit an hour-plus from this movie and not miss a thing. The dialogue is lacking and the acting leaves much to be desired.

Of course he did not forget to fit in some midsommar cliches such as pagan rituals, nudity and a sacrifice. Gore culmination fails to terrify - by that moment everybody already forgot about the third line characters who simply left the scene in the first hour of the film.

Their friend Pelle has friends there that are also taking place in this special tradition that only happens every nine years so everybody is excited to go. Dani has recently lost her parents and sister in a family tragedy so this will be a nice escape for her.<br/><br/>Everything seems wonderful when they get there, everybody lives in green grassy mountains and fields and do nothing but sing and bake little pies and make tea. Everybody that lives in this odd community looks like something is just a little off. All of the people they meet seem to have nothing going on aside from singing and participating in rituals. They make the Manson family look like The Waltons.<br/><br/>In one VERY graphic scene we see how these people do away with the elderly. Instead of sending them off to die slowly in nursing homes they are taken to a very high mountain where they just jump to their deaths. Believe me if blood turns you off this is not the movie for you. This is an extremely disturbing sequence and director Ari Aster really lets you see more than you might want to.<br/><br/>What is particularly odd is that really only two minor characters complain about that death scene and they want to leave. Dani is played by Florence Pugh and she does exactly what she do with this part. She is extremely believable. The problem with the movie is everybody is just way too creepy and when people start dying and things just get weirder I just kind of fast forwarded the last 20 minutes or so. There is just a point where the movie gets too weird and quite frankly RIDICULOUS. Check it out but beware, it's oddly disturbing and not in a fun Texas Chainsaw kind of way."

","We have seen this film before in the form of The Wicker Man 1973. That film was unique, informative and shared a story of depravity in the name of paganism. It's was a shocking film because it built up a certain momentum and although characters where clearly disturbed, we as an audience still felt empathy and tried to embrace their unorthodox approach to life. The final act of The Wicker Man is shocking and the last few scenes can really stir up some serious nausea. Midsommar tries to replicate that feeling of utter disarray but falls flat and becomes predictable. Character development could have been used more. I did enjoy one or two major scenes and I thought they really got the claustrophobic intensity down to a tee. Some scenes tried to pull off the shock factor but anyone watching will probably just think to laugh to throw off their awkwardness or people may just think it's just a tad bit silly over all. It doesn't really come across horrific as I'm guessing it intended. The main actress is good, you can really see how immerse she becomes within the role of a foreigner trapped in a inescapable world."

"jctundis","9","8","12","5 July 2019"," Another masterpiece for Ari Aster
","Director Ari Aster said this was a film about dependency which he wrote during a breakup
... and it shows. But it's so much more.<br/><br/>A commentary on religion, friendship, depression, identity -- all inside an extremely unsettling Swedish folklore, sex cult, horror story. And it's funny, too! Yes, all these ideas exist simultaneously in a brilliant and methodically paced film that frolics in the realm between all things Kubrick and the Wicker Man.<br/><br/>There are layers upon layers, clues given, and a deliberately hypnotic and hallucinigenic sensibility that lolls the senses so that the more graphic scenes of graphic horror hit with jarring impact. Moreso, to me, than in Aster's previous film Heritary (the best film of 2018). Not for fans of quick cut commercial fare, the timid or the squeamish, Midsommar is a beautiful, horrifying meta-gestalt that I look forward to viewing again."
"david_rudy_lee","10","8","12","4 July 2019"," Disturbing Tale of Loss and Relationships
","This was definitely a film that I've been extremely interested in seeing the moment that I heard about it. Writer/director Ari Aster's film Hereditary was my favorite film from last year and I was intrigued to see how he would follow that film up. I caught parts of a couple of the trailers, but I tend to avoid them for the most part. The synopsis for this film is a couple travels to Sweden to visit a rural hometown's fabled mid-summer festival. What begins as an idyllic retreat quickly devolves into an increasingly violent and bizarre competition at the hands of a pagan cult.<br/><br/>We start this out seeing a picture of what I took to be the four seasons. It then shifts to being winter. It goes into a house where the phone is ringing. Dani (Florence Pugh) leaves a message on the answering machine and we see her parents are asleep. We then shift to her and she is freaking out. Her sister is bipolar and she sent a message that freaked Dani out. She is resistant, but finally gives in and calls her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor). He seems a bit aloof about the situation. He does comfort her while still giving tough love.<br/><br/>The film then does well at establishing their relationship. She feels that she is involving him too much and that he's going to leave her. On the other side, Christian seems to want to break up with her for awhile, but he just hasn't. He is out with Josh (William Jackson Harper), Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) and Mark (Will Poulter). Mark is adamant they break up while Josh kind of analyzes him that he takes the safe route and kind of just moves through life without making a decision.<br/><br/>This film then gives us a gut punch that sends Dani into a deep depression. Christian is there to comfort her and it then shifts to spring, a time of renewal. The guys have planned to go to Sweden to visit the midsummer festival that is happening in Ulle's hometown. Dani hears about it at a party and is upset as she didn't know Christian was officially going. His way of avoiding the argument is to invite her and we see that he immediately apologizes a lot to avoid dealing with situations. He doesn't really think she will accept, but that's exactly what she does.<br/><br/>Upon their arrival, everyone seems so nice. They meet Pelle's brother who invited a couple he met in London, Connie (Ellora Torchia) and Simon (Archie Madekwe). The group is offered mushrooms to hallucinate on and Dani at first declines and Christian elects to hold off as well. Mark throws a fit so everyone ends up doing it. The following day, they actually enter the small village.<br/><br/>There are some odd shaped buildings and some interesting murals on the walls. They start to experience the events and it takes a dark turn on the second day. Dani wants to leave, but this group is in for much more than they initially realize.<br/><br/>Now I wanted to go a bit vague here with my recap. Part of this is I don't want to spoil things, but give you my assessment of it and for those of you on the fence about seeing it to try to convince of you why I liked or disliked this film. With that bit of a disclaimer out the way, I have to say that Aster is great at creating atmosphere. I think what actually works really well here is that I've been in a relationship like this before, where we are staying together, but we don't really know why. A podcast I listen to said this and it hit home as I saw this playing out. Neither person really wants to leave, but they also know that it isn't working.<br/><br/>I have to also say, Aster is great at giving you the gut punch to close out his first act. If you've seen Hereditary, then you know what I mean. This could be a mild spoiler you could say, but the event that happens doesn't have a major impact on the story itself. It is more the effects of this have on Dani and in turn her relationship with Christian. I feel like it sets the tone and things just get progressively worse from there for her. It is interesting though, because this event happens before she gets to the village.<br/><br/>Something else I got from a podcast about this film is that it takes place in the daylight for a majority. This makes the creepy things that happen even worse, because we lose that feeling of being safe. Horror fans know that they mostly take place at night to hide what can scare you until it is needed. This film is taking place where there is very little darkness at night and the sun is out the majority of the day. We can see everything and it is happening when we think that things are safe.<br/><br/>There is definitely a surreal feel to the film as there is a bit of drug use. It is actually more subtle, but a lot of the drinks given out have something in them that have hallucinatory properties. I found that interesting as it makes what is happening even that more unreal, but we know that it really is. Having the character's question their sanity is interesting.<br/><br/>The last aspect of the story I want to cover before moving on is I love the murals in this film. It is an old technique to foreshadow what is going to happen, but they're out of context. Every time one happened it was like another revelation. I feel this is good storytelling and you know me, that's what I'm a fan of. I also love that Josh is out to write his thesis on the pagan festivals from different places in Europe, so he has a reason to investigate. There is an interesting turn as well that Christian decides to finally write his while stepping on his friend's toes. The idea that his name is one of the more popular religions in the world and coming to this festival isn't a coincidence either. The cult aspect of the film is definitely one of my favorite parts as well, because that's really what this village is.<br/><br/>This brings me to the pacing of the film. I'm going to warn you, this film is long and it is a slow-burn. If you aren't into those, you probably won't like this film. I feel that the atmosphere and trying to figure out what was happening is what kept me engaged. The film did something that I really enjoy is learning more about what is going on here. I came in making predictions of things and that makes me enjoy Josh even more that he is studying this academically, because I feel like that would be more. The ending wasn't expected and to be honest, I really dug where they took this. With everything that happens in the film, I think that it is kind of a vindication.<br/><br/>Speaking of what happens in the film, I want to move to the acting next. I will admit I'm torn on how I feel about Pugh. I feel horrible for what she went through, but I can also see one of my exes in her, so that makes me dislike her a bit. She's in a bad relationship and needs to move on. I do find her attractive though and as she participants in this festival, I can see her healing a bit as well. Reynor is such a jerk in this film, but he is also kind of a rock for Dani. He does a few things that are pretty shady as well. I thought his portrayal of Christian was good though. Harper was one that I was a big fan of, as I feel like he'd be me. Blomgren was really solid in his role and I thought Poulter was hilarious. The rest of the cast definitely rounded out the film for what was needed.<br/><br/>To the effects of the film, they were amazing. They were pretty subtle in the amount used, but they weren't in how brutal they are. The ones done practically had me cringing and I loved it. There is some CGI in there as well and to be honest, I thought it was a good use. There are just times to show that characters are tripping. There is also some CGI fire that actually looked really good to me. The film is shot beautifully as well as it is so bright and the colors are vibrant.<br/><br/>The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. There is a lot of ambient noise and music in the film. The songs are definitely cult-like and really make it eerie with what is happening in the film. They also do a lot of mimicking of other people which I did think was interesting as well. I do think this really helped to enhance the overall feel of the film and really make it creepier.<br/><br/>Now with that said this film I really liked when I felt the theater. I went to a late showing and then went to bed. The more that I've been sitting and thinking about the film, the more that I realize I really liked it. I do think this is a step down from Hereditary, but I don't mean that as a slight in the least bit. I love the idea of the cult in this film and what happens when these Americans go there. This is kind of a break-up film as we have two characters that shouldn't be together and are just there for the convenience. The deeper story to film is great. I thought the acting brings this to life and even though it is a slow-burn, I think that is builds tension. There aren't a lot of effects, but what we get is really good. The score of the film definitely enhances the scenes as well. I found this to be a really good film and I think that with another watch or two, this could move up potentially as well now that I know what to look for."

","'Midsommar' starts out fairly well with an undeniably disturbing scene that acts as an interesting setup for both the characters and what would seem to be the underlying theme of the piece. Unfortunately, it steeply goes downhill once the characters arrive at the festival. Quite frankly, it soon becomes a bore; it's not scary, thrilling, tense, or even dramatic, and any semblance of theme or character is thrown out of the window. The complete lack of any dread, tension, or atmosphere leads you to wonder what the whole point of it is. It doesn't even feel like it's trying to be scary or unnerving at all, aside from the few moments of overt gore that are shown in great detail. This was clearly only done in a desperate attempt to shock the audience, which is kind of a cheap move. Aster even seems to think that foreign customs are enough to unnerve them. The whole piece really tries to evoke a fear of 'the other', which is really quite disrespectful. For example, there are several very long scenes showing the cult do traditional dances and chants, even simply eating meals in the way that they do. They aren't doing anything at all weird or scary here, yet it seems Aster just included them to build a sense of dread. He even includes a disabled character that has absolutely no purpose within the narrative; he only exists as an attempt to 'frighten' the audience. Again, this isn't scary, it's just disrespectful. Another issue is that the characters generally don't feel threatened or in danger at any point, which is really detrimental to the film. If they're not scared, why should we be? Of course, we don't really care about them anyway. In the end, 'Midsommar' is just an extremely overlong collection of uninteresting scenes about uninteresting characters, that has zero atmosphere, dread, or tension. It's not scary, which wouldn't even be so much of a problem if it had an engaging story and good characters, and you leave feeling absolutely nothing, wondering what the whole point of it is. I must say that it is extremely well made, with some interesting shots, great production design and fantastic performances, but when the story is this bad that doesn't really account for anything. It's a real shame, too, as this should be the cure to modern 'jump scare central' horror flicks that flood the screens every month. Aster clearly has the talent behind the camera to craft something unique in the genre, but here he's completely wasted that on an absolutely terrible story with no scares at all. It's just a waste of time really. 4/10"

","Not really a horror film, more a disturbing, psychological insight into grief. Midsommar is the first pagan break-up movie, which has a major nod to The Wicker Man.<br/><br/>This film has brutal violence, the deaths are shocking and gruesome. And the orgies are a little awkward. But it isn't a horror film. This is about what happens when you drop a fragile relationship into the most extreme of circumstances.<br/><br/>Florence Pugh is fantastic - fact. She is always fantastic - fact. One memorable scene where she collapses on to the floor under the weight of her own anguish, wailing like an animal. But Reynor is also decent, reacting to everything like a deer in headlights. His coping mechanism is to straight out refuse to process anything that's happening to him.<br/><br/>The film, which stretches to nearly three hours, is in no rush to reach its horrifying conclusion. It never dragged and you feel like one of the characters, uncertain about the impending situation. This is strange and distressing stuff, punishing at times. But a film filled with ideas, images, and feelings that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled."

"EmbraceTheGeek","8","9","14","8 July 2019"," Beautiful Madness
","Unlike any horror film you've seen in recent years, Midsommar is beautiful, disturbing, and uncomfortable throughout. As we accompany our protagonists on their journey to the countryside of Sweden, the peaceful and serene setting the film establishes is slowly corrupted. Piece by piece the angelic facade the film creates slowly deteriorates. As an audience we feel this unnerving tension develop through the minor changes in the behavior of the Swedish hosts. It creates a world which seems almost like a dream, but is grounded by the relatability of the protagonists and the empathy we as an audience seek to feel. With its strange rituals and nonsensical customs, Midsommar truly is an experience which is best explained only through watching the film. Midsommar doesn't try to scare you, but rather leave you unsettled with its countless memorable shots that will stay with you once you leave the theater. So rather than continue to explain, do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful cultish nightmare<br/><br/>If you enjoy arthouse films, this is a horror movie you won't want to skip."
"jabox-89571","8","9","14","5 July 2019"," Hereditary's great follow up
","After Ari Asters debut film ""Hereditary"", I had that itching feeling some have when I first saw it. I wondered if, like many other directors, his first film was just going to be a fluke. Yes while the directing was amazing, the acting was phenomenal and some may argue if there's enough talent put out it's unjust to assume the next one won't be amazing. But I had my fair share of meeting flukes too (cough cough Nightcrawler then Roman J. Israel, Esq.) and know that too familiar emotion of disappointment . So I went in with normal-to-high expectations, re-watched Hereditary in preparation and went with my brother... And here I am and Midsommar proves that he's a capable promising director and should be looked out for whenever he makes a new film.<br/><br/>Now this movie is obviously similar to hereditary but I wouldn't say it's the same as hereditary. It's almost like a different take on it. Both are about grief and family but both say something different. Hereditary talks about mental illness, family dynamics, and coping. Meanwhile Midsommar talks about toxic relationships, culture, friends and relying on people. Like Hereditary though both have amazing performances. Florence Pugh at least deserves an oscar nomination if not because they didn't give one to Toni Collete last year. She definitely is in her own when it comes to this movie. Not only portraying someone with extreme anxiety very accurately but like Collete shows subtlety where it's needed.
When it comes to the horror aspects that are the tone for both films, they contrast here and there. Hereditary is shot in a dark house to make you feel like someone's watching you in the dark (the parts where you have to almost squint to see what's in the dark not only puts you in the characters shoes but is also unnerving not knowing right away what the danger is). Midsommar has this bright white color palette the whole movie, confusing the watcher of what the time is or how much time has passed (which is brilliant considering the characters in the movie felt the EXACT same way). At points some of the scenes even feel euphoric and striking. Again similar to Hereditary, the way it's shot has a lot of purpose to it.<br/><br/>Just like Hereditary it's well thought out and deserves extra watches for things we missed and things that add extra weight to scenes once you know what happens. Now having time to think a lot about this movie, I saw some female empowerment things there but I need to watch a second time to make sure.<br/><br/>Now comes to the question on whether it's better than hereditary or not. The people I've seen online review this are mixed. My brother for example liked it even more. But where my gripes come in that keep it from a perfect movie or even being better than hereditary (which I think despite being fantastic, for me hereditary wins there) are that it's too slow at parts. Mind you everything they show is essential but they could have gotten there a lot faster, which by the way I think Hereditary did. It's ending too is something that'll make you finally decide whether the movie is fantastic or not liking it. What I think this film did better was expand on the other characters in the film (Hereditary's dad is someone almost no one goes bananas over performance wise.), the horror in general I thought was more disturbing, and being a more complex film (in a good way). There are a small things I could nitpick but I'm going to keep that to myself.

"cristianocoppola","10","13","22","27 September 2019"," Absolute TERRIFYING MASTERPIECE
","SPOILERS AHEAD! DO NOT READ THIS BEFORE YOU WATCH THE MOVIE.<br/><br/>I understand why most people do not like this movie, they expect a cheap scare from a maimed zombie leaping at one of the protagonists et simile... boring and seen a million times.<br/><br/>This movie is exceptionally disturbing, terrifying and horrifying in a way that does not leave you alone even after a long time you watched it, and not in the way that body horror does. The implication that all those people live their entire existence on a completely different set of values: life, death, deity, godlessness, fertility, relationships, and all the values we are brought up with are meaningless and even sinful.
I have never seen such a depiction of a complete and utterly different human society which lives on a completely different level very distant from what is accepted as ""right"" and ""wrong"" in western society. It is perspective altering, it is a profound reflection on our own society and set of values, a challenge to our intellect about what is actually benign and malign in our society.<br/><br/>I think for the reasons above alone this script is an utter masterpiece, on top of that the visuals of the movie and the acting are absolutely flawless in delivering an absolute terrifying feeling of uneasiness, a crawling sensation that pushes your reason and sanity to dangerous levels instability .
One example are the pauses, the movie gives the audience time to ponder, to think about what just happened, to take it all in, to LIVE the moment in all its psychologically disturbed glory. As said, it stays with you, it changes you, it makes you WANT to go back there in those fields to feel like that once more, to feel the freedom of reason. To feel the ""normality"" and ""simplicity"" of easing the pain of your suicidal elders with a gigantic hammer.<br/><br/>The ending offers the same beautiful mind violence of the rest of the movie... in a single instant: the temple is ablaze and Dani watches it crashing down, beyond the trauma, beyond madness, beyond any shred of sanity, she finally embraces what has happened to her and joins in with her new family... her smile and crazed eyes are probably the most haunting image of the entire movie, this was exceptionally acted by Florence Pugh, the crowning of an incredible performance in this movie.<br/><br/>I feel still disturbed and amazed by watching this, I think I will never be able to watch it again, I am afraid I might see even deeper and delve even more into the madness and world altering views of the authors, and this would not be good for my own sanity.<br/><br/>I would recommend anyone who wants to challenge their mind to watch this with an extremely open mind and dig deep into every detail and nuance of this utterly dangerous and shocking experience, this is what art should be, something that enriches one's life."

","I had high hopes for this after being absolutely terrified by Hereditary. The beginning was the best part. The way the characters pretend to get along was perfect; it was uncomfortable in a good way. When they actually got to the festival is where it fell off. The ambiguity left a very thin plot, and the unsettling images were there to just be unsettling and didn't add to the story. That being sad the visuals were absolutely gorgeous. I've never seen anything like it. The bright colors, the cinematography, and the set design was phenomenal."
"jadepietro","4","13","22","10 July 2019"," No Swedish Delight
","GRADE: C-<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: Artfully made but absurd in its narrative, this psychological thriller about pagan rituals and bad romance wears one out. The Swedes should sue.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Ari Aster's psychological horror thriller, Midsommar, is this talented director's sophomore film, his second full-length feature, but this time, he allows his excesses to get the better of him. The director in him is still very astute and resourceful, piling on impressive surreal images and a purposeful sense of dread. However, the writer in him is in need of major guidance. His film is all set-up and no pay-off.<br/><br/>It's deja vu, horror redux and repackaged. The director's screenplay rips off other movies from the horror genre and ends up disappointing in comparison. His previous film, Hereditary, had a similar effect, but that film was at least original and compelling. This one, relies too heavily on obvious troves from Hostel (students being maimed and tortured on a student trip), The Stepford Wives (a community that is not what it appears to be), The Village and Get Out (a community of followers with a hidden agenda), Rosemary's Baby (a coven of evil), Suspiria (another coven of evil with supernatural forces), and especially The Wicker Man (yet another coven of evil with supernatural forces and pagan rituals). Add to this rehash, lots of blood and gore and it makes for a rather unpleasant, if tension-filled, moviegoing experience.<br/><br/>Not that all films need to be strictly entertaining and upbeat, but Mr. Asher's obsesses with slasher elements and shock value to make his point about the hazards of sustaining a dysfunctional relationship. His story involves a young couple named Christian (a less-than-subtle name) and Dani. a woman with some bouts of deep mental anguish), who are trying to salvage their romance...at least Dani is. Christian is ready to call it quits and go off on a European vacation with his buds, Mark and Josh, to a idyllic commune with their Swedish friend Pelle to attend a 90 year midsummer celebration. Christian mistakingly invites his soon-to-be ex to join them. Beware a woman scorned!<br/><br/>This revenge fantasy clocks in at nearly two and a half hours and Mr. Aster takes his time to establish his stock characters and soak up the atmosphere. (A pre-credit prologue gives a backstory to one of the central characters, but it really is not all that necessary to the film's plot.) While suspense is a mainstay, the script is in dire need of rewrites, some judicious editing, and, most importantly, clarity. One wonders why these lambs to the slaughter are so dense that they are incapable of catching any clues to their dangerous journey from the outset. (Just looking at the artwork on the walls is more than a hint at the danger than is their destiny.) Their non-plussed reactions after a particularly grisly ritual makes no sense at all. (All book sense and no common sense, as my father would have called it.) Sex, youthful folly, and hallucinatory drugs can only justify so much for the lack of logic and the willingness to stay there.<br/><br/>What the film has at its core is a strong performance by Florence Pugh as Dani. (The director was lucky to have that lightning strike twice, as his previous film debut had a riveting lead performance by Toni Collette as well.) Ms. Puhl takes on this emotional role with a self-assured presence. She shows her characters inherent flaws, vulnerability, and her unhinged nature. Jack Reynor as her handsome boyfriend is an interesting foil and depicts a self-centered millennial quite accurately. As his friends, William Jackson Harper, Vihelm Blomgren, and Will Poulter make the most of their underwritten roles of college intellectual. laid-back foreign graduate student, and sex-driven jock, disrespectfully.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is a stunner. Pawel Pogorzelski's photography heightens the eerie uncertainty as he contrasts the brightly-lit countryside with the darker goings-on. (Loved the 360 degree angled road trip, aerial shots, and the fluidity and multiple movements of flora during the drug-induced sessions.) Along with Andrea Flesch's peasant tribal costumes with their intricate embroidery and Bobby Krlic's electronic folk-tinged atonal musical score, the look of the film resembles a pretty utopia that goes askew rather quickly.<br/><br/>Mr. Aster's vision of a bizarre world keeps one's attention fixed at the atmospheric details and foregone omens, but his script that loses its way. The story becomes progressively absurd as more of the mystery is slowly revealed and the plot just leads to a very unsatisfying conclusion which caused more titters and groans than real fear and genuine scares from my movie audience.<br/><br/>Despite all of the artistry involved, Midsommar is half baked horror. Mr. Aster's film starts off very effectively as it follows the recipe for suspense but the far-fetched story has too many overripe moments and wallows in its own pretentiousness. It's well made schlock, served piping hot. Just not to my taste."

","I have NO IDEA how there are positive reviews (actually I do. They absolutely must have gotten paid or belong to the production, advertisement of this movie) on here but I have decided to neutralize those with my unpleasant opinion of this MidSlumber drivel. If you have problems sleeping, go see this film. I did give it a generous 4 out of 10 (D) solely due to the concept, idea. I was intrigued by the preview but the execution was disastrous!<br/><br/>Midsommer was one of the most disappointing films I've ever seen in my 39 years on this planet. This means a lot because I am a huge movie buff that enjoys all types of genres especially horror. Expecting to see something somewhat close to the brilliance of Hereditary; I received a painful nightmare of a movie that lasted two hours and twenty minutes! There was no solid pacing. It dragged on and on only for it to slow down even more.<br/><br/>I kept expecting the movie to pick up and piece everything together but it never did. I'm not sure why there was a need to get the main female (Dani) character's family killed (her sister killed herself and the parents with carbon monoxide). It added nothing to the story aside from additional run time that was not necessary. They also introduce a storyline where her and the boyfriend (Christian) are going through a tumultuous relationship. He's trying to find a way to break up with her but the deaths of her family is not helping the situation. He books a trip with his buddies without telling her only for her to find out last second and tag along for the ride. One of Christian's bros that belongs to the cult is trying to get with Dani behind his back. He draws her pictures on her birthday and hints that she is not being appreciated. Why was any of this necessary if it never translated into anything further down? The movie could have been cut short 30-40 minutes, easily.<br/><br/>We get it. They decided to take a road trip to Sweden and explore this weird cultural awakening while doped up on shrooms only to realize it's this demonic cult practicing incest, sacrificing humans while staring into the sun that never comes down. Was it really necessary for it to be so long when nothing is happening? I would think that seeing two old people randomly jumping to their deaths off a cliff would be a clear cut sign to get out of dodge but apparently it wasn't enough for the group of friends. I guess eating pubes found in their ""chicken pot pies"" was a common misunderstanding as well. It was a long, dragging period of awkwardness only for it to get more weirder.<br/><br/>Numerous friends of theirs and a couple have mysteriously disappeared yet they're still participating in their festivities. Why is there not a stronger reaction or suspicion to these incidents? It makes you not want to root for or relate to the main characters. The black guy? Gone. The guy that pissed on the ancestral tree? Vanishes with a girl. The couple that actually reacted to the suicides and crushing faces? Where'd they go? Dani drinks an odd looking concoction that looks like diarrhea mixed with water despite clearly seeing something's not right. The drink is spiked and has Dani dancing in a competition for becoming the May Queen. Of course, she wins and is selected to be their representative?<br/><br/>While that is happening, Christian goes into a wooden shack to find a bunch of naked women from the cult waiting for him. One in specific is going to be divirginized in a leafy platter so that she can get impregnated with his seed. Why him? Not sure. The other women are gathered around cheering him on with cringy chants to make sure he performs successfully. He looks uncomfortable but is still able to finish despite an old lady assisting with the thrusting from behind. This brought several laughs throughout the theatre. I thought it was a comedy for a second. Dani catches the spectacle (women's intuition I guess or was it the chants?) from a peek through the door lock. She's shattered and bursts into screams/cries. The women mimic her bellows in the most annoying way possible.<br/><br/>Christian seems to have realized what he's done and bursts out of there butt naked. He finds the bodies of his friends and the missing couple with their intestines torn apart. One of the cult members blows 'fairy dust' into his face as it paralyzes him and enables him from speaking. The final sacrifice is about to take place. A total of nine bodies (a combination that is not explained) have been gathered. Dani is dressed up as a peacock of flowers but she is clearly under the influence of whatever substance that she drank. She has to pick the final person they will sacrifice and she picks Christian. They dress him up in a gutted, bear costume (why? No idea) and sit him up in the middle of the shack with the other taxidermy bodies with branches and stuff. He is burned alive along with a few other cult members that volunteered their services to their ritual. The end."

","Midsommar is a 2019 horror film directed by Ari Aster (Hereditary) and stars Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor as a dysfunctional couple who travel to Sweden to visit the Midsommar festival. This festival, located in a quaint Swedish village quickly turns into an unsettling and violent holiday, hosted by a pagan cult.<br/><br/>It's very hard to achieve a perfect 10/10 score from me. The film has to be perfect in every aspect, both technically, and story-wise. Midsommar is a perfect film. Every single act, every single scene, every single shot... is perfect. I watched this film for my second time last night, yet this time I watched the director's cut, still perfect. But just what makes this film so good?<br/><br/>The film stays clear of horror cliches. No lazy jump scares and no stupid exposition to keep the plot going, just a genuine film, that is written brilliantly by Ari Aster. The film has clear inspiration from other horror films, which seems to be a common criticism among the audience members, but why should that be a criticism? The film is still original, yes it takes some plot devices from other films, and yes some shots/scenes may be inspired, but why does that matter? Every film has inspirations, every film will have occasions where it may not be original. Besides the point, Midsommar takes these inspirations and just improves on them.<br/><br/>Florence Pugh's performance is the best of this year. No argument. She is stunning. One of the best modern actresses today. She is outstanding in what may be the greatest horror film performance of all time. The rest of the class is just phenomenal. Will Poulter manages to bring humour into such a horrific, eerie story, and Jack Reynor really makes his and Florence Pugh's character's relationship so alive.<br/><br/>The film's cinematography was also, the best of this year. So gorgeous, and how almost this whole film is shot in natural light, and during day time, is genius. The film leaves me in dismay and shock, despite it being a horror film, shot in the daytime. I loved the use of natural light, and the cinematography again is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Each shot gives me a sense of discomfort and manages to unsettle me. So damn creative as well. Goddamnit just thinking about the cinematography makes me want to cry of happiness.<br/><br/>The score is the best of this year easily. Bobby Krlic creates a score that incorporates elements of Swedish folk music that proves to be horrifically hopeless. The score somehow stands out to the already unbelievable film. Take a listen to the score. Please. The score is so soothing, so delightful, yet behind such a disgustingly gory and disturbing film.<br/><br/>The film's story is fantastic. A great narrative, with deeper meaning. I loved watching this film a second time. I could interpret the film any way I wanted to. The movie is a slow burn, much like Ari Aster's previous work Hereditary (2018). I slowly watched everything go to crap, and I loved it. The film is a perfect cult movie. Watch it. Now."

","Florence Pugh is tremendous from the very start, with that extraordinary first scene where she conveys so many emotions in her face while on the phone. It's a terrific performance and I can't wait to see more from her.<br/><br/>I love how well Ari Aster writes/directs scenes with deep grief and emotions in both this film and Hereditary. The actors have to deliver of course and they do, but there is such honesty in the material and the amount of time he spends on it that it adds considerable depth to the horror that follows.<br/><br/>This is also quite simply a gorgeous film. The colors, camera angles, ceremonies, nature scenery, those slightly off-kilter roofs on the buildings ... it's all so visually stunning. The soundtrack definitely keeps up with it too.<br/><br/>It may go on a teeny bit too long especially since we see the gist of what's coming, but on the other hand, it allows for this culture to be rendered so completely in every disturbing little way, and I was engaged to the end.<br/><br/>Quote:

"aram81","10","10","16","28 January 2020"," Unlike any horror movie you have ever seen
","Strange, haunting, beautiful and unlike anything you have seen before. Midsommar does have some very disturbing moments but it is neither an extremely violent movie or an overtly scary one. The film has a subtle and unnerving intensity. Ari Aster does a great job of slowly cranking up the tension and weirdness level all the way to a shocking, disturbing and on some level, hopeful climax. And all of it is done under bright daylight, with strikingly colorful images and beautiful scenery. On the surface, Midsommar is a film about cults and folktales. But if you dig under the surface, this is really a film about loss, grief, family, belonging and caring. Dani, played with heartbreaking vulnerability by the young and talented Florence Pugh, suffers a terrible tragedy in the beginning of the film. She looks for emotional support from her somewhat aloof and uncaring boyfriend, played by Jack Reynor. Their unraveling relationship and her need for companionship and support is the crux of the story. And that is why the unforgettable ending is so bittersweet."

","Midsommar is beautiful.<br/><br/>It is a gruesome, gritty, visceral tale of a ill-fated Swedish getaway and delivers gore aplenty but unfortunately it doesn't quite deliver fear.<br/><br/>I felt uneasy at times, and I felt tense at times, but at no time during the 150 min run time did I feel afraid. The scenes of horror are disgusting rather than fear-inducing which is by no means a bad thing, but the moments that are supposed to be scary with no gore seem to miss their mark.
I enjoyed the uneasy feel that grows at the start but it seems to falter towards the middle, and while the end tried to deliver the explosive finale like that in 'Hereditary' or 'The Wicker Man', there are sequences in the middle that really need you to stick with it and risk losing a lot of people due to the pacing.<br/><br/>Ari Aster tells a chilling tale of dealing with loss, breakup and realising the damage of a toxic relationship. The themes of release and letting go that Dani is forced to accept are brutal and it drugs the audience into a psychedelic trance alongside the cast.<br/><br/>All that said, what it does, it does beautifully, with some astounding performances and some truly disgusting moments that make even the most hard stomached cinema-goer experience a slight twinge. I enjoyed watching Midsommar, and even with the feeling that it left the possibility of an even scarier movie out in the field, you're not in any way dissatisfied with the end product.<br/><br/>Midsommar needs to be experienced.<br/><br/>Enjoy the festivities."

.
.<br/><br/>Hereditary was a hands down ultimate horror hit, however upon seeing Midsommar, I feel that Hereditary has some competition. A lot have speculated that this may be a rehash of The Wicker Man, but that's where I draw the line. Midsommar is a huge slow burning nightmare that slowly evolves into a very real and genuinely terrifying experience that will only freeze you and force your eyes to stay still, pondering at the screen. Albeit, this movie was a bit more straightforward than Hereditary was, but don't let it distract you from the important Easter eggs and sneaky foreshadowing that Aster is known for. The simplest things such as the cinematography is a huge plus for those that may find this movie ""boring"" or ""slow"", I mean there's literally a shot of a rock that is just beautiful to look at. Another thing to love is the detail put into everything, ranging from the scenery, the clothing to the reactions and the, yes you read correctly, the gore! Also, Will Poulter is such a sweetheart of comic relief in the most unnerving of situations. .
.
.<br/><br/>Verdict: It's really difficult to compare Midsommar to Hereditary, being they are two completely different movies, however what comes as an easy choice is saying that Midsommar definitely knocks it out of the park at being one of the greats in horror cinema."

"giodracondrum","9","4","5","7 February 2020"," With disgust and beauty- horror masterpiece
","Hereditary was in my eyes a horror masterpiece- something so deliberately paced with incredible tension and twists that sent your soul to hell... Midsommar somehow recaptures this spirit by masking its disturbing nature in (literal) broad daylight.<br/><br/>If I was to ever give a sermon or master class on how to direct a camera, I would 100% show this film. The best word to describe every technical visual feat is ""clean"". There are so many beautiful shots-- especially in the opening hour or so-- and none feel gratuitous or obsequious in intent. I can imagine a lot was done with drones that wouldn't have been possible even just a few years ago. The editing, camerawork, set design, and lighting all blend together in this masterwork of cinematography and style. A lesson on how to make a movie look absolutely pristine while presenting what you want the audience to feel subtly. There are countless moments where clever camera-based CGI makes the audience feel like they are on a drug-trip with the characters in the film. Even the disgusting moments in this film are shot so cleanly that the visuals and camerawork clash with each other. Just like how Hilsongland's (main location) exterior masks its malicious heart. There are brilliant time transitions where the camera focuses on one thing then seamlessly transitions to a new period through the editing. It's done so well that the pacing never dies down- masterful.<br/><br/>Now on to the next part of technical wizardry. The music by Bobby Krlic is tied so perfectly with each scene as it serves its purpose both diegetically and non-diegetically. Sometimes the music will start diegetically then transfer to the audiences ears or vice-versa. It goes from soothing to horrifying which at times elevates scenes from creepy to terrifying. The string orchestra is used so viciously that it makes your hair raise as if it's calling out to run away from what it's hearing. It's serenity is but a farce. If anything, I felt that the sound design was mostly fine while at other times fantastic. A lot of moments have characters talking at a distance but the sound mix does not reflect that and puts them center channel as if they were talking directly into the camera. This was slightly distracting but felt stylistic, so I give it a pass. One specific detail that can't go unspoken is the runic language used in the film as the village elders explain that they speak and learn new ""sounds"". This is essentially the script's way of making the audio mix play into the emotions of our main characters and the villagers. Unnerving- just hope you never hear anyone scream this much in real life. Otherwise, masterful audio mix; specifically the music mix, what a damn good score. Gonna be hard to listen to it on its own, that's for sure.<br/><br/>Florence Pugh has seemingly broken into the mainstream most especially with this film. Her performance here is incredible. Florence's sadness is so real that it's awkward to watch play out on screen. The way Jack Reynor's character, Christian, subtly abuses his power in the relationship is portrayed perfectly by her constant self-reassurance that she is in the wrong- not him. This is undoubtedly her movie and with good reason as the opening sells you on her motivations/paranoia. Another perfectly acted character was the calculated and curious Josh played by William Jackson Harper. He was one of the secondary characters yet felt necessary as an outsider looking into a world unknown. A big standout was Vilhelm Blomgren as Pelle, the friend who brings them all together and is generally quite a nice individual with a smile that hides more than it reveals. The rest of the main ""outsiders"" cast all felt like redshirts and were just fine but really were so cliche that you know how it ends for them. Jack Reynor plays such a cold-hearted person that I honestly found him to be wooden until I understood his character and realised he was meant to be that way. Overall extremely well performed but the script left some characters in the horror trope dust.<br/><br/>The script is probably the weakest part of the film and not in a bad way. It's written realistically enough but some characters' dialogue is unconvincing to the point of ridicule. Will Poulter plays the idiot character and he is so cheesy. The movie puts smart dialogue in everyone's mouths except for his. It always came across as an older gentleman's perspective on how a horny teenager would talk and it's almost laughable. Luckily the rest of the writing is strong even if some parts are ripped directly out of other horror films. What saves those issues is the pacing. By giving each scene time to breathe, we believe the trope-y things more than we would in a faster paced movie. We believe more in these characters and their situation as opposed to immediately wanting the film to come to its conclusions. In that way the script more than justifies its merits. -- It has come to my attention that some character motivations/stories are more fleshed out in the extended cut. If I ever get a chance to review this version of the screenplay I will.<br/><br/>Between Hereditary and Midsommar, Ari Aster has a few oddities he exploits for shock value. Both movies share excessive head-related gore, cults, mystery, innocence, and nude old cult members. The sinister images in this film feel so real because of the use of high quality practical effects and CGI. VFX have characterized horror for years; Midsommar is a great example of them at their most real.<br/><br/>Midsommar is another hit for Ari Aster and is my favorite horror of 2019- yes, beating out The Lighthouse. I never would have thought Aster would be able to recapture that horrific witchcraft he did with Hereditary again but here he does it in a more relaxed setting. This is a strong recommend to anyone trying to experience quality tension in any medium. Just don't forget to ""breathe"" along the way."
"Stay_away_from_the_Metropol","10","50","107","4 July 2019"," Ari Aster just solidified his place as one of the new masters of horror
","Hereditary was no accident. Ari Aster is a visionary filmmaker and he's just proven that and surpassed himself with Midsommar.<br/><br/>It is the 4th of July today and this movie was released yesterday - this is not only my favorite film of 2019 thus far, but one of the greatest horror films of this CENTURY, at this point.<br/><br/>I grew up on 70's, 80's, and 90's horror. I perceive contemporary horror to be, for the most part, brainless, regurgitated, formulaic garbage. Midsommar is a rare gem for the genre, in this day and age. It journey's far, far out from the played-out possessions in haunted houses that make up 90% of the U.S. genre output. It is a breath of fresh, multi-colored air in a chamber full of suffocating ghosts. Within the first 24 hours of Midsommar's release, I saw a multitude of people post ""I loved it, but...it's not really a horror movie"". After viewing, this made me LOL pretty hard. I can't figure out what people would be perceiving this as if not horror. This is one of the GREATEST horror movies I have ever seen. It is pure and utter horror... it's just...a UNIQUE horror film, something we rarely receive nowadays. This seems like further proof that people have been so conditioned to the brainless formula of contemporary horror that anything that falls outside of it's own cliches is then perceived as ""not belonging in the genre"". That's actually horrific, in itself, if you ask me.<br/><br/>With Hereditary as it's predecessor and a very promising trailer as it's backbone, I was chilled to the core of my soul just 5 minutes into the film. I knew I was in for something very special. Florence Pugh puts in a revolutionary performance and goes on to carry this film 10x better than a grip of A-listers ever would stand a chance of doing. Simply put, the movie delivers from all angles... cinematography, acting, writing, atmosphere, environments, set pieces, wardrobe, pacing, casting, sound design, sound editing, concepts, scares, violence, mystery - it ALL hits right on the money, and it's FULL of surprises. There is not a dull moment on this utterly terrifying ride. The film has no weaknesses.<br/><br/>Though aesthetically there are only a few films that come off as comparable (like The Wicker Man, for example), I perceive this movie as a beautiful monster completely of it's own. There is only one other movie that I found it's eerie tone reminiscent of for moments at a time, and that's Kubrick's EYES WIDE SHUT. In fact, Aster's work as a whole, especially after viewing Midsommar, is now reaching a Kubrickian caliber of craft. It's that immaculate of a creation. I was teary eyed during the finale and it wasn't even a plot-based sadness - I was simply tearing up because I'd just witnessed such a visionary masterpiece, and I was in love with it.<br/><br/>I don't want to say much more, but I will say that Ari Aster is a new savior to the genre, and thus, to film. I imagine I will be seeing this in the theater more than once. I...have to. I can't believe he pulled this off. It's...just...phenomenal. It's legendary. Thank you Ari Aster, and thank you to everyone involved. You came when we needed you most."
"callmetheben","8","16","29","3 July 2019"," Bizarre, but satisfying
","Just got out of the theater after the midnight release of Ari Aster's second feature film, Midsommar. My gut reaction was negative, but by putting together different plot points and comparing the attention to detail that was a highlight of his 2018 film Hereditary, I am more than satisfied with the end result. For example, the painting above Dani's bed features a bear and a young girl with some sort of tiara or crown on her head, foreshadowing the gruesome end for her boyfriend.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a summer horror film, you will be disappointed with Midsommar's lack of true evil horror, but will likely come out of the theater feeling satisfied with the substance of the bizarre and wicked coming full circle to create a narrative which, similar to Hereditary, has a more abstract and impactful meaning than simply shock value horror (yet, this aspect is not at all ignored in the movie). Hereditary and Midsommar share a very exclusive genre which bonds intense thrillers with creepy paganism, yet also touches the familial nerve, and illustrates both healthy and unhealthy ways to process grief and relationships, whether they be familial or not.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was definitely worth the watch for those who are into experimentalist horror films (such as The Wicker Man), but one needs to keep an eye open for important allusions and foreshadowing motifs for over two hours, which can get tiring after a while."

The film is not for the faint of heart as it was seriously one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen. Ari shows pretty much everything on screen. I found the story to be very compelling as it honed in on themes such as grief, and finding support in that grief. The only reason I'm not giving this 10 stars is because I believe too much was explained at times. Instead of leaving the viewer to wonder more about the tradition of the cult, so much was explained it left me needing more to feel satisfied."

"jakobbokman","4","25","49","20 July 2019"," Stupid, insulting - and a bit boring
","The beginning of the film is brilliant. It is believable, gives a relevant introduction of the characters and set their internal relationships. Everything up until and including when the camera rolls 180 degrees (very clever footage) and the four young americans and the single swede travels up side down in the northern parts of Sweden is well done. It is Florence Pugh moments in the movie where she is given the chance to shine. It also gives an opening to how the movie could have ended. The car scene turns into a bad trip on some funghi and maybe - but apparently not since the film makers did not make any more significant hints towards it - it could all be just a nightmare and a purgatory for the female protagonist to get out of her grief and out of her poor relationship to her boyfriend and into a better self esteem. But from the bad trip the movie walks into the hands of the sect and turns in a southernly direction.<br/><br/>As a Swede I can not help feeling insulted by the outright stupid and primitive portrayal of somthing that should resemble swedish (midsummer) traditions. Apparently some research has been made since I can recognize bits and pieces - the Falu red coloured barn, the folklore dresses (but not in any of the correct and traditional variants), the outdoor long table for lunch with snaps, the occasional violin and so on. But most is just outright fabrication and close to a colonial view of some seriously deranged people in some primitive part of the world. But then I realise there are some other people that are even more unhinged and it is the american youngsters that not only are appalingly ignorant despite their higher education in philantropy, but also unable to interpret ceremonial killings (of humans), mystical disappearance of other outsiders to the cult and pure secterism as a warning to be careful and withdraw. But maybe this is what to be seen as normal in a ""horror movie"". Even so, I keep on wishing the ""locals"" would have been Danes, Norwegians or why not North Dakotians.<br/><br/>Before the locals prove themselves to be full blown psycopaths - but extremely well organised and conniving psycopaths since they manage to gather enough externals and manipulate them to get just enough human sacrifice, be helped with the breeding to propagate the tribe and also get a brand new May Queen - there are some sequences where I feel a secondary shame. The movie is non sense and makes no sense. It is just poor and awkward. Then it turns into full crazy and the awkwardness is more bearable and probably intended (at least some of it).<br/><br/>The actors portraying the locals most have wondered what they were supposed to do or how this would come across. Not nicely, anyway. And poor Florence Pugh. She needs to work hard to no avail. I saw her in The little drummer girl, was hugely impressed and noted her for future stardom. But it is not her fault she also becomes awkward at times.<br/><br/>It is almost as the beginning and the rest of the film where done by different teams or directors. And maybe they were. If so I would have guessed the moral was higher when the first part was shot.<br/><br/>Anyway - ""synd på så rara ärter"". (A pity with so nice peas.)"

"MOscarbradley","4","20","38","12 July 2019"," What happened to 80 minute horror movies?
","What is it with horror films these days or should I say, what is with Ari Aster horror films that they must clock in at around two and a half hours. I still remember the time when you could get a perfectly decent fright-fest at about eighty minutes or less but then perhaps Aster has loftier things in mind than just scaring the pants off us. His first feature, ""Hereditary"", had a host of real frighteners coupled with a much deeper tale of grief and how we cope with it and it worked very nicely in both camps thanks largely to a terrific performance from Toni Collette as a grief-stricken mother whose demons are very personal indeed.<br/><br/>His new film. ""Midsommar"" runs for two hours and twenty-seven minutes and in its tale of cults and potential sacrifices it looks like it might go down the same road as its predecessor in both frightening us and making us think, particularly after a beautifully built-up opening involving murder and suicide. However, once Aster whisks us, and his four protagonists, off to Sweden at the invitation of a Swedish friend, we find ourselves in the middle of ""The Wicker Man"" and some very dodgy 'midsommar' festivities. Actually the slow build-up here also works very nicely. Aster takes his time, (well, he does have almost two and a half hours to play around with), and it's clear to anyone who has seen ""The Wicker Man"" or any other horror film, come to think of it, that when something seems too good to be true, it usually is and that all this chanting and mumbo-jumbo can only end badly, which, of course, it does a long time after the movies started.<br/><br/>If I sound flippant it's because I really had high hopes for ""Midsommar"" after the vastly superior ""Hereditary"". Nothing happens in this picture you can't predict a mile off, (even the killer closing shot is fairly obvious when you think of it). Of course, things might have been different had Aster a leading man who could have convinced us he was disorientated, frightened or even interested in what was going on. Instead, we get Jack Reynor, whose performance is surely a shoo-in for next year's Razzie. Reynor started his career with a reasonably interesting performance in ""What Richard Did"" as an Irish schoolboy who accidentally kills a classmate but it's been all down hill from there, culminating in this misplaced, wooden performance.<br/><br/>As his girlfriend, Florence Pugh, (she of ""Lady Macbeth"" fame), does what she can with a one-dimensional role. Indeed, this is not an actor's picture with no-one, including the usually reliable Will Poulter, making much of an impression. It has its moments to be sure, with Aster even managing to inject some grisly humour into the proceedings and perhaps there is a good eighty minute horror movie struggling to get out but by adding an extra hour he kills it. Perhaps the moral of the film is just avoid Sweden in the summer because if the cults don't get you, the tics will."

"QuadeC2010","10","22","43","4 July 2019"," A Bizarre, Disturbing, and Surprisingly Funny Acid Trip through Broad Daylight
","[Caution: extreme spoilers ahead. You've been warned]<br/><br/>It goes without saying that after I had been completely traumatized by the masterpiece that is Hereditary, I have had extremely high hopes for Ari Aster. The 31-year-old filmmaker has the potential to be this generation's Stanley Kubrick, not to mention that he plans to dabble in a lot of different genres in his career.<br/><br/>Ever since this trailer dropped, I have been completely compelled to see this movie, so I bought my ticket as soon as it was available and was on pins and needles to finally see this. The weird Wicker Man-brought to the 21st century had me pumped. And boy was I not let down!<br/><br/>We follow Dani, who is on the rocks with her boyfriend after she goes through a traumatic family tragedy. Her boyfriend is almost done with her co-dependency, but he is forced to stay with her since she just went through a tragedy. He feels disconnected, showing him through shots in mirrors, reflections on tv and in pictures in the beginning, while the rest of the cast feels as if they're in the same room. Speaking of which, the shots with the cast looking intentionally into the camera throughout the film lend to almost some sort of 4th wall break. It makes the viewer feel as though he or she is experiencing the movie with the whole group. Helps keep the atmosphere tense and the overall compelling feeling high.<br/><br/>After Dani guilts her way into going on the trip with her friends, we find that Pele seems quite strange and that he is very excited for her to go on the trip (just something I found to be quite foreshadowing).<br/><br/>Once the group arrive in Sweden, the mood of the film completely changes. The beginning is dark, emotional, sad, and snowy, and when arriving in Sweden, the film turns bright, beautiful, colorful, and almost sending some sense of happiness and cheer, despite knowing something is wrong from the get-go.<br/><br/>The humor starts to set in here, with the cult handing out mushrooms like they're potato chips with lots of interesting and gorgeous ""breathing"" visuals taking quite importance throughout the film. The naivety of the group also lends to this as they blindly follow the cult despite all the red flags given out.<br/><br/>As the intensity of the movie ramps up, the viewer is left to know this film will not end up well. An elderly couple jump to their gruesome deaths from a high cliff, finished off by some of the most horrific gore I've ever seen in cinema. The cult live their lives in seasons the spring being birth through adolescence, summer being adulthood, fall being their adult pilgrimage, and winter being their old age until suicide at age 72.. There are runes and signs everywhere, when examined lead to pure hopelessness for the group. And that sex scene! Oh my!<br/><br/>The beautiful score, the absolutely gorgeous cinematography, the sun-drenched existential dread, and the relatable themes make this one of the more mesmerizing movies I've seen this decade. I felt I was rooting for Dani by the ending because she is so cute and vulnerable and going through a ton of grief and just wants to be accepted. I've tried to spoil as little as possible, but I can not recommend this enough! I had initially thought Hereditary was his crowning achievement, but upon reflection, I think Midsommar shines just as brightly and will be a cult classic in years to come. Besides, the 23-year-old Florence Pugh puts on a performance equally as great as Collette did in Hereditary. Hypnotic, creepy, and smooth, this is a film we'll be talking about for time to come.<br/><br/>One last thought and for those who have seen this: What if Pele killed Dani's family in order to put the whole thing in motion? He knew Christian wouldn't take Dani to Sweden if she wasn't in extreme grief. Just a thought that kinda turned this movie on its head for me."
"dressedkill","1","22","43","3 July 2019"," Yet another pretentious and smug pseudo artsy a24 dull drama sold as a horror film.
","To top it off Ari Aster ripped off a Swedish film in 2003 of the same name and plot. Hereditary was incoherent nonsense and a boring drama. This is somehow even more contrived and moves and operates like an amateur effort with some ridiculous attempts at nuance and undertones that fail Completely. But now all of the hipsters will follow critics blindly and label it as masterful and claim people with an opposing opinion missed the point and are too unintelligent to grasp its ""intricate brilliance"" like they claimed with hereditary. Pure and utter drivel."
"klynnfarris","9","44","95","10 July 2019"," best original horror concept in a long time
","If you're looking for jump scares or gore, this film has little to none of either and may not keep your attention. It is a sort of surreal, art house horror that dives into the psyche and plays with the emotions of the viewers. From the first few minutes to the last i was incredibly uncomfortable but never lost interest in what was coming next. Some parts are slow and some are predictable but neither of those things took away from the film somehow. The parts that were slow were painful in a way that the viewer feels anxious, confused, and fearful for long extended periods of time which make the horrifying things happening to the characters seem all the more real and the parts that you could predict were no less shocking than if you couldn't have seen them coming at all. The imagery and cinematography was beautifully done. Great shots, and seeing floral colors and white dresses juxtaposed with the dark subject matter made me just as uneasy as everything else.<br/><br/>There have been a lot of remakes this year that have been great but this is the first original concept I've seen in a while that I truly thought was brilliant. I left the theatre feeling almost traumatized in a way but haven't stopped thinking about the film since which I'm not sure is what a lot of people are looking for but is how I feel true horror should make you feel."
"ferguson-6","7","12","21","3 July 2019"," a sunny nightmare
","Greetings again from the darkness. Summer movies are traditionally tentpoles and teen flicks ... big budget action movies and those aimed at an audience that are on a 3 month reprieve from school. We are quickly learning that rising star filmmaker Ari Aster cares little for tradition. Well at least he seems to thrive on twisting tradition and spinning off in an unusual direction. His feature film debut was last year's mega-hit HEREDITARY, a horror film which was noted in most every critics association Top 10 list for 2018.<br/><br/>HEREDITARY was filled with darkness and dread, and Mr. Aster's second film begins with a similar setting: it's a dark and cold night as Dani (Florence Pugh, LADY MACBETH) frantically searches for her bi-polar sister through emails and phone calls. During her search, we realize that her relationship with boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor, SING STREET) is a bit strained. The brilliant pre-credit sequence results in a horrific tragedy striking Dani's family. Christian does his best to offer support, but he's a typically weasel of a man who feels more at ease hanging out with his grad school buddies than providing love and compassion to his needy girlfriend ... and he's not man enough to tell her, despite the urging of his friends.<br/><br/>An awkward group conversation leads Dani to accept an invitation to go on the boys' trip to Sweden. The purpose of the trip is twofold: to participate in a 9 day long village festival held every 90 years and for Josh (William Jackson Harper, ""The Good Place"") to work on his thesis. The other guys in the group are Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) whose family in Sweden is hosting the festival, and Mark (Will Poulter, THE REVENANT) who provides much of the comic relief thanks to his overall cluelessness about pretty much everything related to graceful societal interactions.<br/><br/>And with that set-up comes one of the most deranged, unsettling and bizarre movie experiences this year (or most any year) is likely to bring. Try to picture a Folk Horror Comedy Fairy Tale Break-up Pagan Cult film, which at any given time reminds of MOTHER!, THE WICKER MAN, THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE VILLAGE, SUSPIRIA, and a handful of other cinematic oddities we've seen over the years. It is quite likely the sunniest horror film you've ever seen. And that's a literal description ... like the production could have been solar-powered. Most of it is filmed outside during Sweden's Midnight Sun - constant sunshine accompanied by mostly bright white skin and even brighter white cotton costumes (embroidered as if meant for Woodstock). The daylight messes with your senses and expectations. Bad things are supposed to happen in the dark, not in broad daylight enveloped by picturesque wonders of nature. Although the opening is cold, dark and punctuated with tragedy, the rest is so bright, it almost blinds you to the atrocities on screen.<br/><br/>So without giving away anything, here's what we are in for: a welcome to Sweden mushroom trip, a Waco joke, a caged bear, a sacred tree, a Powerball game you hope to lose, and flowers and trees that seem to breathe. We also are reminded not to forget the birthday of our significant other, living to age 72 is not really rewarded in this commune, and no one should ever dance till they drop - even to be named the Queen of May. Of course, as with most horror films, it's easy to sit back as viewers and question the decision-making of the characters, but it's not like they realize they are in a horror film ... at least not until it's too late!<br/><br/>Ms. Pugh (who reminds of another talented young actress, Haley Lu Richardson) is terrific here. Her character experiences shock, personal grief, a strained relationship, hallucinations, and a shot at revenge. The excellent music from Bobby Krlic, better known as The Haxan Cloak, is a mix of compositions and songs that create the mood for each character and scene. I was so shell-shocked at the end, that I'm unable to confirm that the version of ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)"" is that of The Walker Brothers (Scott Walker died earlier this year) or that of another band. Director Aster's second film proves the exaggerated and diverse spectrum of what constitutes a horror film, and cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski's disorienting camera work perfectly complements a rare cinematic blend of frightening and funny. The cheery faces and pastoral beauty very nearly distract us from what might be the ugliest break-up movie ever."

","I heard a lot of things about this movie before I watched it. Had high hopes but what this movie turned out to be is extremely predictable not sure why it gets such high praise. Other than its in sunlight there is nothing unique about it. Also it's an extremely boring horror movie. There is no real psychological drama since the intended victims are too stupid to know what's happening. The foreshadowing is for 5 year olds. Skin the fool, all the May queen stuff, the tapestry etc. The characters are unlikable especially Dani. I was just rooting for her to get killed at one point. But unfortunately the most predictable ending of course occurred. If you didn't see it coming I can't help you."

"jtindahouse","10","10","17","8 October 2019"," A horror masterpiece
","I only finished 'Midsommar' 15 minutes ago and I'm already obsessed with it. What an incredible film. It's 2 and a half hours long and still the ending snuck up on me. I thought to myself it can't be over already. That's how much I enjoyed this movie. I was entranced by it. I was hanging on every line, every action, every facial expression trying to pick up clues and work out where this was going. What a blast this was to watch.<br/><br/>Ari Aster is one of the best filmmakers working at the moment. His films are somehow arty and yet entertaining at the same time. That's not easy to pull off. The creativity he uses in almost every scene of his movies never ceases to blow me away, and I'm not someone who usually notices things like that. He's not afraid to experiment with risky ideas either, and why should he be considering he pulls it off almost every single time. Also the little details that he includes along the way to foreshadow things are incredible. He's possibly the best foreshadower working today.<br/><br/>I almost never rewatch films but I think I will have to check out the director's cut for this one. Considering some of the incredibly gruesome stuff they left in (including one of the toughest scenes I've ever had to watch) I can't even imagine what they cut out. That should be a real treat. Also the entire cast were phenomenal but I have to give special credit to Florence Pugh. She blew me away in every scene she was in. I can't recommend 'Midsommar' highly enough. Please see this film."
"davidjkobb","8","10","17","9 July 2019"," Better than Jordan Peele's Us
","People give Jordan Peele's Us far more credit than its due. Viewers mistakenly believe Us has something to say, but ultimately it hides its lack of substance in opaque imagery the meaning of which Peele is as clueless to as the viewer. But both Peele and viewers like to pretend like the movie has a deeper substance -- they just can't point to examples in the movie...<br/><br/>Midsommar is the antithesis of Us. The film abounds in scenes with deeper meanings and bathes in intelligent themes (and blood). Its tense, but not scary. It's more thriller than horror.<br/><br/>It's not perfect, the characters could be more fleshed out, and some of the decisions they make will leave you wondering if they maybe should have laid off the psychoactive tea. Overall, however, Midsommar is an excellent movie, intelligent, tense, interesting and in a perverse way - a lot of fun."

","The story is relatively simple and it's all stuff we've seen before (to an extent, especially if you're a horror fan), but it's very well crafted and executed, it doesn't really matter that the film wears its inspirations on its sleeve because its done with a respect that you can simply enjoy the trip you're taken on.<br/><br/>It moves at a somewhat slow pace which might be a problem for the goldfish generation, but those who appreciate real suspense and intrigue will no doubt enjoy this captivating approach.<br/><br/>The cinematography is flawless and some of the best I have seen in recent years, that alone makes the film worth watching. It is truly a beautiful looking film and the score compliments the visuals almost perfectly.<br/><br/>It's by no means a perfect film though, there are some tedious moments and the ending for me was way too predictable, I found myself saying what was about to happen in my head before it happened on screen and I was right until the credits rolled. It isn't a particularly bad thing, I was left satisfied but it would have been nice to have been surprised. Others may feel different but that's just my take on it.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for cinema viewing! There were a few gasps from the audience at some of the violence and one scene in particular had everybody in hysterics."

","Midsommar is one of the best drama/ horror movies I've seen in the past years. It's originality is way beyond the average horror flick. The movie gives a look inside Pre Christian Europe on fertility rituals, combined with lots of reminiscences to the Nazi era, where blonde females were sexually heralded to produce lots of children. Obviously based on Arian views on Women, for these Nordic girls innocence is an absolute requirement. Logically the dark side of the focus on fertility is sacrifice.<br/><br/>The acting and art direction is top notch, which is unique for this genre.<br/><br/>I'm kind of shocked by the many bad reviews. I think Americans have no clue as to interpret and determine Midsommar. But for me, as a European man who has studied history, this is fantastic mix about the black pages of our history packed in great fiction."
"kristid-89575","8","5","7","22 February 2020"," I actually quite enjoyed this movie.
","I came into this movie excepting it to be an intense psychological thriller, and not so much a ""horror"" film with camp and gore and scary monsters lurking about. But what it actually turned out to be in my opinion was actually a really good marriage between the two.<br/><br/>I've seen some reviews stating that some of the sences were outright laughable and because of this they gave a negative review. I saw it in a different way. I felt like those parts really reminded me of the campy B rated type horror flick that I personally love, while still maintaining that intense psychological thriller feel to it. I didnt feel like some of the aspects people have an issue with took away from the film. I actually think it added to the film and in effect to the genre of the film itself.<br/><br/>Alot of people also say that the subject matter is not original, to which I agree. But I'm willing to forgive it for that as it's really hard to make a story with subject matter that's never been touched before. Though I will say that the film really did seem to take a bit too much time on scenes you'd expect to happen, and less time with things that may have been more on the original/shocking side. Though the film did have it's fair share of shocking scenes. I felt like the film makers could've spent more time w/ finding new and creative ways to shock the audience and spent a bit less time on the scenes that though they were undoubtedly disturbing, they were in fact what the audience would've expected to happen in a film with such subject matter. Its because of this and the atrocious audio mixing that I deducted a couple stars from my review.<br/><br/>Negative aspects aside, I still thoroughly enjoyed this film for what it was. The beautiful cinematography and transitions they did between some of the scenes along with the helter-skelter placed and uneven buildings throughout the commune that was quite reminiscent of german expression combined with what I thought was a spectacular ending also reminiscent of older films that intentionally leave it somewhat open , definitely warrant in my opinion a positive review for this film."

This was much more on a dark creepy chilling style that had a somewhat, M Night Shyamalan feel to it. The movie had a lot going for it. Direction was spot on, with good backdro/scenery.

First, the film took its time - by the time these characters got to Sweden, you knew who they were, who they were becoming, and what fears they needed to face. There is a ton of stillness here, and it works. Second, while there were some fairly gruesome moments, the story focused less on making you jump and more on building an increasingly bizarre and creepy world. Third, Florence Pugh absolutely blew me away. Would I watch it again? Hard pass. But this film wanted to be more than just another scary movie, and it mostly succeeded. It may not work for everyone, but it sure was ambitious."

","I watched this movie, because it popped up on some ""best films of '19"" lists.
I appreciate brave film making and daring to be different, but I also appreciate stories, that make some sense. It felt to me that trying to shock the audience was more important, than anything else. There's a long buildup, that leads to nowhere. I found myself laughing at some points, because this film tries ridiculously hard to make people uncomfortable. It might have worked if the characters had some actual depth, or it was done in a more subtle manner.
In the first ten minutes I thought to myself, that this film tries to copy Hereditary (which I liked) in a bad way and later found out, that this is from the same director. It isn't a bad thing to have a distinct style, but in this movie, the theatrical elements outweigh the actual message, whatever that was. Was I supposed to care about any of the characters? Was this supposed to be an atmospheric cult horror? I mean a horror about a cult. If there's a hidden meaning to all this, it was so well hidden, I couldn't find it. Otherwise it was dragged out needlessly long."

","Midsommer is the second feature length film written and directed by Ari Aster. If you're a fan of his first film Hereditary, I highly suggest watching Midsommer. Expect to see vague similarities and an overall running theme; however, be ready for a completely different feel than the more blatant horror of Hereditary.<br/><br/>Midsommer gives the feel of an unending trip gone terribly bad. I honestly haven't felt so anxious watching a movie since I saw Requiem for a Dream. Nevertheless, as weird and bizarre as the film is... I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen. It's almost like poking a sore and having it hurt, yet wanting to poke it more and more. I realize that it seems like i'm rambling and maybe none of this makes sense to the reader; however, it is my best attempt at explaining what I just saw without giving away any details.<br/><br/>I highly suggest going into the film without having any background. DO NOT READ ANYTHING REVEALING WHAT ITS ABOUT! Just grab some snacks and popcorn and get ready for a 2 1/2 hour weird ride.<br/><br/>The film itself is beautifully shot and brimming with color, light, and beautiful scene scapes. I thought the acting was phenomenal, especially that of Jack Reynor who plays Christian in the film. Florence Pugh also brought a level of acting to the film that could definitely be considered award winning.<br/><br/>I gave the film a 7 out of 10 not because of any flaws with the film, but just the fact that it was 2 1/2 hours long. A small amount of the film seemed to be drawn out a bit and I believe the same effect could have been achieved in a shorter amount of time. The length doesn't take away from the initial watching experience at all, but would definitely keep it from being on my rewatch list.<br/><br/>I give Midsommer a 7 out of 10."

","After a promising job in (hereditary), Ari Aster is back with his new nightmere ; Midsommar. Here we have an astonishing scenery where greenery is everywhere and the light of midday -and midnight!- sun shines over every thing , which itself becomes a creepy and chilling thing as we go through the film. we also have the great performance of Florence Pugh who broke our hearts with her tragedy , her tears and her final confusing smile!
If every thing is such great , so what is the problem? the answer is: this is not a new film. every minute in the film is predictable. If you see the trailer you will be able to anticipate every coming shot while you are watching. You say to yourself (OK! of course some thing will happen) , and you keep waiting for a twist that never comes, then you realize the truth : this film is only a remake of The Wicker man! a good remake of course but ...no more.
The film uses the same symbols: the maypole, the flower gatherings and dancing and - certainly! - the human offerings.
If you enjoyed the wicker man , you will enjoy this ,but you will be a little bit disappointed because it adds nothing to the genre - the folk horror- except for horror in the rising sun ....and that is why I gave it 7"

The cinema was laughing at the climax of the filming with the whole pushing the guys bumcheeks, I don't understand how anyone would not find it funny, the man was drugged up and looked like he had no idea was going on.

","I'll start by saying that I enjoyed Hereditary. It had elements of surprise that were great to see and as a veteran film watcher, I've seen a lot. I can't say the same for this movie. Everything you think is going to happen does and in exactly the same order and manner you imagine. I suppose if you're new-ish to horror, you might find the excess of cultish behavior in the film disturbing (personally, I found it unsubtle and cliche) but as many have already mentioned this is head to toe ""The Wickerman"". Aster has nothing new to add and where he might have delved into the characters more he really doesn't. I like what one reviewer said, ""Aster establishes the veneer of an art movie only to draw viewers into what is essentially exploitation fare"". I give the movie 4 stars for camera work and trying to shoot a horror movie fully sunlit. This is a long movie so...yeah, be forewarned."

"AceRoccola","4","58","132","3 July 2019"," What happens when someone already remade The Wicker Man.
","A film this bereft of plot or purpose does not need to be 2 and a half hours long. But Ari Aster is nothing if not pretentious. The unnecessary length of this film is just one example of his boundless ability to indulge himself.<br/><br/>If you've seen the Wicker Man, you've seen this. If you've seen just about any film in this genre, you've seen what this one has to offer (and likely much more). But above all else, it really is trying to just be The Wicker Man. It dutifully follows each expected beat, with no surprises in store. The usual tropes of an ""evil village holiday"" movie manifest. A troubled relationship, an innocent invitation, folksy people preparing for an upcoming celebration that is obviously the epitome of all evil to everyone but the clueless protagonists. The evil villagers themselves are indistinguishable from those of The Wicker Man's equally pointless 2006 remake. The whole ""evil matriarchy!!"" theme from that film is imported fully into this one (minus the bees, I guess), proving that Ari Aster believes storytelling is nothing more than a quick cut-and-paste job.<br/><br/>This film is not a trainwreck in the way that some are. It looks like a movie, and sounds something like a movie. On a technical level, it is mostly fine. But it's insufferable all the same. Because it fails on a creative level. Everything done here has been done to death already and done better. It is a hollow exercise in remixing other people's' work, with no update or insight to justify its existence. The perfect horror film for the time, I suppose. But not one worth actually sitting through."

","Just finished watching a movie called ""Midsommar"". It was slow, took forever to resolve, and was disturbingly pagan. I haven't decided if it glorifies paganism (as the end seems to imply) or if it is a metaphor of the loss of the power of Christianity in Europe and the return to it's immoral Christless and pagan past (which its disturbing nature and symbolism seemed to).<br/><br/>Whichever it was, the entire movie long I was struck by Romans 1 which talks about how God's judgment is just on those who have not known the Creator but rather became fools and worshiped the creation. The thought of what it must have been like to be a priest 1000 years ago bringing the light of the gospel to such villages is fascinating. Let us remember that such individuals brought Christianity to Europe and saved it out of such a culture.<br/><br/>Lasty, the movie struck me that, not only would God be entirely just in striking such people down for the evil they do, but that such people don't deserve a warning of death let alone the giving of His only Son for a mere chance that one might repent - but that is exactly what God did . The true weight of God's patience toward sinners became uncomprehendingly great watching this train-wreck play out.<br/><br/>That aside. I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you are somehow intellectually and prayerfully involved in better understanding the resurgence of paganism taking place in the world today. Let me make it quite clear that this is a picture of the world from which Christianity (Christ Himself) called humanity out and thus it took quite an emotional toll to sit through. I wouldn't call it entertainment but rather a stark picture of a Christless Europe."

","I have to admit I didn't like ""Hereditary"" at all, in part because it was w-a-y overhyped by A24, so I wasn't waiting with bated breath for Ari Aster's next film. Even the preview for ""Midsommar"" was underwhelming. Similar to ""Hereditary"", there was this really creepy-looking character who we'd be led to be believe was the key to everything, but who most likely would have little to do with the plot development. (In fairness, he actually did play a role by foreshadowing through his art what was to come, but otherwise, his only purpose seemed to be to just look weird.) And like such recent hybrids as ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" or ""Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter"", this film looked from its preview like ""The People's Temple Remakes Wicker Man while Performing The Sound of Music"". But I was jonesing for a horror flick and thought I'd give ""Midsommar"" a try, and I'm so glad I did.<br/><br/>One thing I have to give Aster props for is his visually arresting opening scenes. In Hereditary, there was the doll house expanding into a very similar full-sized house with a flesh-and-blood family. ""Midsommar"" opens with shots of a pristine and tranquil countryside abruptly punctuated by the tragic here and now. In fact, this entire film is so visually stunning and audibly seductive I was immediately drawn in.<br/><br/>Another plus for ""Midsommar"" is that I was able to emotionally connect to the two main characters, Dani and her boyfriend Christian. Dani has long been dealing with the ups and downs of a mentally disturbed sister whom she loves and is now reeling from the loss of her entire family through a murder-suicide. Christian seems to care about Dani but finds her family drama and emotional neediness wearing. He's ready to move on but can't bring himself to leave Dani in such a vulnerable state.<br/><br/>The other characters play minor roles but respond to circumstances in believable and sometimes humorous ways. The scene where the newly arrive guests trip out on hallucinogens is a hoot.<br/><br/>I also liked that, unlike most horror movies that rely on darkness, stormy nights and the like, the events in ""Midsommar"" unfolded like a rural idyll bathed in mostly dazzling sunshine.<br/><br/>When Dani learns that Christian is planning a trip to Sweden with his male friends, she guilt trips him into letting her come along, and this is where the drama begins.<br/><br/>The group plans to stay as guests of Pelle, a friend of Christian's, who became orphaned after the loss of his parents and who was taken in by a pagan cult called the Hargas. As the students learn the strange ways of the cult, they're horrified by some of the brutality they witness and become increasingly unnerved by the disappearance of a number of visitors.<br/><br/>One of the horrors they witness is the suicide of an elderly couple who have reached their terminal age according to their tradition. In typical Aster fashion, their death is spectacular and over-the-top gruesome. As brutal as it was, this scene was breathtaking in its visuals, touching in its solemnity, as well as engrossing in the dramatic stillness waiting to see what was going to transpire. Interestingly, although Dani was the vulnerable and traumatized one, she was the only one in her group who didn't turn away from the spectacle in shock and disgust.<br/><br/>Another highly disturbing scene is where Christian is chosen to mate with a girl in the community named Maya and apparently given some kind of aphrodisiac (as well as some tampered food and drink that would have sent me to the nearest McDonalds) to aid in the coupling. In spite of the full frontal nudity, this had to be the most non-sexual sex scene I'd ever seen. As in everything else in this strange community, it ""takes a village"" to consummate the act. The hapless Christian seems more driven by biological compulsion than any titillation, and more bewildered by the women than engaged with his partner. However, as strange and creepy as it was, there was just something haunting about it too.<br/><br/>Oddly, with each successive horror, and as Dani's relationship with Christian falls totally apart, Dani begins to lose her dependency on Christian, become empowered, and realize the Hargas as her new family. When Dani catches Christian cheating on her and finally falls apart, the Harga women share in her pain in a very moving way. They tend to communicate a lot through gestures and glances (called ""affekt"") mimicry, and also through chanting and singing which, I have to admit, was eerily beautiful.<br/><br/>The final scene left me up in the air as to whether the evolution of Dani was a good or bad thing, though I suppose it could have been symbolic of catharsis and putting to death the old and embracing the new.<br/><br/>At any rate, with more films like this, I see a very bright future for Ari Aster."

","First of all: if a movie receives very low and very high scores then you know an art-film or new classic is born. And despite the sometimes gory shots, as a horror movie it actually doesn't really fit in the genre. Which is refreshing.<br/><br/>The movie delivers in the acting, as has been said many times before. And it is a psychedelic trip on one level. On the other hand, this movie is all about belonging somewhere. Having an environment that is caring and loving and healthy.<br/><br/>And that's what's so good about this movie to me. If your environment is toxic, uncaring and unhealthy, like Dani's is, it is actually a lot better to be included in a society that has it's brutal rituals but definitely is loving and caring. At the end of this movie i was rooting for the Swedish commune instead of Dani's friends.<br/><br/>What did help in this proces was the fact that the horror scene's weren't really scary, and, as a critical note, the special effects / grime wasn't that convincing and sometimes a bit laughable. If the effects we're of a higher level, i think i would've been more conflicted in the end.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, if you love cinema or theatre, and liked to be inspired by an out-of-the-box kinda movie, I'd definitely recommend Midsommar."

"DwightLynn","7","6","9","14 January 2020"," A Powerful and Bizarre Ride
","After the powerhouse that was Hereditary, I was eager to see how writer-director, Ari Aster, would follow up his amazing debut. Midsommar is an ambitious second film that carries over some of what worked with his initial film while having a different feel overall.<br/><br/>Like Hereditary, this film is carried by a wonderful lead actress who goes through an entire cavalcade of emotion. Florence Pugh was an actress I was unaware of, but following this film I am definitely going to keep my eye out for her. She was jaw-dropping. She conveyed grief and sadness so vigorously it almost became hard to watch.<br/><br/>One thing that was interesting about this film is that unlike Hereditary, which was unpredictable the entire way through, in this film the outcome is fairly apparent. It is a horror movie about a bunch of people visiting a strange place; you kinda know what is going to happen to them. But what kept my interest, aside from the great presentation, is how Aster presents his characters.<br/><br/>They are believable. Especially the boyfriend character. They aren't over-the-top; they are real people. And that makes what happens to them all the more heartbreaking. Aster really likes to put his characters through the ringer emotionally. There are moments in this film where his characters are so emotionally-devastated part of you just wants to reach into the screen and put your hand on their shoulder.<br/><br/>The presentation of the film is notable as well. What stuck out to me is the amazing cinematography, score, and lighting. Having a horror movie set during the day is a unique decision and it benefited the film greatly. There are so many breathtaking shots in this film that it almost becomes more mesmerizing than scary. Midsommar lures you in slowly and looks innocent at first, much like the cult of this film.<br/><br/>If I had any complaints it would be about the last 20 minutes or so. As mentioned previously, the plot is somewhat predictable, and that is fine for a movie like this because if anything, this just increases the dread the audience feels for the characters. The problem I had with the last little chunk of the film is that the two remaining characters left were both rendered mute. This was a good way to get the audience to focus on the creepy visuals, but with completely silent protagonists it becomes kind of hard to relate to what is happening on screen.<br/><br/>The characters are written so well that when they no longer speak I feel left in the dark. And since the plot is kind of predictable, the ending feels a little too slow for me. I think Aster could have achieved the same feeling in the end if the pacing was a bit quicker. This is another complaint I have: the movie may be a little too long for its own good. Hereditary had such a breakneck pace that this may be jarring to some.<br/><br/>Still, what makes this film compelling is its characters and the journey they go on. Aster is a king at mixing relationship drama with disturbing ideas and images. His films really stick with you more than most horror films because of this, and I am very eager to see what messed up thing he cooks up next.<br/><br/>Midsommar is a unique experience and very much worth watching. Although it is a bit uneven in some places, like pacing and the occasional cheesy moment, it is so crazy and strange that it can become impossible to look away."
"jonathonmann","3","6","9","6 October 2019"," Wicker Man Reboot
","Film was ok, definitely watchable but zero originality, personally I found the leading character irritating too. I think as a stand alone movie it's a 5/10 but I've given it 3 because it just rips of the Wicker Man which was much better"
"jacquelinesage-16072","3","6","9","5 October 2019"," Beautiful cinematography

Apparently about lack of communication, which is painfully obvious, because I felt nothing other than wishing I was watching Wicker Man again and didn't communicate it to the person I sat through this with. As Grace Dent said, would have experienced more drinking schroom tea in a garden centre"
"sportsnut-66935","7","6","9","4 July 2019"," Ambitious but Overlong
","First off, anyone who planned to see this movie
should go in with an open mind. It's a movie going experience that is very difficult to describe. Ari Aster film delivers on being very disturbing and gruesome but suffers from major pacing issues.<br/><br/>The good: the cinematography, acting, colors and music are nearly flawless. It is one of the most technically stunning films you will see. The music makes the film all the more unsettling at times and the camera shots can linger for so long it begins to make you nervous. The acting is solid specifically from Pugh. Will Poulter is funny at times and intentionally annoying as almost all his characters are. If you were expecting hereditary part 2, you may want to reconsider.<br/><br/>While this film just gets crazier and crazier as it goes, it can be hard to forget that this story is Dani's and that's where you will find what this movie is truly about. It's about an unstable relationship that decays and eventually explodes and forces a new cycle of self-discovery. You will probably need to read articles or watch videos on this movie when you come out like I did.<br/><br/>Now on to the issues. This movie is long. And I enjoy long movies. Hereditary was perfectly paced but there are numerous scenes in this movie that could be trimmed down or cut. People will say it adds to the movie as a whole but some don't. Also, there are supposed to be some genuinely unsettling scenes but almost everyone in the theater burst out laughing. Nudity can be a hard thing to take seriously when it's showed like this, but I understand that some pagan rituals actually do that, so i understand where it's coming from. While the climax is far from as unforgettable as hereditary, the story does come full circle and will leave you with an unsettling final shot.<br/><br/>Overall, Aster's sophomore film doesn't reach the heights of hereditary, but still provides much of what people loved about that movie. You will most likely walk out of the theater thinking wtf did I just watch, but that's the point. It's a film that requires multiple viewings and some research to truly appreciate. Go see it to form your own opinion though because this could end up being more divisive than hereditary."

"djdavidandersen","8","7","11","6 July 2019"," What just happened to me?
","As many already suggested, go into this knowing as little as possible. This movie will not be for everyone. It is not a scary movie cut from today's typical cloth. It reminds me of 60s and 70s horror like Kubrick and Polanski. Smart, deliberate, beautifully shot slow burn that grips you from the beginning and holds on until they decide to let you breathe with the horror. Ari is a director that cannot be reckoned with in my opinion. I left this movie feeling exactly how I felt after Hereditary. Disturbed, uncomfortable, and knowing I will be thinking about it for a long time. Florence was brilliant at making you feel for her, while being just neurotic enough that you felt for her boyfriend along the way. Also, this movie makes you feel every emotion, even ones you don't want to! Lines are blurred between good and evil, what is ok to see or not see, and an ending that leaves you wanting more. Go see this if you want something very different and powerful. Be prepared for large doses of gore, ""unsavory"" topics, and non gratuitous full nudity. They are part of the movie, and I'm not sure if i would have changed any of it, even though I feel they distract from most movies. Another masterpiece by A24 studios."
"elliottthomasc","9","35","76","5 July 2019"," A beautiful misunderstanding
","Many of the reviews I've seen for the film, have totally misunderstood the sole purpose for this film.<br/><br/>Before I get into that though, I would like to talk about the technicals of this film.<br/><br/>Throughout this film, I counted multiple times where the transitions and editing were simply stunning. Many great center of focus transitions that show how great this filmmaking team was. Great directing again from Ari Aster who continues to give us great ""post-horror"" films. Although this film is not as great as Hereditary (too me a top tier horror film) it has better Cinematography elements to it such as the theatrical aesthetic.<br/><br/>One thing I didn't notice, was that this film lacked the stand-out performance that Hereditary gave us from Toni Collette.<br/><br/>This film gave us great writing with little to no throw-away lines. It also had too many long scenes where the suspense was being overused. However, I don't find that to be much of an issue.<br/><br/>Okay, now here is what many people are misunderstanding. I couldn't help but acknowledge many people in the theater after the last shot saying ""aww cmon it can't end like that"" but I believe that was an amazing point to end the film. The sole purpose of this movie was to show Dani overcoming her loss of her parents/sister. Many people that I've talked to have believed that the suicide/murder revealing scene at the beginning is a ""plot hole"" but that is where they are wrong.<br/><br/>The whole film is about Dani overcoming the adversity that she went through with that horrific event and the triumph of her finally moving on from it and finding people who will always be family to her and who will always empathize and sympathize with her. The cult provides her with people with loving and caring support (something her boyfriend could not do) and helping her find her ""family"".<br/><br/>The final shot shows Dani happily smiling, knowing that she has people who will always be there for her and will always take care of her. For example, they help her through the breakup of her boyfriend (they basically breakup when she finds him having sex with the red-head female) when the whole group of girls comfort her by showing that they are feeling her pain as well.<br/><br/>I think many people are looking at this film the wrong way and I hope that this will be a guide to see this film through a better and much clearer lens."
"chloegold","10","32","69","5 July 2019"," One of the most captivating and disturbing movies I've ever seen
","It's hard to describe the movie without spoiling it but I'll try my best. It's definitely a movie that's better if you go in not knowing much about it. The film was beautifully shot and wonderfully acted. In many ways, it reminded me of classic horror movies like The Wicker Man (obviously the original and not the horrible remake). It's beautiful and horrifying all at the same time. The movie is a slow burn like Hereditary but it's really hard within the first few minutes. I almost wanted to walk out in the first few minutes. Not because it was bad, far from it. But because of how soul crushing and triggering the intro is. But the intro really sets the tone for the movie and is important for explaining why the main character feels and acts the way that she does. One of the things I love about this movie and Hereditary is how Aster doesn't shy away from pain and human suffering. It makes the movie more painful to watch, but the emotional connection is like none other (and there are scenes in Midsommar that directly mirror this communal feeling of pain and sorrow). It feels as if Aster wants you to be a part of the movie, feel the pain, sorrow, suffering, and confusion that the characters feel. At the very least, it makes for some of the best character development.<br/><br/>All in all, Midsommar is very far from an enjoyable experience, but it is a must see because of how masterfully crafted the entire movie is. Just be warned, many of the scenes are quite shocking (some of the plot points you can easily see coming but the visual imagery is nothing short of shocking, even if you do predict what is going to happen)."

"dogmaticdogs","9","38","85","4 July 2019"," Ambitious Nightmare Examining the Male and Female Relationship Power Struggle
","I can't believe all the bad reviews, especially those relating to substance or lack thereof. It seems like many missed the point or didn't know what to expect going into the movie.<br/><br/>This is not a horror movie (at least not in the typical sense like Hereditary was, and which I thought was easily the best horror movie of 2018 and is by the same director) although it certainly is horrific. Rather, it is an acid-trip nightmare born from the anxiety arising from the contemplation of a life-long commitment to a mate and starting a family, and familial pressure regarding the same. Much like Rosemary's Baby was a play on female anxiety arising from one's first pregnancy, this is a journey through the cycles of human life with special emphasis on fear of commitment and what it means for one's individual identity.<br/><br/>The woman is portrayed as having a lot of family baggage and worried that her chosen partner's friends will not accept her, that he may be cheating on her, that her friends cannot be trusted, and that she will give up all power by continuing the relationship. Consumed with beauty and dreams of idyllic happiness replacing the chaos that is her current life. I should note that these traits are not always exhibited directly through her eyes or mouth but through the lens of her trip.<br/><br/>The man is portrayed as doing his best to do the right thing but still wanting the respect of his buddies, tempted by seducers, and surrounded by women that want to lock him down. One friend, a horny but hopeless geek always getting into trouble. The other, a rival.<br/><br/>The director doesn't pick a side (i.e., the female perspective v. the male perspective), but rather tries to show both sides fairly (including flaws) at the same time. You will have to watch the movie yourself to see who wins this power struggle for dominance and who is subsumed by the other.<br/><br/>Don't go in expecting a simple-minded horror movie, go in expecting to see a brilliant manifestation of the complex emotions many women and men go through when finding a mate and trying to decide whether to commit. This movie will be too raw, graphic, violent and ethereal for many, but if you don't mind that sort of thing, what a truly brilliant piece of art this is. The visuals are absolutely stunning."
"truemythmedia","8","15","29","8 July 2019"," Aster's Stunning Sophomore Entry
","I enjoy this film more and more I think about it. It is not exactly what I was expecting when I walked in, but it is crafted with undeniable class. This is one of the more beautiful horror films I've seen recently (in terms of visuals), and it just goes to show Aster has plenty to say.
This is a film about being in an abusive relationship, and how people inside that relationship are sometimes blinded by their own love to seeing how another person might be bad for them, it's about why some people decide to stay in relationships like this even when it's obvious it's a bad place for them. I think the way that this film approaches this topic is pretty fantastic.
I personally can't wait to see what comes next from Aster.

","This movie was terrible! The director who created this film must of been on something himself. It left me confused and left sitting awkward during scenes. I wouldn't recommend to anyone."
"ekamanoieau","8","2","2","15 December 2019"," Know Nothing
","Midsommar is an ambitious film, I watched the cut version and it shows in the editing that various scenes are missing, especially in the beginning, but considering it still runs into 2 Â½ hours I won't hold it against anyone.<br/><br/>Firstly, the film suffers from the typical horror movie failing where the viewer can't explain why the characters don't realise something is incredibly wrong and they should probably do something about it, but on further reflection one could say the same about everyday people with bad habits, toxic relationships, and delusions, so I guess horror movie characters are no different.<br/><br/>The film clearly draws from Wicker Man, anyone and everyone who has seen the two can't help but notice this fact and one can't help but wonder if there was not some way to avoid the over-similarity, but it's hard to say exactly how.<br/><br/>As my last criticism I must stress there is a major dearth of restraint in this film, there are many good ideas but there are many bad ones (choosing by lottery balls being the worst, and the and the co-existence of the two really detract from the high points. This isn't a failing of cinematic editing, it's a failing of writerly editing, and it is built into the film at the roots, which is sad considering just how great the best parts of this film are.<br/><br/>The scene which shocks is of course the thing which sticks in the mind but aside from the religious views of the participants it's not that unique, plenty of skull-crushing happens in horror, though the responses of the Brits as the villagers look on in silence really hammers home how alien it all is.<br/><br/>The constant sunlight is enveloping and adds to the timelessness, the spacelessness, this story happens during a season, not on a specific year or particular country. The constant use of hallucinogenic mushrooms and various herbal drugs robs the viewer of any certainty at how much is real, surely people are dying, but are they really dying as they seem to be, is the wave of decadent blooms, the laughter of strangers, is this hallucination? We're never quite sure.<br/><br/>What I love though are the later scenes, as the girl becomes drawn into their world, inexplicably speaking swedish, her crown bustling with life, the flora growing over everything, the juxtaposition of beauty, death, growth and decay. The boy knows less and less of what is happening, he's scared and confused, and when drawn into the place he gets some his basic nature takes over even as his higher cognitive functions clearly remain obscured.<br/><br/>When the girl witnesses his betrayal, which she not only expects, but almost wills into existence, then she grieves, and her retinue grieve with her, and there is a real sense of the sharing of grief not only making the process easy for her, but more intense, it is paradoxical and palpable, and with a little restraint, it could have been a profound beautiful moment in cinema.<br/><br/>Likewise, as the girl becomes the queen of may she assimilates the mixed feelings, the harsh hunger that followed spring, the weariness of countless days in the dark and cold followed by unending light, the hope and jubilation of a year coming into it's most joyous point beside physical pain.<br/><br/>Then in the final scene the girl smiles, it is a knowing smile, and there is a sense of horrific, beautiful necessity to the agony of people burning alive. It's a shame the guy is inside a bear.<br/><br/>This film is much like the flowers, abundant, lovely, overaabundant, overlovely, and in desperate need of pruning."
"Daviteo","8","2","2","12 December 2019"," Immediate thoughts
","I'm writing this about four minutes after watching the film on iTunes. First, Midsommar is definitely ""art house horror"" like Hereditary was. I'd put it in the vein of Rosemary's Baby and The Shining. I bet this and Hereditary could be considered horror classics in fifty years.<br/><br/>What this movie is NOT is some mainstream splatter fest. Like Hereditary, I'm guessing this will will sit with me for a while, take its time to be digested, allow me to contemplate its every detail.<br/><br/>Now, I think Ari Aster may have gone a little too far on the weirdness in some places, but possibly only a few inches further from Hereditary. And there were a couple things he wrote in, dialogue and action, that could almost be considered silly. But I still give him the benefit of doubt in being, in my opinion, one of the best horror filmmakers of the 2000s.<br/><br/>With that being said, the film is certainly not for everyone. It'll make you think; it'll evoke deep and troubling feelings. It's not a straightforward blood fest. You have to be comfortable with uncertainty and strangeness and mixed genres going in. You have to be okay with a 2 1/2 hour meditation on grief and loss and confusion that's sometimes quite slow or even seemingly happy.<br/><br/>But if you're still interested in the film, you'll find an absolutely gorgeously shot, beautifully scored, well acted, bright, colorful art house horror movie that will stay with you much longer than any dark slasher pic could."
"lavatch","Null","2","2","7 November 2019"," A Midsommar Night's Dream...or Nightmare
","This reviewer gave Ari Aster's film ""Hereditary"" the rating of 5, and ""Midsommar"" merits the same mark for the same reasons. In the bonus track of the DVD of ""Midsommar,"" Aster describes his goals of wanting to leave audiences ""moved, unsettled, and confused"" through the experience of ""an adult fairy tale."" But he could have achieved those goals without the long, protracted build-ups to the ritualistic scenes at the heart of the experience.<br/><br/>Ostensibly set in Sweden but filmed in Hungary, ""Midsommar"" makes use of a large, open field that was converted into the village in which an ancient Scandinavian cult practices its rites unimpeded by the constraints of modern civilization. The action unfolds primarily through the perspective of Dani Ardor, a young woman who has experienced the traumatic loss of family members. She then travels with her boyfriend Christian to Sweden where they will partake of summer ""festivities"" built around the June solstice and the customs of the Harga in the small village. But after they arrive and participate along with the cult, it would appear that Dani is being thrown from the frying pan into the fire.<br/><br/>In the extras segment of the DVD, writer-director Aster observed that he wrote the screenplay for ""Midsommar"" in response to a personal crisis in his life after a painful break-up. But the self-indulgence of the film went too far in stringing out the mundane activities of the village and an arty approach to the horror genre. In the interviews of cast and crew, it was apparent that the film personnel admired the auteur style of Aster. But the cast seemed to bristle at the limitations they felt from not having greater artistic license of their own in this meticulously choreographed pageant. Everyone seemed to move out of the way for Aster to take charge so that he could exorcise his personal demons.<br/><br/>The reactions of Dani to the bizarre conditions of her new environment seemed ambivalent at best. She never seemed to take a liking to the cult experience until the very end, when her reactions seemed forced and not believable. An alternative and more realistic portrayal of Dani would have been closer to Dorothy in the land of Oz, trying her best to remind herself that ""there's no place like home."" Instead, the little May Queen gleefully accepts a pagan dormitory as her new home, yet needs sleeping pills at night. As she admires her handiwork in the violent ritual practices of old, she had to realized like Dorothy that it was a long way to come from Kansas for that cathartic experience and that it now may not be easy to get back home."

","All I can say about this movie is: this was amazing.
I went into this movie with rather high expectations. Afterall I heard good things about it prior to watching it, and it was done by the same director as last year's Hereditary, and let me tell you - it did not dissapoint! Quite the oposite in fact - it not only meet my expectations, but exceeded them. Ari Aster is becoming one of my favourite horror directors in modern cinema, and alongside Jordan Peele (Us, Get Out), is giving me the feeling that the future of horror is in good hands.<br/><br/>But back to Midsommar. What to say? The movie is beautifully shot and realy stunning to look at. The locations, the costumes and the colorfulness of shots are realy a wellcome sight, specialy after countless horror movies of last decade that seem to use the same annoying and generic blue/gray filters and mute any color on screen. This movie is not that. In fact it is the opposite of that - everything is so bright and vibrant, and what adds even more to this is the fact that everything happens in broad daylight. Even the horrible stuff. And this is the key - it provides contrast between idilic pagan life on one side, and disturbing rituals on the other. It realy plays well with the plot and makes the horrific scenes even more horrific. And horrific they are, because the camera does not shy away from disturbing and gory scenes.
About this subject, I would say the movie is known for being one of more disturbing entries in recent years, but in my opinion the on screen violence, while there, isn't the main reason for this. Rather I would say it is the whole atmosphere that the cinematography and actors create that gives the disturbing feeling. So I would say, if film's (disturbing) reputation gives you second taughts about watching it .... do not listen to them, and don't sell yoursef short for one of most amazing moviegoing experiences in recent years! There is also one lenghty nude sceen (but non explicit) which manages to be erotic and uncomfortable to watch at the same time. And probably gives of the same feeling Cristian would have in that situation.<br/><br/>The movie is quite long and the pacing is slow, at the beginning, but it realy uses this time well to build up the atmosphere, and once it picks up it realy gets going. In this respect it is similar to what Hereditary did, but it is not that slow, and in my opinion does it better.
Acting was good overall. I especially liked the main protagonist, Dani, played by Florence Pugh, who I don't realy know that much as I haven't seen any of her movies yet. I also liked Josh, played by William Jackson Harper who I also taught did a great job in this. Out of the group, it is his character that I identified the most. On the other hand I relaly grow to dislike Cristian, Dani's boyfriend through the course of the movie, which was afterall the intent.<br/><br/>I won't spoil the plot, as I think I said everything and then some, so needless to say I highly recomend this one. Don't let the rumors of disturbing scenes or slow plot scare you, and treat yourself to not only great horror movie, but to a great movie period. 9/10 from me."
"Amthermandes","9","11","20","11 January 2020"," Style AND Substance
","Who would have thought a movie with such a bright and aesthetically pleasing exterior could be so disturbing and alien inside? Midsommar is such a film. It's remarkable; like viewing a documentary on a culture from a different planet. The horror sets in quick, taking no pause. Along with the main characters, the viewers then take a strange plunge into the sunny depths of a ritualistic hell. There, relationships are tested, drugs are induced, and all that should be light and wholesome are revealed as dark and horrifying, especially to those unfamiliar to the customs of this ""village."" It's an unsettling ride, effective and well done on everyone's part, and I'm sure many will not be able to look at a beautiful bouquet of flowers the same way ever again."

","""That was a waste of time"" muttered the viewers behind me. ""What on earth is going on?"" laughed the friends in front of me. ""That was hilarious!"" chuckled the imprudent heterosexual lads as I was walking out. Rather infuriatingly, as with most cases of contemporary filmmaking, I yearned to instantly throw a rebuttal at their faces. ""What did you expect?"".<br/><br/>Sure, A24 were excessively marketing this as if it was a mainstream horror, but even from the promotional material you could tell it was a piece of contemporary art. Divisive both in content and in art from. And I couldn't be any happier with the results. A group of friends, following recent dramatic trauma, travel to Sweden for a festival that occurs nearly every century. However, this festival is managed by a pagan cult who slowly envelope these tourists in a shroud of hallucinogenic transcendence.<br/><br/>With contemporary horror, and folk films in general, I repeatedly blurt out the phrase ""you get out what you put in"". If you are close minded, despise ambiguity and are repulsed by a glacial narrative pace, this film is not for you. Midsommar is not a ""horror"" film intrinsically. Unsettling? Absolutely. But at its Swedish core is a drama depicting the tension of a relationship breakdown. The emotional tonality and instability of the looming presence of frailty with the one you cherish most. The horrific festivities and ceremonious rituals is a tantalising representation of the delirious pain and heightened hallucinatory dementedness that is often evoked in a long lasting relationship. Aster conveys the highs and lows through palpable events that conjure emotional turmoil for the characters. Which brings me to the ""style over substance"" argument.<br/><br/>Often, as is the case with many ambiguous visions, the story and character development is more transparent than literal. The progression of these friends isn't necessarily painted in black and white, but watercolour instead. Dani in particular undergoes the most expressive development. Representing a weak and unstable state of mind during her family trauma, only to the increasingly grow stronger as she welcomes resentment and bitterness. Perfectly performed by Pugh who is fast becoming a global sensation. I knew she was one to watch ever since 'Lady Macbeth'. Her other peers, arguably, garner less screen time and are mere expendable assets to the folk horror vibe that Aster has lovingly shot. And trust me when I say this film is beautiful.<br/><br/>Far too many breathtaking camera angles and one take sequences that left me picking my jaw up off the floor. It's not often an unsettling film such as this is entirely shot in broad daylight and still produce the same effect. Just awe-inspiring, and Aster continues to be a talent to watch blossom. His ability to allow multiple interpretations exhume from the same story is effortless. A colossal amount of allegories and depictions, ranging from: spirituality, religion, matriarchal cultism, modernisation and emasculation.<br/><br/>The final scene, being one of the most provocatively artistic moments in the film, resembling the interconnectedness of community and family. A theme explored heavily in Aster's previous directorial efforts, 'Hereditary'. And in some ways, this is a companion piece to that. Which brings me to the same criticism that I had with 'Hereditary'. Aster is simply unable to satisfyingly produce a third act that seemingly keeps in tone with the preceding plot. Less is more. Unfortunately the shock value ramps up rapidly without much development and fails to resonate with me personally. The psychedelic visuals and bloody rituals accelerate faster than a flower blooming, and just loses its grip.<br/><br/>Can I recommend this film? Of course I can. Will I recommend this film? No. This is a divisive film that, whilst open to interpretation, is a film you need to want to watch. It's contemporary filmmaking at its best, that just loses its folkish edge towards its climax."

Ari Aster has created something special here and while his last film was a more straightforward horror this has subtle elements of brilliance throughout. It shocks at the perfect moments while making you laugh at others. The undertones of relationship study is an interesting one and something most can relate to. Go see this movie with an open mind and you won't be dissapointed."
"justinwfirestone","4","10","18","9 July 2019"," Pretty, summer, no fun
","Whoo-ahh! There sure is an awful lot to unpack here, and I mean awful, a lot. Ari Aster is continuing to provide evidence that he is the unholy offspring of Eli Roth and Lars von Trier, but only if they were brothers, because incest can produce people who are ""open"" to oracular visions.<br/><br/>Is Midsommar a dark comedy about emotionally abusive relationships and how awful dudes can be when they get together on vacation? It's neither dark nor funny enough for that qualification, and about an hour longer than would necessary to develop such credentials. Beyond that, the movie vacillates between gore-shock, pretty visuals, and far-fetched rituals which literally, and figuratively, beat the dead to death like Gallagher smashing watermelons on a beautiful summer day.<br/><br/>I suppose Midsommar might trip your trigger some if you, for example, had never been on the Internet and had never clicked on stuff you wish you hadn't. Or maybe you would find it refreshing if you had never seen the original Wicker Man with Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward. The ultimate parallel could be Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, depicting visitors as they explore a wondrous, yet perilous, new world.<br/><br/>There has to be a better way to break up than Midsommar suggests, but there are also an awful lot of movies to watch instead."

The cinematography was incredible and the direction by Ari Aster was great, nothing I would change. I always found myself on the edge of my seat throughout the film. Midsommar only had one jump scare and yet it made me on edge and tense throughout its entirety. This is what good horror movies should do. Jump scares are easy to do, but keeping an audience on the edge of its seat (the people in my theatre were definitely tense throughout this film): that's a feat. That's an achievement. I would definitely say this movie is 100% not for the feint hearted. There are many gory scenes (One almost made throw up) and WTF moments. However there is more to the movie than just the gore. It's a riveting story that is leaving many of us viewers confused, especially during the film's final act. I will be seeing this film again. 10/10 would recommend if you like horror movies!!!"

The film is an experience, unlike your standard horror film. It's is worth watching for its beautiful cinematography alone.

For example: There are small details that also play with your empathy, especially the screaming (animal or human), not just the paintings.

"sweidman-28016","10","12","23","11 July 2019"," Very Artistic Movie About Grief
","Midsommar Review:<br/><br/>Midsommar is written and directed by Ari Aster, the same guy who wrote and directed Hereditary (one of my favorite films), and follows a struggling couple who travel to Sweden to visit a rural hometown's fabled mid-summer festival. What begins as an idyllic retreat quickly devolves into an increasingly violent and bizarre competition at the hands of a pagan cult. This was my third most anticipated movie of the year. Hereditary was my favorite film of last year and I think it's an absolute masterpiece. This is definitely different from what I expected to see. Hereditary is a horror film about dealing with grief, and a bunch of other stuff that happens with supernatural cult stuff. I wouldn't consider Midsommar a horror movie at all. I think it's more of a drama with a little thriller stuff thrown in. It's more about Dani, played by Florence Pugh, and her failing relationship with Christian, played by Jack Reynor, all the while trying to deal with a recent tragedy. I should add that Jack Reynor did a good job as a horrible boyfriend and also a shocked man discovering everything that's happening. I think it shouldn't have been marketed or branded with the horror genre. It's not a huge problem it's just that after Hereditary and all the trailers for this most were probably expecting a horror movie. That being said it's not a bad movie. The plot is intriguing. It's more artistic and not for everyone. I think me and my friend were the only ones who actually enjoyed it out of everyone in the theater. Most people said ""Well that was stupid"" when it finished. I totally understand if anyone doesn't like it. The first hour I was debating if I liked it because nothing really happened. On an artistic level the first hour was good but not much happened. It was mostly the group getting high and sitting around before the festival. I thought everyone did a good job. Will Poulter played the funny one and he had many great one-liners. William Jackson Harper, just like his role in The Good Place, plays a serious guy and I enjoyed his character. He was most interested in the culture of these people. Once the festival begins things start to get more interesting and there's a sense of something being off. We all know everyone there is in a cult but we're confused on what they're going to do. Once the first most remotely ""scary"" part of the movie happens the rest of the ""scares"" are based mostly on shock value. One thing that might make people think this is dumb is the cult has many weird rituals that make us laugh in awkwardness. From what I read and know it was meant to be awkward so it wasn't just poorly done. I thought there were many shocking things that happen. That is all thanks to Florence Pugh. She is really good. They were saying that she was going full on Toni Collette in Hereditary but I don't think those two can be compared with the whole different plots. I thought Pugh portrayed a person dealing with grief perfectly. The opening tragedy scene we just hear her voice over a phone call and I thought it was just heartbreaking. The slow takes throughout, especially during that scene, added effect with some suspense and just making it like the audience is there discovering what is happening. May I add the cinematography was beautiful. It was brightly colored with pastels and there wasn't a shot, no matter how disturbing and shocking it was, that looked bad. Aster wanted pretty, light colors because there aren't many horror movies that have that look. There was always a sense of peacefulness throughout. It was honestly a calming movie that also wasn't at the same time. It's a very weird tone that I liked. The very end was such an interesting sense. Aster also likes a loud, beautiful song while something horrible yet joyous is happening. I really like that. The score by Bobby Krlic is good. Once again very peaceful and really pretty at times. This is a hard movie to write a review about. It's definitely one that needs an analysis and to be honest I haven't read one yet. I might be seeing it again and I might pick up on things I didn't the first time. I know there's lots of foreshadowing with these paintings and pictures in the background and plainly there for the audience to see. I found some that I noticed later and I want to know more. Overall it's a very interesting movie. Ari Aster went through a breakup and this is his way of writing it out on paper as he puts it. I can definitely see how that life event shaped this. That's really the meaning of the movie. Life events shape our lives. If you're not one for slow paced, artistic, strange movies this isn't for you. I wouldn't recommend this to everyone. It's more aimed for a specific group. I did enjoy it, not as much as Hereditary though so I guess I was expecting just a little more. Not that it's bad I just had different expectations. If you plan on seeing it just don't expect a single thing. That will help for a better viewing experience.<br/><br/>My Grade: B"
"maryleishman","8","12","23","3 July 2019"," See Midsommar in Theaters
","I had the opportunity to see Midsommar at an early screening and while I think the film could end up being divisive among movie-goers, I still think it is worth your time.
I'm not 100% sold on this film, but I did enjoy it. It was intriguing and very beautiful. For me the highlights of the film were the cinematography, short composition, sound editing, and sound mixing. In terms of sound I honestly feel this movie is Oscar worthy. Florence Pugh also deserves some recognition. She carried the whole film on her back and that shouldn't be overlooked. Her acting was spot on and completely believable. I loved it and I loved her.
My main problem wasn't the completely unsettling events that took place throughout the movie, but that the storylines of the main characters felt a bit weak and took a back seat. I think I would have cared more about where the film went if we had a better understanding of the characters. I felt there was no clear character development happening.
Whether you love this film or hate it I think it's worth the watch. At the very least it's better than giving your money to a remake or a sequel."
"Nhirscher","9","12","23","3 July 2019"," Ari Aster's Breakup movie
","This movie is one of the most unsettlingly joyful films I have ever seen. There is a line I never knew existed: the line between horror and happiness-- and that line was criss-crossed in an odd yet unmessy way. The film is idyllic in its depiction of horror imagery, meaning what the audience sees is inherently disgusting and bloody and pulpy, but the reaction is not necessarily wincing. This is because Ari Aster crafts a film where the lines are swirled and beauty is found in the mesmerizing horror. Similar to the last five minutes of Hereditary, the ending of Midsommar is euphoric.<br/><br/>Florence Pugh, as a Twitter user once aptly described, is ""god-level"". Her constant break downs and panic attacks demonstrate just how fantastic of a performer she is. She's able to light up her face in an instant and maintain that emotional high for ungodly amounts of time. She is the standout and should be compensated as such with shiny awards. Speaking of shininess, the cinematography is gorgeous. The overexposed film adds to the tone of uneasy happiness. And, adding to the creativity, the camera is poised in its movement, often holding on its subjects for extended amounts of time. The pulsating backgrounds and flowers are simultaneously nauseating and picturesque. Aster knows exactly which details to show and not show, giving the viewers a trail of flowery bread-crumbs to sniff out. Also hint: pay attention to the walls.<br/><br/>Thematically, Midsommar dares to deal with communal values and their ultimate strengths/shortcomings. Dani's attempts to confide relationally and emotionally in Christian, who is distant and uncaring (but not mean spirited), ultimately leave her unsatisfied and unable to move past the death of her parents and sister. Her inability to grow through Christian leaves her vulnerable for the cultish communalism of the pantheistic Swedes. The cult steps in and promises that through them, there will be no more worrying about what's yours and what's not. This includes food and family, and ultimately a home. Aster brilliantly uses this very encompassing view of community as a means to propel the protagonist to a happy ending, but also as a warning for the audience. Although Dani and the story is left satisfied by her new sense of community, the audience understands that the worldview she has decided to adopt has and will forever cloud the way she sees the world she lives in. She accepts the murder and mutilation as merely cultural differences.<br/><br/>Overall, it's fun. Enjoy a messed up film."
"jake-smith-1","6","26","58","4 July 2019"," Underwhelmed
","I loved hereditary, and had very high hopes for midsommar. Unfortunately, by the end of the film it was a slog to get through. Let me also add that if you liked ""Mandy"" you will probably love this film.<br/><br/>The start of the film was very promising, and in true fashion, the dialog, performances and camera work were exceptional. The opening lasts approximately 30 minutes and sets up the concept of the film, this is usually the hardest part for a horror (not really sure what category to put this film in as it is unique) film to do well, and I think Midsommar does a pretty good job.<br/><br/>The mid-section is very slow and does a phenomenal job at building anticipation. Many will hate how slow it is, and others will appreciate it. There are sequences that show the hallucinogenic effects of drugs (imho) the most accurately to date.<br/><br/>So why did I give this film a 6/10? Where do I think it went wrong? Well, I don't believe it did go ""wrong"" as such, rather it just stayed at the same level, and the ending felt like a disappointment. It was incredibly clear (intentionally) where the story was going, so the fact it took so long to get there, and only there was a let down.<br/><br/>Best things about Midsommar.

These are movies with two different goals and similar concepts but what I would and will argue to my grave is that midsommar takes the best aspects of that movie and makes it into what in my opinion the best movie of the year. The movie takes its time and the buildup is excellent the ending while some feel may be a letdown to me was the most powerful scene in the movie and the symbolisms and story telling is fantastic. The acting in this movie is not just great its realistic, the couple feels real and there situation is depressing, I know people like Mark who just want to have fun, this movie is perfect because it has comedic relief but it never takes away from the tension, the scares and just the overall feeling thats something is not right and its only gonna get worse. I have seen the directors cut of this movie twice in theatres and the second time was even better then the first time, the movie feels much smoother and fast pace but even on my first watch I knew I was watching something and someone who was truly great.

","""Midsommar"" (2019 release; 147 min.) brings the story of Dani and her friends. As the movie opens, it is snowing outside and Dani is frantically trying to reach her bi-polar sister. Turns out her sister has murdered their parents and then committed suicide. Dani leans heavily on boyfriend Christian for moral support, but because of that, their relationship seems in danger. After the opening credits, we find ourselves in May, and Christian and his 3 college friends are planning a trip to Sweden, at the invite of a college friend from Sweden, who explains that there is a week-long festival in his village that happens only once every 90 years. At the lat minute Dani decides to join the 4... To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the second film from writer-director Ari Aster, whose 2018 debut film ""Hereditary was a critical and commercial smash (I thought it was not the masterpiece that many others felt it was). Here he takes a different take on the grieving process, equally prominent in ""Hereditary"", and a potential relationship break-up, all served up in what looks to be an idyllic commune in northern Sweden (or is it cult?). Given that this is a plot-heavy movie, I don't want to give a lot more background, so as not to spoil. But I will say this: the movie is a slowburner and the trip becomes stranger and ""strangerder"" as we go along, to the point where you keep telling yourself ""what the heck?"" The movie is at 2 1/2 hrs. a bit too long for its own good, but I was surprised how quickly time seemed to pass by. During the last hour of the movie, I sat frozen in my seat as I watched the thing unfold. The photography is gorgeous from start to finish (surprisingly, the movie was filmed in Hungary, not Sweden). Last but certainly not least, there is a stunning score, and in the end titles I noticed the score is composed by British musician Bobby Krlix, better known under his stage moniker The Haxan Cloak. I will surely be checking out the movie's soundtrack.<br/><br/>""Midsommar"" opened wide over the July 4th weekend. The Friday early evening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati (in a fairly small theater) was PACKED. I noticed 2 people left about 45 min. into the movie, and didn't return. The rest of us sat transfixed, and you could hear a pin drop during the last 45 min. or so. If you are looking for counter-programming to the never-ending stream of superhero movies, sequels, prequels and other franchise garbage, look no further! ""Midsommar"" is one of the most original films that I have seen this year. I encourage you to check out ""Midsommar"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."

","«Midsommar» identifies with a widespread definition among Northern filmmakers that art, while larger and more spectacular, is better, as witnessed from Griffith to Linklater, through Gance, DeMille, Lean, Bondarchuk and even Coppola, along with all the rest. Immersed in music to provoke emotions that the images do not transmit by themselves, it is a film of excessive duration to tell an essentially simple story of fanaticism, cultural shock, materialism and primitivism in a hippie-like community in Sweden, with two pathetic leading characters who have traveled from United States to Scandinavia, and that, at least on my part, did not have my sympathy and did not allow me to connect: a woman who does not stop bawling, clinging to the memory of dead relatives, and a man who, in the end, is nothing more than an insipid stud. Along with the decent photograph of Pawel Pogorzelski, embarrassing and sometimes laughable incidents accumulate: the mating of the flabby stallion with the Swedish little virgin, the millennials' reactions to the sacrifices, the collective hysteria of the community in the Loudon nuns' style, the fake anthropological approach to the story, the bear costume... I don't know why I thought it was a very strange crossing of «Boyhood» with «The Blair Witch Project», «The Wicker Man», «Private Vices and Public Virtues"" and «Triumph of the Will».

"lukem-52760","9","10","19","8 January 2020"," A DISTURBING & MESMERISING SHOCKER MASTERPIECE
","WOW!!! ""Midsommar"" is one brilliantly made disturbing Horror Thriller, it's a slow burning tight trip into terror & it's done beautifully & eerily with a sense of dread hanging over everything all the time, a masterful piece of Cinema.
Now I can totally understand all the excellent reviews & see this as a definite instant CLASSIC.
The performance from the main girl Florence Pugh as ""Dani"" was absolutely outstanding, she gave it her all in an extremely emotional & raw performance & was easily the best actor & character in the movie.
The beginning scenes were depressing,shocking & unsettling in itself & that was just abit of ""Dani's"" backstory & her family but that was so intense & dark even before we get to The shockingly scary summer festival in Sweden!!!
Dani has been through a hell of alot with her family dying tragically & she suffers from depression & panic attacks & this movie is really her story & journey.
Dani & her useless boyfriend & a few friends go to Sweden for some summer festivities & learn the different culture but as expected the weird over nice village place is a haven for a Cult.
You already know exactly what is gonna happen & who will die but when it does happen IT'S shocking & disturbing, i can see the idea may have come from the 70's Classic ""The Wicker Man"" & Midsommar is just as shocking & scary!!!
Dani's boyfriend & his mates are useless idiots & Dani is the only smart & fully aware person there that fears the strange place & can really see how weird it is but the others just seem to go along, Dani is a fantastic character.
There is a very raw feel to it & an incredibly intense atmosphere that's gripping all the way through from the shocking beginning to the disturbing ending, Midsommar is a terrifying new modern Horror Thriller MASTERPIECE!!!
Some of the imagery is very scary & some scenes of violence is savage & shocking with realism & harshness, this is not a film i could watch lots but i TOTALLY can appreciate what a BRILLIANT work of art this movie is & how well it's MADE.
A standout performance from Florence Pugh & an incredibly directed shocker by Ari Aster who is a masterful powerful Director."
"dsayshi257","8","10","19","4 July 2019"," An incredibly immersive and visceral experience

"anmu-55804","9","10","19","4 July 2019"," Ari Aster has done it again!
","Let me start by saying this movie is not another Hereditary. It's not a ""scary"" movie, but that doesn't mean you won't find yourself scared or disturbed.<br/><br/>Midsomar is a wild ride that follows a young women navigating her life after a horrific tragedy. Unlike Hereditary Asther makes it clear that this is in face a cult movie. Through the trailers it's fairly easy to piece together what will ultimately happen in the final act. I believe that Asther did this on purpose because this isn't a film about a ""cult"", it is a film about relationships, grief, empathy, and codependence. There is so much more to this move then a cult.<br/><br/>
Like Aster's first film, Hereditary, Midsomar will inspire the horror genre for generations."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","16","34","6 July 2019"," Ari Aster's Midsommar is the single most terrorizing and suturing film of all time.
","Every summer in Scandinavia, Europeans celebrate the summer solstice with an array of festive activities, such as traditional dancing, gourmet cooking, and lots and lots of drinking. Extravagant clothes are worn, music is played, and sometimes pagan rituals are practiced during the longest day of the year, where sunlight is constant and the celebrations are continuous for weeks.<br/><br/>This ongoing festival known as Midsummer is still an incredibly popular occurrence throughout all of northern Europe, countries such as Sweden celebrating it as their national holiday. This seemingly harmless party was once practiced back before the origination of Christianity, in which brutal acts of human sacrifice and ritualistic violence occurred in order to worship either mother nature or various gods, including Jesus Christ at certain points in human history.<br/><br/>After last year's horror knockout Hereditary, director Ari Aster has topped his disturbing first feature by centering the Midsummer festivals as the topic of his latest horror nightmare Midsommar. This is a film I had been looking forward to seeing tremendously due to how Hereditary shook me to my core and kept me enthralled from start to finish and ended up disturbing me more than any other film, which I mean in the best way possible. Now, with Midsomar Ari Aster has crafted yet another ingenious horror film, this time delivering another brilliant piece of cinema but being too disturbing in his imagery at times.<br/><br/>Let me be frank by stating that Midsommar is the single most atrociously disturbing film I have ever seen, both due to what is and isn't shown on screen. Aster is too liberal in what he shows on the screen, depicting the most gruesome act of violence shown on film that I (and probably anyone) has ever witnessed. While there are only two scenes that actually depict ritualistic violence, Midsommar grabs you by the throat and refuses to let go, overwhelming your senses with a constant shred of dread, yet acting like a car accident that you know will haunt you, yet you can't turn away from.
The film follows Dani, a young woman plagued by an unspeakable family tragedy who travels to Sweden with her selfish boyfriend and his fellow anthropology graduate student friends in order to study the traditional festival in one of their friends' rural communes. Dani and Christian have a failing relationship yet she attends the festival anyway in order to escape from her harsh reality, thinking a peaceful few weeks in the beautiful Swedish countryside will help her move away from her trauma. Turns out, Dani couldn't have been more wrong. She and her American travel companions soon realize that the commune practices ancient traditions in tribute to the circle of life, their culture one of barbaric savagery and evil.<br/><br/>What keeps Midsommar together is actress Florence Pugh's remarkably fierce performance as Dani. Pugh gives her character a defensive charisma that she tries to use as protection against her vulnerabilities, yet the actress is simultaneously able to expose Dani's fears and vulnerabilities. Pugh does a perfect job of expressing raw emotion and is able to act genuinely horrified by what her character is going through, a rare talent found in very few actors in horror films.<br/><br/>It's important to note that this is not a film for mainstream audiences and is definitely not for everyone. If not immediately turned off from the scene I referred to earlier in which we see an atrociously graphic and grisly suicide (two people walked out of the theatre when this occurred), many will be put off by the fragile and delicate pace that Aster composes. Aster wants us to feel comfortable before taking advantage of us as a director. Having his film take place almost entirely in bright daylight while surrounded by beautiful scenery and slowly unfolding the terror allows the filmmaker to manipulate us as an audience and secure a false sense of comfort before overwhelming us in terrorizing bodily horror.<br/><br/>However, Aster uses his pacing to his advantage and makes the film far more effective. By taking the time to get to know Dani, we root and feel for her as a protagonist and are generally concerned for her safety and emotional state. Aster creates a vibe as a director that is intoxicating. We are constantly feeling a sense of uneasiness and are desperately awaiting what is next to come out of fear of being further disturbed. Using artistic editing and stunning cinematography to its advantage, the film presents a visually captivating array of images that wake the purest of emotions in us. I literally felt numb during several moments of this film due to how disturbed and unnerved I was at not only some of the hauntingly realistic and graphic images displayed on the screen but by the constant sense of fearing the unknown of what is yet to come.<br/><br/>It's easy to say that Ari Aster is one of the most effective directors of our time. He's a filmmaker who wants his audience engaged with his work in each and every second, using storytelling techniques such as foreshadowing and connectives in the most profound and creative fashions. Few filmmakers who contribute to the horror genre are able to make their films feel so real, which is why Aster is a natural master of horror. We're terrified and disturbed by his films because they feel like realistic plots, as opposed to obvious fictional situations that, while entertaining, don't resonate and hit home as hard.<br/><br/>I can't say that I can recommend this film due to how hardcore it is and how viciously disturbing it is. While Midsommar was by far one of the most memorable movie-going experiences of my life, most will be mortified by what they see. While I am haunted by some of what I saw in this film, I'm glad I saw it. It's a film that got not only an enormous reaction out of me but kept me more entertained than almost any film I've ever seen. Despite including the most hideously violent scene and the most uncomfortable and warped sex scene in film history, Midsommar is a truly unforgettable experience that will haunt you for weeks. While I felt these two scenes could have been much tamer and less barbaric and strange, Midsommar is even more mortifying than I expected, a description that, while normally would sound like a criticism, is the highest praise a psychological horror film could get.<br/><br/>Midsommar is by all means a messed up and hard to watch film, but it's because of this that it's so captivating and hunting. Simply put, this is one of the most unforgettable films of the 21st century, one I doubt I can handle seeing again, but unforgettable in the purest of senses."

Oh my god, this movie is BAD! It's not horror, it's gruesome and disgusting gore that pretentiously tries to ""deliver a message"" but fails miserably at the moment two guys jump from a cliff, and they smash the head of the one that didn't die with a sledgehammer. All with multiple close-ups to the bloody broken skull. How lovely!<br/><br/>After that, and seeing that one of the friends was skinned alive, and an explicit sex scene with naked middle aged women chanting/moaning, you just know how this is going to end: Everyone (but one) is going to die<br/><br/>And of course, that lucky survivor is our millenial angsty and toxic protagonist. Why else would we spend 30 minutes of the movie learning about her and her sister's suicide? Unless we pity her, there's no way we'd care about our whiny, emotional vampire protagonist, which is funny because she's the exact type of people that sects lure into joining them. Guess they did that right, huh...<br/><br/>In conclusion: Not worth it. No coherent behaviour, no answers in the end, not even scary"

"ernestsavesxmas","9","6","10","28 January 2020"," The thin line between pure joy and utter pain
","This film made my stomach hurt. But what induces such queasiness? Is it because we are presented with ideas that shake the very core of some central things about life, like love, religion, reproduction and sustainable farming? Midsommar exists on the thin line between pure joy and utter pain. It's a place the human mind does not want to willingly traverse. Ari Aster pushes us there and he keeps us there for the better part of three hours. Length is a necessity in this all-encompassing long game.<br/><br/>Much has been made that this artful horror is an allegory for a relationship falling apart; the director himself has pushed this forward so I'm not here to discount that in anyway. It certainly is that in the plainest of terms. Why my brain kept wanting to go bigger picture with it perhaps indicates I see everything in a state of decay? This is getting too personal. Sorry.<br/><br/>Aster is part of a new crop of filmmakers who are genuinely raising the bar for the horror genre, and simply making some of the best movies of today period. He set the bar ridiculously high with Hereditary just last year, and while this doesn't quite get to that level, it's a noble and overall successful attempt.<br/><br/>At times, the big picture, quasi-historical elements of the cult seemed to bog things down. Early on, by its very nature, it was clear that anything could happen, thus negating the onscreen shock of the ""surprises"" when they did. The idea that much of the action takes place with the characters on hard psychedelics removes some conflict as well.<br/><br/>But Aster thrives in moments. His execution of specific scenes and set pieces, and his knack for nailing realistic dialogue in otherwise unreal worlds are amazing. And he ramps up the visual FX this time around with some of the best if not most lowkey CGI work out there; I can't get those trippy pulsing flowers and landscapes out of my head. Ultimately, while I didn't feel like the movie was more than the sum of its parts, those parts are just too damn good to ignore."

First of all the run time is ridiculous. The films tales up almost THREE HOURS of your time. That alone should have been a sign to me but I kept watching. To say that this film left a bad taste in my mouth would be beyond an understatement. For most of the viewing I felt disturbed and anxious. At some points I genuinely thought I was high or having some kind of mental break. And this goes on for a long time. I can kind of relate this experience to the one I had when watching ""Suspiria"" (2018), meaning that the films entire purpose is to just be gross, disturbing, and pointless. Also the actions the characters take in the movie are ridiculous even for film standards. The movie is set in modern times, yet these grown adults see nothing wrong with going to a ""cult retreat"", taking strange drugs, and eating and drinking things from these strangers. Basically at multiple points in the film, the main characters are offered things to drink from these disturbed people all dressed in white, and at no point do they hesitate or refuse. It also gets way worse then this, as there is a lot of shocking goring scenes with close ups of this gore. I apologize I am now rambling but it's 7am and I have been unable to sleep because of how much this films disturbed me. Please save yourself the trouble and just watch YouTube reviews if you want to know what you are missing.

The only ""positive"" thing I can say about it is that the psychedelic parts were semi effective in having you experience the trip. Other than that, it was strange, slow, and meandering. I would NOT recommend that anyone watch it."

","Midsommar can be described as nothing less than a masterpiece. Ari Aster manages to turn an idyllic swedish village and the beauty of broad daylight into one hell of a crazy trip. The camera work and editing was undertaken with painstaking detail. The actors, in particular Florence Pugh, gave Oscar worthy performances. The commitment these actors make to their characters (by god given talent) means that the development of their characters through a very short time period is done gracefully and organically. There is nothing forced about the acting in this film. Most horror movies can only dream of having this fluidity - but Midsommar is different than traditional horror movies. This film draws you in from the very beginning; the concepts and themes are ones that are extremely familiar to all of us. The emotional bargaining that you do with yourself throughout the film creates a true EXPERIENCE that stays with you long after the credits are finished rolling. I think it is quite sad, but also hilarious, that someone on this site has literally created dozens of accounts to bash this movie. Clearly not blessed with Ari Aster's scope of imagination and creativity!<br/><br/>Anyways, I suggest you see this movie. 10/10. Cannot wait to see what Ari has in store for us next."

","I don't want to get into details. I watched this movie, at the time I thought it ran too long and it wasn't as messed up as I thought it would be. But it sticks with you, like a terrible dream. The movie wants to be warm and inviting, but in the end it's the worst kind of nightmare. Just ask yourself watching Midsommar, was this planned from the start, from the death of her family to the end. Was it all part of a master, and besides the characters faults, was it always rigged for them to fail?"

","If you're familiar with ""Hereditary"" then you probably know how this film will proceed: at first it seems like a conventional film with a glossy polish. That polish is eventually stripped bare, and you're left with very graphic, grotesque imagery.<br/><br/>I will state that it definitely has merits, though. I value independence and other people's independence. I think that relying on communalism is a flaw, so when someone depicts cults well, my stomach turns. I'm also claustrophobic, so the cloistered, sheltered aspect of the cult in this movie freaked me out to a certain extent. I would not have remained in such a place for even a day, so I would have avoided all of the horror if I were in a similar situation in real life.<br/><br/>But it's far too slow paced, and it lingers on human anatomy and its various states of decomposition a bit too long. I'm neither a mortician nor a necrophiliac, so such things did not interest me. I also want to state that the previous imdb viewers who have written, ""We really can't tell who are the evil people in this movie"" scare me more than the movie itself. They are the simpletons for whom cults are designed. I believe that most sane people can agree that murder is a bit... ummmmm, draconian for the ""transgressions"" (and even this term is debatable in some cases) that the visiting party committed against the cult.<br/><br/>But their mentality makes for good horror. I just wish that director Aster had focused more on these reviewers-- I mean, cultists' mentality and less on defacing human flesh."
"faultlesstrash4","8","17","37","3 July 2019"," Weirdest movie I've seen in a long time... Though not necessarily a horror
","Let me start this off by saying that Hereditary was my favorite movie of last year and one of my all-time favorite horror movies. Therefore, ""Midsommar"" has been one of my most anticipated movies of 2019. Going in, I honestly had no clue what to expect except that some crazy stuff was going to go down in Sweden.<br/><br/>The cinematography was stunning. Absolutely beautiful. Additionally, the acting was very impressive, especially from Florence Pugh, the lead actress. The two hour and twenty minute run-time seemed to go by quickly, though at parts the film seemed to drag just a bit. The movie was disturbing and at times absolutely terrifying. But after exiting the theater, I just felt like I was expecting more. I had been waiting the whole movie for something to happen. I don't know what that something was, but it just didn't feel right to me.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil the movie but I just want to give a warning to those who want to see this movie: don't go into ""Midsommar"" expecting it to be a full-out horror movie. I believe that this is why I am giving it seven stars at the moment. The whole time, I was expecting for the horror to begin, but it wasn't until the end of the movie that I realized that ""Midsommar"" was no horror movie. Don't get me wrong, the movie contained numerous bizarre, grotesque, and suspenseful scenes, but I wouldn't categorize it as a horror movie. The film is definitely a slow-burner, with moments of terror and disgust interspersed within the overall drama of the story, which is in fact what I would mainly categorize this movie as. A suspenseful drama. I know. I might sound crazy, but this is just my opinion.<br/><br/>I definitely plan on giving this film a second viewing and believe that when I re-watch ""Midsommar"", no longer waiting for it to become a ""horror"" movie, I will be able to enjoy the movie more for what it is.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this movie to people who enjoyed Aster's previous film. Additionally, I would recommend it to those who enjoyed ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" by Yorgos Lanthimos, because for some reason I felt that the two had many similarities.<br/><br/>Overall 7/10"

The music in the movie gave me such a headache with all the screeching noises. Nothing at all made any sort of sense. Nothing really had an explanation as to why. I have seen a lot of movies and this was truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. If you understand anything at all, you must be tripping like the people who made this.

","I am at a loss for words. I want to give this film a high rating, I really do. The acting was stunning from Florence Pugh and the cinematography was a work of art, but I don't think that redeems the film from the traumatic and disturbing scenes that unfold throughout the film.<br/><br/>I still find myself unsettled by the events of the story. I felt like I needed a shower as I walked out of the theater, and as someone who can normally handle gore, violence, and demonic films, that is saying something.<br/><br/>While Ari Aster is obviously a master filmmaker, the question must be asked, ""How far is too far?"" I liked the idea of the cult and Sweden and all the main aspects of the story, I just don't understand why Ari had to be so chilling with the events of the film. The way they throw bodies around like they mean nothing is disturbing to me. I understand that's how the cult works, but something just felt wrong from a human moral standpoint. How could someone (Ari) have such a sick and twisted mind to come up with a story like this? It bothers and saddens me to know that this movie is being praised by others.<br/><br/>I hope people are able to see this review and possibly rethink their decision to see this film. Yes the acting was great. Yes the trailer made the film look amazing. But are the traumatic scenes you are about to watch worth it for the countless days those images will be burned in your head? To me, it's not worth it."

"aidanalderdice","10","5","8","23 February 2020"," A Masterpiece
","This movie is a PERFECT example of how to build tension. It's slow, it's subtle, it worms it's way into your mind and creates a genuine sense of safety and security. For the first hour, you might even forget you're watching a horror movie. But then, oooooooh but then. I don't want to give a single thing away, but once the story takes a turn, there's an exponentially building sense of dread that doesn't ever go away. Again, it starts off gradual, but ramps up exponentially, until dread turns to fear, turns to horror.<br/><br/>Alien is an effective horror movie not because Xenomorphs are scary by themselves, but rather because they pose a real, tangible, threat to characters that WE care about. Characters that we have a chance to really understand, and grow familiar with, even fond of. So when horrible things happen to them, we're invested not because of the shock value or the jump scare, but because WE don't want them to get hurt. It seems that most ""horror fans"" have forgotten that.<br/><br/>Pacing and writing aside, the film is absolutely gorgeous. Even in the first 10-15 minutes, when scenes take place in normal apartments and bars, there is some really fascinating cinematography at play, and once it gets to Sweden, every shot is breathtaking. The use of symmetry and color is reminiscent of Kubrick, and I mean that as the highest compliment.<br/><br/>The score is fairly understated, as it was in Hereditary, and I think it works even better here than it did there. It's only purpose is to build tension, instill dread. You won't even notice it in the background of most scenes, and often there's actually nothing to notice, but regardless of whether it's completely silent or blaring violins, it always feels appropriate.<br/><br/>Look, I love big, loud, dumb, gory horror movies as much as anyone. Give me over-the-top violence and a paper thin plot, and as long as things keep moving, I'm along for the ride. But I can also appreciate auteur cinema, where a single artist's vision is realized by thousands of actors, camera workers, set designers, etc. And this is exactly that. Anyone who doesn't like the movie, I won't tell you you're wrong. But I'd ask that you at least try to appreciate the work that went into it, on literally every level."

The characters make decisions which are so out of norm that it's frustrating to watch, story is entirely predictable, boring not to say the least and the only thing impressive is the cinematography and Florence Pugh did an amazing job and remains to be the only standout in the movie.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this movie to everyone as it most definitely wasn't cleverly written or maybe I'm just missing the point.<br/><br/>Utterly boring, predictable and forgettable."
"almanac-39178","5","5","8","28 September 2019"," Middling Midsommar
","As a fan of the director's previous feature film, Hereditary, I perhaps expected too much. Basically, the film is too long, too pretentious and too predictable. Before I saw the film I guessed the visiting students would be used by the commune either as human sacrifices or for reproduction, to add to the commune's gene pool. In fact, both of these things happen, with the boyfriend of the main character - in what amounts to a rape scene - being drugged into sex, and everyone else except the main character being killed and burnt in a ceremonial sacrifice.<br/><br/>But the film takes too long to get there. I found my attention wandering quite a few times. What's great about Ari Aster is that he knows horror films made today need to concentrate on atmosphere, and creating striking, disturbing visuals that stay with you. All horror tropes have been done to death by now, so you have to go this way, though it's something plenty of directors don't seem to know. I'm all for slowing things down and not turning a movie into a trashy slasher film, but there's a limit. The foreboding atmosphere in Midsommar isn't strong enough, and the disturbing visuals get lost amid so much padding.<br/><br/>Midsommar isn't a bad film - I get the feeling Aster doesn't have a bad film in him - but it's not overly special. It's just middling."

","Hereditary gave us one of the most visceral performances regarding grief and loss of a loved one with Toni Collette's brilliant portrayal of Annie Graham.<br/><br/>In Midsommar Florence Pugh carries the grief baton Collette handed off with an equally disturbing depiction of familial death.<br/><br/>Collette's guttural wailing at the loss of her daughter in Hereditary was the most striking scene of the movie, somehow overshadowing a close up of said daughters rotting decapitated head on the side of a nondescript road.<br/><br/>Aster continues his unintentional legacy with Midsommar, I cannot praise Pugh enough for her portrayal of a woman who has lost everything in one night. Her gut-wrenching howl will send shivers down my spine forever.<br/><br/>Toni Collette and Florence Pugh were both able to convey two of the most realistic depictions of animalistic grief ever portrayed on film in my opinion. Their performances shook me to my core.<br/><br/>The only logical conclusion is that Ari Aster murdered both of their families in front of them and I implore the LAPD to please look into this case."

I couldn't speak for 10 minutes after stumbling out of that theatre.
So all in all what to expect, you will Go through many emotions, most if not all of them will be negative. You will be disturbed, sad, disgusted, uncomfortable, shocked, anxious. But aside from all that there's something about this movie that keeps you watching eagerly.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I can say I enjoyed this movie. But what the producer was trying to make the viewer feel, I got that. And for that I call this film a huge success. When this movie is held up to Hereditary, it makes the last movie seem like a children's show."

","Psychologically-fragile American college student Dani attends a celebratory midsommar festival in northern Sweden with her graduate student boyfriend, Christian, and his cohorts Josh and Mark. They are invited by Pelle, an exchange student who was raised in an isolated commune there; he explains the celebration occurs only once every ninety years. The festivities are initially harmless, but soon ramp up to disturbing proportions.<br/><br/>Ari Aster's follow-up to ""Hereditary,"" ""Midsommar"" marks a significant tonal shift for the director, but it is in truth a much more aesthetically rich film. Thematically, it is less dense, but the film heaps on hallucinogenic visuals in a manner that leaves the audience feeling as intoxicated as its chemically-induced characters.<br/><br/>When the film hits, it hits hard, and its only real downfall is that it fails to reach a true fever pitch, despite appearing to be heading in that direction. Instead, the dread slowly builds as the film plods toward its dour conclusion. Fans of the classic ""The Wicker Man"" will see plenty in common with this film, and it stands as an obvious reference point for Aster. Part of the film's failure to reach a fever pitch may be due to the relatively unclear motivations of the protagonist, specifically in the final act; while it's clear why she makes the decisions she does, the emotional groundwork for them feels underserved, resulting in a finale that seems slightly shallow.<br/><br/>Despite this downfall, Aster manages to present a lush and intoxicating film that induces dread in a manner that is oppressive and subtly terrifying, leaving the audience quietly sweating in their seats. 8/10."

","Midsommar is a lean and mean take on ""The Wicker Man"", and true to the original story, the visitors are doomed, the inhabitants are evil-doers , and the surroundings are surreal. The fact that Midsommars main cast are in danger from nearly the moment they step foot near the Swedish commune, is impressive, as the films director Ari Aster drops much of the artistic trappings of his last film ""Heredity "", and in return paints a collage of hallucinogenic upheaval, with evil underpinnings. The commune undermines the protagonists fears and desires, to disastrous effect.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it's predictable. The film goes to great lengths to not be typical horror, with many of the kills taking place offscreen, lessening the impact.

I'm sorry.<br/><br/>I am not discrediting the artistry of Ari Aster; he definitely knows what he wants to do, but I don't think he knows quite how to make it 100% unique.<br/><br/>People can say what they want about Darren Aronofski, but that dude has been firing on all cylinders since jump street (Pi). Ari Aster is definitely someone to watch, but I think he needs to establish a better voice for himself.

Given my adoration for hereditary I went and purchased this movie, midsommer, without having seen it before. This movie struck a chord with me in a very different way than hereditary did. This movie physically, emotionally, and spiritually messed me up. The final 20-30 minutes had me feeling disturbed to the point of feeling sick and light headed. I was very confused and disturbed by this movie. There were scenes that were difficult to watch because they made me so uncomfortable. Friends of mine wanted to skip scenes because they made us feel so weird. I've never experienced a movie like this before, so watch with caution. This is not a typical horror movie at all, it's far less horrory and more disturbing. Themes involving dark magic, drugging people, raping people, cannibalism, deliberate inbreeding for the purpose of creating genetically deranged people, human sacrifice, and extremely culty behavior are the key ingredients for this movie. I left the movie extremely disturbed and bothered. This movie is not for everyone. That being said I cannot wait to see what Ari aster comes out with next. This movie was a physical and emotional trip, not for the light hearted. I've been a huge fan of all kinds of horror my whole life and never seen something like this. I felt dirty after watching it, like I'd watched something influential that I shouldn't have seen. Still, i got what i was looking for. But I wonder at what cost. Good luck, viewers."

","This is not for everyone some people will love this movie for its craft while others will think of it as a waste of cinema. Well what did I think? I loved it. The visuals in this film are stunning and the irony make the bizarre viewing even more of an experience. All this dark twisted acts all take place on a nice sunny day. A lot of filmmakers feel as if they have to have dark nasty weather or rely on certain color pallets to get the feel for the movie. The slow takes really makes you feel that you are a part of these characters as they see this cult unravel. There are a lot of scenes that have minimal dialogue giving us the awkward creepiness this story has to show. The violent scenes are realistic and effective yet they do not focus highly on the gore. This is a film that gives you that feeling of paranoia and how just the little bit of acceptance when vulnerable can led you to a dark path. The performances were good. I really liked Florence & Will in particular for her fear turning into revenge worked well while Wills comic tone was a feel of relief. Jack did alright though I feel his character was actually more bland than intriguing which was hard to sympathize towards the end. The movie is a little long but did not drag too much. You are either going to really love & appreciate this film or you are going to hate with a feel of pointlessness"

This movie is NOT for you.<br/><br/>That is not to say that this movie doesn't get your blood pumping because... wow.
It starts off with the most anxiety triggering thing i have seen in a long time and leaves you almost depressed as the movie continues.<br/><br/>Not many horror-related/suspicious things happen until the movie reaches about the halfway-point but it really does keep you hanging on, i did not look away from the screen for one second.<br/><br/>The actors are amazing and you literally feel what they feel. (In spite of Jack Reynor's constant ""deer-in-the-headlights"" look.)
Florence Pugh did so well holding on to the emotion of her role and expressed it in such a way, i have never seen any actor do before. I will definitely look for her name in the future.<br/><br/>The movie in general is a straight up masterpiece, both visually and story-wise and it is rare that we get to see that these days.<br/><br/>This movie is centered around the feeling of helplessness and loss of control. It really feels like you are there, living it. This is also a result of the amazing cinematography this piece contains. From perfect frames that give just the right feel and the creative transitions that really helps give you a sense of stress.

But it shows how people are really afraid and close-minded for the cultural differences. Thus, making a division. Thou, many may have told that it was long-ass boring, it wasn't for me. I find it very interesting all throughout the film with every shot is depicting and making me feel something... The characters also did well with their difference, the only thing that bothered me is that Josh wasn't being cautious enough despite his knowledge to anthropology and this kind of cultures and despite how real they actually performed such ceremonies even to that modern age...I also feel like this kind of culture/system is actually justified to maintain the balance of the society, such as the controlled number of people(attestupa, sacrifices, and breeding,) distribution of works, and their predetermined(maybe not) life path which is also a system that can be found in the modern period. The difference is that somehow in this society there is no economic/social stratification as Pelle said that they are a ""real family"" that shares their own pain, and does not bicker of what's theirs and nots, because they believed that all is from the nature(maybe Pantheism) Thus they give have a unique perspective/understanding for the essence of life and death."

"christianrmaxwell","9","16","36","4 July 2019"," A brilliant and thrilling slice of horror
","Right off the bat, im just gonna say it, this movie is amazing. From the director of the amazing Hereditary comes this nightmare soaked in daylight. While Hereditary was more of a drama movie with horrific aspects, Midsommar plays more like a horror movie with drama about equally as much. This movie had some extremely horrific scenes, some more disturbing than Hereditary. Where this movie shines the most is in its cinematography and acting. The cinematography is just absolutely stunning with some shots that elevated the tension of certain scenes to an unbelievable degree. And with this movie being almost completely drenched in sunlight, the shots are absolutely gorgeous and vibrant, as well as equally horrifying. As far as the acting goes, it is amazing all across the board especially from Florence Pugh who played Dani. She did an excellent job at displaying multiple emotions not even through dialogue but just through facial expressions and actions. The rest of the cast did an excellent job as well, with Jack Reynor playing Christian as another standout. The only minor complaint i have with the movie is the fact that it does not go wild to an extreme degree in the last act like Hereditary did. Instead, this movie had horrifying things happen throughout to even it out. I was just expecting that insane last act like Hereditary but it honestly was not that big of a deal. Ari Aster (the director) did it again with this movie, making a smart and effective horrific movie that puts the human psyche and emotions in center stage. This movie was incredible and i highly recommend any fan of horror to see it."

If you liked the Witch, you might like this, but if you actually want to be scared, go see anything else.<br/><br/>I knew going in that this wasn't a traditional horror movie, and was still disappointed. I was hoping to have some sort of unsettling feeling at some point. I read articles talking about people losing sleep. Are you kidding me? What was supposed to be scary at all? Other than the people who jumped off the cliffs, nothing was even remotely horror. Go watch the wicker man (Nic Cage version) and you'll get an equal amount of scares.<br/><br/>The opening scene set up something that could be super cool, then just completely fell apart after that. I expected some sort of slow burn along the lines of hereditary, but this was more the slow along the lines of ""I wish I had just gone to sleep.""<br/><br/>The cinematography and visuals were good, and the lead girl did a good job, but other than that this movie was awful.<br/><br/>If you get dragged to this film, just watch the first 10 mins and then go hang out in the game room at the theatre and you'll have a much better evening."
"Red_Identity","Null","13","28","3 July 2019"," An unnerving nightmare
","This was a doozy. One thing that you can tell right off the bat is that it feels like an Ari Aster film through and through. To be able to make your distinct voice/vision be apparent with just two films is really impressive, but he achieves it. He's a great director. He knows how to frame scenes, what to shoot, what to capture on camera, what kind of feeling to give. He's an incredibly visceral filmmaker and his strengths are captured here. I don't think this is as complete a picture as Hereditary (that was a near-masterful horror film) as I do think the biggest thing weighing this down is its runtime and sometimes a less clear focus. However, even with that said it's an incredibly impressive film. It's perhaps even less conventionally horror than Hereditary (and if audiences hated that, they will absolutely hate this. My audience hated it) but the entire journey and ride is one very much worth taking. By the end, it also feels very much like Hereditary in both content and style, with an ending that does leave you with the same feeling as Hereditary. Florence Pugh is really great here too. She commands the screen, and it's interesting to see her play this kind of role after Lady Macbeth where she has to give off a very different screen presence."
"anitabphoto","9","14","31","11 July 2019"," Ari Aster knows what he's doing
","If you're expecting another Hereditary, you'll be disappointed. This is more of a drama than a horror movie. With that said, the drama is almost perfectly executed. There were some gimmicky parts, some troubling leftovers from Hereditary that fell flat (the facial deformities, the way women react to grief). Those things felt contrived but they dont take away from the narrative. This is a truly immersive film. When I first walked out of the theater, I gave it a solid 7.5. Days later, I bumped it up to 8.5 because I look back and the whole thing felt like a dream. I think this is what Ari Aster was aiming for and boy, did he succeed. I laughed, felt nauseous, cried, got angry. The highlight of the film was definitely Florence Pugh. Aster has a knack for hiring underrated actresses. She owned the role and I cant think of any other actress her age who could have done it as well as she did."
"rcolgan","8","14","31","6 July 2019"," The Worst Thing to Ever Happen to Swedish Tourism
","We're currently entering a new renaissance in horror, one which has largely been brought on by the many great filmmakers bringing their own unique voices to the genre. There's Jordan Peele who infused the genre with his own brand of social commentary in Get Out, Robert Egger's ability to explore the darker sides of human nature in The Witch and Ari Aster using the genre as a pretense to show us a dysfunctional family dynamic in Hereditary. And Aster continues to keep his horror anchored by his characters in his follow up film, Midsommar.<br/><br/>From the start of the film we're instantly thrown into an uncomfortable situation with Dani (Florence Pugh) and Christian (Jack Reynor) clearly living in a broken relationship. Dani fears that she has become too emotional and overbearing to him regularly calling him in tears, whilst he is just trying to find a way to easily end the relationship and is becoming more distant to her. But when she experiences a tragedy he decides that he can't leave yet and at the objections of his friends invites her to come with them on their planned trip to a Sweedish village.<br/><br/>When they arrive they're embraced by the locals who are about to begin a special festival celebrating life and rebirth and enjoy the scenery where there's always light which causes the days to blend in to one another. At first it seems pleasant, but very quickly this constant light switches from being beautiful to unsettling, to the point where we feel as if we're being drowned in light. It also becomes very clear that these pagan rituals are far more sinister and dangerous than they originally thought they would be and every person in the village is part of it. It's an environment similar to the Wicker Man, where there's a feeling that the threat is so encompassing that there's no way that anyone would be able to escape even if they realise they're in danger.<br/><br/>Ari Aster's strong attention to detail is on display throughout the film with each shot constantly conveying information to us. Shots early on are filled with so many hints as to what is to come, including a mosaic at the start of the film which seems to subtly outline the entire plot of the film. He also shows us so much through just the body language of the characters, with Christian constantly looking to the door whenever he's in the room with Dani always looking for a time to escape.<br/><br/>But one of my favourite touches was early on in the film during a strange drug trip a character mentions how he can feel the world around him breathing. Then throughout the rest of the film, there are moments where it feels the world around starts to move unnaturally like a lung inhaling oxygen. At times it was so subtle I wasn't sure whether it was really happening or if my eyes were just playing tricks on me.<br/><br/>Considering the constant sense of horror which looms over the entire film, there's also a surprising amount of humour throughout. A lot of this humour is brought in by Will Poulter, who seems to be one of the actors with an ability to improve every film he's in. Though there's also a lot of moments during the festivities where I was unsure whether it was being unintentionally funny with the film walking across that thin line between awkward humour and abject horror.<br/><br/>Though unlike Hereditary, which was well paced throughout with the story and character dynamics constantly evolving, the last third of this film does seem to stagnate. We already know exactly what's going to happen to these characters, but it's still stretched out by another 30 minutes of slowly going through the motions of these slow rituals. But even in the films slower moments it's still carried by Aster's distinct visual style and a fantastic lead performance from Florence Pugh, whose traumatic screams capture the same sense of complete anguish that Toni Collette did in Hereditary.<br/><br/>Oddly enough the film does technically have very positive undertones being a story about coming to terms with loss, understanding the cycle of life and the importance of having a strong emotional support structure. It's just that these lessons are told to us through creepy rituals and horrific acts of violence. It's a strange and unsettling film which definitely won't be for everyone, but if you're a fan of Hereditary and want another film which leaves you with a sense of dread then you should give this film a chance."

","How Ari Aster, the man that brought us possibly the best horror flick of modern film in Hereditary churned out this complete nonsense is a mystery equal to that of the building of the pyramids..<br/><br/>It's ridiculous in (many) places, way too long, predictable and our main protagonists are as thick as they are annoying. Those praising the film, ask yourself please, after the first ritual would you really of hung around for more? It just wasn't true to life. I appreciate horror is escapism and delves deeply into the impossible, but the impossible should not extend to human reaction to given situations. What made Hereditary such a great film was the human element, the pure raw emotion that encapsulated the film, it made it believable from a human perspective, this however.. The characters just came across as thick and disinterested. Will Poulter's character for instance. Just completely unlikable and unbelievable. Lets face it, it's getting a lot of trendy love for the director isn't it!<br/><br/>It wasn't all bad. The cinematography was fantastic in places, the soundtrack very similar to Hered's was good, but apart from that..<br/><br/>It even got interesting toward midpoint when one of characters takes photo's of things he shouldn't.. I thought a turning point in the film was coming but disappointingly it just carried on at the same mundane irrelevant pace and slowly, predictably came to its ending act, which I embraced wholeheartedly.<br/><br/>The next time they fill that barn up it needs to be with copies of this DS.<br/><br/>3*'s for it's cinematography, hilarious sex scene and soundtrack.."

","As I read some positive reviews, I wonder if we saw the same movie.
I had no bias at all when I came to watch it, as I chose it randomly, so I didn't even know the plot. It started promising with Dani's family murder, and I expected the movie to develop from that, but it was simply used to justify Dani's panic attacks.
The movie is quite slow, nothing really happens, you sit there waiting for something but you get tiny pieces of relevant things. And when I say tiny, I mean it. You get at most 10min of relevant scenes, and the rest is disposable.
Get ready to see loads of speeches, dancing, bland ceremonies and a plot that does not come together. At the end, you're left with a ""what the heck did I just see?"" feeling, but not in a positive way."

"sagniknath","8","26","65","3 July 2019"," A fantastic simulated acid trip that could have worked more on the narrative
","There is no dearth of critical reviews online hailing this movie as a masterpiece . The verdict seems to be this has surpassed even Aster's previous venture , Hereditary, in terms of sheer brilliance. Well, personally speaking, the film no doubt is something to be not just seen but rather experienced as a trip. 10 minutes of watching Midsommar offers more on the visual psychedelic palette than all the recent jump scare based run of the mill horror movies combined. But I would still rank Hereditary a notch higher than this.<br/><br/>Hereditary still remains the best horror movie I have seen in the last 10 years. In terms of motifs, Midsommar definitely inherits from Hereditary such that fans of the older movie can spot them in the new one again and get the same level of satisfaction. However, Hereditary also had a more structured plot that sets up a lot of subtle things in the beginning and have them pay off very effectively as the film progresses. The conflict established between the central characters of the mother and son, brought on by a family tragedy, serves to properly guide the decisions of the characters . In fact, the film's ending even justifies the namesake Hereditary, without going into spoilers.<br/><br/>In Midsommar, a lot of these tropes seep in as well: the family tragedy, the conflict and misunderstanding between the two lead characters who are supposed to love each other. However, they don't pay off with the same efficiency. While I was being smothered with the crazy beautiful visuals ( and really they are very good ) , I couldn't help but notice that the plot could could have had a better resolution. The characters did not seem guided by motivations that made much sense, save for the black guy and the Swedish friend. The side characters here had very specific traits: the curious academic who is only driven by research ( William Jackson Harper) and the comedian ( Will Poulter). Also, as a graduate student myself, it takes some suspension of disbelief to accept that the lead characters are doctoral researchers. Except for William Jackson Harper, everyone else looked quite young for the character age and acted more like freshmen rather than grad students. But again, this in particular is a minor nitpick.<br/><br/>In terms of praise, I guess the visuals are the top draw. The enchanting camerawork, that seems to fluidly distort space and time, helps sell the idea that the film is meant to be a simulated acid trip centered around a cult in Sweden. There are zero jump scares. The horror element comes from the insinuation that this acid trip started on a high note but gradually descends into profound chaos and dread.<br/><br/>So, on the basis alone of getting to experience an acid trip , I would definitely recommend this movie."
"jackgdemoss","9","19","45","5 July 2019"," The horror genre is changing for the better
","My mind is blown. If the 2010's are not remembered as the horror film renaissance I will be surprised. Midsommar proves that you do not need shocking and clever twists to create a phenomenal film. It's strength lies in its sound design, cinematography, and chilling score, which all serve to highlight the truly unsettling moments that director Ari Aster creates. None of these aspects is nearly as potent without the other. As an example, let us look at the scene where our female lead is kneeled on the ground crying, surrounded by handmaidens. Director and writer Ari Aster can be credited with creating the situation which has our protagonist in so much pain, but also with working the actress to convey the most realistic agony and grief I have ever seen on screen. Lead actress Florence Pugh is to be given credit for this amazing performance, but it cannot be coincidence that both leads in Aster's films have shown heartbreaking performances. There simply must be some method he is using that no other director does as well, to get his actors to portray pain so well. Now that the scene is set, music by The Haxan Cloak envelopes the audience in a sense of urgency and dread with their score. As the music plays and Pugh's character runs into the housing unit with maidens in toe, the camera pans brilliantly with a perfectly timed 180 cut that will set up a truly iconic moment. This scene isn't particularly brilliant from a cinematographic standpoint when compared to other moments in the film where Pawel Pogorzelski controlled the scene with his camera work. Finally, we find Pugh's character crying out in agony over and over again on the floor of the bunkhouse. What makes this scene so chilling and memorable is the 8 or so maidens surrounding her attempting to comfort her by matching her emotions. As Pugh cries out, each maiden cries out in unison, not in tune or pace at first as they try to get the hang of it. After 30 seconds or so, they are in perfect pace and it almost seems as if they are mocking her, but it is absolutely haunting. Midsommar is one of the best horror films ever created and is not for the faint of heart."

","Beautiful artwork however the story was not clear. It's not horror or psychological horror it's more of a film about a cult. We only have a few instances where their religion is slightly comprehensible. The film is laughable, uncomfortable, and oddly cosmic rather than scary. Way too long for it's substance level. Has some disturbing imagery and themes, but unfortunately nothing provocative enough to make me feel anything other than discomfort. I also was not impressed with the lack of emotional weight, I barely saw tears on the main characters' faces. They did not react to their surroundings in a believable way. And characters were killed off and I didn't care. It was simply just weird. If there is meaning behind the scenes-they were not clear. Perhaps this film is more of an inspired acid-trip where you're supposed to feel incomplete and without personality or sense of self when the credits roll."

","After I had watched Aster's movie ""Hereditary"", which I found weird and unsettling, but cheesy in the end, I was not sure about his new movie ""Midsommar"". But when I read the premise, I instantly knew, I had to watch this movie.
The original Wickerman is one of my alltime-favorite movies and I am very fond of pagan rites, so Midsommar was a must. There are also a few concept which have been taken from the Wickerman-reboot, which I also like, because I like trashy movies.
And boy, I was not disappointed. The atmosphere of this movie is everything. The swedish characters are believable, their faith feels true. Sadly, the main characters felt weaker, over-emotional, kind of ""forced following the script"".
Outside of very few gory scenes, the movie ""drowns"" in light and creates an almost pastoral reality, adding the concept of highly specific rituals, which make sense - in a way.
I took the chance and watched the Director's Cut and it enhances the movie's power, but it creates a kind of foreshadowing.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie for people who don't need jumpscares. I also admit, that I don't find any scene truly scary (outside of the first part of the movie, which was quite emotionally brutal). Now I have to go and read Frazer's ""The Golden Bough"" again ..."

","I have nothing against longer films. I really don't. If it's a story that needs to be told in over 2 hours, I'm all for it. Unfortunately, Midsommar is under the impression that it has a bigger, deeper story to tell that it really does and that hurts the film. The odds are, if you've seen more than a handful of horror movies in your day, you'll know where Midsommar is going within the first 30 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>Granted, this isn't always a bad thing. Entire franchises (such as the Friday the 13th series) have been founded on the principal of ""let's give them what they expect with a little something different."" The difference is - these movies know they're not exactly high art and keep things short and sweet before the audience has the chance to catch on that what they're offering up isn't anything terribly new or interesting.<br/><br/>Midsommar starts off well with a solid 1st act in which Dani (a terrific Florence Pugh) still grieving over an incident that robbed her of her entire family. She weasels her way into a Sweden trip with her boyfriend, Christian, and his friends so that they can check out a strange cult-y commune. Once they arrive, they start to get the feeling that things aren't quite right with the people there. Well, I shouldn't say it happens immediately.<br/><br/>In Midsommar's most drawn out act, the audience catches on that this cult is iffy as the lead characters take another 40/50 minutes to figure it out. That said, once the film really gets going, it's great, but it seems like so much time is wasted on silly things (who cares if two friends are trying to do a thesis on the same subject and why do we need to see every single cult ritual in full?)<br/><br/>Ari Aster still has a knack for creating unbearably dark, depressing, and dread-filled horror out of thin air and it's a genuine gift. Hereditary at least had it's old dark house to generate tension, but Midsommar is perhaps the brightest film of the year, so there's nowhere for the terror to hide. In some ways, it's an even greater feat that he managed to create so much apprehension out of otherwise beautiful, scenic views.<br/><br/>All in all, it's an interesting, if frustrating viewing experience. It's recommended."

I lost count the amount of times Florence Pugh's character cries in this movie and I had no sympathy for her as she was just so annoying. And when she's not crying then she's being nice to people any sane person would run the hell away from.

"paulmcuomo","9","15","36","5 July 2019"," Kind of a tough film to review, but easy to rate highly
","Last year, Ari Aster wrote, produced and directed Herditary, which I saw in cinemas and I had a good time with, up until the end. Admittedly, a large amount had to do with me seeing this with an audience of mostly people that weren't engaged in that kind of horror, but also a lot was due to the film kind of wrote itself into a corner by telling you how it was going to end about 20 minutes before it did, and also containing a lot of unintentionally funny moments that kind of ruined the mood.<br/><br/>I bring this up because I was curious to see how this movie would be different. And it was substantially so; first of all, this movie a lot lighter and contains a lot more scope than Hereditary that was so much based around that darkly lit house, and it does use that contrast well in making the landscapes of Sweden seem somewhat idyllic and a great place to be. The grander scope of the cast does actually give Ari a greater focus, impressively. He does have some funny moments, but this time they are more intentional, and therefore don't detract from the story. This is especially evident in the film's ending, which is far more subtle, sinister, and grounded than in Hereditary, whilst also continuing to make excellent use of a soundtrack that is both uplifting and dissonant at the same time.<br/><br/>From the acting, everyone is mostly solid; Will Poulter (arguably the most well known of the cast with the least to do) is a good comic foil for the group, Jack Reynor is great as this distant, somewhat-of-a-prick boyfriend character who is integral to the main theme of the story, which I'll cover in a second, and there are great secondary bit parts in as well. However, both Florence Pugh as Dani, who I've always rated highly as a versatile and intelligent, subtle actress, and who shines in a role that could otherwise have been very monotonous and unlikable, and also Swedish actor Vilhelm Blongren as Pelle, are the true stars. I think they are both early frontrunners for Oscars, especially Blongren, who really does a great job in a role that easily could've been a one dimensional villain, but instead becomes a vision into the future for Dani, and is doing these clearly wrong things, but due to his alliance with the Cult, views it as anything but; because of this, his presence within the story was deeply unnerving.<br/><br/>Now, one important thing to note here, and it's something that knowing about after the film made me appreciate it so much more. This movie is marketed as a cult horror film, but in Aster's own words, this is a break-up movie dressed as a cult horror movie - much like Shaun of the Dead is a Rom-Com dressed as a zombie horror but obviously way more subtle here. The central relationship here, between Dani and Reynor's Christian, is terrible, and throughout it becomes increasingly more obviously broken up, and to see the way it leads towards the ending, it was easy to feel unnerved for how it unfolds - especially as it taps into a major fear of mine - but also points to both of each character's major flaws, in that Dani is looking for affection and Christian is someone who looks to take advantage of people. This fulcrum point for all the horror to revolve around is probably the thing the film does the best, but something that has been underplayed in the advertising, which is a mistake as knowing about it does improve the film significantly in my eyes.<br/><br/>My recommendation, go see this film. Best part is the film is rated 18 here in the UK, which helped me enjoy the film a lot as there's less chance of young groups of kids being there, and there is a lot of intense gore as well. If that's your kind of thing as well, of course."

And, really, it's not hard to see why; all four films were promoted as horrors when they weren't, drawing in audiences who were disappointed that they didn't get what they were expecting. Midsommar is, at best, a thriller, and even that's pushing it. Whereas Hereditary was a study of grief, it undeniably had horror elements, but in Midsommar, apart from one brief moment involving somebody wearing somebody else's skin (don't ask), there's little resembling a horror trope. What it does have in abundance, however, is dread, and as with Hereditary, it's primarily an allegory built on a foundation of generic tropes. Whereas Hereditary dealt with the lengths one may go to shut off emotional pain, Midsommar is more interested in what happens when the initial pain of bereavement starts to wear off, especially when the only person one feels one can turn to isn't exactly sympathetic to one's situation. Aster himself has called it a ""breakup movie"", and it's hard to argue against this. And whilst the characters are underwritten, and the film is painfully predictable (especially if you're familiar with <a href=""/title/tt0070917/"">The Wicker Man (1973)</a>), it's beautifully crafted, brilliantly shot almost entirely in glaring sunlight, and vastly ambitious. And much like <a href=""/title/tt6857112/"">Us (2019)</a>, it avoids the sophomore slump without necessarily knocking it out of the park.<br/><br/>The film begins as Dani (a superb <a href=""/name/nm6073955/"">Florence Pugh</a>) learns her bipolar sister has killed their parents and subsequently committed suicide. Already emotionally fragile and prone to anxiety attacks even before their deaths, Dani turns for support to her boyfriend Christian (<a href=""/name/nm2930503/"">Jack Reynor</a>), an anthropology student struggling to find a topic for his PhD. Christian has wanted to break things off with Dani for some time, as he finds her overly needy, and had been trying to work up to ending the relationship prior to her family dying. The following summer, Dani learns that Christian and fellow students Josh (<a href=""/name/nm2860379/"">William Jackson Harper</a>) and Mark (<a href=""/name/nm2401020/"">Will Poulter</a>) have been invited by Swedish student Pelle (<a href=""/name/nm9859585/"">Vilhelm Blomgren</a>) to his ancestral pagan commune in HÃ¥rga, where a midsummer celebration that only occurs once every ninety years will be taking place. Dani is upset that Christian didn't tell her about the trip, and to placate her, he invites her to come, never imagining she will say yes. But she does. And it doesn't take long, for the visitors to learn that something isn't right in the commune.<br/><br/>As Aster has said, Midsommar is really a breakup movie, with Christian as a classic manipulator. For example, after Dani learns about the trip, she's understandably upset that he didn't tell her, but in the space of a couple of minutes he manipulates her into apologising to him. The core of the story is her slowly coming to realise that he isn't the man she thought he was, and in a weird way, it's a variation on the female revenge genre. In this sense, it's primarily an allegory for the process of a young woman's emotional/spiritual awakening. Indeed, one could take this even further if one reads the character names as symbolic; Dani's surname is Ardor, but she's denied love, and in the paganism of the commune, she's offered something she can't get from a self-serving Christian(ity).<br/><br/>Aesthetically, the film looks terrific. Whereas the US scenes are dark and confined, taking place in small poorly lit rooms with the characters wearing drab costumes, once the film shifts to Sweden, the visual design changes completely. <a href=""/name/nm7346609/"">Henrik Svensson</a>'s production design emphasises an open-plan vastness with unlimited space to move, but few places to hide; <a href=""/name/nm1850507/"">Pawel Pogorzelski</a>'s cinematography drenches everything in glaring sunlight; and <a href=""/name/nm0281893/"">Andrea Flesch</a>'s costume design focuses on brilliant white. Indeed, the attention to detail in the presentation of the commune is immensely impressive; the long middle act doesn't really feature much in the way of narrative incident, but it does a fine job of creating a milieu that feels authentic and lived-in.<br/><br/>There are also some nice individual moments. For example, the choral singing with which the film begins is harshly interrupted by a telephone ringing, suggesting the clash between tradition and modernity; Dani's hysterical crying upon learning of her family's deaths blends with <a href=""/name/nm6438644/"">The Haxan Cloak</a>'s discordant music; a superb single-take shot takes Dani from heading to her apartment bathroom to entering the bathroom of an airplane; a high altitude shot showing a car travelling along a country road is imbued with malevolent undercurrent as the car passes under the camera, but rather than turning around to pick the vehicle up on the reverse angle, the camera follows the car by turning downwards, ending up upside-down.<br/><br/>In terms of the narrative design, somewhat unusually, the film wears its predictability on its sleeve, with many of the major narrative beats not only foreshadowed but literally shown to the audience prior to occurring in the story, whether it be the mural that opens the film or the illustrations seen on the walls all over the commune. With that in mind, anyone who has seen any folk horror will be able to predict much of what happens. Even if you're only familiar with The Wicker Man, you'll still be able to take a decent stab at how things turn out.<br/><br/>As for the acting, much as Hereditary was <a href=""/name/nm0001057/"">Toni Collette</a>'s, Midsommar belongs entirely to Florence Pugh. For most of the film, she's on the precipice of a nervous breakdown, with her performance redolent of <a href=""/name/nm0001167/"">Shelley Duvall</a> in <a href=""/title/tt0081505/"">The Shining (1980)</a>. This is easily her best and most layered performance thus far, especially the gamut of contradictory emotions she runs in the insane last 20 minutes. Elsewhere, the performances are all fine, but the actors aren't helped by the script. As Christian, Jack Reynor is the least convincing academic ever put on screen, although he does do a decent job of getting the audience to loathe his passive-aggressive persona. Will Poulter plays Mark as the kind of ignorant sex-crazed loudmouth that seems to only exist in the movies. As Josh, William Jackson Harper barely registers, whilst Vilhelm Blomgren's Pelle is so obviously untrustworthy that it pushes suspension of disbelief to breaking point.<br/><br/>As this might suggest, one of the biggest problems with the film is the underwritten characters. Additionally, Dani and Christian's relationship is demarcated along stereotypical lines - the emotional female whose need for support becomes overwhelming and the thoughtless bro who is more interested in hanging out with the boys. Another issue is that even aside from the character of Pelle, the film pushes suspension of disbelief too far. There are multiple moments when the goings-on should prompt the visitors to leave immediately, but they repeatedly accept the most ridiculous of situations based upon the most tenuous of explanations. Indeed, in a lot of ways, they're no different from the idiots who get picked off one-by-one in so many cheap slasher films.<br/><br/>Additionally, as already mentioned, there are few surprises here. Aster is obviously a big fan of folk horror, but he allows reverence to the tropes supersede narrative inventiveness, leading to predictability. Also, as in Hereditary, the explanation for what's going on isn't anywhere near as interesting as the ambiguity preceding it.<br/><br/>That said, however, I did enjoy Midsommar. Aesthetically impressive, and built on a terrific central performance, it could be cited as an example of a filmmaker whose ambitions outweigh his abilities, but ultimately, Aster's mastery of tone sees him through. The script could use some work, no doubt, but the ominous sense of dread is palpable throughout and is brilliantly handled, whilst the depiction of the death throes of a toxic relationship is as penetrating and emotionally honest as any ostensible relationship drama. Unnerving and audacious, Midsommar is an exceptionally confident piece of filmmaking, if not necessarily an exceptional piece of filmmaking."

"cristiandeiana","3","5","9","8 April 2020"," What has been seen cannot be unseen
","After watching Midsommar I feel somewhat conflicted, on the one hand it's a beautiful work of art, very cinematic and it delivers on quite a few levels. However I can't deny that it's a horrific experience and not necessarily in a good way, the ending chapter of the movie is hard to watch and overall the narrative is awful. The style of horror in Midsommar reminds me of watching some other atrocities such as Hostel (2005) where the movie is centred on gore/torture type of horror which I've never understood how people can enjoy. I think that using horror in such a way is just an excuse for a poor narrative and ultimately is where the movie fails.<br/><br/>I do want to mention however some of the areas where Midsommar triumphs. The overall casting/acting is excellent, in particular that of Florence Pugh (Dani). As the main protagonist her character is given a lot of depth and is portrayed very well. There's also interesting and complex relationships between the characters throughout the movie, however this is ultimately ruined by all of the characters being killed off or drugged to the point that they can't even speak.<br/><br/>This is where again I am conflicted, I want to give an honest rating to this movie where the reviews are so polarised as I can see many good and bad things about it. I have to be honest and say that overall as a movie it fails, the narrative is very poor, would I watch this again absolutely not. The final chapter of the movie was so bad it leaves a bad taste in your mouth with some scenes so horrific you'll feel like you wished you hadn't seen them. There's no underlying deep message or allegory to take away from this it's just horror for horror's sake and I know some people like that sort of thing but it's just not for me. However I do feel like the cinematography, acting deserves some merit which alone might be worth a watch, other than that it's utter garbage."

","The cinema was nice but that was it. I'll try to phrase it nicely below but this movie was an absolute bore and a checklist of tropes and cliches
I remember when I saw the very first preview, the day it came out andd I said ""that looks like teen based Wicker Man""
Sitting at a lengthy 2.5 hours I was hoping for quite a deep dive of cult horror.
The cinematography was wonderful, great pans of landscapes and scenery. The location of filming was gorgeous and the frame work was excellent. All of it well directed as seems to be Ari Aster's forte
The lore is strangely shallow for it's length. What they had was interesting and convincing for the cult. The convictions and ideals were fun to hear about but ultimately could have been fleshed out more.
The acting was acceptable even tho all of the characters were unlikable and tremendously oblivious to any danger. Character creation seems to be a weakness for Ari. I do hope to see more of the female lead, Florence Pugh, in more roles in the future. She did great in her part but was restricted by the character.
Overall, this was everything I expected it to be to a T. It's not that it was a bad movie it was just the exact formula that you would expect from the preview. And as I thought, it was essentially teen based Wicker Man. I feel like I've seen this movie before and nothing super new was brought to the table.
It also could have been very easily 30-40 minutes shorter.
I did enjoy it far more than Hereditary. I can see why people got excited about it and I hope Ari keeps pushing out big hitters to help the genre out. Both his movies brought a ton of attention to the horror world and that's great! but I think I'll pass on his future movies."

Her screams resonates within us. What makes it even more powerful is when the village shares her anxiety, when they feel her pain and validates it by amplifiyng it.
The gore scenes were pure art, we could share the intoxications and the trips being presented infront of us.
I do not have a bad thing to say about this movie, altough I feel bad for the second main character to be concious during the fire of the temple.

Sadly the film stretches a story which should be 45 minutes shorter. There are too many wasteful or drawn out scenes and it more frustrates than intrigues.<br/><br/>There other issue is its unoriginal storyline. The main set up feels like a slasher movie while the theme is very much The Wicker Man, from the surrealism and the ending, it all lifted from the 1973 classic. The predictable 'friends dying one at a time' didn't help either.<br/><br/>I still give this film 7/10 based on the fact that it is entertaining, the performances are very good, looks great and mood is quite unique for a modern horror.

I was hoping for an amazing plot twist at the ends, but the story just ended and the credits started to roll.<br/><br/>There was a lot they could have done with this story, but they didn't do anything with it."
"davidmvining","7","4","7","29 January 2020"," Entertaining and intelligent, even if it meanders more than it should
","I don't like really comparing films, but I think it's unavoidable to do that between Midsommar and Ari Aster's first film, Hereditary. Not only are they stylistically very similar, but they deal with very similar subjects (cults) and end on very, very similar notes. I think Aster's first film is the better of the two, though. It's not because it came first, but it's because the first film is more focused and clear headed about its narrative.<br/><br/>Dani and Christian are on the verge of breaking up when Dani's sister kills herself and their parents. Suddenly, the relationship that has been on autopilot for a while is going to keep going for a while longer. Neither is happy with the other, but they stay with it out of inertia's sake. When Christian gets invited to go to Sweden to accompany his classmate Josh on a research trip to see a unique midsummer festival, Christian halfheartedly invites Dani along, expecting her to decline. But, she doesn't. She goes out of the inertia and in order to get away from her depressing life, spent all day in bed and pondering the deaths of her family.<br/><br/>This early part of the film is easily the best. The prologue, up to the deaths, is fantastic filmmaking and could almost stand alone as its own short film. The lead up to the trip is also quite good, with delicate balances in performances that tell clearly, in a very realistic way, the uncomfortableness around the relationship not just between the two directly involved but the friend circle as well.<br/><br/>It's once they get to Sweden that things unravel a bit. You see, Aster has said that he didn't care about the cult aspects of the film, preferring to think of it as a metaphor for breaking up. I think the metaphor works, but he gets really lost in the weeds of the cult and the particulars of the ceremonies at the nine day festival. For a solid half hour or so, we get almost nothing but details of the cult, both visually and through dialogue. It's interesting, but not interesting enough to carry the film as a whole.<br/><br/>And the cult is into some weird stuff. The two elders throw themselves off a cliff at the start. There's obvious drug consumption in the form of drinks and the inhaling of smoke. There's a deformed and inbred person of supposed clarity that writes their sacred books in a series of runes with very specific rules (that we get told). There's a ritualized sexual process where Christian gets hoped up on stuff and impregnates one of the Swedish girls (because of his astrological sign), surrounded by a dozen naked women who chant, sing, and push him a bit, physically that is. And people start going missing.<br/><br/>The relationship between text and subtext can be a tricky one. In the pursuit of subtext, an artist could sacrifice some elements of the text in the process. The logic of the rest of the outsiders staying at the festival as people start disappearing in mysterious circumstances gets thin, perhaps a bit too thin at times, but they all need to stay so that Dani can go through her breakup process. In a way, she casts off first the strangers that arrived with them at the festival, then the friends she likes the least, then the ones she likes the most (which isn't very much) until finally she literally sends Christian to meet his end.<br/><br/>I think the subtext of this film gets lost for a while, but when it comes back, it's at the movie's textual height of horror. As a quick side note: I say horror not because the film is actually scary (it's more disturbing than anything else) but because the characters are meeting horror. We may not share the emotion, but we can understand the emotion running through them.<br/><br/>The plot resolution (fine...SPOILERS for both this and Hereditary since they're both so new) comes when Dani, having been crowned May Queen (in a process that may or may not have been rigged) decides that Christian is going to be the ninth of nine sacrifices to the heathen gods of the festival. He gets sewn up into a bear carcass, drugged out, placed in a sacred hut with the other eight, and set on fire. As Dani watches the flames go up, she smiles for the first time in at least half an hour of movie time. She's been through hell, the metaphor of her breakup, finding surprising support at the cult, and she embraces it as the flames take her crappy boyfriend up. It's pretty close to the ending of Hereditary when Peter finds the satanic cult in his treehouse and implicitly decides to lead them.<br/><br/>Spoilers over.<br/><br/>I actually quite liked the film, though it does feel like a step down from Aster's first film. The idea of the thirty minute longer director's cut, though, confuses me. Maybe it's filled with more relationship stuff that deepens the characters more, but I imagine that it's actually more cult stuff than anything else. I'll check it out some day and see for myself, but I just can't imagine that this movie (which is already overlong) would benefit from another thirty minutes.<br/><br/>Still, I got into it for enough of the film, and I really like what Dani goes through, even if it does get lost a bit for a time."

","I had read good things about it, and curiosity kept me going until the very end, but then it felt like I spent 165 minutes watching A Space Odyssey's monkeys crushing bones (minus the metaphor)...<br/><br/>In other words: nicely shot, but hollow, and not scary or suspenseful in the least (since it was supposed to be horror movie, right?). Story and plot are basically non-existent, scares and thrills are simply not there, the pace is slow, characters are undeveloped mono-dimensional cardboard figures...

"darkolazicbg","4","4","7","22 October 2019"," Just my opinion
","Characters are seriosly underdeveloped. Trough the movie they dont learn anything nor they become better people. Because of that everything from start to the part when they come to the commune could be cut off and not a single thing would change. It does not add to the story or to the characters. I dont care about any of them nor i feel any remorse for death of any of them. Two of them even just show at random and we dont learn anythin about them except that they are engaged (thats super important to the story)<br/><br/>As for a story, its what critics call ""and then movie"" visuals are stuning but story is non existant. Its an ""artsy movie"" but even they can have a story. Its not fluid its just a number of scenes that comes and go with a nice
scenery in the back. It could be cut to 90mins easy.<br/><br/>Someone said its a breake up ""fairy tale"" only thing breaking was my patience with this movie.<br/><br/>You know that movies The Village and Wickerman with Nicolas Cage? Yeah, go watch that instead. And the end, oh wow, i said to my wife, well atleas Cage got an dignifiedly death.<br/><br/>

"Mike_O_Dwyer","3","4","7","13 October 2019"," Disappointingly Silly
","Like 'Mother' and 'The Wicker Man' this sets itself up as a modern day strangers-in-a-strange-land fable, but unlike those two films the weirdness feels silly because it's trying to hard.<br/><br/>Florence Pugh's 'Dani' is about to be dumped by Jack Reynor's 'Christian', egged on by his friends who see her as being manipulatively needy; her sister has mental health issues and Dani is distraught when she can't be contacted, something that seems to happen regularly. This accomplishes two things: it provides us with an overcooked and unnecessarily long prologue; shows us Will Poulter can ham it up with the best of them, and Jack Reynor is working from a limited range of woodeness to emote from.<br/><br/>It's an undeniably pretty film in terms of visuals, there's something Wes Anderson about the composition and stylistic flourishes but none of the wit and humour. It drags. Things really begin when Dani and her companions travel to Sweden at the invitation of a friend to witness a Midsommar festival in a remote part of the country, apparently it only takes place every 90 years - although why is never fully explained.<br/><br/>Dani and her 'friends' witness some odd behaviour, but for the most part they carry on even when others disappear - because if they were wearing red shirts in a star trek film it wouldn't be more obvious that that was the only reason they were in the film. Other characters, like Will Poulter and William Jackson Harper, also do dumb stuff because they have to in order to move the 'plot' along. This is a story that is so desperately contrived that every dramatic turn is signposted so far in advance that it's a trudge waiting for the consequences to be delivered.<br/><br/>At two and a half hours it's far too much for Florenece Pugh to carry on her own. As good as she is in giving some emotional heft at the start of the film, that all dissipates rapidly once the dumbness of the middle act takes hold, and by the final act I didn't care about anyone involved.<br/><br/>A pity."

"bijanadhikari","3","4","7","29 September 2019"," Style over substance
","It started really strong and I was beginning to get invested a lot. Especially due to the visuals and cinematography which was top notch. But the characters were so dumb and poorly written that it made no sense by the end about what the director vision was? Was he telling that cult is bad because pretty sure murdering 8 people while drugging them is not supposed to be enticing. Was he trying to say that anxiety or heartbreak can be overcome by joining a cult and burning your boyfriend alive? Yeah you can say he dint treat her right but the only worst thing I saw him do to her was miss her birthday. I couldn't understand the point of Dani's character. She is not a sociopath at the start but apparently dancing around with a group of women and being made a queen is all it takes. I also understand the she got a family in the end but even then this film is so self indulgent for the ending that it made no sense. Very poorly executed storyline. And the boys in this film are just a bunch of morons. They are just a plot point director uses to show how masculinity is bad and will get you killed while he glorifies a cult of people who have no hesitant in killing people. And never mind Pelle who is supposed to be the nice guy in the movie who brings his friends knowing they will get sacrificed has the most happy ending. Overall I dont get what the director thought when he wrote this film. I mean sure it has some amazing work camera and visual works but it genuinely feels like sadistic film with no real characters. Not saying you can't make a good film with that, just look at Shining. But like Kubrick you need to execute it perfectly or else you have a film with no real substance which unfortunately this film is."

","A lot of horror movies try to freak you out. A lot of horror movies try to disturb you. But not many horror movies try to blow your mind and are so beautiful. Midsommar by Ari Aster is definitely the mind-blowing and beautiful category, which is incredibly rare.<br/><br/>Midsommar is arthouse horror. Much like Eli Roth's Hostel duology, it's has some heavy stuff about culture clash. However, it is much less gross and sadistic.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is ethereal, especially when they arrive in the commune.<br/><br/>The characters are a bit interesting. Florence Pugh should get an award for her performance and the European cast are all great. Will Poulter's character I just was repulsed by as he was so disrespectful towards another culture and society. The other two guys are okay (Jack Reynor and William Jackson Harper) and I wish there was more development between the two of them.<br/><br/>The cinematography is great, almost Kubrickian in appearance. I really thought it was impressive that the film is shot like it's almost taking place over the course of one day and you never see the sun. It adds to the feel of disorientation and underlying darkness of the film.<br/><br/>Now, the pacing for the film is quite slow and the horrors are subtle. The climax is disturbing and chilling and worth the wait. However, the wait is not for everyone, as there are some really slow scenes. Also, if you got the Director's cut on iTunes, be prepared for more longer and slower scenes.<br/><br/>Pros:
<ul><li>Gorgeous camera work and set design</li><li>Great acting</li><li>Ethereal Music</li><li>Good disturbing scenes of horror</li></ul><br/><br/>Cons:
<ul><li>Incredibly slow pace</li><li>Will Poulter's character is a butthead</li><li>Director's Cut has no subtitles and the dialogue is a little hard to follow without them</li></ul><br/><br/>Also, fans of Robin Hardy's legendary film about sacrifice and cults 'The Wicker Man' will probably complain about this film being an arthouse copy of it."

","Directed by Ari Aster. Starring Florence Pugh, Jack Reynor, Vilhelm Blomgren, Will Poulter, William Jackson Harper, Hampus Hallberg, Archie Madekwe, Ellora Torchia, Anna Åström. (R)<br/><br/>Following up his take-notice debut, ""Hereditary,"" director Astor tackles folk-horror alongside an emotional/spiritual awakening parable. Reeling from a family tragedy, Pugh (in an effective performance) joins her emotionally-distant boyfriend, Reynor, and three of his buddies on a trip to Sweden to take part in a midsummer festival taking place at Blomgren's ancestral home commune. Aster's mastery of subtle tension-building and lingering ideas and imagery are on full display here once more; flawed as it is, this movie sticks to your ribs and gives you plenty of things to ponder and itch about afterward, as well as numerous indelible film frames that are hard to shake. The combination of hallucinogenics and gaslighting only makes the sensation all the more eerie and discomforting for Pugh and her crew. Long but never dull, the main criticism with the movie is in the wrap-up; it's not that it's as fearlessly mad/contentious a jump as the one that occurred in the final reel of his last film, but rather it's somewhat underwhelming, especially considering how close it comes to simply ripping off another well-known folk horror movie (no spoilers, but you can probably guess). Still, while you may walk out feeling a little let down after the oft-mesmerizing first two hours, don't be surprised if the film's ideas and allegories keep filling your head for days after.<br/><br/>82/100"

I wasn't sure if I was watching 1973's ""The Wicker Man"", an episode of ""Heidi"", a Nazi rally, the film ""Shrooms"" or the ""Blair witch project"". And as each crazy idea unfolded and we, the viewer, were treated to more outlandish ceremonies I began to realise that the film was going nowhere. Use of the elder futhark piqued my interest as I have studied it and know the order of the Aetts and the meanings of each symbol but then I found myself cringing at the inaccuracy portrayed in this film. Subplots went nowhere, everything was bright and crisp and loud with no nuance. An hour and a half in and I was watching the clock, bored out of my mind by more unnecessary and gratuitous gore, hoping the whole thing would end soon. By the time we got to the May Queen dance and the unfortunate sex ritual I was practically howling with laughter at the absurdity, and simultaneously climbing the walls with sheer ennui. It was fast becoming a case of ""Now what??"" towards the end and as our hero burnt to death in a wooden pyramid surrounded by the other eight sacrifices I was almost wiping away tears of laughter and relief.<br/><br/>I won't even mention the bear....LOL<br/><br/>

It's a story about a fictional teutonic cult that celebrate a nativ cult ritual, which happens to occur every 90 years. Beginning with some drug intoxication, many people may guess where it ends. This is a very bright and friedly atmosphered horror movie, which becomes bloody, and visually clearly gory in several scenes. The story slowly developes and progresses over the whole playtime. The characters slide into the story deeper and deeper and that's not only because of the acting, the technical aspects of that movie allow the audience, to easily glide into the storyflow. There are many strong visual scenes, that match with a hypnotic score. So the hole movie slows the audience down while telling the story. It didn't really feel like 2 hours and 27 minutes, because I was so slowed down myself.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call it a real new invention of the horror gere. There are some pretty good horror movies that formerly were made in Scandinavia. 'Midsommar' is not really an excellent movie, but also not mediocre. I've seen a bunch of compareable movies before.

","The film lacks real suspense because it denies the characters intelligence. These insular groups similar to the Amish send at least some of their youth out into the outside world for a period, and so they are not naïve to outside norms. So there is no reason for much of what you see in the film where they pay no heed to spooking their guests. This was done much better in the Wickerman where it was all part of a grand plan, in this film instead of a plan you have ""I'm horrified screaming"" to take up space where content should be. The pagan world building of the original Wicker man had far more depth than this film where everything is just a façade, where the people are playing nothing more than weird zombie white people. But I guess this fits the new Hollywood quota of woke ""look at those crazy white people"" level writing, the why no longer matters.

"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","9","5","10","6 July 2019"," A brightly sunny and bleak destruction of toxic relationships
","Beginning in the grey snowy America, an emotionally troubled Dani is struck by the death of her family. And before that she is having relationship problems with her boyfriend Christian, a guy who does the bare minimum to be emotionally supportive for her. In an effort to avoid to having an ugly breakup, Christian invites her to his guys-only trip in a remote Swedish community. There the seeds of their relationship's end take root while the horror shows itself in broad daylight.<br/><br/>While Ari Aster last movie Hereditary was about grief and psychological pain consuming us, Midsommar is about releasing it in a chaotic and destructive fashion in order to heal. As the characters continue to learn about the bizarre and somewhat disturbing traditions of the pagan community called the Hagra, Dani struggles to keep her emotions in check to avoid humiliating Christian. To Christian and his college buddies the Hagra's approach to death, marriage and tradition seem alien to them as Americans. Dani, however, begins to see their connection as a community may actually be more psychologically healthy compared to her own relationship.<br/><br/>The surprising thing about Midsommar is how Aster makes it feel different to Hereditary. Aster shows to have great comedic timing as a director to show the American's oblivious and ignorant behaviour to the Hagra's traditions. He also relies more on the use of bright daylight and exterior wide shots as opposed to Hereditary's dark claustrophobic feel thanks to his returning cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski. The almost heavenly-like sunlight exposes the weird and surreal elements that make the little community feel uncomfortably otherworldly. And it reveals in full glory beautiful set decorations made by Henrik Svensson that creepily foreshadows the disturbing events to come if you look very closely. And the score by Bobby Krlicis is surprisingly beautiful and majestic at times in an otherwise disturbing movie.<br/><br/>Florence Pugh (the only few good things from Outlaw King) stands out as her emotional performance leaves you heartbroken. Pugh plays Dani as someone who acts calm and sane to avoid public humilation but her performance comes out in full force when she lets her character cry out her emotional pain and anger. On the other side of the relationship, Jack Reynor portrays Christian with subtly as a guy who feels trapped in a bad relationship but lazily tries to play the role of a sympathetic partner. Reynor makes Christian seem relatable at first but then later displays how manipulative he can be to avoid taking responsibility. Will Poultier surprises as the culturally ignorant and sexist Mark whom most of the movie's comedy comes out.<br/><br/>While the examination of Dani and Christian's toxic relationship is what elevates the story, the movie's plot is a very standard horror. Most of the twists and surprises are ones would you actually expect in a horror movie. And since Midsommar is very straightforward the long runtime is definitely felt by the last quarter and you get to a point of just wanting to get to the big finale.<br/><br/>Like many other art-house horror films, Midsommar is not for the mainstream audience. It is a slow burn with plenty of gruesome imagery and acts of violence to make you feel uncomfortable and disgusted. But it is also one that has a lot of smart humor to not make the bleakness feel too overwhelming and worth talking about its examination of relationships and cultural appropriation."

"ericamc77","2","6","13","28 January 2020"," Not for me
","I'm giving this film two stars because it does have lovely cinematography and decent editing. Much like this writer-director's film, Hereditary, the plot lacks any type of character development or believability. It's trying to be original, but instead gets caught up being gruesome for shock value alone. There are certainly recurring themes, such as life and death, bereavement and lust vs. love. But if any one of those themes had been thoroughly fleshed out, this film would have been better. I feel like the director has something to say but hides behind ""snuff"" style visuals. As a filmmaker, wouldn't you want your viewers leaving the theater feeling haunted rather than nauseous?"

"jboothmillard","5","13","35","14 July 2019"," Midsommar
","This scary movie was becoming something of a talking point before I even saw a trailer, and when I did it looked like a Wicker Man style movie, I was definitely looking forward to it, written and directed by Ari Aster (Hereditary). Basically, college student Dani Ardor (Lady Macbeth's Florence Pugh) suffers from severe emotional trauma during winter, after her sister kills their parents and commits suicide, flooding the house with carbon monoxide from a car. This trauma adds further pressure to her relationship with her anthropology graduate student boyfriend Christian Hughes (Jack Reynor), who is already emotionally distant. The following summer, Dani attends a party with Christian and friends Mark (Will Poulter) and Josh (William Jackson Harper). Christian and his friends are invited to attend a midsummer celebration in Hälsingland, Sweden, by their Swedish friend Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren). It only occurs once every ninety years at Pelle's ancestral commune, the Hårga. Dani finds out about the trip, and Christian awkwardly invites her to join them. The group arrives at the commune and together they take a psilocybin concoction offered by Pelle's brother, Ingemar (Hampus Hallberg). They also meet English couple Simon (Archie Madekwe) and Connie (Ellora Torchia), they were invited to attend the festivities by Ingemar. The psilocybin causes Dani to have a bad trip and she hallucinates about her dead sister. The group are initially accepting of the commune's peaceful if strange nature, routines and rituals. But then tensions rise after Pelle brings them to witness an ättestupa ritual in which the two elderly commune members commit senicide by leaping from a clifftop. When the male elder fails to die as a result of the fall, several members crush his skull with a mallet. The group are disturbed after witnessing this ritual, but they decide to stay, at the behest of Pelle, and because Josh is writing a thesis about the Hårga. The next day, Simon and Connie disappear, but the group is assured they were taken to the train station. Christian decides to copy Josh's thesis on the Hårga, causing a rift between them. Josh wants more information from an elder on the commune's ancient runic practices, which are based on paintings made by Ruben (Levente Puczko-Smith), a deformed member selectively born incestuously, he is considered an oracle. Mark unwittingly urinates on an ancestral tree where ashes are scattered, he is scolded by Ulf (Henrik Norlen), and later lured away by a female member, never to be seen again. That night, Josh sneaks into a temple to photograph scriptures in a mysterious book, he is distracted by a partially nude man wearing Mark's skinned face, he is hit over the head with a hammer and dragged away. The next day Dani is invited to partake a maypole dancing competition, all taking part must continue dancing until they fall and are eliminated. At the same time, Christian is drugged and groomed to participate in a ritual in which he impregnates virginal commune member Maja (Isabelle Grill) whilst being watched and surrounded by naked female elders. Dani wins the competition and is crowned the ""May Queen"". Following her victory, she discovers Christian having sex with Maja, she has a panic attack, she is surrounded by several of the Hårga women who wail with her. A disoriented Christian realises what is going on, he runs out naked and hides in a shed, there he discovers Josh's leg, and Simon who has been ritually dismembered as a blood eagle. Christian is found by an elder and then paralyzed with an unknown drug. The cult explains that, at the conclusion of the ritual, nine human sacrifices must be offered. The first four victims are outsiders, therefore Josh, Mark, Connie, and Simon. The next four victims are cult members, two senicide elders, a still-living Ingemar, and a second living volunteer. As the May Queen, Dani must choose the ninth and final victim, either an outsider or a lottery-selected cult member. Bitter and heartbroken, Dani chooses to sacrifice Christian. He is stuffed into a disembowelled brown bear and placed in a yellow temple alongside the other sacrifices. The temple is filled with straw bales and set alight; the cult celebrates the completion of their ritual. Dani at first sobs in horror but gradually begins to smile. Also starring Anna Åström as Karin, Gunnel Fred as Siv, Julia Ragnarsson as Inga, Liv Mjönes as Ulla, Gabi Fon as Dani's Mother, and Zsolt Bojári as Dani's Father. Pugh gives a good performance as the emotionally damaged young woman, Reynor is reasonable as her unworthy boyfriend, and Poulter and other supporting cast members do well also. It is very simple, people brought to a secluded location to be carefree, with a pagan cult behaving strangely and slowly becoming more suspicious and sinister, the twist here is that it in a location where the sun never sets, you can see obvious similarities to The Wicker Man, it is perhaps a little too long, and as a ""slow burner"" it is maybe too slow at times, but the continuing strangeness, occasional shocks and tension keeps going, a reasonable folk horror. Worth watching!"

","When I found out this movie was made by the same director who made one of the better horror movies of this millennium, HEREDITARY, I was instantly hyped to go see this as well!<br/><br/>I was disappointed.<br/><br/>Just by looking at the press material the similarities to THE WICKER MAN were a bit too obvious, but I didn't let that fool me, nor did I even watch the trailer - I hoped the similarities would be just thematic and the content would be fully original... I was wrong. Sure, this movie has its original(ish) moments, but it ends up crossing with THE WICKER MAN way too much. It frustrates me that Ari Aster could have made this so much better if he had made some different and especially original solutions. Almost everything in this movie is very predictable.<br/><br/>The beginning of this movie is actually very good and in its slow way it gives promise of good things to come, but then we end up with re-imagining of THE WICKER MAN. This is 2,5 hour movie and they say they cut 30 mins off from it to meet the R-rating. Was that 30 mins all the good stuff from it?! This movie is not scary at all. It has like 1 bigger gore scene and few other gruesomish moments, plus 1 laugh-out-loud scene.<br/><br/>That is just not enough, Ari Aster! You had a good idea, but ended up with a rehash of things we've already seen. A great ending could have saved this, but no, u rewrote almost the same ending as in ur previous movie HEREDITARY and mixed it with, u guessed it, THE WICKER MAN, to make one of the most anti-climatic endings ever.<br/><br/>A lot of people praise the great cinematography - I didn't notice anything ultra beautiful in it. The only thing I did notice was the great camera work/tricks during the 1st quarter of the movie, then they sort of disappeared.<br/><br/>And I didn't like Jack Reynor's acting.

The same should be done for the pretentious and artsy style of some scenes.

"zaywhat","7","3","5","3 January 2020"," A well formed horror
","Some spoilers here. So this is a ""strange community"" horror, like Children of the Corn but without the evil deity figure. The movie gives a colorful and plausible depiction of a naturalist community, ie. Druids or similar whose rituals are based on the seasons, plants and animals. That gives the horror a base, a backstory that makes the overall story a little better than say, Hereditary, which just sort of dumped a supernatural explanation on the audience at the end.<br/><br/>The psychopathic disregard for outsiders is the main horror feature. Real insular communities are said to bring in strangers for the DNA diversity for breeding so that part is realistic. The end of life ritual is interesting and not unrealistic considering cultures that starve out elders in times of hardship. This was just a step further. The rest of the treatment of outsiders wasn't really explained or of some obvious value to the community. The human vivisection in the chicken coop suggested the person was still alive and several visitors just disappeared with just a flimsy excuse to the remaining. I suspected that the ""pilgrimage"" process mentioned was basically this, to go out and bring back some sacrifices. So the story didn't quite tie up the loose ends but the rich visuals and vocals of the people presented a better basis for the story than many horror movies."
"Sankari_Suomi","4","3","5","8 October 2019"," Robin Hardy rolls in his grave
","The latest attempt at a 21st century incarnation of The Wicker Man. It fails spectacularly, because the last person who knew how to do what Robin Hardy did in 1973 was Robin Hardy, and nobody ever had the decency to ask him. Also, he died in 2016.<br/><br/>Let's start with the good points: (a) cinematography; it's visually stunning, and Florence H. Pugh looks gorgeous; (b) music; it's bold, evocative, and atmospheric<br/><br/>Now the bad points: everything else.<br/><br/>There is no plot. Some people go to some place, some stuff happens, and then the movie ends. If you're looking for narrative, you won't find it here. Why? Because **** you, that's why.<br/><br/>'Plot' holes, poor characterisation, and general inconsistencies are glossed over like the eighth layer of varnish on your grandmother's piano. Why? Because **** you, that's why.<br/><br/>No attempt is made to develop a coherent belief system for the members of the Swedish cult. Why? Because **** you, that's why.<br/><br/>The cultists' religion is never presented in any systematic way. Its rituals and traditions are entirely arbitrary, and seemingly unrelated to each other. Looks like the scriptwriter said 'Let's just make them do a lot of weird stuff. The weirder the better, so we don't need to explain it.'<br/><br/>Why did they do this? Because the rituals don't need any significance. And why is that? Because they're just a vehicle for the violence, the sole purpose of which is to shock the audience. But the turgid predictability of the screenplay kills any latent tension, so there is no shock at all, and the violence is just boring.<br/><br/>The critical failing of this movie is its lack of a clear protagonist. The original Wicker Man had a powerful plot driven by a strong protagonist, an even stronger antagonist, and the clash between their respective worldviews.<br/><br/>By contrast, Midsommar has... nothing. While its main characters do experience increasing discomfort, their worldview is accommodating to a fault, and yields at the slightest push. As the crazy mounts up on all sides, they continue to rationalise it away in the name of political correctness. This robs Midsommar of an ideological collision; the very motif that worked so well in Hardy's film.<br/><br/>Apparently Swedish cultists use jazz hands instead of clapping, because of course they do. Let's borrow one of the dumbest idea from American social justice warrior culture, and shove it into a movie based in northern Europe. Great stuff.<br/><br/>I rate Midsommar at 13.32 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a shockingly flawed and highly derivative 4/10 on IMDB (2 points for cinematography, 1 for music, and 1 for Florence H. Pugh)."

","Midsommar introduces us to the battle that Dani has to go through -- death of her whole family and a close-to breaking relationship with her boyfriend, Christian. Although all this, Dani chose to tag along to her boyfriend summer trip with his friends -- however -- no clear background on this. She literally was still in grief but chose to go with his boyfriend who wouldn't even bother to let her know until the LAST 2 weeks that he will be going?? And don't you need visa or anything which will not allow u to just tag along D-14 right? CMIIW on this.<br/><br/>The story right after was told in a slow pace -- and still -- some sins to add on. First, how come there is no signal or any sign of electricity but Josh is able to charge his laptop - phone - headphones and still use them after days in???? And even after Josh and Mark went missing Christian and Dani did not immediately be suspicious towards it but very suspicious when Simon just left Connie ""to go on the train""?? This still doesn't make sense to me.<br/><br/>However overall though, I did enjoy the movie. The cinematography, scoring and story which creeps me out hence I get the level of disturbance that I'd expected from previously watching Hereditary -- which I thought was incredible."

","If you have seen the trailer and are familiar with the typical ""cabin in the woods""/""group of people go to an isolated mysterious place which is not what it seems"" patterns, than you know exactly what to expect, from the beginning to the end. There was no plot twist what's or ever, and if there was suppose to be one, than at least I saw it coming from a mile.<br/><br/>What the trailer does not show you, however, are the long tedious forever stretching scenes which shows you the community's weird culture. Which is OK, but I don't see why making them so long.<br/><br/>I loved Hereditary, and was looking forward for this one. But this wasn't even close. What made Hereditary excellent in my opinions is the originality and suspense. Did not feel any suspense here, what's or ever (Did I say it was predictable?...).<br/><br/>Bottom line, it is OK to watch.

"Joetampa90","6","11","29","3 July 2019"," Strange Self Indulgent Film
","Midsommar brought to us by horror prodigy Ari Aster could have been so much more. Most people are familiar with Ari for his breakthrough film Hereditary. A good percentage of people (myself included) found that to be one of the best horror movies of the decade and were clamoring for Ari's next work. In comes Midsommar a sunny acid trip to Sweden. Right off the bat, the audience is treated to a sorrowful pitch black opening, that while serving its purpose left more to be desired.<br/><br/>If you're reading this you know what Midsommar is about. We get a good hour of buildup before anything out of ordinary happens. Once that shockingly gruesome moment happens it's as if we've reached a crossroads. The director had a few different paths to take from there, and he took a more self-indulgent strange one.
Unsettling music, obtuse camera work, trippy visuals, long drawn out scenes, head-scratching moments, a disfigured child, comical quips (both intentional and unintentional) Midsommar is a messy mixed bag.<br/><br/>This film could have been more than another beautiful to look at, but hollow art piece. Ultimately it's hard to call it anything more than that. We are left without explanations for some big things, some elements feel like they were thrown in for no real reason outside of being visually jarring, and a lot of this movie feels overlong and dragging. Often times taking itself way too seriously and feeling like it was trying too hard to be something it isn't. Characters felt empty, even given the long run time to aide in giving them more depth.<br/><br/>Just as these types of movies usually do we have some allegories here. We don't, however, have much horror at all. The viewer gets occasional feelings of dread and despair, but this is more of a drama than anything else which I'm not faulting it for, the marketing would just have you think otherwise.<br/><br/>I can see the appeal, and it wasn't horrible but Midsommar drops into some pitfalls that I can't forgive it for. I left the theater just wanting more ultimately unsatisfied with what I was given."

I doubt this was intended but I could not shake that feeling 2/3rds of the way in.

","This movie depicts the ancient European religion and culture as evil and backwards, it portrays nature and our traditions connecting us to our environment in a negative way. The use of psychedelic drugs is also portrayed as generally negative which is not even close to reality as these drugs have a huge potential in psychotherapy, it's just a continuation of the War on drugs or better called War on free thinking. It's Hollywood propaganda with the main goal is to divert people from looking at an alternative to the mainstream global capitalist way of thinking.
And the movie itself is boring, the plot just drags along whitout any sense of direction. Its very predictable and unintelligent, uninspiring and worst of all unoriginal, basically a rip-off from The Wicker Man (1973).
As a horror movie it's not very scary. So to sum it up it this movie fails on every front. At nearly 3 hours run time it is a pretty bad waste of time."
"h_benevides","4","7","17","9 July 2019"," Disappointed
","Spoilers Ahead Do Not Read Last Chance!!
I had very high hopes for Ari Asters 2nd film, I loved Hereditary. This film started off with a very interesting setup with good acting all around it. It started off with the main character Dani's sister killing herself & their parents via carbon monoxide poisoning but here's what started as a trend for this movie on setting up character back stories/plot lines and then never finishing or touching back on them. Things are terrible between her and her bf Christian, she finds out about his secret Swedish trip with his friends and she joins them they get there and the person who invited them is a local of this Colony by the way (SKETCHy!). They have fun for awhile but then they find out about the life cycle view these people half which is peoples lives are seasons ie 1-18(Child/Spring)18-36(Teen/Summer) 36-52 (Worker/Fall)52-72 (Retire/Winter) or something along those lines anyways only really matters for setting up this next scene to show what happens when people hit 72 at this place so they have a huge feast then they all gathered and the couple who turned 72 and was celebrated today launches off rocks from a few hundred feet and splatter there heads open but the husband survives and then a village comes and smashes his head like a balloon, the movie being good stopped right here if this was a short film and just stopped it would have been 8/10. But Ari had way to much ambition & not enough vision on this one beautiful cinematography was wasted on a terrible pointless script we never learn much about any of these characters they mostly die offscreen and theres a lot of weird nudity much like hereditary. The main girl Dani for not much of an explained reason happily watches her bf be murdered not a tear she smiled very sadistic actually. Also worth noting Christian the dull bf was sewn into a gutted bear before being burned alive. Very little script, this is as much of a plot as there was tbh. Hoping his next one has more less ambition more execution. I watched this with 3 people 2 of us would have walked out early but 1 of us loved it so we had to stay. Do not waste your time with this movie unless you really love cinematography."

"edgeofreality","10","4","8","18 April 2020"," Catharsis of grief, acceptance of death
","Funny how passionately so many hate this film. It is often a sign that it touched a nerve. This is not conventional horror, but it is horror. It is horror raised to a truly disturbing and horrific level. Like Hereditary, it touches on primal fears of insanity and death in the family, on modern society's lack of real communal support for those who are grieving, and the general selfishness and isolation fostered by a society that puts success above all else and has found nothing with which to replace the religion it has emasculated. In contrast we see a pagan cult in Sweden, which is fully, and horrifically, prepared to accept, even welcome death. However, through rituals based on unquestioning belief, it offers full support for its members - provided they don't go against the gods. While this cult is almost purely unpleasant at first view, it provides a form of catharsis, for the grieving heroine, who is confronted with two types of death: she recently lost her sister and parents, and is losing her boyfriend too. To the latter her catharsis takes the form of unintended revenge - so completely that you begin to wonder if she isn't dreaming the whole crazy story. Anyway, this film has a hypnotic pace, with an almost unbearable build up of dread before the arrival at the commune and the sacrifice of the aged couple. The nastiness that follows builds carefully towards the almost apocalyptic end - an apocalypse of these young people's assumptions and trust in reality and the fake safety net our modern world 'protects' us with. (The recent lockdowns during the epidemic have revealed just how thin and useless this net always was, and how our modern lifestyle has betrayed us. Not to say that the cult is an improvement: merely a horrific reminder of all we must repress. One can quibble that it is a bit similar to Hereditary - the grieving in isolation, the seeming invincibility of the cult, the doomed fate of (most of) the characters. Also some of the rituals did feel a bit like warm-ups in whacked out drama classes. Aside from that casting and acting work very well indeed, and this film is powerful, beautifully photographed, and impossible to forget."

"Willie-12","2","4","8","6 February 2020"," Far Too Long With No Redeeming Qualities
","**Note...there could be **SPOILERS** in this review if there truly is anyone who doesn't know exactly where this predictable and overly-long film (please Aster...for the love of all that is holy and good, employ an editor who has the balls to stand up to you and tell you that your movie is going to be too long) is going**<br/><br/>It became fairly evident early on in Midsommar that this wasn't going to go anywhere, except right where Ari Aster wanted it to go. Now, you might be thinking ""well it's his movie, it should go where he wants it to go."" And I agree. However, in a good movie, where the director wants a movie to go isn't so obvious right out of the starting gate. Aster isn't interested in creating real characters who would make decisions that real people would make. He manipulates his characters and he provides circumstances that pretty much forces them to make decisions that are so stupid and so irrational, that it becomes very difficult to care about any of them. Why would I? None of them seem like actual people. I could list numerous examples of what I'm talking about, but then I'd have to write more about this steaming pile of pretentious, wanna-be art house crap than I want to (and people will give me grief about writing spoilers and such). So I'll mention one. As soon as our wooden and robotic puppet characters get to this commune/cult place they are told that when you reach a certain age, then that's it...that's all she wrote so-to-speak. And then, we as the audience, are supposed to be horrified when something happens that any movie-goer with half a brain could see coming from a mile away. So what do our characters do? Do they turn tale and run? Do they get together and make a plan to escape in the night (oh wait...that's right...is it night or is it day? Note to Will Poulter's character: when you get closer to the arctic circle the days are longer in the summertime)? No. A few of them were truly upset with what they witnessed, but then some of the other visitors rationalize what happened and all is well again...until the next disturbing ritual, and the next, and the next. It's preposterous and ridiculous and almost no one makes any kind of decision that makes sense. One of the people who saw this movie with me tried to make it make sense (always a bad sign when one has to manipulate circumstances in their mind to try and make a movie character's decisions make sense) . They said, ""Well, they made bad decisions because their minds were altered."" The problem is, their minds weren't altered the whole time. And how's this for a rational decision? Stop drinking and eating crap, when you know that the last crap you drank and ate caused some serious issues and problems. The whole thing is just dumb. And I don't call very many movies dumb. There are plenty of movies that suck. But I will usually stop just short of calling them stupid or dumb. This movie, minus the acting, was both. And before anyone tries to bring up Aster's last film, Hereditary, save your breath (or finger strength). I saw it, and I didn't like it as much as I liked this one. I will give Aster another shot. I think directors and screenwriters deserve the same chance that a baseball player gets when they're up. However, I think I know what the result will be. He'll basically make a carbon copy of what he's already made. It will be Hereditary and Midsommar packaged a little differently, but the results will probably be the same. It will be full of disturbing images surrounded by stupid characters who make some of the most irrational decisions in the history of mankind. And if you feel the same way I do, then I'm here for you. I already know what kind of grief someone can get when they go against the grain. You'll be ridiculed and told how shallow you are. **People will accuse you of not getting ""it"" (whatever ""it"" is). Just know that most of them are like most of the critics who raved and went on and on about how great it was. Sometimes when a snow ball gets rolling, no one wants to be the one who gets out of the way, lest others think they are cowards. Once the initial praise for this film started, no one (no movie-goer, no critic, etc.) wanted to be the one accused of not being creative enough, or intelligent enough, or as sophisticated enough, to really understand this film. And so the praise just kept on coming. And at that point, it was all over. Midsommar was branded a horror movie masterpiece. The problem is, it's not horror (there is not a genuinely frightening or disturbing moment in the whole film) and it sure ain't no masterpiece. If you are still a bit nervous to actually tell people how you really felt about this piece of garbage, then don't worry. Just know that you are not alone.<br/><br/>** - I wanted to write this addendum to bring your attention to what I'm talking about as far as people ridiculing others because those others weren't ""smart"" enough to get what was going on in this film. A reviewer by the name of Lonnis_Cult wrote a review on February 4, 2020, ridiculing others who wrote negative reviews about this piece of crap film. Apparently Lonnis_Cult is one of the most intellegent people in the world whose brain is much more advanced than those of us who hated this stupid movie. It's your typical, narcissistic and arrogant tripe that people write to try and puff themselves up by pretending that this was a complex and intricately woven masterpiece (It's not), and they understood it when others, apparently didn't. Lonnis_Cult also made an absurd statement about how this movie, and especially Florence Pugh's performance, was raved about by critics, so that means the movie and Pugh's performance have to be very good. Here's his reason for making that conclusion: Lonnis said that since critics are the ones who ""know what they're talking about when it comes to filmmaking,"" then that means Pugh's performance and the movie are great. In other words, he seems to indicate that critics are always right. Why? Well he gives no explanation. Lonnis also has quite a negative attitude towards movies with CGI and jump scares. He suggests that such films are ""crap,"" (his word) and implies that they're only for anti-intellectual simpletons. However, critics loved Avengers Endgame and The Conjuring. Those two movies have an abundance of CGI and jump scares respectively. Rotten Tomatoes gives Avengers Endgame a 94% rating and The Conjuring an 85% rating. Midsommar only has an 83% rating on RT. According to Lonnis's logic, that must mean that Avengers Endgame and The Conjuring are, not only great movies, but they're better films than Midsommar, since they have better ratings from the critics, and according to Lonnis, critics know what they're talking about when it comes to filmmaking. Hey Lonnis...just using YOUR WORDS, as well as YOUR LOGIC to make that conclusion."

The only thing it kind of has going for it is the cinematography, which is nice at points but is overshadowed by the utter confusion emptiness of the plot. It portrays a series of scenes, events, and characters that are barely related to each other, and offer no explanation as to what any of them are or mean. It just feels like a bunch of random scenes that were spliced together. The sister taking her own life and the lives of her parents at the beginning bears no resemblance to the rest of the story, or if it does, I struggle to see why. There is absolutely no reason why these characters would go (or be allowed to) a cult-like the one in this movie. It is also completely unrealistic that a cult would be able to operate like this. All of the characters are extremely underdeveloped, and the acting is terrible. Every single character was annoying. After the people who have hit 72 jumped off of a cliff, a normal person would have been gone, whether or not they were there for research. The unnecessary gore does not add anything to the plot and felt forced in the sense that it was needed to make it a ""horror"" movie. The sex scene at the end was also just plain gross. I'm not sure whether it was supposed to be funny or not, but either way, it just reaffirmed my opinion that this movie is terrible. If I could give it zero stars I would. I think this is truly the worst movie I've ever seen. It is definitely the type of movie where all the actors watched it when it was done and thought it was the best thing ever."

No. Does it deserve 1? No. I guess 5/10 would be a fair review. It's an interesting concept that combines grief, the need of social belonging, our gullible society and most interestingly the form of cults. For all the cult movie fans, this might be for you. For all the horror and thriller movie fans, this isn't for you. It's way too slow paced and overly artsy to fall into the horror category. In fact, the movie could have been 20 mins shorter without having a negative effect on its creative visuals. It has some beautiful and authentically bizarre scenes but most of the time you are left wondering when the movie will start eventually which it never does btw.

","SYNOPSIS:
A couple travels to Sweden to visit a rural hometown's fabled mid-summer festival. What begins as an idyllic retreat quickly devolves into an increasingly violent and bizarre competition at the hands of a pagan cult.<br/><br/>REVIEW:
Ari Aster is probably the most disturbed genius in the most spectacular way. He's officially a Director that I will get up to go see opening weekend. Florence Pugh is also now officially an actress I look forward to seeing in everything. This film is written and directed in such a superb way. You're eased into this easy-going atmosphere that has you feeling comfortable until they sprinkle in the horror and disturbing imagery as the screen goes ""no don't worry this is totally normal."" 99% of this film is done during the day which strangely makes everything much worse. It's similar to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre where they flipped the trope of ""having to be dark to be scary"" on its head. The same discomfort in an environment we're accustomed to feeling comfort. Then you have the film following Dani (Florence Pugh) who is going through a beautiful yet disturbing arc that also plays into the ""don't worry everything is normal"" commentary this film carries. The cast itself was great all around. Vilhelm Blomgren was great in his role and of course we can't skip over Will Poulter being the absolute comedic character. This was my second favorite film of 2019 and could've been my favorite any given year. All the pieces fall together and I get a certain feeling from this film that I've never felt from another film and that says a lot for me. If you are a fan of horror, this is definitely a must see and I hope this film is not ultimately forgotten like I feel it already has been somewhat. 9.2/10."

","First of all and most importantly, imo, the design, costumes and cinematography was stunning.<br/><br/>The movie itself was very engaging too. You knew what would happen, to an extent, but it's still able to keep you on the edge of your seat. The story felt original to me and I constantly felt myself thinking ""who can think of this?"" During parts of the movie; and that's a good thing.<br/><br/>The movie was very shocking and also scary without resorting to pop outs. I detest pop outs so that was welcomed.<br/><br/>The story had a bunch of plot holes and it stretched reality - they all would have noped right out of there after the elders committed suicide - and that detracted a bit from the overall quality for me."

"mochteam","6","2","3","29 November 2019"," Not as good as Hereditary but still good in it's own way
","Midsommar tells a story we've seen before only in a different way. It is pretty much ""The wicker man."" Except it's also kind of it's own thing. What I like about Ari Asters films is his use of emotional shock. Right from the get go into this movie you get hit with it hard and it carries on through the main character. The problems I found with the film is that it is predictable and that's what makes it not as great as Hereditary. You know the direction this film is going in before it gets there and even with its chills and thrills you're not really all that surprised by what happens when it does happen but the story is told in a beautiful way. The movie feels a bit overly long but it has some of the best scenes I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>I also felt that the movie kind of flip flops around when it comes to which character is taking the high road or the low road. Dani isn't exactly the hero of the story and her boyfriend Christian isn't exactly the villain either. Christian is stuck in a relationship with a needy and emotionally unstable girlfriend who he wanted to break up with but ended up being stuck with after she endured a tragedy. Christian being the good guy put himself through the torture of sticking with Dani even though he was already tired of her but felt pity on her since he was the only person she had left in her life.<br/><br/>There seemed to be a lot more than could have been done with that story line alone but somehow in the movie it flips to make Christian look like the bad guy for not being faithful to a woman he didn't even love but forced himself to be with and Dani being selfish and needy and not realizing that she's selfish and needy becomes is treated as a hero in the end.<br/><br/>It's a strange story but I think that's what they were going for with this film. It's a solid 6/10. I wouldn't watch it again because it's too long and kinda drags on in parts but it was worth a first time run through."

","I thought that the beginning was slow, maybe deliberately, but it didn't quite get the effect the filmmaker was trying to achieve, in the sense that watching people for one hour arguing did not make us invested in the slightest in the characters, there were other methods that could have been used. The twist, although expected, in the midpoint was pretty good- my only problem was that the characters kept talking about how crazy that twist was for twenty minutes afterward until you didn't think it was that crazy. The second half was definitely superior, but it never reached the heart pounding dread that you would have wanted it to. It was close enough to that point where you were interested, but far enough where you never really felt bad when a someone died or were scared for the main characters."

You may be on the edge of your seat for a bit but when it's all said and done nothing adds up. This group of friends appears to be so clueless and dumb that they almost deserve what is happening to them. You become so disconnected with the characters that whatever happens to them doesn't matter to you. Consistently you may ask yourself what will happen next and it could shock you, but in the end it's nothing more than senseless.

This made for a tedious second half of ""don't go in the basement"" style goofs.<br/><br/>I loved Hereditary, which scared the pants off me, but Midsommar is more akin to Hereditary's ending than its remainder.<br/><br/>But it's worth watching and will provoke plenty of discussion and it is more refreshing than many horrors around at the moment, if a bit annoying.

"crobbs-52066","7","1","1","8 November 2019"," A Good First Draft (Spoilers)
","This was a very enjoyable movie. It is good for those getting into horror. For example, my wife has not traditionally been into horror but we watched this as an easing into it. There are three problems with the movie:<br/><br/>-no escape: at no point do any of the characters try to escape. they are slowly picked off one by one. normally this would be ominous and freak out the characters. In this movie, the characters are able to rationalize the disappearances all the way until the end. They don't realize something is wrong until way, way too late.
-unnecessary plot points: there is no need for Dani's parents to die. Even if there was, there is no need for such a long intro. The movie is already 2.5 hours long, and it feels almost like the only reason for the parent's death is to give the viewer a little bit of horror imagery to tide them over as we then transition to a peaceful mountain religious community that slowly builds towards horror. Additionally, the part about the stolen book never comes to fruition. This feels like it should've been a much bigger plot point. We know that none of the main characters stole the book. They're either all dead or sleeping at the time when it was stolen. Yet the movie spends a good 5-10 minutes beginning this plot point only to have it never resolved.
-the build towards horror never pays off: the movie feels slightly tense, like the moment before a roller coaster takes off down a slope. But that tension only pays off if there is a hurdling down a slope. Most character deaths happen off screen and we only see parts of their bodies. What one would expect from this movie is that after the instigating scene of Dani seeing Christian impregnating the redhead (Maja?) that we would take off on a whirlwind of madness and horror. Instead, we continue at the same slow pace until the end where Dani watches the bodies of her friends and boyfriend being burned as sacrifices. The blood eagle scene would've been perfect and after Christian ran out of the one building naked it seemed like we would be getting that descent into terror especially after seeing the blood eagle. Instead he's knocked out and the movie resumes it's slow pace.<br/><br/>That's a lot about the bad in the movie, but there's also several good parts.
-Unique setting
-Unique feel
-Amazing camerawork
-Intriguing plot<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good movie that had the potential to be a great movie if it weren't for a few small errors."
"bigbillyt","6","1","1","31 October 2019"," SPOILERS! If I didn't have expectations based on Hereditary this might have seemed better
","SPOILERS - DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM!
This is a very engaging movie with an interesting premise, decent writing, gorgeous cinematography and excellent acting. The two big problems are a lack of depth in terms of character development and difficulty relating to or investing in the protagonists. Ari Aster is a brilliant director and writer but spent a little too much screen time setting the tone and atmosphere that would have been better spent on a little more time with the character's backstory. If we knew more about Dani and Christian's motivations, expectations and emotional history it could have made everything about their actions fall into place. As it is I couldn't help but feel that neither of them, or their friends, made significant attempts to escape once they realized that the group they were among was clearly a dangerous cult. They clearly were supposed to be reasonably intelligent people but they sure didn't act like it. I realize there were a number of plot devices designed to make this seem natural, such as being drugged, distracted, separated etc. But it just made it all seem a bit contrived that they didn't make any serious attempts to escape. Anyway, it is kind of sad and frustrating, because otherwise it was a so well done. With 2 1/2 hours to burn he really should have given us more to go on, or made their actions seem a bit more realistic. Also, Florence Pugh is a brilliant actor, her depictions of her character's reaction to extreme grief were very real and unnerving. The scene of the firemen going through her parents house was one of the most disturbing things I have ever seen. In fact, I believe it was so disturbing that if anyone saw that who had any experience with anything similar I would be concerned about them seeing that."

"derekmen-86753","5","5","12","12 July 2019"," Not What I Expected.
","Midsommar is this years 'It Comes At Night' in my opinon. (Another outing from A24 )That film was promoted as being a dark, terrifying venture into a post apocalyptic world, with some horrific monster unveiling at some point. It instead was a slow-burn that dealt more with human relationships and expectations than really much else. The audience reaction to that was not unfavorable, and I see Midsommar having the same problem. Its being billed as this years scariest movie and likened to last years Hereditary, but I disagree. Ari Aster is definitely a very talented director and showed that when he busted onto the scene with 2018's Hereditary. I don't think he kept the pace with his sophomore outing though, deciding to try his hand with folk horror and producing very mixed results. Midsommar is beautifully filmed, with bright vibrant colors filling the screen in every shot. Ari really captured the essence of the midsummer festival and elevated it. The movie borrows heavily from 1973's The Wicker Man, so much so that I think this movie could be considered a remake or re-imagining of that film. There are scenes that are literally pulled straight out of that movie, and slightly changed to add a different feel. The cult here feels real and authentic, which adds to the effectiveness of what actually transpires on-screen. But that's really all that's memorable about it. Despite a very inspired performance from Florence Pugh and some perfectly executed comedic lines from Will Poulter, this movie just didn't do anything that other films haven't. Its also VERY light on visual horror (a lot of the violence happens off screen) instead relying on tension building and setup for the majority of the scares. This is effective at first, keeping the viewer feeling uneasy and on guard, but becomes increasingly stale near the end. Overall the movie is enjoyable in spurts, but ends up feeling empty and forgettable. Go see it, you may love it and apparently its getting rave reviews. Its just not a movie I would see again."
"rustonreviews","6","5","12","6 July 2019"," Underwhelming, with glimpses of genius buried beneath self-indulgence.
","Expectations were sky-high for Ari Aster's sophomore effort following his absolutely horrifying debut Hereditary (2018). Aster's debut feature is a truly unsettling watch and was my favourite film of last year by a country mile. For me, Aster cemented himself as a director to watch out for, and Hereditary easily ranks as one of the greatest horror films of the last ten years. I've been looking forward to Midsommar ever since its announcement. Pitched as a hallucinogenic folk-horror nightmare largely influenced by the brilliant The Wicker Man (1973), Midsommar ultimately serves as a twisted break-up movie. After suffering a traumatising loss, Dani (Pugh) embarks on a trip to Sweden with her boyfriend Christian (Reynor) and his friends to participate in a midsummer celebration festival that occurs only once every ninety years. As friendly as the brightly clad villagers appear, Dani soon discovers that a sinister nature is concealed behind the ritualistic practices that take place during the festival. With her anxieties amplifying and tensions steadily intensifying within the group, it becomes apparent that the villagers have their own ulterior motives that prove to be inescapable once the festivities begin.<br/><br/>Midsommar is a very interesting, if not precariously muddled, sophomore effort from Aster. From a technical standpoint, it's a remarkable accomplishment. Aster's shot composition is flawless and Pawel Pogorzelski's cinematography is outstanding throughout. Visually, it's a beautiful looking film to behold with an illuminous aesthetic fused with infrequent bursts of ghastly, bloody imagery. Florence Pugh is great as Dani, and very much like Toni Collette's performance in Hereditary, Pugh drives the whole thing forward through the emotional sincerity of her performance. With that said, I found Midsommar to be largely underwhelming on the whole with a startling lack of frights.<br/><br/>Clocking in at two and a half hours, it can at times feel like quite a sluggish viewing experience (particularly due to the slow burn approach of Aster's storytelling), and the film would have perhaps fared better if it were thirty to forty minutes shorter. Aster's script contains an assortment of twisted ideas, some of which work rather well (mostly during the films first half), whereas others come across as distractingly ludicrous (not to mention unintentionally hilarious). Unfortunately, Midsommar never quite lives up to the excellence of its first act, in which Aster sets the stage brilliantly for another unsettling nightmare in the same vein as Hereditary, but Midsommar is no such nightmare. It doesn't even come close. Once the third act of the film begins to unfold, Aster plunges into total self-indulgence. The most disappointing aspect about Midsommar lies within its storytelling. Despite its solid concept, it is far too long and frustratingly silly at times, and although Pugh's performance is emotionally engaging, the storyline (that is stretched way too thin) is not. I never felt entirely invested in the plot, which is a startling far cry from the emotional torment and unrelenting terror I felt throughout Hereditary.<br/><br/>Midsommar is bound to divide audiences. It is a film designed to provoke reaction. Even though the films flaws are aplenty, I cannot in good conscience call this a bad film, for there are still moments of genius to commend and technical aspects that are brilliantly crafted. Aster is undeniably a very talented filmmaker, but Midsommar is an underwhelming effort that ultimately fails to tell an engaging story, and most crucially, it never once unsettled or disturbed me."

The director stretches out too many scenes just a bit too long so just as you're ready to bail it moves on, so you keep watching.
There's a whole 30 minute beginning involving Pugh's character that's basically irrelevant to the main plot although I'm sure the director uses it as a reason for her to hang around when anyone else with any sense would leave.
This is one of those frustrating movies where you keep hoping the heroes come to their senses and get some payback on the evil doers. But it never happens.

The movie tried to tell us that the boyfriend was at fault for the girlfriend being emotionally dependent, or at least that's what I got from him being sacrificed, since they barely talk to each other during the whole film.

Also, the fact that this was very pretty to look at, makes for an unsettling experience.<br/><br/>However, I have to say I was disappointed at the lack of horror (or that ""sinking"" feeling one has after seeing a good horror). While I understand everything that happened plot-wise, I'm not completely sure what the film was trying to say. It felt like they threw a bunch of ideas at the wall hoping one would stick, when none of them really did. For all the buildup, the story ended up being predictable and flat.<br/><br/>This might be a bit spoilery: Cults are not inherently ""scary"", and neither is deformity or deformed people... which disturbingly feels exploited here just for shock value. Gore and face-bashing is not scary, just off putting and gross. Toxic relationships and co-dependency might be horrific, but with that setup you could predict where the plot was going from a mile away, so nothing ends up being much of a surprise.<br/><br/>I can't help but compare this to Hereditary, which was a very effective horror flick, but don't go into this expecting more of the same. It's slow and meandering and lacking in some much-needed horror elements. It was memorable though, and I will continue to see more Ari Aster films because they're interesting.

","Complex, hauntingly beautiful, and by far unique, Midsommar is by far one of 2019's most original and daring films, and proves the brilliance of Ari Aster yet again. Most of what holds this film together, as with Hereditary, is the source and deep interest and involvement of the characters, and the actors portraying them. The obvious and necessary to recognize standout is by far Florence Pugh, who gives an absolutely fantastic performance as Dani. Jack Reynor and Vilhelm Blomgren also make for some eye-catching performances, but all together, the rest of the cast shines together in one big ball of crazy. The script may seem over, and yet, under-complicated, but all together proves to be an impressive mix of tension, confusion, and pure terror. It isn't as scary as Hereditary, but it does feel more realistic, making for some certainly uneasy tension. The visuals are absolutely outstanding, with its bright and colorful atmosphere making for not only a beautiful array of filmmaking, but also a sophisticated lesson on what it truly means to be a horror film. The film can be a bit hard to follow, and or slow, but it proves to be a certainly thrilling ride with many questions to still ask, and many i'm sure people will seek and follow.

The scenery is gorgeous, the idea is cool, the mystery is alluring, and everything was set up for a grand journey into fear or revelation---but...nothing...ever...really...quite...happens, aside from the most obvious bullcrap that I could have told you from watching the trailer, or watching movies like Wicker Man.<br/><br/>I mean, honestly, the whole movie is nothing but a stupid rehash of Wicker Man, with some commentary or underlying themes about rotting relationships, family, depression, and the futility of life. We finally find out midway through the film that the black dude and the blonde's boyfriend are both trying to write a thesis paper on other cultures or some crap, but I can't even remember a single character's name from this movie. That is how boring the characters are. The blonde is sad cause her deranged sister killed off her family and committed suicide or something at the beginning of the film, and she is in a lame relationship that seems to be spinning its wheels. They decide to visit some stupid place in Sweden, which is the homeplace of one of their friends, but there really is nothing else of substance, resembling a plot.<br/><br/>There were a lot of missed opportunities here, with a great setting for real heroes and villains with depth, but no one pulled the trigger on this concept. Many scenes feel like they are filmed 100 yards away from the characters having a dialogue, so you can't even tell who is talking at times. There are literally about 28 scenes of idiots sitting at a table, talking at an outdoor table, drinking at the table, standing in the field near a table, eating at the table, dancing around the table, and sitting at the table again, with little explanation of what the rituals are or what is going on(though I recognized references to the May Queen early on, reminding me of occult and esoteric practices of old, and the reference to this in Stairway to Heaven by Zeppelin).<br/><br/>Anyway, there are very few moments of fear, and this movie was about as scary as Vincent Price muttering nonsense in a cape from Walmart. Hereditary was WAY scarier, with more atmosphere and presence. This is subpar, by comparison, and really left me wondering how such a talented director filmed so much crap with no payoff. Then, they just stick the guy in a bear suit and burn him at the end???? PUHLEASE. I already knew this was going to happen from the trailer. I hoped there would be WAY more to the story. NONE of the village people are really developed, or given interesting motives for anything, and the main characters are as boring as your child's 4th grade play. I LITERALLY CAN'T REMEMBER ONE NAME OF THESE PEOPLE IN THE FILM. That is just pathetic. The part where one of them takes a leak on a tree, and a villager cries about it and cusses at him was just hilarious. It comes off as very corny and juvenile. Where was the fear? The story? The character development? The irony? The plot twist? The horror? The substance? The people to root for or against? The realism? The new stuff that would make this different in some way from other folk horror cult films of the past??? I don't know, but it surely isn't here.<br/><br/>The characters are incredibly stupid too, and this isn't even a teen slasher flick from the 80s. I expected more from this level of production. Like, they hear people screaming in the woods in the distance, and their friends are vanishing, but they move along like this is normal at several points in the movie. They drink or eat stuff that is given to them, even after seeing that this group assists their villagers in suicides, and bangs them in the head with hammers!!! I would already figure I was in a Jim Jones celebration, and quickly put down the Kool Aid.<br/><br/>Overall, I give it 3 stars, as the scenery is breathtaking, the music is unsettling, and it was not the worst movie I've seen. However, this is no masterpiece, and it really isn't horror at all. More like a boring documentary about bozos having sex in a flowerfield and rehashing old plot lines with absolutely NOTHING new. I couldn't believe how lame this plot was, after 150 minutes of crap. PRETENTIOUS AND BORING, with what basically amounts to lazy plagiarism."

I see a lot of negative reviews on here, but I can only say they must have a small mind. It's not a horror movie for its jump scares, it's a horror movie for its tension building, it's realising the main characters are actually the bad guys here in a way, it's the profoundness.

If you are a horror fan or even just read the synopsis you can see where the film is going from about 15 minutes in, that's ok if the plot has some twist or unpredictable elements but unfortunately it basically plays out like you expect.<br/><br/>The film has some good moments and starts off with similar themes of grief and loss that Hereditary had which was expertly done again here. There is also quite a lot of humour (mainly from Will Poulter) which was done well. When the group goes to Sweden there are a few moments of horror and definitely a feeling that something is not right (which you expect from reading the synopsis) but way too much of the ceremonies, chanting and communal wailing which I ended up getting a bit bored with and wanting more to happen. I have no problem with long films building an atmosphere of dread but they honestly could have shaved 30 minutes off the run time and the film would have been no different.<br/><br/>As the film progresses towards the end there is one bizarre elongated sex scene that had people laughing out loud in the cinema I was in. Although there is lots of general weirdness and strange cult practices which does convey a sense of uneasiness I don't think there was enough of a feeling of genuine dread or horror. I kept thinking the slow build up would lead to some really horrendous scenes towards the end and some unpredictable ending but for me there was nothing particularly shocking or scary towards the end.
Worth watching but not what I hoped."

","I went into this film with high expectations. I disliked Hereditary but this looked extremely intriguing so I figured I would give this director another shot. Turns out I actually like Hereditary more than this film. Midsommar is technically a very well made film. Well acted and the visuals are stunning. The story is one we have seen before and offers no real shock (like Hereditary did). What you think happens happens. In fact, its way lamer than you expect. The shock in the middle of the film (which was very gory) is where the film peaks and you assume something worse is coming at the climax... but it never comes. You can see whats going to happen a mile away and you think ""no way thats all that will happen something INSANE is gonna happen!!"" but it doesn't. The relationship dynamic between the 2 main characters was amusing but the characters were unlikable (much like the ones in Hereditary). It took far too long to reach a conclusion most in the audience had made from the minute they arrived at the colony. The movie earns a few points for weirdness (as well as xenophobia) but it falls very flat. I had very high expectations for this film and it could have been so much more. If you would like to see excellent cinematography and bright, interesting visuals you will be happy with that aspect.

It's hard to separate Hereditary from Midsommar but when you get by the similarity's and consider this a completely different movie, which it is, it's good.

To make this story simple: it's about a breakup between the two main characters.<br/><br/>Dani and Christian are the two I speak of, with Christian wanting to let her go because they have been dating for four years and he hasn't had sex with her. However, Dani is suffering from major PTSD with her family being dead. He and his friends envision him going on a trip to Sweden to meet women of the area, however, once Dani surprisingly finds out of his last minute decision to go, she feels uncomfortable. As a result, Christian ends up inviting her along with him, feeling guilt for his decision. Upon arriving, that is when his truth of how he feels unravels and the path of releasing herself from this callous individual (along with those that supported his perspective of selfishness) begins.<br/><br/>Those that desire a survival-horror movie based upon these themes, this is not your kind of movie. This is an abstract movie with hidden symbolism and emotional meanings; e.g. at the ending, there is a burning of a building, which represents the burning of attachment such as us burning boxes of materials to let go of the pain involved in breakups (don't worry, there are many other spoilers I have not shared that are worth looking out for). I feel this is necessary to clarify as those that don't like this movie simply didn't understand the overarching abstraction, thus label it as meaningless.<br/><br/>The meaning behind this film is to articulate complex emotions through that of paganism, which at its root is about feeling and embracing the interconnection of human emotion tied to nature. Those that claim this movie gives paganism a bad name, it's not meant to represent a specific pagan group - it's meant to represent an abstraction of our typical pain in society; e.g. as every person involved in this commune feels pain together, it directly represents our need to express and relate pain with each other in our society. In the end, these are typical reactions to abstract filmmaking, so if you're into deciphering messages, don't let short-sighted perspectives fool you - this may very well be your type of film.<br/><br/>Director's Cut will be released in Theaters on August 30th, which adds 30 minutes of scenes to the story."

This movie is truly a work of art all on it's own without getting into the great plot and themes.<br/><br/>This movie isn't about a cult a group of stupid college kids. It's about Dani and her search for acceptance. The movie cares so little about the cult crazy aspects that it spells it out right for you in the beginning, with a tapestry of all the major events. It doesn't matter if you know what happens because it's about what Dani is going through that gets you there. Dani needs to find a place in a world that has taken everything away from her. She lost her parents, her sister, she has a terrible boyfriend, and she has no one to turn to but him. The cult invites her in, a very emotionally vulnerable person who just wants to feel accepted because time and time again everyone around her fails her. That's brilliant. That's why this movie is so slow-burn. People came wanting gratuitous horror. They got something more akin to a drama. I think that was marketings fault, in all honesty.<br/><br/>This movie is beautiful, it has believable characters, amazing themes of acceptance and grief, and a 9 star rating from me. I urge any of you to give it another watch, if you didn't like it the first time. Look at it from this different perspecive, and I think you'll find something to love in this movie."

Having all the suspense removed actually made the movie quite funny in some parts, which is the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars. If you have seen ""The Wicker Man"", ""The Village"", or other similar movies, you've seen Midsommar.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't bad. Some hackish attempts were made to portray a creepy murder suicide which put the main character out of sorts. This seemed completely unnecessary given she had plenty of reasons to freak out after arriving at the village. This was also used to weirdly put the relationship of the protagonists ""on shaky ground"" as well, which also could have been portrayed as a couple just not getting along for any number of more plausible reasons. The murder suicide didn't really succeed at connecting me with either of the two main protagonists motivations.<br/><br/>The characters reactions to horrific events are completely unbelievable. Initially, they are shown in shock at ""the big reveal"", then in the next scene one character comments he is ""just fine"", and they proceed to argue about something not related to what they just witnessed. Characters start disappearing left and right, and most of the ""visitors"" don't even seem to care.<br/><br/>There were just so many unnecessary scenes designed for shock value, cheap laughs, etc. Most of them were not done well, but I did get a few chuckles along the way.<br/><br/>Even though the story is completely predictable, the movie managed to hold my interest to the end, and I didn't feel like I had totally wasted my time. I won't watch it again, and wouldn't really recommend it unless there is just nothing better on Amazon Video, which is probably why most people watched Midsommar to begin with."

","While I loved Hereditary so much that I watched it five times, the yelling, screeching, and xenophobic mocking of obscure European rituals was a bit too much to bear in Midsommar. I have nothing against Florence Pugh, but if I were her I probably would have been angry at the wardrobe department, especially when they show her from the back; you'll know what I mean when you see it. While I appreciate Aster's clever use of visual clues in both films, in this film it wasn't compelling enough to rise above the achingly long, drawn-out dramatic scenes. Was there supposed to be a correlation between the mass murder in the beginning of the story and the smiling horror show that happens later on? If so, it wasn't apparent to this viewer. It could be that I was distracted by all the screeching. Oh well, the creepy music was top-notch, I recognized the style right away from Hereditary, and correctly guessed that this film had the same director. I wouldn't want to watch this film again, but I am looking forward to Aster's next film."

","Spurred on by his friends, anthropology student Christian (Jack Reynor) is on the verge of breaking up with his girlfriend Dani (Florence Pugh), but a family tragedy for Dani changes his mind. Feeling guilty about putting his girlfriend through further emotional trauma, Christian asks her to accompany him and his pals on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to the remote ancestral village of their Swedish friend Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren), who has invited them take part in the commune's nine-day midsummer festival.<br/><br/>Director Ari Aster (Hereditary) might claim that Midsommar only pays homage to brilliant UK folk horror The Wicker Man, but all I can see is a blatant, bloated and extremely tedious rip-off. Where The Wicker Man (Director's Cut) runs at a reasonable 99 minutes, its engrossing story whisking the viewer along as Edward Woodward's character attempts to solve a mystery on a remote Scottish island, Aster's film (The Director's Cut) takes a whopping 171 minutes to tell its very familiar tale of unwary outsiders falling foul of an strange religion that practises bizarre rituals.<br/><br/>Moving at a snail's pace, the first hour of Midsummar is a massive challenge for the viewer, as the students travel to the village of the Hårga, meet the locals, and take part in ancient rites which involve lots of chanting and taking of hallucinogens. Those who make it through this tedium will eventually be rewarded with a shocking scene that is the equivalent of Hereditary's decapitation (ie., it's designed to wake up the viewer and become a talking point): before the eyes of the horrified students, elders of the village throw themselves off a precipice, falling onto the rocks below with very messy results.<br/><br/>Anyone hoping that this will herald a turning point in the film will be sorely disappointed: the dull drama continues, with an excess of singing, dancing and a glut of aerial overhead shots, with hints of weirdness to indicate where the film is heading (as if we didn't know already). As Christian's friends go missing one-by-one, and the locals become increasingly weird in their behaviour, neither he nor Dani question the wisdom of remaining in the village, both continuing to partake in the commune's activities. A bit of ritualistic sex and the sight of a bloke with his lungs pulled out of his back are about the film's only other noteworthy moments before the whole boring mess finishes in inevitable fashion, stealing its fiery climax from... you guessed it.... The Wicker Man.<br/><br/>In short, what a load of (Swedish meat)balls! If you haven't already seen it, watch The Wicker Man first."

","The one thing I always come back to when thinking about both of Ari Aster's last few movies (Hereditary and Midsommar) is that I'm thrilled we still have filmmakers like him that bring a unique vibe to Hollywood films. Sometimes divisiveness can be bad and toxic, but in most cases, intelligent conversations are what makes this medium of art so special. And make no mistake, Midsommar is a piece of art. How much did I enjoy that piece of art? Well, that's a different answer. Slowly paced and seemingly forgetting the premise the first 15 minutes sets up, Midsommar finds itself stuck in a cult horror where most of the horror is off screen, as is anything interesting. Though admittedly, Florence Pugh turns in another fantastic turn as the lead.<br/><br/>5.0/10"

","Despite its color and glorious premise, Midsommar suffers from an extraordinary lack of imagination. Aster once again fails to successfully mix the terror with the psychological trauma his characters are enduring. The dots are easily connectable but they leave no impression. We are forced to sit through numerous conversations, dinner feast and rituals that go on endlessly scene after scene. The issue with this is Asters mediocre screenplay. The characters say little of interest and the feasts and rituals, although interesting at first, quickly run out of flavor. Midsommar is nowhere near as shocking as it thinks it is. The films final sequence however Is glorious. It's a powerful testament as to what the movie could have been."

"ironhorse_iv","6","3","7","20 May 2020"," This movie may become a cult classic. It's a Smörgåsbord of weirdness.
","Originally pitch as a straightforward slasher film about a group of American tourists being killed off by a surreal but vicious pagan cult during their midsummer festival in a remote Swedish village. The film directed by Ari Aster added elements to the concept about deteriorating relationship between the emotional trouble main character college student Dani Arbor (Florence Pugh) and her emotionally distant cultural anthropologist boyfriend Christian Hughes (Jack Reynor). This was done in order for Aster to cope after he just experienced a difficult breakup. For the most part, this extra subplot was fine for most audience. After all it somewhat works as a semi metaphor for the rapid decline of Abrahamic religions within the western society. The phone calls in the beginning is one such example. Much like a prayer I like how the film is shot set squarely on the character's face implying that she's talking to somebody who isn't fully there to help her. Nobody home. Even with people in her presence, the movie views those discussions through reflections of glass. In spirituality, mirror is said to reflect the act of continual self-evaluation regarding the consequences of thoughts and actions. It shows how detachment she is in this somewhat cold alienating world only wanting to egocentric procreate. That's why it makes sense that Dani would eventually fell seduced by the warmth of Harga community after first rejecting them after the public Ättestupa senicides. She slowly sees that the villagers repeatedly appear to share feeling including pain and pleasure. They're also seem supported and only produced what seem good for the community rather than selfish means. Being more in line with nature's circle of life than it seems. The metaphor of the grass growing on her, represented Dani's rebirth as a seed rooting herself back into the society after burying herself with haunting guilt of a past tragedy. The more she spends in the bright light of the community, the more she becomes willing to pollinated through Harga own means. By the end, she has become the new definition of the flower generation to the point of absurdity. She found free love and peace in an unusual way. As for the other characters, their wiliness to stay after the senicides seem a little more baffling than Dani. Especially when it comes to their very lack of reaction to death. Even with the amounts of drugs in their system, the brainwashing of both Josh (William Jackson Harper) & Christian are really not well established. I get that Josh is an apolitical scholar just looking for fame and Christian is an unsympathetic opportunist what a be savior. Nevertheless, fighting over a thesis is not a great justified for them staying at Harga after witnessing people getting killed. There has to be something more which the film fails to mention. Then there is Mark (Will Poulter) whom impulsive dumb character seems really out of place and not needed as much of his story about wanting to score could had gone to Christian. After all, there was no good exposition dump on why he wasn't around the cliff to witness the senicides. Also, to add onto that, what happen to the rest of the tourists that came to the village on the first day? They all seem to disappear along with the baby. I doubt that the cult killed all of them for no good reason. There is no way the villagers will be able to get away with all that death rituals in the cellular age without a family member finding out. Since we on the topic of the ceremonies. The film is a bit unclear about the rituals and how often they do it. The 90 years exposition seem to be a bit muddled. I didn't know it meant the barn burning until I listen to the director's commentary much later. It's that confusing. Still it does still beg the question how Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren)'s parents died in a house fire if that wasn't it. To add onto that weird mess, it seems like some of the rituals could had cut out as many of them didn't really add much to the main story like the subplot with the cult's inbred oracle. They did truly come across as unrealistic drawn out sensory overload surrealism that was somewhat funny than frightening. Despite that I felt that cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski did a great job with most of the shots. While super long, the whole establishment opening was a masterpiece. It was super creepy & disturbing. Very scary. There was also a lot of foreshadowing Easter eggs like the 1939's 'Wizard of Oz' references, bear artwork and the bouquet behind the photo of Dani. Even the very first shot of the film shows a full frame medieval folk pagan mural detailing roughly the entire sequence of events that will unfold. I also like how the film communicates the near constant hallucinogenic induced state by distorting and warping the scenery. For example, seeing Dani's family haunting her & turning the camera view upside-down on the Highway to Halsingland scene. Lots of rewatch value. I would love to one day watch all of the director's cut of the film. It's just over a half hour longer and contains more looks at both the American characters' dynamics, some cut rituals like the drowning kid and overtly supernatural elements like feet levitating off the ground. It might be interesting to look at and listen to, along with the full dark ambient eerie soundtrack composed by musician the Haxan Cloak. Overall: While the costumes might look nothing like Swedish culture & nobody really speaks with the region appropriate accent. I still said it's worth watching despite some people finding the film depiction of an iconic good nature Swedish holiday offensive and racist. It was still well shot, had fine performances even with the goofy memeable faces and downright entertaining for the most part. It's one trippy movie."

","I have to admit, there were many laugh out loud moments watching this, but this hardly rises to the praise so many have given it. This movie never makes it to the intensity of a Lars von Trier or Araonfsky film as I hoped it would. I was fighting to stay awake twice, and I was thankful I did for the spectacularly ridiculous conclusion. But spectacularly ridiculous isn't enough to give this movie more than three stars.<br/><br/>There is a grand effort to make a visual and aural impression, but it falls short of films like Mandy, Mother, Blue Velvet, Antichrist, or even Under the Skin. As far as the weirdness factor, or shock factor goes, these newer films can't touch David Lynch, Cronenberg, or even Greenaway - with the exception of the von Trier trilogies - just genius there. If you're looking for gore - the violence reminded me so much of the brilliant Mads Mikkelsen TV series Hannibal, with a direct nod to one of the tableaus at the end of the movie. The film doesn't get a zero though. I thought the acting was excellent, and if this gutted bear of a movie sparks a viewer's interest to see better works than its existence is worth it."

It's visually spectacular. It's very bright, joyful and serene. Then there is a very unsettling score that actually makes me feel anxious and frightened. It's not like horror film music or anything like that, I can only describe it as tense and there is this aspect to it that makes it feel like your ears are ringing or almost like bagpipes. The cinematography is very wide and spacious but the music feels almost claustrophobic. It's so hard to explain.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's about a cult in Sweden and I won't really tell you much about it but just know they are getting their freak on. My biggest issue with the film are the main characters who play the Americans. Outside of the female lead, the acting is a bit corny. It feels like a bad teen movie.

","An impressive work, ""Midsommar"" is Ari Aster's follow-up to ""Herditary,"" a decent if flawed horror film.<br/><br/>""Midsommar"" follows Dani, who, after the tragic loss of her parents and sister, decides to follow her increasingly distant boyfriend and his friends on a trip to Sweden to visit the pagan cult commune their roommate, Pelle, grew up in. While seemingly open and friendly, it becomes obvious fairly quickly that something else is going on here. The obvious comparisons to ""The Wicker Man"" are not uncalled for.<br/><br/>First, in the interest of full disclosure, this review is based on the nearly three-hour Director's Cut of the film rather than the theatrical release. I haven't even seen the theatrical release, so I can't attest as to what was added in the nearly 30 new minutes. I will say that the Director's Cut is pretty seamless and doesn't seem to have any superfluous scenes.<br/><br/>Second, we need to start with the elephant in the room and address how this compares to ""Hereditary,"" which as I stated was okay but flawed. The major flaw in that film is that it has its own internal consistency, but doesn't have consistency from an audience standpoint. There's only the most minor of hints as to the truth, and it's clear that in that world, such things were possible, but the audience isn't really let in on the answer until the end. The audience has to think about it to get that internal logic. I'm usually the type that doesn't like spoonfeeding information to the audience, but this withheld a little too much.<br/><br/>Okay, that was ""Hereditary."" So how does ""Midsommar"" compare? Well, it's far better in terms of letting the audience in on the secret and revealing its internal logic. But, sometimes it's too good at it. There's not much of a secret. You know what's ultimately coming.<br/><br/>However, interestingly this is where the brilliance of the movie actually comes in. Much like life and sex, it's about the journey, not the destination. We know where we're going, but the fun is in seeing how we get there. And it's a fun and colorful journey. This is bright daytime horror, taking place in Sweden at Midsommar when there is very little darkness at night, which itself could be a metaphor in that we can see the end and know where we're going.<br/><br/>So, why only 8 stars? The film is great, but definitely not perfect and has a couple deep flaws. I could give the film a little more credit if it did conceal the end a little more, giving a less obvious ""twist."" The other is that it sticks pretty close to traditional character archetypes for horror films. If you don't know what I mean, this was very well addressed in ""Cabin in the Woods."" A little more variety and a little added creativity could have elevated ""Midsommar's"" score. While it's still great, don't expect a perfect film."

","This is a film that you have to keep an open mind with. I was expecting a lot of hate from the mainstream horror fans on here and was not mistaken. I really didn't expect all the hate from ""WICKER MAN"" fans, though. I do see the similarities, but they both stand on their own as great movies.
This film creates a different sort of terror and it unfolds right before your eyes. You can see it coming, but it makes it no less terrifying.
Apart from this being a ""horror"" film, it is a beautiful art house film at the same time. The production design, cinematography and overall direction are superb. Dreamy. Nightmarish. Trippy as f#$k. As someone who has experimented with strong hallucinogens, this film triggers something inside me, gets that 3rd eye open to where I felt like I was tripping myself. If anyone else had a similar reaction I would be very interested in hearing it.
But I digress. Now, this is definitely not a movie that everyone will have the patience for.

It turns out it isn't the well-known herring infused festivities they expected, as they find themselves amidst a pagan sect with dubious motives to their visit. Aster pulls it off with a tremendous setting, beautiful cinematography, and ambitious story, that - together with a brilliant cast down to the minor roles - leaves you with a great piece of horror. While his previous installment ""Heredetary"" had more of the classical components for a film of the genre, in ""Midsommar"", he focuses on a more overarching unsettling tone that really crawls under your skin.

The score and musical performance in the story convincingly makes you drop your guard and feel at home, yet the quiet stillness and vastness of the setting provides an unnerving atmosphere making you feel domething is off. What adds to the horror is even horror scenes are shot in a lustrous backdrop. The performances in the movie is excellent and even the cult members are believably charming. They even seem normal, which makes it even more disturbing when the movie reaches its climax. I am amazed at the music performed by the actors and the singing. They actually sounded good and could have made for a great musical if Ari Aster had chosen. The flaw would be the plot and lack of character investment but Ari Aster's masterful direction draws you to the events and you are as spellbound as the characters. Though the movie features some gore, it is used very judiciously. But for me the most terrifying aspect of the movie is how even the most beautiful setting could be used to create such horror. I am not sure if others would like the movie but it took me an hour to recover after watching it, so I highly recommend watching this movie before arriving upon any judgment. This is a movie to be viewed and experienced."

"Benslie","8","3","7","10 July 2019"," A slow paced film but a gorgeous looking one
","First of all, this film is two-hours and twenty-seven-minutes and for the first hour you don't really feel the time but towards the end, you could definitely feel it as it starts to drag on. I will admit that all of the scenes in this film were necessary for the film but just dragged on far too long. This could be because the director, Ari Aster, wanted to show off the sets but it still doesn't need to be that long. I will say though that all of the sets were gorgeous, and you could tell the set designers got to have fun with this movie. This film only takes place in one location which without good set design would get boring after a bit but because everything was beautiful to look at, I didn't mind. Also, the cinematography was outstanding in this film. You can easily see in both of Ari Aster's films that he really cares about cinematography and how it can help show the story and change the way people feel. I will say there are some cool transition techniques that were used in this film to help change from one location to the next. Now, I'm not going to roast the actors because it's obvious that they all were giving it their all in this movie but at the same time I just couldn't get invested into these characters at all. They all pretty much seemed like the exact same character trait just changed slightly a bit. But really throughout the entire film, they just remained that same flat kind of character. In the end, this film may not have been for me but for others, it might be worth checking out. At least watch clips of it to see the stunning scenery and cinematography."

Most horror movies have very dark and claustrophobic visuals, but Midsommar is very bright and pristine: covered in open flowers and picturesque landscapes. I was fascinated by how such classically beautiful scenes could contain such horror in the storyline, and I think the movie did a very good job of contrasting these. The images stuck with me the next day.<br/><br/>The film is not very horrifying; I did not find it suspenseful. I think the feeling is more like doom: the feeling you would get from traveling into a strange new culture and doing something horrifyingly offensive while on drugs. It's fun!

"MomoFuzz","8","2","4","12 March 2020"," Gorgeous Slow Burn Horror
","Ari Aster may now be one of my favorite directors. His flavor of horror is deeply personal, and therefore absolutely gut wrenching. First in Hereditary, and now in Midsommar, he shows mastery in the mix of both human tragedy and grotesque horror to impart such stomach churning dread in every scene of his film. While some horror movies may be content to show us the demons in underground catacombs or the ghosts in big old mansions, Ari Aster's monsters have a through line directly to the characters' psyche. These characters demand the viewer to step into their mind. Empathy is the key to both these films.<br/><br/>Midsommar is an exploration of that human empathy. How much are people willing to tolerate in order to have that sense of belonging? To be understood by anyone, even if by monsters? Midsommar is a slow film, but it doesn't mean that it isn't fascinating. It gives the film space to explore the layers of manipulation and psychological evolution that our protagonist Dani goes through. It does of course end with a traditional horror-infused bang, but the set pieces weren't my focus by the end. They even felt a bit superfluous. I mostly wanted to know more about this cult and how Dani was dealing with it. I felt like I was one of those anthropologists, conveniently watching and analyzing on the safe side of the screen.<br/><br/>The cinematography and art direction were also just gorgeous. Who thinks to make a horror movie where everything takes place in broad daylight in the idyllic pastures of Sweden? Yet it worked. They nailed all the creepy, ominous moods and tensions. The sound design and editing carried many of these scenes and they were excellent."

","This movie is worth watching but that doesn't mean it's good. The lore in this movie is very interesting but the plot is just very generic, 5 ""friends"" went on vacation somewhere to write their thesis; a white blonde girl with anxiety and traumas, her boyfriend, the one that forms part of the cult (or whatever the tribe was), and two other characters that doesn't matter at all, a black man and the funny one. These characters are supposed to be friends but in the movie doesn't feel like that, nobody ever laughs at Mark's jokes and that made me feel like they're just partners of work or something, there is no chemistry between Josh and Mark or Josh and Christian, the movie is more focussed on the girl and the cult.<br/><br/>Good thing on this movie is the cinematografy, at least 85% of the images i see in this movie are beatiful and the camera movement is just incredibly well made. I wish i could say the production design is great too but i mean, how difficult was to write the environment this movie was going to have? A mountain with some houses made out of wood and something else, i do like some details on the production design but almost everything is too generic.

(i know it has to be some clues at the first beginning but it's just full of dialogue that it's difficult to understand everything at first), who was the man wearing Mark's skin?, WHO and WHY was the girl with the big lips?.<br/><br/>Christian, Mark and Josh were incredibly boring characters, beautiful cinematography, beautiful soundtrack, horrible storytelling, interesting lore, plot is so wack, unnecesary sex scene and not too well directed (it could be better by not making it so slow and uncomfortable), i don't know how to feel about the gore since i think it's unnecesary too but in the same way i believe it's like a good intro of how nasty this movie could be.

Cannibal Holocaust but in rural fictionalized Sweden. They try to play everything else up as weird, but its all vapid; there isn't much in the way of symbolism, especially any that meaningfully ties to the plot. There is no catharsis, no development, no depth of character, nothing of substance for all the odness to hold onto.

"patriciogl10","8","2","4","1 January 2020"," A peculiar yet great film.
","To be honest, I had my reservations before watching this film, as I read some comments online and heard mostly negative things about it. The slow pace mistakingly perceived as ""boring"", the plot being weird and bizzarre, amongst other negative remarks. The film indeed starts slow, but it has to build a story, its characters and everything that drives and motivates them. Dani, the main character (played by a magnificent Florence Pugh) is concerned with her sister's state of mind, as she is not responding messages which keeps Dani upset, having only her boyfriend to rely on, who thinks Dani's sister is being dramatic as she always is. Shocking news come Dani's way as she learns about the decease of her sister and her parents in a strange episode never truly revealed on dialogue. Her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) and his friends are planning a trip to Sweden, to one of the friends' (Pelle, Vilhem Blomgren) village, where everybody is set to celebrate a midsummer festival which takes place once in a lifetime.<br/><br/>The Swedish villagers take part in rather strange and morbid rituals which in their eyes are seen as traditional costumes which have been carried out for many many years. Situations take an even more bizarre turn with some members of Dani and Christian's friends begin to disappear, and from then the narrative takes the viewer through a spiralling down of grotesque scenarios evidently crafted in order to shock and disturb the audience.<br/><br/>Ari Aster knew he didn't want to make just an average conventional horror film, so he used many resources at hand to excel in a genre that often gets depreciated because the lack of quality efforts being put out every year. These filmmaking resources include unusual long takes, sometimes without close-up shots, only long shots or american shots, which gives the film its own distinctive style, combined with the daytime photography which is absolutely breathtaking. Not many films can pull off perturbing and distressing an audience without the always helpful aid of nightime.<br/><br/>These technical tools elevate the quality of the narrative and storytelling, which flows naturally without hurry, taking its time to truly develop cohesively and coherently. Events unfold into aberrant situations such as procreational sex with harmonized moans as part of a fertility ritual to name one. The experience is truly unsettling, an uncomfortable watch that challenges viewers' perception on the abnormal ways of these Swedish villagers, as opposed to what a normal civilization accepts as normal behaviour.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film, and certainly had a much fitting closure than Ari Aster's previous film Hereditary, which in my personal view was completely off in regards to what came before. Midsommar is an unusual film, with a distinctive directorial style and filmmaking techniques that embellish the final product, which is essentially great, yet misunderstood."

Midsommar manages to feel like an entirely new story, although both concepts turn out to be similar (creepy cult-looking stuff). Going into the movie theater, I was expecting to get ""kickked up"" like Hereditary had previously done, but I was very pleasantly surprised. This movie had excellent character development, and the emphasis was really on the relationship between the two main characters, Christian and Dani. Even though I didn't walk out of the movie theater shaken and with a new point of view, it was really fun to watch and also had its fair share of creepy and unsettling moments. Once again, Ari Aster hides so many details throughout the movie and the foreshadowing is crazy, which makes it a really fun experience to try to notice all the ""secrets"". This movie was much more casual for me, and a good entertaining psychological horror. I would recommend, but beware, this movie is also quite long, and slow-paced, which might not please everyone. I personally really liked it, it was a much lighter storyline and the cinematography was brilliant in my opinion, conveys emotion really well.<br/><br/>Another favourite from Ari! A deeper look into unhealthy and dying relationship dynamics. If you think you're about to see a ""Blumhouse"" type of movie, this is not it, this is more of a drama.

It reminded me, at least in tone, of the more morbid horror films in which at a certain point things start becoming so bleak that you're less expecting surprise and more preparing for an emotional drain. Its a bit like Bone tomahawk, cell block 99, The void or The Descent. You realize bad things are going to happen and the likelyhood of our protagonists coming out ok is looking grim. Its also at this point in the film that perception starts warping in a way that will make some people sick to their stomach. There's drugs involved, lots of drugs. The movie is in no way gory, but it is disturbing and difficult to watch. Its good, if you're looking for a serious drama, run away if you wanted popcorn flinging torture porn.<br/><br/>I give it an 8. I could totally understand some people giving it a 7 or a 9 or 10. Theres a point in the film where literally nothing is technically happening, but I could not seem to pull myself away for a coke or a break. I was stuck to my seat. I think that deserves an 8. To me, while the protagonist Florence Pugh hit it out of the park and was mesmerizing to the point of a Bjork music video level, The other characters youre watching go through this arent given enough to do.

"MrDHWong","8","2","4","14 November 2019"," A bizarre series of events held together by its gorgeous visual style
","Midsommar is a horror mystery film starring Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor. Written and directed by Ari Aster (Hereditary), it is a bizarre series of events held together by its gorgeous visual style.<br/><br/>After her sister murders her parents and herself, Dani (Florence Pugh) is in a distraught state, which puts her at odds with her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor). A short time later, Christian's friend Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) invites him and his group of friends to join them in Pelle's midsummer festival in Sweden. Hoping to ease Dani's mind, Christian decides to bring her with him to the festival and upon arriving at the commune, the two discover that the group of celebratory participants are all members of a centuries old Pagan cult with strange, backward traditions.<br/><br/>While it is certainly not for all tastes, Midsommar manages to stand uniquely among today's modern horror films due to its interesting stylistic choices. The film's slow pace will be off-putting to many viewers but it is necessary in building tension as we are shown the increasingly unsettling nature of the cult. This creepy build up in atmosphere kept me invested in the story as I feel that simply having the cult shown to be weird from the very beginning would have not left as much impact. The only other cult related films that are similar to this would be The Wicker Man and Eyes Wide Shut.<br/><br/>Visually, this film is rather beautiful to look at. I particularly loved the production design and creative cinematography. Even though each cult member wears white, they are given one unique feature about them, whether it's a facial irregularity or the colour of their hair. Yet, from a distance, they all appear to look the same. The film's stunning use of cinematography often framed the screen in the style of a painting and sometimes there were subtle uses of asymmetry to remind us that not everything is as it should be. It's rare for films of this type to employ this type of quality control, and I believe we have writer/director Ari Aster to thank for this.<br/><br/>In terms of the cast, they all did a fine job. None of the main actors felt wasted and were each given their own special moment to shine. However, Florence Pugh left the strongest impression due to how expressive she was during the film's most intense scenes. It would be difficult to show the amount of distraught her character is going through without resorting to hammy overacting, but thankfully Pugh manages to rise above this to give a solid, memorable performance.<br/><br/>Overall, this likely won't scare too many people as I don't believe it is intended for mainstream audiences, but those who have an affinity for art films or surrealist pieces should find the right amount of entertainment value.

","I'm going to totally spoil this, so stop reading now.<br/><br/>This is second remake of ""The Wicker Man"". Note that I also have mixed feelings about the original ""cult classic"", as well as about the Nicholas Cage remake, though the latter at least had the virtue of being funny.<br/><br/>Here, the setting is Sweden. The evil pagan cultists are even more obviously depraved. The body-count is higher. And the film-maker is even more obviously on the side of the evil pagan cultists. The Christian (or anti-Christian?) themes of the first film is largely absent, and the only nod to them is that the poor doomed slob who will be the central final sacrifice is here named ""Christian"".<br/><br/>I watched the longer, slower directors cut, but despite that, the film kept my interest throughout the buildup (where most of the extra scenes were). But eventually, at not too far past the mid-point, my interest began to flag. This is the point where the poor doomed idiots, who were visiting this hippy-trippy commune of ancient Swedish pagans, ought to have started to realise they were in serious trouble, and attempt to formulate a plan of escape and survival. Their failure to wise up and attempt to save themselves, deprived the second half of the film of tension, and effectively transformed the film it a celebration of evil.<br/><br/>Another innovation is that the poor doomed slob who the pagans end up burning alive is not the central protagonist. Rather, the central protagonist is his girlfriend, evidently intended to be a more-sympathetic character than he is. She is also the only character who seems on the verge of figuring anything out. But instead of trying to save her friends and herself, she decides to join the hippy-trippy pagans, leave her friends to die, and smile as her not-so-good boyfriend gets burned alive. Are we supposed to be happy for her?.<br/><br/>Fascinating, I guess. But is it good."

","This contains spoilers! Ten minutes into this movie, I was intrigued. twenty minutes in, I was way ahead of the movie. OK, a traumatized young woman travels with her boyfriend and his friends to a utopian community in Sweden.. Everyone in the community is wearing white and is strangely friendly, but not really helpful. How many horror movies start this way? Sorry, but I don't like movies that a) promote the torture of animals. The bear in the small cage sent a signal to me to turn this off. b) the ritual of killing their elderly by throwing them off a cliff and smashing their heads in, and the comeback line from one of the Americans is, ""Well, we put our elderly in group homes."" Are you kidding me? Historically, there were actually real people who tried to set up real communities that were compassionate and idealistic. Brook Farm comes to mind, which would make for a much more complex and humane look at people who attempt to live alternate life styles. But this is just pure Hollywood with a touch of sadism. Not for me. Give me a movie that actually tries to grapple with humankind trying to come to terms with the best and the worst in itself. Actually I don't agree with the critiques that condescendingly called this movie ""artsy."" What's wrong with trying interesting camera work, different pacing, and a more slowly developed plot? To me, that was the interesting part of the movie. But the utopian community as a thinly disguised hell is not new and the torture of animals is just cruel and inhumane. Try a more difficult plot, one that actually refelcts real huan behavror and not decades old Hollywood tropes about cults."

"paul-2148","8","2","4","10 October 2019"," Ari Aster is the New Hitchcock.
","This isn't as terrifying and mind boggling as Hereditary but it's a terrific follow up. Both films follow similar themes: death of family members, struggles with grief, hallucinatory states of consciousness, and mysterious religious cults. I have always found psychological horror more terrifying than physical horror and though there are plenty of scares and murders it is the psychological dread that Aster's characters go through that is truly horrifying. Midsommar for the most part is the story of relationships. The lead, character, Dani suffers through a Horrifying family tragedy, and in her grief she is mostly alone in the world trying to cope with a her immense sadness. Her boyfriend seems void of any compassion And completely incapable of comforting her in a meaningful way. I think this is the central theme of the film. How does our modern, superficial society deal with profound loss and tragedy?
There's a terrifying scene where Dani, in Sweden for the first day with her boyfriend and his roommates takes hallucinatory drugs and has a really really bad trip. Knowing what she is going through personally and watching her unravel is both heart breaking and horrifying. From this moment on, most of the characters are in a sort of fugue state until the end of the film. The events that follow in Sweden are really what the film is about but it's our connection to Dani that makes what is absurd and shocking seem intimate and relatable.
Midsommar isn't so much a horror film as it is a psychological journey through hell, and for the most part it all happens in gorgeous sunlight in a breath taking landscape. This is no accident. Most horror films seem to take place in the dark because we are supposedly afraid of the dark but there are some pretty terrible things happening in broad daylight too."

","I wasn't as captivated watching Midsommar as I was with Hereditary, but with that said, this is a one of a kind film experience that had me in a state of laughing mania when the credits rolled. Bizarre doesn't even begin to explain where this film takes you. Some moments pulled me out of the film's ever growing psychotropic mania, but they were done well enough to actually keep me engaged. The character of Dani was incredibly acted and deserves some sort of praise during award season. Grief, anxiety and trauma are hard to depict on their own but in this case they are intertwined like what we see her go through is actually happening. Doesn't live up to the weirdness of Mulholland Drive but boy does it come close."

"dog-56427","8","2","4","27 September 2019"," When you make a fantasy realistic....
","This film was enjoyable because the director played with tone, cinematogrophy, fantasy, and realism to increase the depth and the shock of the story. It is about a cult that acts like fantasy but everything they do is real crazy. When the group drives up to the cult property the camera is turned upside down as a preview of what will come. At the cult the people are nice but not too nice which fools your expectations and they live in a beautiful setting where nothing sinister can be suspected. Everyone talks like real life not like actors. There is little cgi. When the lead is betrayed by her boyfriend she and ten other female cult members scream in unison with her same body movements - almost an orgy of primal therapy. When her boyfriend is burned alive she was pleased not shocked revealing she too had become a cult member. Since every film plot has been redone many times directors have to get creative with other aspects to increase the shock effect. Ari Aster has done this well. If you like David Lynch and Tim Burton this film is for you. Midsommar is not a masterpiece but a recommend and I will see it again to look for things I missed."
"APRI6ION","6","2","4","26 September 2019"," Overhyped, like everything these days but definitely worth a look-see...
","Much like Ari Aster's first film, this is a well constructed drama that insidiously morphs into horror, leaving one to reflect on the many signposts that lead to its inevitable climax.<br/><br/>Not so good: The American characters are largely uninteresting and unsympathetic, whether that was the intention, I don't really care. There are also problems with the running time and like nearly every film that comes out now, it needs a damn good trimming. Ironically I hear that the director is prepping a longer director's cut - lordy give me strength!!<br/><br/>Good: this is a very handsome film, the lighting is some of the best I have ever seen and complements the excellent framing and production design, which has clearly been produced with serious TLC. The plot unfolds with a tantalising amount of unease and there are some very effective, well-controlled moments. Its best feature though, is that there is a lot here to unpick and a second viewing will surely unearth some hidden diddlers that were missed first time around.<br/><br/>It has obvious genetic links with The Wicker Man and it's fair to make comparisons but to say it is simply a rip off is a very blunt observation indeed... those reviewers need to learn some nuance. 6.5-7/10"
"ale-toff94","5","2","4","26 September 2019"," I was expecting more
","I had really high hopes for this movie. Maybe this was caused by the raving reviews it received or maybe because I was expecting something different.
I'll start from what I liked and continue with what I didn't.
The cast was really superb, Florence Pugh in particular plays the main character Dani with an incredible intensity. I also really appreciated Vilhelm Blomgren in the part of the Swedish Pelle which from the start of the movie showed an ambiguous behaviour toward the protagonist.
I also really liked the setting, cinematography and music. The fact that the majority of the scenes set in Sweden creates something really different from similar plotted movies (for example The Wicker Man and the recent Apostle). It also makes a huge contrast between the first part of the movie which is set in the US and consists of a lot of scenes shot at night or indoor with little illumination. Also a lot of scenes are shot from quite a distance, a technique which adds realism and creates a strong juxtaposition with the close-ups of the actors.
Another good point was the decision to not insert subtitles for the dialogues in Swedish, which creates confusion in the viewer.<br/><br/>What I didn't like are some of the supporting characters. Starting from Mark, he showed very little empathy for Dani, knowing well her personal story. I doubt that someone would be so insensitive in the real life. More generally the characters, with the exception for Dani, don't show such a strong response to what happens in the village. After thinking about that I can state that's probably caused by the drugs that they are constantly obliged to swallow. But is still a bit upsetting that after witnessing people jumping from a cliff and die Christian (Dani's boyfriend) not only doesn't want to leave but is more eager to stay and write his thesis about the traditions of the village. Also Josh, one of the students visiting, is highly fascinated about the strange tradition of the suicide. Maybe I don't get it since I'm not an anthropologist, who knows.
But the real problem for me is the plot. It is not particularly bad or ""filled"" with holes, simply is not so surprising. The direction in which it is going is pretty clear from the beginning and is also hinted by some dialogues and other small details (like the figures painted inside the houses or the explanation given on how the can continue to keep a certain number of inhabitants ). Even if it is admirable inserting self references in movies when they are not subtle and hint major plot's point they became a mere exercise and can ruin the twists that would happen later.<br/><br/>In conclusion the movie has a great setting, a great cast and a stylish direction but lacks in plot and doesn't present many surprises."
"omendata","5","2","4","25 September 2019"," Wicker Man vs The Village
","I was really looking forward to this movie after all the hype but sadly it does not meet expectations.<br/><br/>For one it is overly long and could have an hour taken off as this contributes to the languid pace and does not create enough tension.<br/><br/>Unlike the Wicker Man from 1973 this film does not conjure up that mystical dread that the original does and the crazy screaming and antics of the cult just becomes laughable after a while and really quite tedious. The Swedes just love to throw in a load of nudity but c'mon guys it was boring in the 70's and its even sadder now that you have to use it to try and excite the viewer.
It seems to be part of a recipe for every so called Arty Nordic movie so really not very original just like the movie itself. It does not even look like Sweden either for anyone who has actually been there!<br/><br/>It is indeed a bizarre concoction and tries to go for the foreign scary land and strange customs angle but achieves none of the fear and dread that the brilliant Hostel gives to the viewer. The movie is far too long and this just becomes an exercise in tedium as it meanders its way from scene to scene and they could not even come up with a different ending than the Wicker Man and is really just a very poor copy of an original classic. Even the Nic Cage remake is better than this artsy fartsy effort and you can tell by all the pontificating ever-so-clever shill reviews which just illustrates that half of these so called arty types have not got a clue what the average man in the street wants to watch or even what they are talking about!<br/><br/>Very disappointed - It is true... ""Don't Believe The Hype!!!""."
"ksgillihan","6","2","4","27 August 2019"," Worst vacation ever or: hey drink this.
","Been waiting for a while to see this film and I purposely avoided any spoilers so that I could experience this movie fully. I'm not exactly sure what to even say about this film. It's not exactly a horror. More like a thriller with shock elements. The main character Dani has a pretty messed up life from the start of the movie. Her crazy sister plays ""puff, puff, pass"" with her parents and a tube connected to the exhaust pipe of a couple cars. Yeah. I guess this is supposed to set up the idea that she is a bit hollow inside and needing some sort of fulfillment or purpose after all she went through. Why not then go to Europe to participate in a pagan ritual with a bunch of strangers? What's the worst that could happen?<br/><br/>The main characters who are the outsiders to this community seem to not be all that bright. From the instant they set foot on the soil owned by this community, someone offers them drugs and they say ""hey why not?"" Who doesn't like to mix unknown rituals with drugs in a foreign land? I sure do. So Dani falls to peer pressure and trips balls on some magic mushrooms. She runs around and starts thinking some crazy thoughts. This should have been the first red flag. Nah though, these are just some harmless strangers who like giving drugs to outsiders. Nothing to worry about. Soon more rituals start. The group of outsiders are baffled by what they are seeing but their ""friend"" who invited them explains away their fears by being very specifically vague about everything. It's all pretty innocent as things continue but oh hey! two old people just high-dived off a cliff and landed on their faces. Uh, oh. Good thing Pelle the friend is there to mutter some non-specific mumbo jumbo to make them feel better. Yeah these people are so dumb that it actually works for the most part.<br/><br/>The odd rituals continue but two of the people have finally seen enough. They decide to leave but what's this? The boyfriend has already left to get the train and has left his girl behind; says a very not suspicious random cult member. This makes sense. We'll go with that. Now a day later it looks like both the boyfriend and girlfriend are gone. This bothers the rest of the outsider group for a solid 2 minutes at least. On to more important things. The nerd of the group says he wants to do his thesis paper on the community. Sounds good right? Sure, just as long as you don't take any pictures of this sacred book. So that's exactly what he does. I guess he must have looked like a barrel because some dude goes all Donkey Kong on nerd guy's head with a giant mallet when he's distracted by someone wearing his buddies face. What? so these outsiders are getting killed by this crazy ritualistic cult? NO WAY! Why who could have ever seen this coming? Anyone. Anyone could have. So now there are only two of them left and since blowing that popsickle stand like there's no tomorrow isn't on the itinerary, the two morons stay.<br/><br/>After some May-pole so you think you can dance-off, Dani is crowned the queen! Hey this is all normal right? Of course it is. While Dani is driven off in a carriage her boyfriend (who is drugged, big surprise!) decides he's going to go do the deed with one of the cult girls. We see a large house with a bunch of women who should never been seen naked, naked all in a circle around the wanton maiden. Idiot number 1 decides there's nothing weird about this and decides that instead of run for the hills, he's going to bone her. A nice old naked lady even helps by pushing his  forwards for him while he's in mid-coitis. Aww. Anyway, Dani returns from her ride and goes to see what ever could all these sex noises inside a barn be? Oh boy, she sees her boyfriend banging another girl. She is horrified of course. Probably from the combination of seeing her boyfriend cheating and also lots of gross and saggy things. Idiot number 1 rushes out of the building after he is spent and runs into yet another corpse of one of his friends. Hey, I thought they had just left to catch a train? What gives?<br/><br/>So the community announces that they are going to do one final ritual with 9 people being sacrificed. Since there have been 4 outsiders killed and 2 old people who smashed their faces and now 2 cult volunteers; there's only 1 spot left. As the ""queen"" Dani gets to chose the last. If you guessed that she picks her boyfriend who is then stuffed inside a bloody bear carcass and burned alive inside a barn with the others, you win a prize. Your prize is this mystery drink. Go ahead, drink it. What could happen?"
"jackamccallum","8","2","4","9 August 2019"," Violent, Shocking, Strangely Funny and Slow Burning Second Film from Ari Aster
","I occasionally had to take my eye of the screen for a few seconds during Midsommar's run time as the gore in this film is shocking and brutal to look at just as violence in a horror movie should be. Although Midsommar is not as thought provoking or primal fear inducing as Aster's previous film 'Hereditary' it is still an incredible follow up and another great addition to the horror genre. The direction in this film has noticeably improved since Aster's last film with some incredible long takes and beautiful cinematography and camera work. The performance by Florence Pugh has a raw intensity to it and is deeply magnetic with her taking over the screen every time she appears. Most surprising about Midsommar is how funny it can be. I often found myself cackling, sometimes at Will Poulter's Josh who is by far the funniest character of the film but also at the absurdity of the situation the characters are in. Midsommar doesn't leave the audience with the same empty soul crushing feeling as Hereditary does but still leaves you with a strange uneasy feeling by the time the credits roll. It is a great second attempt from Aster and I am excited to see what horrors he will unveil next."
"harrylosborne","5","2","4","6 August 2019"," So much promise destroyed by a total lack of story
","It's like a curse with horror films - good trailer, good visuals, a decent first half - and then absolutely no end product. A24 Studios are a prime culprit themselves, having now produced three individual horror films (It Comes At Night, The Witch) that all fail to deliver on expectations past a pleasing aesthetic. Horror has always been an oversaturated genre with very little quality, but this is normally down to a terrible storyline or a plot that has no visual quality to back it up. Arguably, examples such as Midsommar are even worse, when given a budget and platform without a worthy script.<br/><br/>Midsommar follows Dani (Florence Pugh), a deeply disturbed 20-something going on holiday with her boyfriend and his friends to Sweden for a mid-summer festival. Following the death of her sister and parents 6 months earlier (in an intensely disturbing but gripping opening scene), her mental state is vulnerable, leading her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) to resent her somewhat, particularly when she decides to join them on their trip. The opening hour is full of bright visuals, fields in full bloom and some light-hearted traditions; these slowly begin to degrade into slightly more sinister rituals, as the group become fractured through their individual experiences at the festival.<br/><br/>This is where the plot begins to die: Midsommar (just like with so many other horror flicks) commits the cardinal sin of leaving the story to ""the audience's interpretation"". This is not a clever technique, and only works if the foundations are extraordinarily well-built; otherwise, the production company is solely to blame for lazy writing. Everything falls apart - none of the group question the obviously insane actions of the cult, nor the growing numbers of disappearing people. In the end, you're waiting for the film to end purely to stop wasting your time with pseudo-mysticism."
"basildave","8","2","4","6 August 2019"," Disturbing but well done pyschological horror
","The atmosphere of this movie is continuously dark, even when the scenery changes to the perpetually sunlit summer in Sweden. Dani's mental trauma is pretty well executed even though it's a little too contrived and ill explained (rather the events that lead to it)... but it still works and when Dani invites herself on the trip, there is the first bits of humor that are sprinkled throughout this movie, despite its' very dark nature...<br/><br/>The horrors depicted in the movie build relatively slowly, from the disturbing to the truly horrifying and are logically justified along the way (in at least a believable manner that requires less suspension of disbelief). They accumulate to the full-on realization of what is going on that is also foretold in some of the mid-film dialogue... Some of the highly disturbing scenes are actually broken up slightly by a twisted humor that the director actually drags out of the audience (which I saw first hand)... people laughing at aspects of the horror all together, as if orchestrated by the director.<br/><br/>The actors, who I barely knew except for Will Poulter, were great; having to endure pretty much the full spectrum of abuse that a bevy of movies could throw at them, much less a single film. I like that Josh (William Jackson Harper) is really the intellectual leader of this group and knows some of the things that will be happening.<br/><br/>I can't imagine this movie will be part of the Swedish tourism bureau's repertoire of midsommer things to do and see to entice tourists ... maybe I'll just wait for winter to visit Stockholm...<br/><br/>Others I've talked to have been of the same opinion, which is that this is a hard film to say ""I enjoyed it"" but I liked it a lot, much the same way you might like a slow burn hot sauce that you know will put you in pain but you have to taste it."

","To begin, I would like to emphasize how you might have mixed thoughts and feelings after watching this movie. Nonetheless, it is definitely worth watching.<br/><br/>The move starts slowly and you might think that it is more of the drama or thriller than the horror move. We are presented with most of the main characters at the very beginning of the story and there is a long period of time until we get to know others and their real intentions, so keep focused.<br/><br/>The color is done perfectly. The beginning of the movie is made in cold colors showing deep pain and personal problems between our characters. The rest of the movie is actually done in bright and vivid colors creating the oxymoron between what is happening in the scene and how majority of the characters are reacting to the events. It is luring us with the fake innocent atmosphere. Even during the brutal parts the scene is colorful, creating perfect feeling of discomfort that we sometimes lack in tense situations.<br/><br/>Midsommar is also full of symbolism and foreshadowing. I would definitely recommend watching it twice as you would experience it differently. There are many details that are going to help you understand why some things happened later on. You are going to be immersed in the the amount of detail that creators have put to create rituals and related events look legitimate. Keep attention to the drawings and dialogues.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I must admit that I was disappointed by the amount of fear I have experienced watching this movie. It is full of brutal and morbid scenes, but very few of them are actually going to scare you. As the story progresses the blood will just start to mix with other segments of the movie like dead bodies, narcotics and orgies so it all just loses its influence on the viewer.<br/><br/>Lastly, I believe that ending is too long and not explained well. The move would have been perfect if they spent more time explaining the ending and rewinding the scenes with ""Oh that happened while the camera was turned off!"" effect. Nonetheless, it has a great potential to become the classic like Shining with its original and definitely interesting scary story!"

"Exeter79","5","2","4","28 July 2019"," So I finally took revenge on my boyfriend
","This movie left me with the impression of having been written by a woman who is angry againt her boyfriend or husband and would like so much to take a hideous revenge on him. This pretty much sums up the movie as well. Dani is portrayed as a totally positive, innocent victim. Christian, on the contrary, has not a single saving attribute: he's a cheating, insensitive, weak, egoistic, liar and opportunist. Even worse, he forgets her birthday and how long they have been in a relationship! No mercy, no forgiveness is possible. Dani's closing smile while he's dying the most horrible death is her hideous revenge. It is her who condemns him to such death.
The story is pretty boring and can't imagine many to get enthusiastic about it. Maybe some angry feminists could see in the female-dominated society of the Pagan village a good proof of women's superiority, and in Christian's character a perfect example of male uselessness and inferiority. Actually, ""The Wicker Man"", from 1973, already exploited the idea of a modern Norse Pagan community in a horror movie. ""Midsommar"" is, anyway, beautifully shot and the score is very effective."

","Solid writing, great acting, and much stranger than it has any right being. The movie is largely well done, though it does over stay its welcome by the end. A full hour longer than most films in the genre, MidSommar could have been far more impactful if it hadn't meandered so much through the back half of the film. This isn't a long movie that takes advantage of each moment of screen time, this is a long movie with a a number of removable scenes and a multitude of scenes worth shortening. Hereditary suffered in a similar fashion, but unlike Aster's first go, MidSommar lacks the fearful uncomfortability of its predecessor, and opts for more awkward uncomfortability instead. While far more original than much of the films surrounding it, having only five combined minutes of fear over the course of a 150 minute film leaves MidSommar a lackluster addition to the genre."
"MouazHajBakri","7","2","4","7 July 2019"," Rich in ideas, yet poor in emotional magnitude, Ari Aster is back again in a recommended interesting horror/drama experiment
","Midsommar, directed and written by Ari Aster, is his second project after the horrifying terrific ""Hereditary"". It's set by a familiar nightmarish thematic that builds itself by distortion of time and place, igniting by an unbearable life-shifting trauma while shaping itself by an expressionistic strategy aided by stunning cinematography and camera tricks, and performed brilliantly in a simple and natural quality that enhances the sense of truthfulness to its alien environment. By the first 10 minutes of the first act of this slowly paced horror experiment, it becomes clear that Aster is highly interested in portraying the psychological manifestation of trauma, mental illness, internal and external conflicts, along with family and relationships dynamics. What stands different in Midsommar is the expansion of ideas and symbolism in what produces a byproduct eclipse of character definition and therefore the emotional investment in the story arc.<br/><br/>Midsommar tells the story of 5 college students taking a trip suggested by their friend to Sweden, particularly to a small distant and almost out of the world village where a small community lives by rituals that are uniquely creepy and bizarre. This cult's core belief dwell on unifying with nature and land; it worships fertility and attempts to maintain an inhuman level of harmony. It has reshaped the concept of family and used past traumas as fuel to their non-stopping efforts to what seems as deep struggles to forsake all pain of grief, the fear of loss, and the inevitability of aging and death. Aster conveniently used the summer of a distant village in Sweden to obscure the familiar rhythm of night and day, and uniquely filmed a horror movie in unending light. Also, he forbade the setting of any privacy by filming in an open field that is filled with all kinds of unintroduced villagers that never stop performing different and simultaneous rituals. Thus, Midsommar is theatrical, unsettling, with an inevitable sense of distance from the story and its inhabitants.<br/><br/>There is a clear mockery of remoteness between different cultures as well as a deconstruction of all forced efforts of inclusion. The arc also plays on different notes of relationship dynamics, alienation, and existentialism. Aster fixated on these ideas and how expressionism will magnify the creepiness of the story, but by doing that I believe he injected too many unto too simple and maybe even absent character arcs. This is evident by Aster's elimination of half the characters abruptly so it would be easier for the viewer to fixate on the two only main characters that are relatively better defined. However, the setting denied any sense of privacy and was constantly filled with too many people, therefor Aster's efforts to maintain the connection with the main character fell flat for me, and this would become obvious with a quick comparison with Hereditary's mother, father, and son who are the sole characters in their small indoor setting that made the experience personal, relatable, and much scarier.<br/><br/>Despite the shortcomings of Midsommar, its intentions were high and lots of its missions are achieved. It is an interesting horror/drama movie that very well deserves to be experienced and proves that Ari Aster is innovative, has big ideas, understands how camera works and what it can convey, and definitely can be considered as one of the most important directors of this genre that is -thankfully to his and few others' recent efforts- redefining itself to be an interesting vessel to exciting and rich films."

","I saw ""Midsommar"", starring Florence Pugh-Fighting With My Family, The Commuter; Jack Reynor-On the Basis of Sex, Transformers:Age of Extinction; William Jackson Harper-The Good Place_tv, All Good Things and Will Poulter-The Revenant, We're the Millers.
This is a trippy little movie that is written and directed by Ari Aster, the man who directed the 2018 Hereditary. I say trippy because there are some drugs administered and lots of hallucinatory nightmares popping up. Florence and Jack are in a relationship-dating about 4 years now-but things are a little strained. Florence has just lost her parents and sister and is real depressed. William and Will are Jack's friends that are planning a trip to Sweden with a Swedish foreign exchange student they recently met and they all think that it would help Florence get over her personal problems if she tagged along. Their Swedish friend takes them to his community where they are in the process of celebrating their mid_summer festival-they do it every 90 years-and wants them to even participate in some of their pagan rituals....I mean, activities. Jack and William also want to write their college thesis on the village. They soon find out that there is more going on than they had anticipated. I guess none of them have ever seen the movie Hostel.
It's rated ""R"" for disturbing ritualistic violence, grisly images, drug use, language and sexual content-including both male & female nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 27 minutes.
I don't know if I would buy it on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental, if you are not too squeamish about bodily fluids."

","This was advertised as A24 does ""The Wicker Man"". I found ""The Wicker Man"" (original, '72) laughable other than the end, and I have mixed feelings about ""Hereditary"" and most A24 horror. Still, as a horror fan, I'm interested in seeing a new stylish director find his/her own brand. If he continues the same pattern, with ""Hereditary"" and ""Midsommar"", Ari Aster's brand consists of the following:
-First half of the movie: drama about coping with grief from multiple family loss.
-Second half: revisit past horror movies as someone gets drawn into a grisly cult sacrifice.
Featuring:
-interesting cinematography
-sets that imitate dollhouses
-repulsive images
-severe bloody trauma to heads
-mutilated corpses used as ritual dolls.
-erie music
-sketches and drawings telling you exactly what is going to happen
-harm by friendly-looking people who trick the protagonists
-many naked out of shape older people
-books about mysticism
-deformed/unusual looking people
-burning men
-women in emotional agony
-men struggling to show emotions
-slow pace, interrupted by disturbing imagery<br/><br/>With both movies, I applaud the technical skill, but I am disappointed in the story resolution, and overall left more disgusted than horrified. Any sympathy I developed for the characters eventually wiltered away, as I questioned their decisions. Specifically with ""Midsommar"" much as I enjoyed some shots and appreciated the tension built up starting at midway through the film, I ended up feeling annoyed."

And it still does to some extent.<br/><br/>Although it isn't the best movie ever and I really think this isn't actually a horror movie it still managed to make me uncomfortable and interested. It starts a little slow but after the first hour things start to get weird. Some of the weirdness is surprisingly good but at most parts it gets back to slow and uninteresting.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I didn't feel any emotion or connection to any of the main characters. I felt there wasn't really any character development except for Florence Pugh's character Dani. It lacked a certain touch that made me feel like I didn't care what would happen to them. Which was a little disappointing, especially with William Jackson Harper because I love him in The Good Place.<br/><br/>There is a lot going on but not everything is explained. It sometimes feel like you've missed something. But maybe that's part of the mystery and perhaps that's what makes it good enough to keep on watching<br/><br/>Although the first part of the movie is a drag to get through the second part has enough weirdness for me to give it 5 stars."

It bothers your feelings most of the time, and keeps you in a suspended circumstance which forces you not to have any idea about the next event... really terrific and worth enough to watch it in this case(well,not for madness of course :/ ) But beside them, there are some kinda faults in it... For instance the reason and just the only one for which they didn't leave the village after those elders suiasided, why they kept staying? For what reasonable and logic reason? no any clue! that is just to make the story keeping on! Why would anyone stay in such a madhouse?!
and even the traditions of the village is another hilarious point which was organized just for storyline!! Imagine In an European country, in technology and communication era, there be a secret village with so many strange traditions and for God sake, no one in the world would know about them with their disgusting masacare!!! How possible?!
I know it's only a story organized in a post modern folk horror genre and they have meanings though; but even in this case, these defects are not admirable and they bother you whole the time you're watching!<br/><br/>I think the story goes on in a way which it tries to surprise the audiences till end and it does so, as we can see whole the time specially the last scene that it acted like a wildling and ended harshly! but those unforgettable deficiencies and of course the madness of it, feels like you don't like to watch it again or suggest it to anyone else but at the same time you wanna do it,too... :/"

","I was extremely excited to see this movie after having seen Ari Aster's Hereditary. By the last leg of the movie, I was bored and waiting patiently for it to end. What went wrong here? Firstly, the plot is The Wicker Man. Westerners visit an archaic agrarian culture that ends up being a cult that commits human sacrifice for the ""greater good."" Once you realize this, it becomes pretty apparent halfway through what's going to happen to most of the characters, then only question being how. This really kills the suspense. Additionally, other than Dani, the characters are pretty underdeveloped. We've got the mean ""bro"" who doesn't like his friend's girlfriend, the geek, the bad boyfriend... The bad boyfriend is especially one-dimensional, and he Andy Dwyer's his way through the entire movie. But worst of all, the characters commit the common horror movie trope of making bad decisions and hoping for the best to their own peril. For example, the commune gives a sign of their ambivalence of towards human life very early on. Aside from two characters, no one sees these signs as any serious threat or deal-breaker aside from two characters. As more hints are dropped that the guests are in danger, most of the characters double down on their interest in the cult, especially the one character who should really know better. The commune's tapestries in the movie foreshadow major plot points. The characters see these tapestries, and are then surprised when members of the cult perform the same rituals that they've already seen described in said tapestries. I kept waiting for the escape plan part of the plot and it never came, so I suppose that counts as a small ""surprise."" This is a complete change from the excellent character development, surprising plot developments, and relatable trauma of Hereditary.<br/><br/>The movie's saving graces are it's well-done jokes and beautiful cult traditions (dancing, eating, architecture, art)."
"gortx","Null","0","0","12 July 2019"," Interesting if overlong riff on The Wicker Man
","Coming off of his intense HERIDITARY, Ari Aster's follow-up certainly doesn't let up in the dysfunctional family drama department from the get go. A young woman, Dani (Florence Pugh), is stunned by tragedy as brutal and lacerating as anything in Aster's first film. But, even with that backdrop, the central story here is more about Dani's flagging four year old relationship with her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor). Still reeling, Dani discovers that her beau is going to go on a European road trip with two of his college buddies, Josh (William Jackson Harper) and Mark (Will Poulter). They have been invited by a Swedish student Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) to attend a summer festival in his homeland. Dani, kinda sorta invites herself.<br/><br/>Once they arrive in Sweden, Pelle informs that this isn't just any annual fest - it's a very special once every 90 years bash. Of course, anybody who's seen the movie's obvious (and acknowledged) model, 1973's THE WICKER MAN, knows -- bad things are going to happen (more on that later).<br/><br/>To Aster's credit, he doesn't just follow the typical horror movie playbook. He takes his time detailing the structure of the cult. The Scandinavian Midnight Sun setting gives it an eerie glow (the digital photography is both a plus and a minus here, with the gleaming whites sometimes veering into a milky artificial look). The story unfolds slowly and it takes a while for it to get to the heart of the matter. But, once it does, there is a certain intensity that builds, even if it never rises about a low simmer.<br/><br/>On the downside, the characters aren't very interesting, save for Dani. Outside of Pugh (who, since her breakthrough in LADY MACBETH has continued to prove to be an actress to watch), the performances are mostly flat (and that's being kind to a couple of them). If you don't care about Christian or his friends, Dani's personal trajectory is trimmed. While showing admirable restraint, Aster's pacing eventually becomes more than a bit protracted. The viewer knows where it is headed, even if the characters are too dense to see it. Those intricate ritual details are interesting at first, but, soon one wonders if Aster and his editors fell so in love with them that they lost the thread along the way, more concerned with fetishistic attention to minutiae than telling a compelling story (Aster has recently said that he is going to add another 30 minutes or more to the already bloated 147 minute run time!). At a certain point, the torpid pacing, simpleminded characters and weak development veers it into unintentional humor (yes, there are some deliberate sardonic bits). The climactic scene (while predictable) has a certain grand guinol quality that partly redeems the bloat.<br/><br/>P.S. On THE WICKER MAN comparisons. Aster has copped to the fact that his producers wanted a ""bloodier"" version of that tale. Now, as pointed out in the piece, Aster adapts Director Robin Hardy and writer Anthony Shaffer's (SLEUTH, FRENZY) piece with his own details and emphasis. Still, it's more than an homage. The outlines of the two movies are easily traced upon each other. Naming the male lead ""Christian"" is more than a bit obvious (I guess naming him ""Edward Woodward"" would have been too much?). Aster goes into far more details, but, all the elements are there in the original work (and, it's no small matter to point out that in a horror movie, what is NOT shown, can be more important - and effective - than what is). And, the ending? Really? Aster couldn't have come up with ANYTHING different?"

","If your characters are stupid, your movie is stupid. This I say to Ari Aster with all the love and hopefulness in my heart, as glad as I am that we have a high-minded director working today and elevating the horror genre to its potential. But, dude. NO ONE is sticking around after witnessing a ritual suicide, I'm sorry, but no amount of academic aspiration is gonna override basic survival instinct. And now I have to watch 2 more hours of filmmaker gymnastics attempting to justify our four friends waiting around to also be ritualistically murdered?? I'm willing to forgive an idiot character or two when the movie itself is campy and dumb, but Midsommar has all the trappings of quality. The punches don't land if the script is just weaving through generic horror-specific tropes to explain why the kids didn't all back away slowly while the swedes took a comically oversized sledgehammer to that septuagenarian's face and book it on foot to the nearest train station.<br/><br/>Don't mistake me, Ari's still at the top of my horror radar, and I eagerly await his next effort. But I might advise this: Ari, sir, please... there is no need to brutally execute a character's entire family in order for us to sympathize with them. Good lord. I mean, yeah, what a master stroke it was in Hereditary! Gut-wrenching! Shocking! A sudden blow to the face with a baseball bat the size of a telephone pole! But now I'm beginning to suspect that you carry a shallow bag of tricks, Ari. I will most likely check out if your next movie has yet another character bellowing unearthly sobs after an unimaginable tragedy. It's a bit of a bummer, man. And I'd be just as invested in Dani if, say, her boyfriend reluctantly invited her on this educational trip to the north after her dog grooming business went bust. Just brainstorming.<br/><br/>A final nitpicky note. And this goes for all filmmakers of any genre. Please, PLEASE refrain from ever again turning the camera upside down to express a sense of foreboding. Uh-oh! I think I get it! There's something sinister going on here! It's almost as if our characters' lives are about to be turned... UPSIDE DOWN. Ari Aster must be ripped because his hands are so heavy.

I understand why it's very off-putting to some, but many people will find another great film from Ari Aster.<br/><br/>I understood the film even better once I heard it's an analogy of a breakup. It just also happens to be a very, very creepy and disturbing film with a hell of an ending, if you ask me. It's not that the ending has never been done before; it's that Aster executes it in a way that gets under your skin. Very brilliantly done.<br/><br/>I found myself thinking about it a lot afterward. Even had a bit of trouble sleeping that night. It puts you into another world, a world of pure evil. Very much in the same ""world"" as Hereditary, where there is an absence of anything pure and holy, an absence of joy, and absence of goodness. Hey, it's a horror film. Isn't that what we want?<br/><br/>If hell exists, this is very much what I would imagine it would be like. Visually, you might at first think what you're seeing is beautiful, but you slowly start to realize you're not in paradise. It's the opposite.<br/><br/>Not quite as good as Hereditary, but very memorable nonetheless.<br/><br/>Ari Aster is a genius. I'm sorry if you disagree. I think he's truly a master at his craft."
"manuel_medeiros","8","4","12","27 April 2020"," How can something so f-ed up be so beautiful
","It is worth saying upfront that MidSommar should be a very divisive movie. If you tend to watch mostly popular movies or standard horror films, Midsommar is not for you.
Which explains the amount of 1 out of 10 reviews here on IMDb, despite an overall 7.1 rating.<br/><br/>But if you don't mind a slow building narrative with tension, innovative cinematography and plenty of look-away gore, then you might be able to appreciate just how unique Midsommar really is.<br/><br/>Briefly - MidSommar shows us a group of friends going on what seems like an idyllic trip to the Midsummer festival in a village in Northern Sweden. But that quickly turns into a harrowing display of Pagan rituals and ceremonies.<br/><br/>The movie is long because it's not afraid to take its time explaining the background of the characters (the group of friends and particularly the young woman in which it focuses). So from the start you can feel that this will be a different experience from most horror films.<br/><br/>But the movie really takes off once they arrive in Sweden. And it goes a long way to explain why Ari Aster is being so buzzed as a new director. Some of the shots shown are, at least in my book, completely outside the norm. And early on help you involve in the world of the film, and in the experience of the main characters.<br/><br/>In the terms of cinematography, it is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. And that becomes an even more impressive achievement because of its contrast with the horrid gore images displayed throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The grass's green, the floral arrangements, the group dances, everything really paints a picturesque image of the Midsommar festivities. Despite all the unexpected events the characters are witnessing, that sense is kept all throughout 2h30 of film.<br/><br/>All of the imagery helped me, as a viewer, to truly feel in the perspective of the characters. Walking into the festival, hopeful, experience the shock of everything that happens in front of them.<br/><br/>I felt I too went on that trip with the characters, and I was shocked again and again together with them. It stuck with me for hours on end after watching. Which is one the best complements I can make to the work of a director in my view.<br/><br/>Truly recommended it if you are up to watching a different yet aesthetically beautiful piece of cinema."

","I've never written a review before, but this movie was insane, so I just have to.<br/><br/>I went into this movie knowing very little about it. All I knew was that it was supposed to be a horror movie set in Sweden under the festivities of midsummer. To me, a horror-loving Swede, that sounded delightful. But oh, how disappointed I was.<br/><br/>A group of Americans follow their Swedish friend back to his home in Hågra, Hälsingland. It is a beautiful Swedish village and this community seems very close and loving of each other. But, something seems off. You might want to call this a cult, rather than a loving community. Their traditions around life, family, and celebrations is rather strange. You have to kill yourself at age 72 to compete a kind of circle of life. Incest is very common, but sometimes, the community allows outsiders. A ""may-queen"" is decided once only one woman is left standing, dancing, around the ""may-pole"".<br/><br/>The movie does have many strange and sometimes frightening times, but calling it a horror movie seems a little wrong. This is not what I think of when I think of horror. It's more of an occultist movie, but what genre that would fit into, I do not know. I do enjoy watching bad horror movies at times, but not this one. I couldn't wait for it to be over.<br/><br/>Midsummer in Sweden is a pretty strange tradition, if you would explain it to someone, but this is the most extreme thing I've ever seen. A normal Swedish Midsummer's Eve is celebrated by dancing and singing around a may-pole with your friends and family, until the moment you don't want to anymore, not until you can't stand. You eat the same food you eat at every holiday, you might even have a fika. You have flowers in your hair. What they're doing in this movie makes me ashamed of calling myself Swedish. The community call what they're doing ""tradition"" over and over, but still, it doesn't explain why. They also manage to almost brainwash some of their American tourists.<br/><br/>I'm so sad that this movie was so bad and weird, because I was really looking forward to watching it. A horror movie set in my home country during the summer time could have become so much better than this actually is. I was excited to see both Florence Pugh and William Jackson Harper in action, since I really enjoyed Pugh in Little Women and Harper in The Good Place. I feel sorry for them for being in such a strange movie. Don't waste 2.5 hours of your life watching it. Unless you're into weird occultists celebrating a summer holiday."

When I decided to watch this movie, I was promised a twisted horror and provocative trip. As it ended, I couldn't help but feel disappointed.<br/><br/>It's okey if a movie chose to develop at a slow pace, as long as it serves the experience. But this is not the case, as it stretches too much for the lack of substance the story offers.
The progression of the key part of the story lacks of connections or meaning between the sequences. It's also predictable. Don't expect twist or surprises, since they won't be there.<br/><br/>As for the horror component. Well, I don't think it was really there. You can check some gory parts but the feeling or the emotion of it was totally missing here. I could say it's not psychologically scary or graphically grotesque, it's just weird.<br/><br/>Now, I have to give it some credit for the technical aspects of the movie that are actually very well done.
The acting is good and it's graphically believable.
So it's the basic idea of the movie. It may not be something very original or that hasn't been made, but it could work pretty much if it was differently done.<br/><br/>In conclusion: I will not say it's the worst movie I've ever watched, as some tend to say when disliking something.
But well, I'm still talking about an average movie in terms of quality that will probably disappoint you if you believe the hype."

"RhapsodyReviews","10","3","8","24 October 2019"," Best Horror Movie of 2019.
","Review:
'Midsommar' is a folk-horror film written and directed by Ari Aster.
It follows a group of friends who travel to Sweden for a festival that occurs once every ninety years and find themselves in the clutches of a pagan cult.
I missed this movie when it came to theaters around my area, but it was on my most anticipated of 2019 so I went into this one very excited. I've got to say it did not disappoint. Coming off his directorial debut with 'Hereditary' last year, writer and director Ari Aster brings yet another beautifully shot, well acted, visually stunning and very unsettling horror film.
Everybody in this movie had me absolutely floored. It didn't feel like I was watching actors perform different characters on a screen I just happen to be watching. I was watching a group of friends enter this unknown world and find themselves in danger. Florence Pugh is phenomenal in this movie and she definitely stands out amongst the rest. She provides the heart for the film and is what keeps the audience emotionally invested. It's one of the greatest horror performances that I have ever seen.
I love how Ari Aster plays with cameras angles and isn't afraid to shoot scenes in what may be considered an unconventional way. I can't say too much about this movie, because I want everybody who wants to see it to go in completely dark. I will warn that it does get dark and has a bit of nudity and graphic scenes. The ending leaves for some questions, but maybe you can figure it out after multiple viewings.
Overall, this is my personal favorite horror film of 2019. I hope others watch this movie, but I understand that a lot of people who like conventional horror won't like this movie, and frankly I can't recommend it to those people. However, if you liked movies like 'Hereditary', 'The Witch', or the original' The Wicker Man' this movie is for you.
5/5"

"jrbond-57624","5","3","8","25 September 2019"," Midsommar - definitely not a horror movie
","Firstly, this isn't a horror movie. Having read some complaints about the film being too long, I can honestly say, the film didn't feel long at all and I was kept interested throughout. The main characters in the film are not really believable, they make some bad choices and the acting isn't the best. The cinematography is good, it's a very odd film and I still can't put my finger on how I'd classify the movie.<br/><br/>It's very important to try to suspend your grip of reality and don't worry too much about the decisions made by the main characters. These are often are ridiculous at times, but when did that ever stop movie makers from making unbelievable situations, that are made even more unbelievable by the actions of the main protagonist on screen?<br/><br/>The film can be annoying at times, the amount of ceremonial nonsense is overdone and there's a lot of it. In short, there's too much emphasis on the ceremonial customs, lots of odd singing, and commune members running about for seemingly no reason at all.<br/><br/>The positives, when you weigh up the film, are few and far between. Having said that, the movie was a reasonable watch, it does provide some funny moments and there is some humour in there. Rightly or wrongly, you will find yourself laughing at the movie,. But I don't think this is a totally terrible movie. I also think that it's bad points are likeable ones and this movie could go on to develop a cult following, this could be the directors aim?<br/><br/>I didn't realise before watching that the director had directed Hereditary, which is much more if a horror movie than Midsommar.<br/><br/>The upshot of watching Midsommar is this, it's a mixed up mess at times, but a likeable one and rather than scare you, you'll laugh at times. It's not a 1/10 and it's definitely not a 10/10. It's somewhere in the middle and in my view, it's worth a watch because there are some really odd moments in it that you will becone talking points for avid movie goers."
"tgarritsen-43217","9","3","8","11 September 2019"," True horror is psychological

I walked outside the theaters in the bright sunny day feeling disillusioned of what i just saw."

","Just like I did with Hereditary (2018) I went into Midsommar thinking I would be presented with a terrifying film, instead I found myself viewing a feature that didn't scare me and yet it filled my body with dread. I would describe Midsommar as a wonderful trip that invites you into its brutal and somber world, and ultimately drops you off at the odd bus stop that was its ending and says ""that's it, bye"". I love how artistic and unique it looked, with a story that presented itself as original and daring, with a world overflowing with interest; if I had not been disappointed by the simplicity of its finale, I would have easily given this feature film a 10/10!"

"IOBdennis","7","3","8","15 July 2019"," The funniest sex scene ever filmed!
","I blame my initial reaction to this film (I originally scored it a 1) on the totally inept criticism it has gotten in the press. The critics totally missed it. I love a good scare: ""Les Diaboliques"", ""The Innocents"", ""An American Werewolf in London"", ""The Shining"" ""Psycho"", ""The Thing"" (original version). But this is NOT a horror movie. It may, on the surface be considered a psychological thriller, more like ""Se7en"", ""Mulholland Dr."", ""Lost Highway"", ""The Wicker Man"", all but the last I loved. Several critics seemed to be going in this direction, but even they didn't get it completely right, I don't think. With ""Midsommar"", when the movie was over and I was leaving the theater, I felt like I had wasted $11 (senior price) and 2 hrs and 20 minutes of my remaining life by seeing this movie. Some things in the film just ticked me off, as they would have in any movie: I don't like it when the director *manipulates* scenes--such as the camera angle going into the commune. ""Hey, viewer, watch out, your world is going to be turned upside down now."" Talk about telescoping an idea!! Could it have been motivated by a shot of the main character looking up through a sun roof in the car? Yeah. Maybe I missed it, but just flipping the view like that was intrusive--""Look at me, Mom. I got a camera for Christmas and look what I can do!"" And if you're going to psychedelically CG a shot, focus it: the table spread at one of the dinners was magnificent, but the CG effect bled all over the screen: everything moved. It was distracting and pulled focus from the scene. And now I'll jump to some other silly stuff: in a ceremony that was supposed to be so revered and holy in that ""culture"", it is ended with a sledgehammer. Oh? Yeah, the director and writer(s) say it really was a custom in days of yore in Sverige. Ok, people have always been nutty all over the world. Welcome to Anthropology 101. But next: what the stupid set up for the bear just to be used that way in the end. Why? What was the connection? But the writer(s) did build that lack of motivation right into the script: one of the characters asks about the bear and a local says that he doesn't have the time to explain everything or want to. But without some connection, I felt that it would have been better if they had used an ass. That would have been more symbolically appropriate. But is that too much of a sledgehammer too? And that sex scene was absolutely the most ludicrous, gratuitous, but hilarious sex scenes I have ever seen. According to an interview with the director, it was supposed to objectify men, depict the vulnerability and ways used to portray women in horror films. But, hey, I counted about 12 pudenda and only 1 penis. So maybe this scene worked for the character (and the actor), but it was gratuitous for the audience, I felt. And when that one old Svenska assisted our hero in performing, I thought I'd lose it. I was the only person in the audience laughing out loud; others were sniggering, like they were embarrassed school children at the zoo watching animals copulating. Was this what the director wanted? I say YES! and he succeeded. So as I sat there I suddenly realized that I was not watching a horror film or a psychological thriller, but a black comedy. The critics had this movie all wrong. It was supposed to be funny, uncomfortably funny, laugh out loud funny at the absurdity of the whole thing. All cultures do stupid stuff. And then at the end, there's that big clump of May flowers with our heroine, the ""May"" Queen, peering out (uuuhhhh ""midsommar""?) crawling in front of the camera in front of that burning building. Not only do the hills have eyes, but the flower arrangement walks and talks! She looked like the Duck Lady at the end of ""Freaks"" or a float in The Mummers' Parade (Philadelphia culture). And why does our heroine romp around the maypole like a native-born Swede? It's a ceremony to purge the psychological demons from her psyche. And what about all that angst and grief over her family? Listen to her wail to her boyfriend for consolation in the first part of the film. Remember it when she is joined by a chorus of women in the village at the end. The women begin by mimicking, it seems, her grief, but then genuinely join her. How wonderfully Euripidean. Only women can console this woman, more than that ass, I mean bear, of a boyfriend could. I therefore mistakenly hoped something would wipe that stupid expression off her face (see publicity photo of film). ""Ah, Flo? Give me your best expression of Liebesschmerz. Great! Now hold it for half an hour or so."" And the group's manic reaction at the end was a nice comment on bravado expressions of grief. It is therefore my plan NOT to read reviews ever again before I see a film. Had I gone in totally unaware of what the critics had said, I would have laughed my unprompted ass off and enjoyed the film. I probably would have scored it higher, but I didn't enjoy the film as much as I could have while it was happening because of the mis-advice.

","It went from a great and intriguing start, amazing acting etc, interesting dialogue, and then unfortunately it went bizarre and slow.

No sane person would stay after that, but then it continue and got worse. And from making sense to making no sense.<br/><br/>The lead girl was amazing, in fact the acting over all was great, for the most part.<br/><br/>In summary, it could have been the standard 90 minutes and been better and cut out some of the weirdness. But even then you have to get over that these insane rituals would keep any of them there is beyond belief and goes back to the old cliche horror films where they all enter the scary looking house and stay after people are killed.

","Midsommar only improved when I saw it a second time. The thing I appreciate about it the most is how Aster transitions the viewer from nerve shredding terror to breathtaking catharsis in the matter of only one or two scenes. The ending sequence is one of the best I've ever seen, and Florence Pugh joins Toni Collette as giving the best female horror performances since Shelley Duvall in The Shining. Midsommar might be too much for some viewers. But I would rather watch a movie that disturbs me so profoundly that I can't forget it, than a movie that bores me so completely that I can't remember it.

","Midsommar is Ari Asters second movie, one for which the stakes were set pretty high after his debut movie Hereditary, which seemed to be a beloved horror gem for film critics around the world. With Midsommar he proves his succes was not a one time coincidence, showing the world a fresh and unique way of making slow-burn horror.<br/><br/>Where hereditary was, in it's essence, a family drama turned outright horror, Midsommar does something similar with a relationship drama. We straight away get to dive into the relationship of Dani and Christian, which seems to have slowly bled to death, leaving Dani worried and a bit desperate for their future and Christian not caring anymore. After Dani suffers a horrible tragedy however, Christian stays with her out of pity and some very awkward scenes later she gets invited to come with him and his friends to the Midsommar festival in Sweden.<br/><br/>Just the fact that at this time of year it is almost always day in Sweden, makes you eerie and disoriented, the movie slowly drops hints, backed up by beautiful visuals , of the horror that will ensue, always with the relationship drama serving as its backbone, even in the final scenes where you might get distracted by the chaos. It not once has to rely on jump-scares to make things dreadful, which in my opinion is what good quality horror is about.<br/><br/>This movie just waits for you to dig deeper and pay close attention to the details, which is not for everyone, but if you are open to that kind of thing you will most certainly love it."

We learn that the festival occures every 90 years, but all of villagers seems to experience it every year, even younger people contributing in the festival are OK and relax to watch men jumping off the cliff and blow their heads!

It's like a drama type of movie more than anything with shocks happening on the way and I saw this at cinemas more than once and it's not the best but certainly by no means the worst movie ever or the worst I've seen. Florence Pugh plays her part well as Dani and her parents die due to her sister, Terri I think causing their deaths. After this she grieves them with support of her boyfriend, Christian played by Jack Reynor, then loads of chatting is done between them and a group of friends to visit Sweden for a month or just over and they travel to Sweden to visit a midsommar cult festival kind of. One by one they start disappearing and strangely enough the only person from the group who visited Sweden who survives is the beautiful Dani. The gore is there but I wouldn't say it's too gory but maybe to some. Overall a decent movie but not the best, I'd say average but some people may find this movie crap or boring but I liked it."

","Soon after suffering a tremendous family loss, and in the middle of a disintegrating relationship w/ her boyfriend, Christian (Jack Reynor), Dani (Florence Pugh) decides to go w/ him on a trip to a remote village / commune in Sweden w/ his friends. One of them, Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) grew up there. When they arrive, Dani and company meet the extremely friendly villagers in what seems like an idyllic setting. It's apparent almost immediately that something just isn't quite right. At least not what modern Americans would call ""normal"". There's a definite cult-like atmosphere. Some subtle undercurrent is bubbling up through all of the pageantry and bliss. An uneasiness is growing slowly, until a particular ceremony proves overwhelming for the visitors. From this point everything -slowly- unravels. MIDSOMMAR wears its influences proudly, especially the original WICKER MAN and Shirley Jackson's short story, THE LOTTERY. In fact, this film would have fit in quite well in the early 1970's, when such unusual, even shocking fare was far more common.

"zenboy627","10","3","9","4 November 2019"," Apprently, breaking up is hard to do. Really, really hard to do.
","Horror is not dead. Indeed, it has new life. It's been given a nice rotation of resuscitators and caretakers in the midst of James Wan's domination of anything and everything remotely horror. Ari Aster among the finest of these new lifers--""new life"" also one of the major themes of both of his films. His bold and controversial ""Herditary"" was an achievement in filmmaking itself--mastering all the elements outside of narrative for a good horror movie, managing to almost never fall into the trap of throwing tropes at the wall and seeing what sticks. ""Midsommar"" is a proper sophomore effort, more ambitious in story and character development (Florence Pugh is divinely subtle as she navigates the slow descent of the break-up amidst being trapped in an unsettlingly beautiful Swedish landscape with a commune of cultists), more intricate in its tone whilst staying within the territory of grief and loss and never not being simply horrifying. Aster strokes the amygdili like the ""mind-nuts"" they are and forces us to keep watching. His mastery of unsettling imagery is superb, as is his pacing.<br/><br/>Also this includes the greatest horror scene involving a bear suit since the Nicholas Cage ""Wicker Man""."

","Ari Aster's follow-up to last year's Hereditary comes in the form of this kin to films like The Wicker Man & White Dawn. A woman, played by Florence Pugh, has suffered a massive tragedy when her sister commits suicide taking her parents w/her when linked hoses filled w/carbon monoxide run throughout the family home. Already feeling somewhat of an emotional burden to her boyfriend, this turn of events does not bode this relationship well. The boyfriend invites her to a remote village in Sweden to participate in a summer festival along w/3 other college pals working on their theses. That her beau is already feeling pangs of break-up fuels the underlying tension already in the air when the activities take a turn from the quaint to the macabre. A sense of impending inevitability soon supplants the proceedings as each member of the foreign visitors disappear under mysterious circumstances leaving breadcrumbs towards an ending even Stevie Wonder can see coming. Aster has crafted the perfect antidote to the noisy, obnoxious shock-fests which frequently populate our multiplexes by asking his audiences to go along for a ride that may not be easy but imminently satisfying."

There are dozens of those out there and as such it is actually quite good. For me as a Swede thou, this one goes through the roof and out into the stratosphere. There are so many Swedish cultural references in this, often taken completely out of context and twisted through a Jodorowskij/IngmarBergman filter, if such a thing could exist. Its the closest thing i can think of to describe this anyway. The result is an incredible mad mess of mushrooms, midsummer flowers, pubic hair and violence. If you have a narrow closed up mind you will complain about how this is a totally unrealistic description of Swedish traditions and folklore in general, and midsummer in particular.

","With A24 and Ari Aster as director, Midsommar was always going to be filled with gore and horror after his first film Hereditary. And the 140 minutes runtime sped by with another unsettling story..<br/><br/>After a family tragedy Florence Pugh's grieving Dani is grudgingly invited by boyfriend Christian to join him and his friends at a pagan Midsommar festival in Sweden. Jack Reynor was going to dump clingy Dani but how can he do that now? To the disappointment of his college grad friends. One of them Pelle, played by Vilhelm Blomgren, invited the group to his commune's festival and it only happens once every 90 years so it's a special event. He's thrilled Dani is coming along. He among them understands her grief as he also lost his parents. I'm sure there's a story there...we'll figure it out.<br/><br/>And when they get to the commune the scenery is stunning, with blue skies, wild flowers and friendly locals in folky white embroidered clothes. How can horror be hiding in the midnight sun? With some choice hallucinogenic drugs to ease you into the vibe. The bear was a surprise, but Dani's room had naive style paintings including a bear and a child, so it all fitted into the pagan setting so remotely separated from society.<br/><br/>Will Poulter's Mark eased the tension with his comic lust for the comely Swedish maidens in their frocks, and the commune members do seem very easy loving. While one of the anthropologist's, William Jackson Harper's Josh, is writing his thesis on pagan rituals, so his mind is blown with the thought of the nine day festival. Pelle's brother Ingmar played by Hampus Hallberg also brought guests from London to take part. Archie Madekwe's Simon and Ellora Torchia's Connie are as excited as our Americans to be there.<br/><br/>The Hårga community believe in a circle of life, from birth to 72, when you then fall off a cliff. I was reminded of Logan's Run, but here age is just a time to begin the renewal of life. But shocking to those outside the commune. Simon and Connie are like us, and abruptly leave the next day. Without saying goodbye.<br/><br/>But Josh explores deeper into the rituals for his thesis, while Dani joins in and helps bake pies with the women. And Mark is finally going to get some Swedish loving, although he's off his face. And when Christian is bizarrely told he has been chosen to be the lover of one of the girls, he is served one of the pies, and discovers the young girl's secret ingredient. You want to avoid the food and drink at this festival.<br/><br/>But the accommodation is stunning, with a beautifully folky decorated communal building for each of the four stages of the Hårga to live in. That will sell it to the tourists. Our friends are all to live in the 'youth' hostel.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Dani is becoming enchanted with the commune, and when she's made the May Queen she even starts speaking Swedish like some fairy magic is at work. And she's taken off to bless the fertile earth as Christian discovers that sex is a spectator sport here. And it all takes place with the scenery shimmering in the background like bad photoshop. But here it's just a very bad trip, and Christian is going to live to regret it when Dani gets back from her day's blessings.<br/><br/>Initially with the buzz of the movie I was expecting a Wicker Man, and some of the filming hinted at a chosen maid, a secret building and a massive unveil. But nothing quite prepares you for the truth as Ari gathers his players for the finale, with stuffed puppet skins, still live action, excited jazz hands, and maybe a touch of John Updike's Hotel New Hampshire. Nastassja Kinski was the one in the bear suit then. This time though not so much fun.<br/><br/>The performances all round were spellbinding, Florence Pugh howling with pain and anguish is exceptional, while gore is mostly kept well off screen, but we get to see the after effects such as when Simon is beautifully dressed in flowers. And Dani is sensationally clothed in a meadow cape of flowers as May Queen. The glorious costumes are by Andrea Flesch who also did the costumes for Colette. Worth the price of admission for them alone if you like fashion.<br/><br/>But it's Ari's horror story that will stay with you. The realisation that it was all as it was meant to be. And horror and dread can indeed live in the most beautiful of places. I thought the ending was much better than Hereditary. And way more shocking. Not a scare by jump horror, and not for everyone, but you'll know if it's your type of festival."

We already know what will happen to most people at the beginning of the film, and the film does exactly what is predictable and does not innovate, it is even a little disappointing, because it is done in a boring and dull way. Midsommar, a film that could be more than it was."

","Too much time, too little everything else.<br/><br/>This is 'Wicker Man', down to the maypole. There is a small difference in that the main character is broken into 4 stereotypes, but beyond that it is a script already written, several times over.<br/><br/>I can see in several instances how this writer/director was trying for the horror genre, though, with three distinctive horror cliches. But, the fact that an audience can recognize these attempts says something in and of itself. Add to this, that each attempt made in this film failed.<br/><br/>Dig, if you will, mes amis:<br/><br/>First; the filmmakers gave us the aforementioned teen stereotypes that have become trope. However, the original concept behind having a group of characters in peril, that this horror trope has butchered for the last 40 years, is that one has to have LIKABLE characters. Whereas, too many modern horror films (this one included) are filled with people you're sick of after an hour and wish would either die or suffer. Sometimes, within the first 5 minutes, but I digress...<br/><br/>Second; to the filmmakers' credit, they didn't pile on the jump-scares but opted for the long, drawn out scenes leading to something ""horrible"". This is refreshing. In theory. However, for these long scenes to be suspenseful, you have to not be able to tell what's coming. Such as in ""The Exorcist"" - what was going to be behind Regan's door after that long dolly down the hallway? In this film, we knew what was going to happen EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. So, the drawing out of such scenes bordered on either excruciation, nappy time, or a chance to show off your riffing skills, depending on your nature. Without spoiling anything, one famous scene prompted my audience to begin a chant of ""Go 'SPLAT'!!""<br/><br/>(OK, I hear some people saying, 'Oh yea? Well, there were long pans in 'Halloween', but we knew there'd be a killing. So there!' True. But, did you know when? Or how? Or who would be first, or next? Not the first time you saw it, and this proves the point. Suspense needs mystery. And again, in this film, there was 0% mystery to anything that occurred. Just loooooooooooooong build-ups to the predictable.)<br/><br/>And third; the damned last-minute-twist moment. Which is by now so old hat that we've almost stopped noticing. It's just accepted. There was absolutely no reason for it, nothing to hint at this, nor was it in the character's nature whatsoever - the opposite would have been true to her character. As it was in the film, it was just a desperate tack-on.<br/><br/>(OK, I hear you again - yes, the unexpected can be jarring and effective. But, only if you can believe it.

","TLDR; This movie was pretty unsettling, Ari Aster has successfully spawned a film that was pretty difficult to enjoy, but isn't that the goal of a horror movie to begin with? The cinematography was some of the best I've seen all year, if anything rent it for that and plan a trip to Europe.<br/><br/>I hated the characters and all I could think about was how long it was taking for them to get wiped out. They were intensely unlikable, it was hard to empathize with the main character despite the focus on her poor relationship with her boyfriend and the effect that the obliteration of her entire family at the start of the film has on her from that point on. The other characters come off as obscenely stupid and petty as well, you just witness a gruesome double murder in the middle of nowhere and you fight with your best friend over your thesis topic? The intriguing weirdness of the cult and their rituals in this film were enough to keep me engaged until the end, but definitely a movie to see alone. I enjoy av av-ante garde"
"micheleroncarati","4","2","5","11 February 2020"," Much hype for mediocrity
","You will hear that Midsommar is an amazing masterpiece. I don't think it is. It's good at making people with low standards accept the fact that horror movies are expected to be mediocre. The whole film can be easily guessed from the very begining and I heard some people saying that is a smart move from the director, because it adds to its value. Wait what? Since when making a corny and guessable film is good?<br/><br/>This film could have been quite good. It had some very good material to work with (such as the theme of a troubled couple, Swedish folklore, Swedish landscapes) but it in the end it turned out to be a mediocre horror film about a cult of hippies with a twisted mentality about life.<br/><br/>The whole premises of the film is flawed. The actual horror doesn't stand. The plot is full of holes. The characters act in incredibly stupid ways, even a kid would know better. If this wasn't enough, when you get to the ending, it seems like the horror is accomplished and yet, if you have any critical sense, you ask yourself: ""So there is a cult in Sweden and tourists disappear. No one does anything? Anywhere in the world? A cult that can actually be found by everyone quite easily? Alright then.""<br/><br/>To be fair the camera work is really nice and there was some interesting material. I find it really boring and mediocre, and I understand that some people may like it, but it objectively far from a masterpiece.<br/><br/>If you would like to see something related to Scandinavian folklore/mythology, watch the Ritual, which is far more original and intriguing than Midsommar."
"Lonnis_Cult","9","2","5","4 February 2020"," Your average person will not get it
","Scrolling through the reviews for this movie, it's not surprising that the usual brain dead and tasteless group of people that is the general audience will not understand this movie. I might sound pretentious and arrogant, but after reading a review that said ""the acting is horrible"", I knew I had to say something and remind these audience members that they know nothing about acting if they think Florence Pugh was bad in this movie. (Literally every critic praised her performance, you know, those people who know what they're talking about when it comes to filmmaking)
This film is gorgeous looking. There's no doubt about that. The camera work was also good, but that one scene where the camera flips upside down while Dani and her friends are driving to Stockholm was breathtaking. The acting is obviously good, especially from Florence Pugh. The way she captures anxiety and what you're mind goes through is very accurate. Pugh's reactions are very similar to how I've reacted to things. The ending, to me, is the most powerful scene in the movie. Dani, throughout the entire movie, has been pushed aside, her emotions ignored and left alone. She had no family, and the only people who emphasised with Dani was the cult (notice throughout the movie that the cult mimics emotions and reactions that other cult members go through.) As the temple burns down, Dani is free from Christian. That's why she smiles. Her family is now the cult. People who genuinely care about her. This is Ingenious directing on aster's part.
There's a million more clues and subtext in the film, But of course, expecting general audiences to actually think about a film has proven to be difficult nowadays.
My only complaints would probably be that I wished more was done with the inbred oracle. Could have been utilised a bit more. Nonetheless, a great film. And please, everybody giving it a 1 star... go watch some jumpscare and CGI filled piece of crap that you people seem to be obsessed with... probably more your level."

The movie starts out slowww and does not pick up much. Things happen with no rhyme no reason (and of course are not explained). The one thing to me that really hurts the film is the length. Its over 2 hours and there are some many just boring dragged out scenes. Something happens then its 45 minutes of talking and nonsensical scenes. The movie is not scary at all and the sense of dread is not here. Its just like things happen and thats it.

Also, the characters were just stupid. Just flat out dumb. The film is pretty, and the performances are solid, but it left a lot to be desired, otherwise.

The plot is unlike anything i've seen before, it is original and unpredictable. The main character is complex and undergoes an amazing development.<br/><br/>However, I do believe that it is not a movie for everyone. Not because of the gruesome graphic violence, but because unlike other horror movies, it's understanding goes beyond it's scripts, effects and music score. I even dare to say that it seems pretentious at times.<br/><br/>That being said, both cinematography and visuals are amazing.

","The movie Midsommar directed by Ari Aster (loved movie Hereditary) has done a great job at directing Midsommar. I just cannot stop thinking about this movie... the story line, imaginative cultural anthropology of people in Sweden and the entire cast. Pretty and without much makeup Florence Pugh (was very good in movie Fighting with my family: different appearance, lots of makeup) as Dani is awesome. Jack Reynor as Christian, a very dependable boyfriend of Dani is great. Christian's friends , Josh (William Jackson Harper) and Mark (Will Poulter seen him in movie We're the Millers)are very good with their analysis of Dani as a very needy girlfriend. Really enjoyed the conversations among friends when Dani makes several calls to Christian in a short span of time. And then the trip to Sweden with their friend Pelle is the best part. It is amazing how chanting and wailing as a chorus was shown to be a part of end of life celebration , unhappiness, sexual intimacy, misery because of betrayal. Christian's attempts to be nice and loyal to Dani come across as sincere efforts. The movie is terrific from so many points of view. There is lot of seduction and at the same time pure romance and trust. Loved the music and cinematography. Both Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor showed sincerity in their relationship and are very pleasant. Casting Directors did a good job. Visual effects are great.

","With one of the most chilling intros in recent years Ari Aster shows just how capable he is at filmmaking.<br/><br/>Once again Aster finds a way to delve into more profound themes while composing a deeply terrifying horror movie. Though at times Midsommar loses its grip at the overlying story of a group of students getting dragged deeper and deeper into a swedish cult, the underlying subjects of grief, loss and love are intertwined so seamlessly into every shot, that I couldn't help but be continuously amazed at what was unfolding on screen.
That's probably the strongest point of Midsommar: The seemingly flawless cinematography allowing many of the perfomance art-like sequences to feel so moving, yet so disturbing. It helps that, once again, Ari Aster was able to work with a terrific cast (especially Florence Pugh).<br/><br/>Ultimately, while Midsommar is far from perfect, it was a hell of a ride that I can't recommend enough to watch."

The direction is impressive and the visuals are genius at times. Sure, it's not wholly my thing in terms of writing but I went with it because I loved the sheer amount of craft involved in every image. There's so many long takes and the acting from everyone, especially Florence Pugh, is terrific. In my opinion the film doesn't even really drag. I was always invested in the story because it just gets stranger and stranger by the minute and because it knows exactly what it's going for. I'm happy that I bought the Blu-ray that includes both cuts of the movie and will happily watch the director's cut in a few months after I've calmed down on this experience.

","I would say the director / writer, Ari...Aster? Gets his influence from Stanley Kubrick. I'm not saying he's at that level but I can see the influence and he's building a nice catalogue of work, possibly heading in that direction. The things the director is strong in are visuals, mood, and tension, and both Midsommar and Hereditary follow a decent storyline that tracks.<br/><br/>While the director's films are good, would I say they're enjoyable? I don't know. I preferred Midsommar to Hereditary and found it a nice evolution. Hereditary was really good, just a little too at 11 the whole time, and just deep into the darkness and despair, and some of its creep factor I've already seen too many times. Midsommar was a refreshing storyline, and I'm impressed that he could make a film so vibrant and colorful, so utterly dark in its own way. That is definitely talent.<br/><br/>I'm curious what the director could do with a bigger budget given how much he can do on a small one. I would like to see the director go a little more in the direction of The Shining, as I think he might have the visual capability, I would just say he needs to work on his roller coaster story building skills. People want to go on a ride. His movies are kind of like taking a wrong turn on the road into say, Chernobyl, and never finding your way back to the main road. Some people like that, and would be disappointed to see Ari go more mainstream, but, you can't live on indie checks forever."

","Midsommar is a very slow paced movie which can be boring at times if it weren't for the likeable characters and somewhat frequent humor.

Without going into spoilers, this movie basically revolves around a small community of people from Sweden that operate as a cult. Although this is a very slow paced movie, it is VERY intense during several moments. This movie is also very mature. Contains a lot of blood and gore, violence, profanity, alcohol and drug use, sexual rituals, and very intense scenes. Not intense in a horror way but intense in a very creepy and disturbing way. My first thoughts after walking out of the theater was ""that was weird..."", and I stated that the movie was weird several times throughout. A lot of things that happen in this movie are very creepy and eerie and weird and disturbing and although it reminds me a lot of Hereditary, this is much more disturbing. But this is a decent movie.

"DVR_Brale","6","2","5","5 August 2019"," Few words of advice
","The aim of this short text is to give you some insights before you see the movie so you know to which elements you have to pay special attention.
-----------
It's rather difficult to write something specific and sensible about this movie. We see a group of young people coming to Sweden to witness some local community festivities. After being initially struck by paradise looking nature and hospitality of the locals, they begin to witness some of their weird and scary customs. And then we go...<br/><br/>Almost entire movie happens during the day. There are no jump-scares. Nobody is coming after somebody. So I wouldn't describe this movie as a horror but rather as a psychological terror movie. And here's the reason why: Midsommar is successful in creating an atmosphere of distrust between the protagonists which makes us feel like not knowing who's going to do what and how. That's the exact reason why Midsommar makes us feel distressed.<br/><br/>On the one side we have a pagan cult with whom we get acquainted as the movie rolls. On the other side we have a group of young people obviously shattered by life tragedies and mutual problems. Former represents a united community, later just a make-believe community. This is important to stress out since the director said in an interview that this is essentially a break-up movie (breaking up with someone is an act of bringing to an end community of two). That means that we shouldn't focus too much on the cult itself but on the protagonist's desires and reasons why. Why did each one in particular decide to go to Sweden? What were they looking for? How did this peculiar Swedish surrounding manage to bring forth their true faces? This movies isn't about providing us with psychological description of cult behavior but psychological description of our behavior, double-standards and hypocrisy.<br/><br/>You may feel about the cult one way or the other but its purpose is in essence an instrumental one. And no matter how ugly they become, we can't doubt that they really believe in what they do. So it's important not to become to occupied with their rituals during watching of the movie. I'll conclude with some questions and tips which you can keep on your mind while watching the movie:<br/><br/><ul><li>pay the closest attention to Dani</li><li>keep in mind her family tragedy and think about how that affects her presence (movie will notice you to keep that in mind with few flashbacks)</li><li>think about Dani's relationship with Christian; this is very important as you'll clearly see in the final scenes</li><li>ask yourself if this pagan cult is group's enemy</li><li>try to answer what were their motives for going to Sweden in the first place</li><li>how this peculiar setting brought about their conformity and behavior?</li></ul><br/><br/>I hope these question help you during watching of the movie and thinking about it!"

"richarddillomes","8","2","5","29 July 2019"," Evil in broad daylight
","Ari Aster is back with Midsommar, his first official horror movie as he considers Hereditary a family drama. Starring Florence Pugh (who we will next see in Black Widow) and Will Poulter from Black Mirror episode (season, really) Bandersnatch, it follows a group of friends that goes to a secluded community in Sweden so they can participate in a festival that happens literally once in a lifetime, every 90 years. As Dani (Pugh) struggles with the recent death of her parents and sister which in turn has strained her relationship with her boyfriend Christian, a trip together might just be what they both need so they can weather the storm.<br/><br/>WARNING: Contains some minor plot points which may be considered as spoiler for some.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this vacation is not it. I mean when suicide in public display is explained to you as a ritual to be reborn into the community, it's a little skittish but since you're a visitor and you want to be respectful of their tradition and culture, you just ignore the lump in your throat and wish you've seen the worst of it. Well it wasn't if you consider ritual sex, skinning, mutilation and something to do with a bear among other things (yes there's more) as acceptable norm, you then start wondering maybe the public community pool would've been a safer choice (hello Stranger Things season 3.) Kudos to Aster for coming up with a horror movie set in sunny Sweden. Sometimes it's more horrifying when something evil happens in broad daylight - it's more raw and real compared to when it's in the shadows of the dark.<br/><br/>Still around? Let's continue. The good thing (?) about the theatrical release is that they needed to cut around 30 minutes worth of material in order to get a R-16 rating which means more cash for them. I suppose the deleted scenes would explain how a tree is grown inside you (on second thought do I really need to know?) but it kind of leaves you wondering how it happened. More importantly, the WHY it happened, what was the relevance if any? Because I want to be able to categorize evil things between explainable and non-explainable which separates the Purge movies from the Exorcist. Yes it's scarier if left unexplained and you're urged to use your imagination but here it's just sloppy editing. Ari only had one year to work on this and it's good all things considered, but definitely not as polished as Hereditary. But I'm willing to cut him some slack as he was able to show how scary being cut off from the world is, and what's considered as knowledge passed on from generations back does not necessarily hold weight in this day and age.<br/><br/>In both movies, Ari has touched on cults, complicated relationships and head bashing. He might be on to something here. Also is it too early to speculate that an Ari Aster horror universe is in the making?<br/><br/>This movie deserves a place in your library, just make sure you have the director's cut."

Yes, it had style, bloody deaths and human sacrifice but they were more disgusting than frightening.<br/><br/>But at the end, all I could do was ask ""what was the point of this religion/cult/secret society? Did they worship some ancient god? Kill for for pleasure? As the film progressed, I waited form some kind of purpose to be revealed. The members took their beliefs very seriously. It was was a lifestyle with deeply rooted traditions and laws. When not meeting did they blend back into Swedish society with normal jobs and families?<br/><br/>Too many questions and no answers.<br/><br/>Two observations:<br/><br/>If this film was rated R, what does it take to get an X rating?<br/><br/>I enjoyed Stranger Things 3 more."

","Where do I start lol??? At first, I wasn't sure if I was at the right showing, then as the film continues it starts getting more interesting, then It goes completely left from there. At some points during the film I said to myself I couldn't imagine going through that. Strong performances for Florence Pugh & Jack Reynor respectively; they both played their roles with realistic energy & emotion (that's pretty hard to complete in horror/thrillers). Midsommar was crafted beautifully by Ari Aster it progressively becomes more horrific & twisted, it will most certainly keep you engaged throughout. The plot is in its own class (not too many cult horrors films); really good suspense."

","This movie was..disturbing. I enjoy thriller and horror movies, but this movie wasn't that type of unsettling. Visually, it drew me in, especially towards the beginning. It's a longer film, and it felt as if the story development became more stagnant as the movie went on. Between the disturbances and the underdeveloped story line, I felt like I forced myself to stay until the end. The first half and the second half of this movie were two totally different experiences. But the film was just that, an experience. I couldn't even really describe it to others after I left. I felt emotionally attached to the story, but not in a blissful way."

","I'm hyper-conscious of movie lengths. For example, I sat through the latest Avengers which was 3 hours; I felt ever minute tick by like a long bus trip to Iowa. It was painful. This movie is almost as long, but you don't notice. I had to take a leak half-way through, but I couldn't leave my seat because I didn't want to miss one frame of this film. Ari Aster's direction is outstanding. Nothing is arbitrary. Every shot, camera position, camera movement, art direction, etc is careful, deliberate, and considered, creating a tension that builds from the beginning to its necessary, but satisfying conclusion. Aster isn't one of these pretentious, artsy filmmakers who doesn't know how to end a movie, leaving you hanging. Nothing is extraneous or self-serving. Nothing is too on-the-nose, or gratuitous either. This dude is destined to be the next great American filmmaker, no question. The first hint are the performances, which are all stellar, especially the lead. Florence Pugh is incredible. I think it's the best screen performance I've seen in the last I dunno how long. Oscar-worthy. I love that there are no ""stars"" in this film, yet they deliver breakout performances. It's altogether intense, funny, and insane. My only critique is the FX body props, which, at times, weren't that great, probably because of budget restraints and the fact that Sweden doesn't have the best creature shops. But that's forgivable given the overall cinematic achievement they pulled off. I have no idea how Aster is going to top this one, but I can't wait to find out."

","I walked into this movie wanting it to be my favorite horror movie. I loved the cinematography and direction of Hereditary and this film thankfully offers the same vision. I was thoroughly disturbed throughout the entire experience however this is also the basis for one of my few issues, the film makes you feel very disturbed with very few disturbing images. This is a praise to the cast, director, score, and everything in between, but it is a personal issue I had. What makes me enjoy this film more than Hereditary is the essence, Ari Astor goes for it and nails it perfectly. This film will leave you disturbed without much basis for why, and if you're like me it will leave you inspired to make films."
"rfinnct","9","2","5","11 July 2019"," You're in for a trip
","When I first exited Hereditary, the woman in front of me looked back at me and said ""what the hell was that?!"" And I just shrugged. For days later I had that enigma running through my head and after some investigation online, I gained an appreciation for the subtle horror and symbolism the movie presented.<br/><br/>Going into Midsommar, I expected the same challenging cerebral experience punctuated by periods of harsh gore and tension. What I got was decidedly a much more straightforward tale of a group of college students traveling to Sweden for a festival. It seemed simple... maybe too simple. Many aspects of the plot are literally shown to the audience in blatant drawings and banners, so it was a matter of waiting for those professions to come through and at the time it seemed tedious and predictable.<br/><br/>The main character is a young woman who is prone to being a drama queen and she's quite aware of it. She doesn't want to be a burden, but when an unimaginable tragedy strikes, she leans heavily on her barely-there boyfriend who's had his fill of being her emotional crutch. Soon after, she does her best to swallow her emotions to just ""act normal"" and even blames herself when the boyfriend plans the trip to Sweden without telling her (or initially inviting her). Out of guilt he does invite her, and to prove she's not a basket case, she agrees to go along. The audience clearly sees all the red flags they both present, but in regular horror trope form, the characters move forward when it's clear they should get the hell out of their situation.<br/><br/>As they get to Sweden and join the commune for the festival, a whole new series of red flags appear. The family/cult is creepy af, but it's thinly masked as friendly and welcoming. As with the woman's relationship, we clearly see this heading in an inevitably bad direction and we watch the group convince themselves everything is ok.<br/><br/>Even when events happen that are unquestionably horrific, most continue to stay the course and adapt to surroundings rather than leave. Just as in their relationship, omens and banners are literally put right in front of them, but they all become like the protagonist and ignore the signs.<br/><br/>Once the film reaches its conclusion, even though it's wildly predictable, what the viewer expected to be unquestionably terrible at the onset is suddenly a grey area because the film has been quietly playing mind games and emotionally manipulating us. In our minds we know the end is just as horrific as we thought it would be all along, so why does it also seem kind of positive? As many reviewers have stated, ""I didn't know how to feel at the end."" If that's the way you exited the movie, then it successfully worked its magic on you. You're just like the characters in that you're seeing all the obvious red flags, but going along anyway despite logic telling you you shouldn't.<br/><br/>So it's simple, yet it's not. If you focus on the simplicity, you'll probably be disappointed. Although the movie does a good job at drenching everything in tension & dread (you just KNOW things are gonna turn crazy eventually, everything is done at a very slow pace and understandably a lot of people will lose patience before the outright horror/gore kicks in. By that point, many will have given up on the movie and think it's been a waste of time even as the credits roll.<br/><br/>But if you view the (what seems like) excessive run time as the film slowly bending your expectations and your feelings about the outcome, you'll understand and appreciate what it's been doing. It's a movie that you either like, or you don't. If you find yourself puzzling over it - as even very negative reviews do - then deep down it effected you just the way it was intended. And just like the main protagonist in her relationship, you're giving it far more thought and consideration than your rational mind says you should."

","As a fan of horror movies I have become very desensitized over the years. I've watched many different takes on what directors and actors try to deliver as being scary, and they usually fall short of my expectations. Zombies, aliens, paranormal, supernatural, witches, ghosts, poltergeists, blah, blah, blah. You can only rewrap an idea so many times before the motif starts to become a little stale. The older I get the less impressed I am. I have turned in to that old guy that has already seen (and rented) it all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And then something truly incredible happens: Ari Aster (of Hereditary fame) writes and directs a movie called Midsommar. Refreshing? Absolutely. So refreshing that it begs to be watched again. This was truly a highbrow horror movie that was as innovated as it was visually beautiful. And dark. I mean pitch black, no light, bottom of the ocean floor kind of dark...ironic in itself considering the location is in Sweden, an area that has nearly 24 hours of sunlight in the month of June, which is when the movie takes place. And, dare I say, even humorous at times, which is a welcome relief between the waves of unsettling visuals, tension, and expertly crafted carnage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Watching this movie was a reminder to me that ALL religions are strange ideas depending on your perspective. They are all created by the fallible minds of human beings and nothing else. Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, and Mormonism - all filled with questionable rituals and customs but are considered normal because they have been practiced for eons. Ari's universe is really no different than our own, he is just able to paint a new picture that makes you feel alienated and repulsed by your own cultural indoctrinations, wherever you are from.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kudos to the wonderfully talented Ari Aster for bringing something completely different to the table. I look forward to seeing whatever else this writer/director will come up with next. If it is anything like Hereditary or Midsommar it will surely be a long career, lucky for us."

Wouldn't call it a horror movie (none of that jumpy scary stuff). But be prepared - it has been rated 18+ for a reason.

This was an inventive start and had quite a bit of potential but I was left with a feeling of ""so what."" The journey that the protagonist goes through is powerful but the larger context to why is left too untouched. There are a few horror tropes in this movie that felt out of place, primarily the character Mark, and lots of could-be interesting facets left untouched.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a let down for me and after two movies I felt didn't live up to the hype or potential with storytelling, I doubt I'd see a third Aster movie in theaters."

It is as if Ari had first hand suffered the things that happen in the movie, not the cult part, but pretty much everything else.<br/><br/>There were couple of scenes that disturbed me down to my core on a personal level.
This is not a horror movie in a traditional sense, instead of fear you end up feeling traumatized and a little bit dead inside (this might be due to my experiences in my real life.)<br/><br/>Ari has really created something unique.
He has pushed horror as genre drastically forward. After seeing Midsommar, all Hollywood horror movies with their unnecessary cheap jump scares feel like nothing.<br/><br/>Midsommar was perfect vision of dread, hope, and in the very end, twisted deliverance."

The lack of jumpscares was interesting. Ari Aster focuses more on building horror through unsettling imagery with great effect.<br/><br/>Pacing may turn some viewers off, but I hold to my belief that Ari Aster knew exactly what he was doing. Aster takes his time worldbuilding this Swedish daylight nightmareland. Cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski and composer Bobby Krlic do a stunning job creating an audiovisual acid trip gone horribly wrong. The film is beautiful on every level imaginable.<br/><br/>Florence Pugh delivers a solid performance as a heartbroken, confused girl who finds acceptance through the cult. The audience will emphasize with all characters as they get more and more repulsed by the traditions of the Swedish cult. It's hard not to see yourself wondering what you'd do if in the same shoes as the characters.<br/><br/>Midsommar is a horror film that will take you in and genuinely scare you if you let it. Though highly artistic in nature, it may not be for everyone. Especially not for those seeking jumpscares with their significant other.<br/><br/>5/5. The most beautiful horror films I've ever seen.

She can be a real drag and further dampens matters when she goes along with the guys to do some tripping with a cult comprised of all ages and smiles. On the surface it looks like a Utopian society but then the ambiguous by-laws begin to kick in and things get gruesome.<br/><br/>It becomes apparent upon arrival at the village that Midsommar is a group Wicker Man in the making, it's supposed well educated protagonists clueless as 12 year olds. Moving at a snails pace writer director Ari Aster's festival ground setting has a very artificial wide open emptiness that he accents with strategic groupings of posing cliches. Pugh's simpering Dani leads a cast of supposed adults acting like kids and all slow on the draw through this debacle as she mopes from end to end gets buried under flowers along with being crowned with an Easter basket while witnessing more horrors but with a new outlook.

There are no jump scares here, just the feeling of impending doom, the enactment of which will impress even seasoned horror buffs. I'm also thrilled that they were able to use a pagan setting in a way that was truly respectful and awe-inspiring. The religion is not a gimmick here. It's essential to the plot and aesthetic. I marked down one star only because the beginning of the film shows detailed traumatic events in one character's life that, while relevant, didn't need to take up that much time. Other than that, the pacing, acting, artwork, music, honestly everything about this movie is top-notch. Word to the wise: you will be exhausted at the end of this. But it's worth it."

Though his weak-kneed party predecessors have paid lip service to eliminating the main drain on the resources of U.S. Job Creators--the Twin Evils of Social Security and Medicare--Leader-for-Life Trump's goal in flooding America with Swedes obviously is to gain access to and widespread acceptance of their Better Idea for handling needy senior citizens.

Furthermore, the Swedes do not have to waste a lot of money building walls to keep foreigners out of their Homeland.

","This was definitely a film that I've been extremely interested in seeing the moment that I heard about it. Writer/director Ari Aster's film Hereditary was my favorite film from the previous year and I was intrigued to see how he would follow that film up. I caught parts of a couple of the trailers, but I tend to avoid them for the most part, since I know I'll see any horror film in the theater. The synopsis for this film is a couple travels to Sweden to visit a rural hometown's fabled mid-summer festival. What begins as an idyllic retreat quickly devolves into an increasingly violent and bizarre competition at the hands of a pagan cult.<br/><br/>We start this out seeing a picture of what I took to be the four seasons. It then shifts to being winter. It goes into a house where the phone is ringing. Dani (Florence Pugh) leaves a message on the answering machine and we see her parents are asleep. We then shift to her and she is freaking out. Her sister is bipolar and she sent a message that freaked Dani out. She is resistant, but finally gives in and calls her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor). He seems a bit aloof about the situation. He does comfort her while still giving tough love.<br/><br/>The film then does well at establishing their relationship. She feels that she is involving him too much and that he's going to leave her. On the other side, Christian seems to want to break up with her for awhile, but he just hasn't. He is out with Josh (William Jackson Harper), Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) and Mark (Will Poulter). Mark is adamant they break up while Josh kind of analyzes him that he takes the safe route and kind of just moves through life without making a decision.<br/><br/>This film then gives us a gut punch that sends Dani into a deep depression. Christian is there to comfort her and it then shifts to spring, a time of renewal. The guys have planned to go to Sweden to visit the midsummer festival that is happening in Pelle's hometown. Dani hears about it at a party and is upset as she didn't know Christian was officially going. His way of avoiding the argument is to invite her and we see that he immediately apologizes a lot to avoid dealing with situations. He doesn't really think she will accept, but that's exactly what she does.<br/><br/>Upon their arrival, everyone seems so nice. They meet Pelle's brother who invited a couple he met in London, Connie (Ellora Torchia) and Simon (Archie Madekwe). The group is offered mushrooms to hallucinate on and Dani at first declines and Christian elects to hold off as well. Mark throws a fit so everyone ends up doing it. The following day, they actually enter the small village.<br/><br/>There are some odd shaped buildings and some interesting murals on the walls. They start to experience the events and it takes a dark turn on the second day. Dani wants to leave, but this group is in for much more than they initially realize.<br/><br/>Now I wanted to go a bit vague here with my recap. Part of this is I don't want to spoil things, but give you my assessment of it and for those of you on the fence about seeing it to try to convince of you why I liked or disliked this film. With that bit of a disclaimer out the way, I have to say that Aster is great at creating atmosphere. I think what actually works really well here is that I've been in a relationship like this before, where we are staying together, but we don't really know why. A podcast I listen to said this and it hit home as I saw this playing out. Neither person really wants to leave, but they also know that it isn't working.<br/><br/>I have to also say, Aster is great at giving you the gut punch to close out his first act. If you've seen Hereditary, then you know what I mean. This could be a mild spoiler you could say, but the event that happens doesn't have a major impact on the story itself. It is more the effects of this have on Dani and in turn her relationship with Christian. I feel like it sets the tone and things just get progressively worse from there for her. It is interesting though, because this event happens before she gets to the village. I am also revising this after a second viewing of the film. My second was the director's cut, which really reveals much more about the relationship with Christian. I can see why some of this is left out the theatrical cut as it makes him look much worse earlier on.<br/><br/>Something else I got from a podcast about this film is that it takes place in the daylight for a majority. This makes the creepy things that happen even worse, because we lose that feeling of being safe. Horror fans know that they mostly take place at night to hide what can scare you until it is needed. This film is taking place where there is very little darkness at night and the sun is out the majority of the day. We can see everything and it is happening when we think that things are safe.<br/><br/>There is definitely a surreal feel to the film as there is a bit of drug use. It is actually more subtle, but a lot of the drinks given out have something in them that have hallucinatory properties. I found that interesting as it makes what is happening even that more unreal, but we know that it really is. Having the character's question their sanity is interesting.<br/><br/>The last aspect of the story I want to cover before moving on is I love the murals in this film. It is an old technique to foreshadow what is going to happen, but they're out of context. Every time one happened it was like another revelation. I feel this is good storytelling and you know me, that's what I'm a fan of. It is actually even better after the second viewing, now that I know what is coming as well. I also love that Josh is out to write his thesis on the pagan midsummer festivals from different places in Europe, so he has a reason to investigate. There is an interesting turn as well that Christian decides to finally write his while stepping on his friend's toes. The idea that his name is one of the more popular religions in the world and coming to this festival isn't a coincidence either. The cult aspect of the film is definitely one of my favorite parts as well, because that's really what this village is.<br/><br/>This brings me to the pacing of the film. I'm going to warn you, this film is long and it is a slow-burn. If you aren't into those, you probably won't like this film. I feel that the atmosphere and trying to figure out what was happening is what kept me engaged. The film did something that I really enjoy is learning more about what is going on here. I came in making predictions of things and that makes me enjoy Josh even more that he is studying this academically, because I feel like that would be more. The ending wasn't expected and to be honest, I really dug where they took this. With everything that happens in the film, I think that it is kind of a vindication.<br/><br/>Speaking of what happens in the film, I want to move to the acting next. I will admit I'm torn on how I feel about Pugh. I feel horrible for what she went through, but I can also see one of my exes in her, so that makes me dislike her a bit. She's in a bad relationship and needs to move on. I do find her attractive though and as she participants in this festival, I can see her healing a bit as well. The ending I think is really hers. Reynor is such a jerk in this film, but he is also kind of a rock for Dani. He does a few things that are pretty shady as well. I thought his portrayal of Christian was good though. As I stated above, the director's cut really makes him look worse early on. Harper was one that I was a big fan of, as I feel like he'd be me. Blomgren was really solid in his role and I thought Poulter was hilarious. The rest of the cast definitely rounded out the film for what was needed.<br/><br/>To the effects of the film, they were amazing. They were pretty subtle in the amount used, but they weren't in how brutal they are. The ones done practically had me cringing and I loved it. There is some CGI in there as well and to be honest, I thought it was a good use. There are just times to show that characters are tripping. There is also some CGI fire that actually looked really good to me. The film is shot beautifully as well as it is so bright and the colors are vibrant.<br/><br/>The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. There is a lot of ambient noise and music in the film. The songs are definitely cult-like and really make it eerie with what is happening in the film. They also do a lot of mimicking of other people which I did think was interesting as well. I do think this really helped to enhance the overall feel of the film and really make it creepier.<br/><br/>Now with that said this film I really liked when I left the theater. I went to a late showing and then went to bed. The more that I've been sitting and thinking about the film, the more that I realize I really liked it. I do think this is a step down from Hereditary, but I don't mean that as a slight in the least bit. I love the idea of the cult in this film and what happens when these Americans go there. This is kind of a break-up film as we have two characters that shouldn't be together and are just there for the convenience. Dani really feels alone and is looking for a 'family'. That aspect is also scary as that's the fear of cults as well. The deeper story here is great. I thought the acting brings this to life and even though it is a slow-burn, I think that is builds tension. There aren't a lot of effects, but what we get is really good. The score of the film definitely enhances the scenes as well. I found this to be a really good film and I think that with another watch or two, this could move up potentially as well now that I know what to look for."

"reigntall","10","3","11","23 July 2019"," Red Summer Nights
","So you want to be a writer-director. In film school you develop your passion project idea. You work on it, meticulously rewriting every line, every word until it is perfect. You run through it countless times, trying to get the pacing just right. And if you're lucky, after 10 years of working on it, constantly improving it, your script actually gets picked up and you get to make your film. And it's a smash hit! So now the studio throws a ton of cash and tells you to make another one. And you only have two years to get it done. Previous victims of the sophomore slump include Neil Blomkamp following up ""District 9"" with ""Elysium"" and Dennis Hopper going from ""Easy Rider"" to ""The Last Movie"". I felt fearful for Ari Aster's second feature length film was to be released a year after his first, despite ""Hereditary"" being one of the favorite films of 2018. Seeing ""Midsommar"", I felt a different kind of fear.<br/><br/>Mental disorders, anxiety, grief, cults, and rituals are all notable aspects of both of Aster's films. The similarities between the two are especially prominent in the first act, before the Americans venture to Sweden, but this is not a rehash. Though ""Midsommar"" does not have any scenes that are as profoundly impactful and gut-wrenching than the accident sequence in ""Hereditary"", this film is overall a more complete film. Most noteworthy, is that unlike Aster's previous film which goes off the rails in a laughable manner in the final act, ""Midsommar"" manages to drive up the tension and stakes whilst remaining believable. All the laughs - there are a plethora of dark humor moments - are intentional. Toni Collette, as the female lead of ""Hereditry"", had a memorable, manic performance, though, understandably, some found it to be over the top and ridiculous. Florence Pugh's character is much more subdued, but she gives an equally powerful performance. A director is responsible for pulling out the best performances from the actors and Aster has a perfect record thus far.<br/><br/>The setting of the film is a folksy village in Hälsingland, Sweden full of flower children in folk clothing, folk dancing and folk singing and folk everything else-ing. One of the American visitors is quite unnerved by the fact that even at 9 pm, the sun in shining brightly in a bright blue sky. One the surface, it may seem like an animist utopia, but seeing one villager playing a flute as another two are locked in an overly long and intimate embrace, you get the sense that it is all too good to be true. As you spend more time with in the commune, you learn about all their bizarre and disturbing traditions.<br/><br/>Horror, like sci-fi, works best when used as metaphor or allegory and about more than just killing people and scaring the audience. ""Hereditary"" went a step further and for most of the film is a family drama lacking overt horror elements. There are more traditional horror elements - body horror and gore - throughout ""Midsommar"", but it still retains a strong emotional core. A seemingly utopian love-empathy cult is the perfect setting for a break-up movie. Dani is an anxious person who needs a lot emotional support, but her boyfriend, Christian - and with a name like that, should you really be going to pagan villages? - is not as invested in the relationship. Their relationship deteriorates as does the situation in Hälsingland.<br/><br/>Once again, Aster shows how he is a master of unease and tension. The feeling of dread and danger builds slowly over two and half hours. Though at times there might not be a lot going on in the foreground, the cinematography is so wonderful, that the film never drags. Every shot either has something weird going on in the background, or is beautifully composed, or is it simply cool. Characters take psychedelics and the special effects of them experiencing the visual hallucinations - faces being distorted or the breathing trees - is top notch and hypnotizing without going over the top. His depiction of anxiety via Dani is also spot on. The opening shot is of bright summer Swedish nature with folk singing which suddenly cuts to silent winter scene. Aster often uses this technique of edits with sharp visual & aural contrast which stops the audience for getting a proper emotional footing. And of course, there is a perfect creepy horror score that incorporates the local folk songs. There are no jump scares, but meticulously crafted mood.<br/><br/>Ari Aster is a filmmaker to look out for. For a second time he has mastered cult horror and I hope he will branch out and make just as great films in other genres. Hopefully, he teams up once again with cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski, because that duo is something special. A lot of movies are created to be entertainment, which is especially true for the horror genre. ""Midsommar"" is not just entertaining, it is art."

This is not a movie, this is an experience.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it go right away, this movie will age like a fine wine. And the people who don't understand it will be in the same camp of oldies who didn't like the shining, verdigo, and the thing.

I like movies that gives me a sense of satisfaction when it's all over; this one just had me scratching my head. It's the kind of movie that leaves it's meaning up to the audience's personal interpretation and that's fine, if you like that kind of movie. I, however, prefer concise films that instills a sense of satisfaction afterwards, but that's just me. I gave it a five because it truly is well made and excellently shot, but it's just too meandering to be an entertaining film; It's more of an art installation."

","Yes this is overlong and, like Aster's first film ""Hereditary"", the ending is unsatisfactory. Especially as in this case it is somewhat mirroring ""The Wicker Man"".
Yes it's has so many great flourishes, just the right amount of laugh-out-loud humour - including some look-away body shock - illustrating the confidence of the directors. Lots of subtle ""did that move"" fun to underpin the psychedelic sequences and, whilst it's no outright scary, it certainly disturbs.

","Midsommar is an extremely well made film. The camerawork is amazing. There are so many beautiful long takes with the camera methodically moving in and out. The setting is stunning. It's filled with sunlight, healthy grass, and beautiful flowers. The camera makes sure to let you know that there something more sinister brewing. The film is filled with foreshadowing and subtle hints. The entire plot is shown through paintings and things that people say, which might seem unimportant. Phenomenal movie with so much depth to it. It's one of the few movies that I can watch over and over again without losing interest. Ari Aster's films are on another level. Midsommar isn't for everyone, but if you're a fan of more intense slow burn movies I 100% recommend seeing it. Even if you're not into this genre take a chance on Midsommar. It's worth it."

"bostocklouis","9","2","6","14 March 2020"," Profound, Traumatic, Beautiful and Distressing
","I am not one to generally leave reviews on here, yet in this case upon seeing so many 'low star' appraisals, I felt it necessary to give this film its due. Just to get it out of the way, as many here have expressed, this film is indeed beautifully shot and the acting, superb. Although it plays homage to certain classics to which it proceeds, the plots originality cannot be unfelt to even the most veteran film buff. The point of this review is to express not so much where this film triumphed or where it failed, but to impose on you an impression of how much this film deeply moved and disoriented me like non before it.<br/><br/>It is perhaps unfair to pigeonhole Midsommar into the genre of horror, even though this may be the genre by which the film most greatly lends itself. Although horrifying at times, the film provides a much deeper articulation into the human condition than the average, commercial horror film has been seen thus far to summon. I truly believe that this film can, and does, actually provide at best, a sense of deep transcendent catharsis for the viewer, or at least, provide some philosophical insights into the familiar, yet oft unexplored concept of suffering.<br/><br/>It appears that Midsommar, at heart, is a film which intends to traverse the landscape of trauma. Midsommar meanders unflinchingly between very real expressions trauma; such as death in the family, the feeling of true cosmic loneliness or the notion of being trapped in a state of existential inertia, without any external familiarity to be able to ground ones being. For me, viewing this film was akin to being in a prolonged and deeply challenging psychedelic experience. This film took me by the hand and guided me on a journey through profound and unrelenting feelings of dread, dysphoria and alienation. The daring vision to film this movie within the daytime, conveys the inexorable and anxiety-inducing notion that it will not be unknown monsters that will face us here, but the known and often shunned aspects of humanity to which one generally averts their gaze. This is where Midsommar brings forth its brilliance, it does not let the viewer avert their gaze for even a second, it forces the viewer to confront those shadowy aspects of self in which society and morality wish to protect them from. It asks us to question whether if you or I were born into a different society, perhaps even we could easily be persuaded to indulge in the actions of this society, and perhaps even... enjoy it?<br/><br/>Upon leaving the theatre, the whole audience was at a hush, my friend and I stepped outside, feeling at that moment that the would was unfamiliar to us, trust into a confrontation with reality comparable to depersonalisation. Very few films have left such an overwhelming feeling within me, some films did it for the better, some for the worse, yet this film left me feeling void. It left in me a desolate sense of the unknown and the unease to this day has been left unshaken. This is a film to be contemplated and treasured, to be viewed with reverence for its ability to give one an opportunity to truly feel certain extremes of the self, to which the mainstream cinema cannot generally provide. Must recommend."

I usually find made-up rituals a bit boring. Drawn out shots aren't scary solely because they're long either.. perhaps it would be scarier for people who relate to these kinds of religious rituals more? Or to people generally more religious? I've not enjoyed a particularly religious life, so don't feel particularly scared by possession films either, unless there are other elements to it. So perhaps as always with horror it comes down to what you find scary? That said, these rituals seemed like nothing really until the end, and simply not relating to something doesn't scare me.

","10<br/><br/>I can't help comparing this overlong teen horror flick to the wonderful 1973 horror thriller The Wicker Man ,perhaps that's what Director writer Ari Aster had in mind to bring that type of story to a new generation.<br/><br/>Well in my opinion he failed miserably of course taste In films is very individual and subjective and if your taste is Group hysteria under the influence of mushrooms and potions leading to satanic mating rituals and a story plot that a 5 year old could tell you the conclusion of in 2 minutes instead of 2hours 27 minutes then you may enjoy Midsommar?<br/><br/>The basic plot is a couple of teenagers travel to Sweden to visit a rural hometown's fabled mid-summer festival. What begins as an idyllic retreat quickly devolves into an increasingly violent and bizarre competition at the hands of a pagan cult.
I read Florence Pugh said filming the superb Little Women and playing Amy March was like therapy after Midsommar and I can see why.<br/><br/>I'm tough rating this film because the professional critics have been so savage on films like Cats 2.8 and Mrs Lowry & Son 6.6 in rating them so low. They give this bizarre nightmare a 7.2 rating when as far as I'm concerned the talent and production of those 2 earlier films alone make Midsommar look like a bad telemovie.<br/><br/>The best moments of this film are the first 15 minutes when Dani's suspicions and worse fears for her family are realised but never explained how they connect to her Swedish Summer Camp of witches warlocks or what ever ever this strange cult of aged hippy grandmas and grandpas and lusty blonde teens call themselves.
In Hollywood they say you're only as good as you're last film and I'm glad Florence Pugh's last film Little Women is not the stinker Midsommar in my humble opinion is."

","Midsommar gets everything right! It's a horrific, stunning, alluring piece of cinema that easily draws you in with the pleasing aesthetics, amazing acting and hidden motives. Florence Pugh was the obvious stand out performance with Vilhelm Blomgren is a brilliant second.<br/><br/>You often find yourself rooting for kind, understanding and handsome Pelle who seems to know exactly what Dani needs and the two are able to connect in ways that she never could with her pigheaded, egotistical boyfriend, Christian. But, don't be fooled by the Swedish mans good looks and charms, it becomes quite apparent that Dani has been chosen by Pelle for a reason and everyone else is simply collateral damage, whether you think it's justified or not.<br/><br/>Whereas everyone else is welcomed to the Swedish commune with a standard ""hello! Nice to have ya!"", Dani is greeted with kisses on her cheeks and people proclaiming ""welcome home!"" a subtle hint that no one is in control except Pelle and the Hargas. This is only further confirmed by the constant lovebombing, affection and attention that is showered upon Dani as she's eagerly welcomed within the right-knit community while the boys are being led on, with a smile to their face and a terrifying looming death. Dani is eventually crowned MayDay Queen, the other girls having obviously thrown the competition either at the request of Pelle(?) or perhaps the Elders(?) or simply because they're eager to welcome a new 'sister' aka new-blood.<br/><br/>There nothing bad to say about the film, you get to watch these characters be lured into a false sense of peace and serenity, to the point where you're rooting for the Hargas and the downfall of the outsiders. It's only once the movies over that you realize how well the Hargas are at manipulation and how well the director was able to hide the obvious signs! I would recommend to any and everyone, it's a must see film! I can't wait to watch more and more!"
"mstvincent","8","2","6","23 August 2019"," A Flawless, Brilliant and Disturbingly Surreal Horror Film
","""MIDSOMMAR"" was a brilliant and disturbing film that makes you feel dirty for watching it. It feels like a surreal snuff film that you'd get in trouble for watching.<br/><br/>The plot is; after a family tragedy, a woman goes w/ her boyfriend and his friends to Sweden to a festival known as Midsommar. A few days in and the festivities don't seem as innocent as initially thought.<br/><br/>The direction was unquestionably OSCAR worthy and felt extremely thought out. Nothing in this film felt slacked off. It had a sense of direction that 90% of films are lacking these days.<br/><br/>The writing was excellent and subtly foreshadows upcoming events. It had very smooth flowing dialogue that worked well in part thanks to the actors casted.<br/><br/>Cinematography was just excellent and beyond words superb. It really captures the film and atmosphere. It shows what it wants and in a way that it wants. No shot ever feels like it didn't have any thought put into it, it all feels thought out and for a reason. I could see an OSCAR for Best Cinematography in its future w/ the right campaign behind it.<br/><br/>The acting was great throughout and from every cast member in the film. When they say that casting is 90% of directing, in this case they are absolutely right! The cast was perfect and had such chemistry that it felt like we were truly watching a real group of friends taking a vacation to a Midsommar festival.<br/><br/>The musical score throughout is the real atmosphere builder. It creates a sense of uneasiness even during scenes of calm to emphasise the calm before the storm.<br/><br/>The film's gift is that you never know when the storm when the storm arrives. Sudden scenes when the elders give themselves to the other life catch you off guard after innocent scenes of festivities. The storm is a hurricane and hits hard.<br/><br/>All up the film is just pure slow burn horror brilliance that is one of the Top Five films of the year.<br/><br/>Rating: 8.4/10"
"kietkyho","8","2","6","12 August 2019"," Ari Aster does it again!
","Ari Asters new film Midsommar is pretty good! It doesn't rival Hereditary, but it's still a really really good film.<br/><br/>As to be expected from Aster, the cinematography was absolutely stunning, with some very beautiful shots and purposeful framing. Aster is someone who knows exactly what he wants in the frame and when to use a wide. It was also really good to see the effects stepped up in this film, especially when it came to depicting people under the effects of psilocybin. I can tell you from first hand experience that the way Aster depicted the visual trips of people on mushrooms is incredibly accurate.<br/><br/>This film also has a pretty great sense of humour too, with Will Poulters character being the main comedic relief (although thankfully not overbearing). Aster, once again, is able to capture the true essence of grief and suffering of people so perfectly... With the very beginning of the film being very full on with the depictions of bipolar. Florence Pugh does an amazing job of portraying a character going through a lot of grief, and relationship dynamic between her and her boy friend was really well done and felt very believable. I think the biggest strength of this film would definitely be the build up and symbolism, but the actual pay off as to what it ended up being wasn't the greatest? That's not necessarily a bad thing, but after coming off the masterful Hereditary and what that film ended up being, this film did feel a bit directionless at points and definitely dragged. Where as in Hereditary, every single conversation and character interaction was all setting things in motion for the ending.<br/><br/>Midsommar is only 10 or so minutes longer than Hereditary but feels much longer compared to Hereditary. Hereditary also toes a very fine line of mainstream horror versus arthouse horror, where as Midsommar is just absolutely insane and unintentionally hilarious at certain points. If you thought Hereditary was weird, this film is very very surrealist.<br/><br/>The gore effects in this film ranges from terrifyingly accurate to... Kinda bad? There's some really awesome uncanny valley imagery used at certain points, but *spoilers* the scene involving the cliff suicide, Aster probably should've cut away instead of showing them hitting the rock, cause that looked really fake. *end spoilers*.<br/><br/>Another flaw was the choices in subtitling. At first I thought Aster was intentionally not subtitling the Swedish parts to put us into the perspective of the Americans being really confused, which I, at first, thought was a really clever thing to do, to put the audience into the perspective of the Americans, but then he just ended up subtitling it.. Which made me wonder why they didn't just have subtitles for the entire movie.<br/><br/>One other minor nitpick would be the scene where Florences character is crying in a plane toilet, and I'm just like ""plane toilets aren't that spacious...""<br/><br/>Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this film and will definitely be checking out all things Aster directs from here on out. I originally gave this film a 7, but it's looking to be more of an 8 for me. This is the third best film of the year so far, with Parasite being my current favourite and Under The Silver Lake being my 2nd."

","Yes, the movie is that good. Each scene in the movie, coupled with the cinematography and the sound, grips you, and seamlessly merges into the next.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, yes, it is a horror/thriller and yes, you may probably get an idea about how all of this is about to end, but prepared to be shocked, rattled and most importantly, impressed by every frame.<br/><br/>The casting is also very well done. The leads are excellent, and each supporting member does their best to add to the overall aura of the rural, isolated Swedish setting.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the best movies I've watched this year. Looking forward to more from the amazing director. I still haven't watched Hereditary, but plan to do so as soon as possible. Kudos to Ari Aster!"
"CarmaChan","6","2","6","24 July 2019"," I feel cheated
","We saw this in theater last night. It is rare for me to give a movie such a low rating, and I'll be clear about why I can't rate this higher than 6 out of 10 stars.<br/><br/>Plot. This movie has a gaping hole in the plot about 15 minutes into the story and the writer failed to address it. You can't ask audiences to get over such a chasm of disbelief. My husband is pretty generous as a movie lover and he couldn't get over it. So the rest of the movie you're still asking, ""Why are they still there?"" It's implausible.<br/><br/>That said, there is a lot going for the movie... strong performances... cinematography... interesting setting... unusual.<br/><br/>Unlike ""Get Out"" which I had to watch twice more in a week because it was so much fun, I will never watch this movie again. But it is worth seeing once, though some scenes are grotesque and cannot be unseen (I blocked my view, knowing what was coming).<br/><br/>It's really messed up. It's weird. And it has the weirdest porn scene I've ever seen, and I've seen some weird stuff - but this exceeds all weirdness. And that was a very funny part, the entire audience in the theater was laughing.<br/><br/>The protagonist is a very strong character and carries this film - fantastic job by Florence Pugh!<br/><br/>I believe all the writer had to do to close that gaping hole in the plot was to make it more of a trap. Otherwise, we're sitting there stuck on ""Why are they still there?"" Made no sense."

She'll whine about needing to decompress from the trip and interrupt everyone else's fun. Spending more than 5 minutes of the movie without crying? She'll cry and mope around in an attempt to get people to pay attention. Someone left without their girlfriend? She'll make a backhanded comment to her boyfriend that she could see him doing that to her. Then once she's done complaining, arguing, crying, and making everything about her, she'll have a problem with her boyfriend plowing some woman in a barn and...here's a shocker...have another breakdown and cry. So what does this terrible person do to make amends for her awful personality? She sends the only guy who wanted anything to do with her (and he must have the patience of a saint to be involved with this train wreck), to his death via being burned alive. What a treasure she is.<br/><br/>A decent movie overall, but her overwhelming ability to annoy anybody watching with her terrible personality reduces the base rating by at least 9 stars. But I'm in a forgiving mood."
"MK_Ultra_","9","2","6","18 July 2019"," Nightmare Fuel Part II
","This is not Hereditary or even remotely close, they are their own. They both channel your worst drug experience coupled with a horrible nightmare...the one you force yourself to wake up from.<br/><br/>With that out of the way...Aster has tapped in to some very underrepresented tropes in modern day horror. Essentially he is legitimizing the genre beyond what was/has historically stigmatized as second rate or just judged as such. Between Lanthimos, Eggers, Cosmatos, and lastly, as I'm leaving the 'best for last', Aster, the genre has found it's way out of trivial jump scares, bad cgi and derivative garbage that tends to weigh it down.<br/><br/>This film is not horror in a mainstream format...think Ruggero Deodato or Robin Hardy influence in tone, flavor and output for this one. There is just this unsettling, surreal feeling of quasi-calmness through the first 45-60 minutes, after the initial opening sequence of family tragedy. This morphs into a overwhelming sense of dread that takes over, which made myself most uncomfortable as a viewer, for an extended period of time. This is horror folks, and feeling that level of uneasiness, watching a film, signifies a ""mission accomplished"" for Aster.<br/><br/>Once again, he has created a modern era masterpiece that is rivaled by his own earlier film (as well as Robert Eggers). They both seem to navigate in the same lane when it comes to the horror genre. Authenticity with a perfectly paired eye for cinematography and tone.<br/><br/>This is probably one of the more non traditional atmospheres also in play here. Bright, washed out...but retains its premise by wandering just outside the lines with an absolute, spot on--- cult film. The trailer does speak volumes on what to expect, but don't think there isnt plenty more in store.<br/><br/>Horror fans rejoice. This is the real deal.<br/><br/>This will be a rewatch for me once its released outside the theater, but not for the same reasons you would go back to watch Hereditary...that was more for imagery and Easter eggs strewn throughout.
Midsommar, on the other hand, is just a case study in contrasts with its cinematography and color---Beautiful as it is horrible--and that most genre films just stay within the lines, Aster creates his own boundaries.<br/><br/>Near perfect nu-classic and bravo for A24, yet again."

","I just saw Ari Aster's new horror gem and it was fantastic, IF you go for the whole pagan cult preys upon unsuspecting foreigners film. Think of this a new age ""Wicker Man"". Albeit, more a gruesome harrowing experience. I praise the entire casts' performance, specifically Florence Pugh's portrayal of Dani. She should be up for some type of award for her depiction of an anxiety-afflicted college student due to emotional trauma. I mean SEVERE trauma! The cult itself was amazingly presented as a too good to be true paradise through the scenery (cinematography), clothing (cue the white robes), mannerisms (unusually welcoming smiles and calm demeanors). The film kept me engaged from start to finish. Though I suspected where the movie was headed, I did NOT anticipate how it would arrive there. The ending is perhaps the most horrific part.<br/><br/>This isn't a pop scare supernatural fest. Not at all. This is more of a grounded unsettling look at humanity. The most interesting aspect to me was how connected the cultists were compared to the divisiveness amongst their prey.<br/><br/>Check it out ladies and gents! I hope you enjoyed my review!"
"mburge96","8","2","6","14 July 2019"," 💐🌷🌸 MIDSOMMAR 🌺🌻🌞
","MIDSOMMAR is Ari Aster's epic follow-up to HEREDITARY (2018). Where both films deal with trauma and cults, they spin their scares in different ways. As opposed to more traditional scares, MIDSOMMAR finds its horrors in the grotesque, in its atmosphere, suggestibility, strangeness, and ambiguity. In other words, the film is more disturbing than scary, but this works extremely well and is appropriate for the story that Aster weaves.<br/><br/>WHAT I LIKED
🌻 Masterful set design paired with gorgeous, spot-on cinematography from Pawel Pogorzelski
🌻 Beautiful score used subtly yet effectively throughout the film
🌻 Stellar performances, especially from Florence Pugh
🌻 Uncanny atmosphere established from the start
🌻 Excellent minimalist use of special effects that subtly enhance their scenes
🌻 Exemplary and creative use of foreshadowing without relying on boring exposition
🌻 Cult members are eerily relatable, which adds to the horror of their eventual actions
🌻 Minimal yet welcome humor sprinkled throughout the story
🌻 Film isn't afraid to take a sharp turn in the final act, which adds to the awe and horror especially well
🌻 Despite its length and lack of action, each scene is filled with mystery and intrigue that keeps the viewer engaged
🌻 The film powerfully and realistically captures the behavior and moments of a couple's dying relationship, and shows, in an exaggerated setting, what can happen to a person who does not receive the love they need when dealing with real trauma and grief.<br/><br/>WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE
🌸 The catalyst of the story is only referenced a couple of times throughout the rest of the film, and does not serve a satisfying conclusion.
🌸 The film does not really do anything different in regards to the traditional folk-horror sub-genre, however it works well for what the film set out to accomplish.
🌸 The screenplay can be sparse in areas, leading the viewer to sometimes wonder where the film is going. However, this tends to work to the film's strength, disorienting the viewer."
"admcdonough","10","2","6","7 July 2019"," Ari Aster's Next Film After Hereditary Doesn't Disappoint
","I was looking forward to seeing this as I had seen Hereditary by Ari Aster and thought that was a truly frightening and incredibly good film. The previews for this one hadn't grabbed me as much as those for Hereditary, but since I was so impressed by that film, I eagerly awaited this one. As good as Hereditary was (and I thought it was the best horror film of the year), this film is even better. I don't want to go into too much plot detail since virtually anything except a brief overview might be viewed as a spoiler. So to be brief and not give anything away, the story concerns an American couple whose relationship is unraveling going on a trip to Sweden. They are joined by three friends of the man including one Swedish student friend of his who is essentially going to be their guide as he shows them the local culture of where he's from. The performances are all terrific. William Jackson Harper (the only actual American born and raised actor in the cast although Jack Reynor was born in Colorado before moving back to his mother's native Ireland at two) and Will Poulter are spot on as the friend who is maybe a little too driven by his research work and the friend who is just a total jerk respectively. Vilhelm Blomgren is amazing as the super laid back Swedish friend who is showing them his home. Two up and coming British actors, Archie Madekwe and Ellora Torchia have good turns as British students also visiting. There are many good performances by the Swedish cast playing the villagers. In particular, the veteran Swedish actress Gunnel Fred as a village leader and newcomer Isabelle Grill stand out. But the real revelations are the two leads Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor. Florence was great in the comedy Fighting With My Family and in the mini series The Little Drummer Girl, but here she really delivers an award deserving performance. And Jack Reynor who I first saw in some interesting Irish films, but who Americans should be familiar with now after parts in movies like Detroit (alongside his cast mate in this film Will Poulter who was brilliant in that film) and of course in the series Strange Angel, gives a truly shattering performance. All in all this film moves ahead of The Wicker Man (the original) as the best horror film about a cult ever made. This will probably be one of the best films of the year and I doubt any horror film will come close to it. One of the best horror films ever made. Now I can't wait for Ari Aster's next film. What a major new talent he is!"

","For those of you who HAVE seen Hereditary: (If not, skip to next segment)<br/><br/>""Midsommar"" is like another flavor from the same ice cream shop of discomfort, but truthfully... it's a bad acid trip that wears off the moment you leave the theater.<br/><br/>A lot of that signature Ari Aster dread can be felt in the film's powerful/memorable First Act.<br/><br/>The Second Act brings up a lot of questions and keeps you engaged, but don't expect to be terrified. It gets a little lost in itself and starts feeling a bit vague.<br/><br/>So, like Hereditary, you're probably expecting a HORRIFIC Third Act, right? It's only natural considering that Hereditary was a Family Drama that ended on a horrifying note. Well, without spoiling anything, don't hold your breath. The Third Act abruptly throws the film into the Art/Allegory category without providing much in the nature of horror.<br/><br/>Midsommar checks all of the boxes. It (kind of) answers all of the questions. But I left the theater, and my mind wandered back to Hereditary. Midsommar isn't really a film that stays with you, while for me (at least) Hereditary still does.<br/><br/>Loads of respect to Ari Aster for trying something completely different, but it loses points for simply not being scary or disturbing enough to stick with you.<br/><br/>For those of you who HAVEN'T seen Hereditary: (READ THIS if you SKIPPED)<br/><br/>On the plus side, Midsommar is unlike any horror film you've seen recently. It deserves to be seen at least once by any horror fan.<br/><br/>On the negative side, Midsommar struggles to even BE a horror film. It starts off as a drama and ends as an art show. Don't expect any scares to write home about. (Although to its credit, it does contain a few genuinely disturbing scenes)<br/><br/>TL;DR:<br/><br/>It's not Hereditary. It's barely a Horror film. But, in many ways, it's probably the most unique film you'll see this year. You'll show up for the ""horror"" but you'll only stay for the visuals.<br/><br/>Props to Ari Aster for shooting a Horror film 90% in broad daylight.

It's almost like a parody of Swedish and viking culture without managing to make it exciting at all. So many scenes are just painfully cringe, it's like watching screaming people from an insane asylum without it being scary, it's just embarrassing. I don't know how the actors and extras managed to keep from laughing when they filmed the scenes. 11 people are killed or die in the movie but trust me it's not scary at all. The start of it seems promising but then spirals down into total ridiculousness.

"scarletpumpernickel","7","1","2","14 January 2020"," What Happens In Harga, Stays In Harga
","There is a scene near the end of Midsommar, where our lugubrious Queen of the May is plodding across the turf, essentially towing a densely intertwined train of flowers behind her very handsome.. uhn.. gown.., which is roughly the size, weight, mass, and shape of a Volkswagen Beetle.
Upon seeing this, my instantaneous vision was that of the lugubrious horse at the beginning of Melancholia, entangled as it was in a tennis net.. while struggling to gallop away (albeit in super-slow-mo) from impending galactic catastrophe.. and the end of life on Earth as we know it.
This visual similarity led me to wonder if perhaps the same writer-director had written both movies (not the case) -- the more so, as I realized that each possessed and savored the same kind of tension throughout the film.., while the viewer is but a half-dead mouse being toyed with -- Will the worlds collide, or not?! Will some terrible pagan fate befall our hapless American visitors, or not?
In short, Midsommar was/is every bit as nerve wracking as Melancholia, or better yet, say, Wicker Man (Midsommar's inbred cousin).., which I'm guessing has been referenced by every reviewer thus far. So enough said about it.<br/><br/>Thus.. so much for plot and all that.., the more so, because lately my ""raison de la review"" has focused on only two things -- the synchronous mirroring of my personal life in any particular film (doubtless of no interest to you whatsoever), and the inevitable Hollywood/NWO indoctrination/propaganda being spewed by it.. (the film, not my life.)
NOTE: Please do not jump to conclusions, merely because I use words like ""indoctrination"" or ""propaganda"". Neither of these activities is necessarily all bad, as we usually assume.., just as franchise Religion or public education cannot be assumed to be ALL bad.<br/><br/>I bring this up, because imho.. in our current climate of aggressive social engineering, propaganda plays a big part. And, while once upon a time the Hollywood ""show-bu$iness"" industry was mostly about entertainment (with a little indoctrination thrown in).., we would be idiots not to notice that, in recent years, this relationship has reversed.
Imho, Hollywood is now mostly about propaganda -- some of it.. perhaps well intentioned and long overdue.., some.. simply paid for by ""The Powers That Be"", and aimed at creating a ""global"" future, the details of which virtually no two ""conspiracy theorists"" can agree on.<br/><br/>As for synchronicity (briefly).., I had my worries from the start..; BUT, in fact.., it wasn't long before I saw that the unrelenting tension and perpetual sense of danger, the mysterious, arcane pagan rites and mixed messages, semi-hostile glances and grotesque smiles.. was indeed an accurate and lucid portrayal of everyday life in my homeowners association.
It IS, however, a little early to know how that's all going to play out.<br/><br/>As for the propaganda (not so briefly).., this was far less surprising.
First, there is the highly predictable, de rigueur injections of male-bashing, reinforced by an inevitable showcasing of dickish behavior -- lying, obfuscation, condescension, anger, mansplaining -- supplmented by emotional weakness or excessiveness, and bouts of raw immaturity or effeminate self expression -- reinforced by a litany of emasculating images, such as our vaguely unattractive and oily protagonist (who bore an unnerving resemblance to Seth Rogan) trotting about the tundra in his birthday suit.., and further reinforced by robes and ""pedal-pushers"" worn by all the heathen gentlemen.
Special (sarcastic) kudos to the curiously agile looking septuagenarian, who apparently lacked the intelligence or courage to swan dive.., then merely broke his leg.. and earned himself The Gong, while the vexed and frustrated crowd booed him off stage. (Empathy.. my ass.)<br/><br/>Having hinted just now that both candidates for Ã„ttestupa (cliff diving) seemed quite fit and healthy, I'm not really sure whether the film was trying to endorse it or condemn it. Such ambivalence is probably my response to the whole bloody movie in general (as a sociological debate)..; but this lack of clarity merely lends credence to the premise that the story and subsequent questions it raises.. are, as I suggested, less important than the film's embedded propaganda.<br/><br/>Bear in mind.., Propaganda is often best (most effective).. when administered in small or subtle doses.
(Do recall, if you can, the elder who stated that homeopathy was one of the community's sources of income? -- possibly the same elder who, when asked about his frock, gave it a little swish, and explained that they were worn by the men as a tribute to hermaphroditism (translation: transgendering.., a huge Hollywood/Masonic agenda).<br/><br/>And.., with that epiphanous observation, I believe I'm suggesting that the overarching symbol-simile of Midsommar is the Harga community itself, which could easily be seen as a metaphor for Hollywood.
In that sense.. we could easily compare the homeopathic injections of Hollywood indoctrination.. to the doses of narcotizing ""teas"" and/or the occasional follicle in ones chicken pot pie, the wisps of inhalents (aromatherapy) common to their pagan apothecary, and other assorted magical ""natural"" remedies, etc..., collectively (the propaganda now) leading us all toward a sort of chronic, mass anesthesia, attended by slavish obedience to the nearest cell tower.. and an emotionless wife and several ""unclouded"" children to keep us hopping.<br/><br/>In short, bit by bit, movie by movie.. we.. the voluntarily indoctrinated people of the United States of America Inc. are being prepared for whatever our paganistic NWO hosts have in mind.., if only to be assembly-line drones.. or soylent-green fertilizer for vegetables which have been engineered to mysteriously thrive in soil contaminated by cloud-laden aluminum, strontium, barium, etc etc., borne of so-said ""clouds"", better known as CHEMTRAILS.<br/><br/>And Ah ha!! You now think I've wandered astray. Not so.
Had you paid attention you would have noticed several shots of the sky above Harga, in which definite chemtrails were present -- thereby (as good homeopathic propaganda will do).. merely, if only subliminally.. adding just another drop of lethargy to our midday tea.., until sooner or later what's achieved is a ""new normal"".
Call it the cycle of life.., where the old realities give way to the new (nudged off the precipice).., and chemtrails and human sacrifice are thought as normal as Friday night football.. or Molloch worship at Bohemian Grove.<br/><br/>Pity me. At bottom, I'm struggling to see how this movie is worth watching -- especially if one has already seen Wicker Man.., neither of which movies I would particularly recommend for young children btw.., as tempting as that might be for the increasing number of neo-druidic parents.. eager to induct their children into the delights of nature worship, etc.., not to mention geronticide (which was re-popularized during the Obama years).<br/><br/>I say this NOT entirely with tongue-in-cheek. That is, I have long considered that tribalism would make a comeback, and become the next step in (America's) evolution -- especially given the financial crisis, housing crisis, employment crisis, marriage crisis, etc. etc.., combined with the enticing lure of the corporate business model --
I.e., what works for Coca Cola should work for the average over-stressed ""family"".., and free daycare!<br/><br/>In other words.., I don't care to attack Midsommar as a promotional film for this sort of bipolar, anti-Christian, commune-flavored, garden-centric, predictably-uniformed matriarchy. I'll merely point out that.. if it weren't for the tautly poised protests of Hollywood, and the thin black line of Amish buckwagons standing between paganism and Christianity, we'd probably have seen the word ""cult"" pop up somewhere in this film. (Oh no.., she di'int.)<br/><br/>Praise Horga.!! And let the chips fall where they may.<br/><br/>PS -- I usually recommend a sort of counterbalance.. after reviewing these propaganda pieces -- say, some small independent gem, as yet unpolluted by corporate money.
In this case.. I thought of a film more-or-less also centered around an obscure community -- namely Granger Washington (not far from here actually.) It's titled Cement Suitcase.

The cinematography was amazing! The vibrant colours gave you a delusional sense of happiness, and that all was pleasant. The premise was a sect that believed in recycle of purpose, i.e., each human had had four stages of production life, liken the four seasons. At the end of the 4th cycle, you died literally. Each step was a time for celebration, because the divine task had been completed. But, the problem of a sect was the reduction of genes pool, so that's why outsiders were invited to have a good time and to replenish a healthy population. The person chosen had to be divinely compatible - blond hair, blue eyes, white skin - and disposable if you are a guy. But if you were a divine girl, come, stay, and be their sister.

","I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library, not my wife's type of movie.<br/><br/>This was made by the same writer/director that brought us ""Hereditary"" a year earlier, I like this one much more. It is confusing much of the time but when it is all over you realize it is a fable of sorts for the lead character, Dani, to come to some resolution from the loss of her family and coming to terms with her dud of a boyfriend.<br/><br/>Look up the entire lyrics of 'Hotel California' by The Eagles, with this movie in mind you can find many parallels.<br/><br/>I already was a Florence Pugh fan from her roles in Lady MacBeth (2016) and Fighting With My Family (2019). Here she is Dani who tragically loses her sister and parents, in grief accompanies her boyfriend and three other guys to Sweden in late June to witness, and ultimately participate in, a ritualistic Pagan festival. But it also goes deeper, to the core of the group's beliefs. By the end Dani achieves resolution, the other four are not so fortunate.<br/><br/>This is a really strange movie once they get to Sweden, there is very explicit and gory violence, there is a big non-erotic sex scene with a number of nude characters. Everything is designed to shock the senses of the viewer. I would not like to see movies like this on a regular basis but as a one-off experience I found it a totally worthwhile 2 1/2 hours."

There are shades of ""The Wicker Man"" here, but this is nowhere near as well written or as scary. Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor try their best but this just doesn't really work.

"ben-snooks","6","1","2","12 November 2019"," Building building building to not much at all
","I am a film buff. I usually watch on average one film per day from all types of genres. This film starts off well but it kind of gets lost in the middle. It's a long film at over 2 hours and after the first 45 minutes it settles into a suspenseful middle section. The way it build reminds me of old horror films like Texas Chainsaw or The Cabin in the Woods where there is something out there just beyond view but as a viewer you aren't exposed to exactly what it is. Unfortunately for this film, it's ultimately not much out there hiding. It's as it seems at the 1 hour mark that the villagers are bonkers and we could have got to that conclusion much quicker than dragging out the suspense for an hour and a half. The film also reminds me of the shining in it's pacing. The supporting male characters don't really develop and kind of goof along stupidly. I was hoping for some decent action at the end but it's fairly tame. The ending just kind of goes up in smoke. The film tries to open up some discussion on mental illness, death, grieving, puritanism and paganism but ultimately fails because although we are shown these things they aren't explored deeply or with any sense of conclusion. It's a very well graded and shot film and the visuals help keep the viewer interested over the long film duration. As a viewer I stayed to the end with this slow story but ultimately I wasn't rewarded as a viewer for my attention and the ending fell short. If the director cut 40 minutes from this film then I think it would have been better. There's a lot of repeated dialog, shots and plot points that could be removed. If you are aiming at a slow burn horror like the Shining then there better be blood streaming down the walls and a psycho with a knife. There's no real action or much excitement except for dancing around the may pole high on hallucinogens."

With this film, Ari still has some work to do knowing when the audience needs to see a scene and when he just wants wants us to. It could have been so much more if he had tightened up the script, the scenes and the dialogue.<br/><br/>There was an unnecessary 45 minutes of film that could have been chopped and it would have been great but the longer it went on, the more I just sat there resenting the time I was wasting.<br/><br/>He is a great director and his vision is unique and I do respect that but length isn't everything and his pacing needs work.<br/><br/>I ended up feeling the characters outstayed their welcome, they were just moving from scene to scene.

","I'm going to start by saying I have only just recently seen Midsommar over this past weekend for our annual horror/fright film night.<br/><br/>Thinking this would be a decent follow on film from Ari Aster after Hereditary, I honestly thought this would be a good choice for us as I had seen some reviews and heard through the grapevine that Midsommar was an ""interesting"" film.<br/><br/>I've now seen the film twice in the period of 48 hours, so I feel that I can give a more proactive review, rather than a knee jerk reactive review...<br/><br/>Screw it, I can't be proactive with Midsommar. Even after watching this beautifully shot film twice in 48 hours, I cannot fathom how people can enjoy the slow burning pain that is Midsommar.<br/><br/>The first viewing, I felt the first 10 minutes were solid and I recognised the Ari Aster visuals from Hereditary were in abundance, alongside the moody score, dark stabs and twisted harmonies. I was sold at this point. But how wrong I was 10 minutes after.<br/><br/>Enter cliche Wickerman/Rosemary's Baby storylines.<br/><br/>Hereditary had it's problems, there is no denying that, but Midsommar is just full pretentious writing and art driven spoiler mosaics tied neatly between the opening segment and the end credits.<br/><br/>Midsommar tries to be Wickerman, but it falls flat on its face. It tries to be Rosemary's Baby but doesn't have the character strength to compete. And finally, it tries to be an undertoned slasher but doesn't have the right narrative when it's trying to be both the formers.<br/><br/>I cannot stress enough how annoyed I was when some people in the room who were watching Midsommar with us said how ""atmospheric"" it was. To that, I can only respond that it is indeed atmospheric (thanks to the score), but Ari Aster has no right to feed me a self indulged, overly drawn out pantomime passion project that you literally see coming on a washing line.<br/><br/>I then watched Midsommar again without a room full of people, and I felt angrier for doing so. 5 hours of my life gone.<br/><br/>The score and cinematography is beautiful, it really is, but its lying alongside a steaming mess of writing and narrative that's been done before, and done better.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen either Hereditary or Midsommar...go with Hereditary. You'll be glad you did, and I hope I would have saved your own time."

"Fairbrit","6","1","2","1 November 2019"," Plagiarizing of a familiar story.
","I feel quite upset that Ari Aster, the director, did not once mention in his interview in the DVD that his story was inspired by THE WICKER MAN. There are so many similarities to this movie (filmed in the UK in 1970s) that it's difficult for me to watch Midsommar without referring to the original film on which Aster surely must have based his story? Even the final scene of the burning construction is straight out of the 1970s film yet Aster makes absolutely no mention of this brilliant far more scary film when discussing his own. Because I saw The Wicker Man when I was a teenager in the 70s it made a huge impact upon me. Therefore Midsommar just does not cut it. It lacks the suprises, the twists, the horror. Midsommar is far too gory and visual to be truly scary. There are so many clues along the way. The name of the Swedish village Halsingland sounds like Hell's Land. I mean, who could not have put two and two together when watching this? Although I very much enjoyed Florence Pugh's chilling performance in LADY MACBETH I found she was far too intense and over-reaching in this role. Nothing seems to connect: what happened to her parents and sister? And why? It does not make any sense to randomly have Pugh experience this trauma if it does not relate to the film. I am sure this will become a cult but not for any of the reasons why it should be."

The characters are rather dull and there is somewhat of an unconnected feeling throughout the film. No where is there any real horror, just a plethora of psychedelic nonsense. It aims at depicting disparaging glimpses of pagan Litha and comes off pretentious, the ritualistic, purification, blood sacrifice, rebirth, fertility, blah, blah. I tried my best to not compare the film with Ari Aster's previous, but really the two films can't be more dissimilar.

The writing is also really interesting with a very unique theme about disfunctional relationships. The only thing that doesn't always work is the pacing of the story. Around the middle of the movie the story weirdly slows down and can become a little bit boring. Although it does pick back up the effects of the slow pace can make the movie feel very long and uninteresting at some points but the good really outweighs the bad. The super bizarre setting and feel to the movie, beautiful cinematography, spectacular acting, and great writing makes Midsommar a very interesting sophomore feature for Ari Aster although it is nowhere near as good as Hereditary.

Having been impressed by the obvious echoes of a rising new wave of horror in Hereditary ,I waited impatiently for Midsommar since they anounced it as his next movie , and the first trailer made the wait unbearable,
A group of american friends including a couple on the verge of a break-up travel to Sweden to attend a pagan festival , urine on their sacred trees , impregnate them, try their weed, eat their pubes, and eventually getting killed in an aesthetic way influenced by Fuller's Hannibal Lecter one by one as a punishment except for May Queen who had to witness all the madness unfold around her and get more and more fused with the crazy reality around her that is so far from normal till the moment of enlightment and clarity .<br/><br/>I think Aster excels in trying new techniques and invading new territories , Making horror in broad daylight (which I thought would be something new and maybe a gimmick but I found it contributing in positive way to the psychological horror faced by our protagonists, using graphic aesthetic violence that few dared to try and succeeded , the camera tricks while they were under the influence of drugs wass mesmerizing , subtle and well done ..
The sustained daylight even when it was supposed to be dark throughout the movie and the crazy bizzare rituals that are far away from normal yet that is considered to be logical and routine gave me a sense of psychological claustrophobia , I'm imprisoned with the protagonists in a secluded place with all sorts of crazy events that are considered normal by everyone except for us , that is well done psychological horror right there,
The foreshadowing throughout the movie for the ending was a little bit expected but I liked it anyway ,
Florence Pugh was very good,
The set design and Art direction was more than perfect,<br/><br/>I think Ari Aster is going places with his second (innovative) horror movie and he is about to join the ranks of people like Carpenter , Argento and Romero ..

"torivt65","8","1","2","12 October 2019"," What I think this movie is about...
","You've read all of the other reviews about the fantastic acting, stunning scenery and cinematography, and unsettling score so I will concur and skip those aspects. One thing I will add to the unsettling part, I hate gore, I read the MPAA rating reviews (minus spoilers) to know what I'm getting myself into. I thought this would be worse and almost didn't watch but I could see over half the icky parts coming and look away and I was glad I watched anyway.
I'm a big fan of smart, slow-burner suspense movies and this is the epitome of that. The spoilers talk about Dani's integration and assimilation with nature and ultimately the cult. For me the main theme and why she joins them is empathy. She goes through the most traumatic moment of her life and she's grieving w/ every part of her soul and her boyfriend awkwardly holds her in his lap, looking miserable, barely touching her. Contrasted w/ discovering his betrayal and all of the woman holding, touching, and grieving with her. This empathizing is seen in many scenes with the cult members; the cliff dive dying man, the orgy, and the final burning.
I'm sure there's many more aspects I missed and I look forward to googling other theories. But the scene where Dani's pain is finally shared and validated made me cry and, in a movie scenario at least, understand her final actions."
"cruise01","8","1","2","10 October 2019"," Shocking direction but slow moving.
","Midsommar (4 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>Midsommar is a folk horror film that leaves you feeling disturbed, unsettled, and speechless by the time the film ends. It is one of those cult films about a pagan cult in Sweden were they have rituals that are weird, awkward, and disturbing. The direction of the film is beautifully done by Ari Aster (Hereditary). If you seen Hereditary you may expect some of the same direction techniques. A slow building story, unsettling suspense and disturbing thoughts about what you are seeing. Ari Aster is two for two with his directing. The film delivers with the powerful performances by Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor. The music score delivers.<br/><br/>The plot follows Dani (Florence Pugh) who is struggling with family matters about her estranged sister. While her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) is tired of their relationship and wants out. Christian was planning a trip with his friends to Sweden to visit a commune festival. After a tragedy strikes Dani which Christian feels bad. He brings her along with his friends to this commune were it is like some kind of Pagan Cult.<br/><br/>I can not give much details about the plot without entering spoiler territory. Besides there are some wtf moments and some cringy scenes that makes you feel unsettled. Plus there are some gory and graphic scenes that will make you shocked. The ending does leave you feeling a little speechless about what happens. Which makes you question on some characters motives and actions.<br/><br/>The direction is really well done. The cinematography work is great capturing the beauty of the scenery and the haunting feeling of being isolated in this commune. The music score works well with the cult tone. The set designs with symbols and rituals these people are performing makes you question with their beliefs.<br/><br/>I did not find the film at all scary or horrifying. Just disturbed with some characters fate revealed and the graphic nature of the sacrifice and rituals.<br/><br/>Florence Pugh delivered with her performance. She delivered a lot of emotions with the character. With her feeling wrecked emotionally with her family issue and her boyfriend ignoring her. Jack Reynor was also good as well playing an arrogant kind of guy.<br/><br/>The film is slow moving with its direction. Its two and a half hours long. The story is slow moving which may lose some audience. Definitely, one of those films that you will need patience for.<br/><br/>Overall, Midsommar is a good film. It delivers shock and disturbing unsettling feel. The plot is a scary folk tale of a pagan cult. The performances are great. The script and direction is slow moving but it delivers the unsettling mood."

"andrewburgereviews","8","1","2","3 October 2019"," Her worst retribution
","Ari Aster is a man who understands horror in the truest sense of the word. With ""Hereditary"", his debut feature, he made a movie which filled me with an inescapable dread. Like the place where its occult theme came from, it felt like hell--and boy was it good. Here, Ari Aster shows us he still understands the meaning of dread. But this film is nowhere near as scary as ""Hereditary"". This is not a critique but an observation and its lack of conventional fear should be welcomed with openness.<br/><br/>Instead, ""Midsommar"" tends to go, believe it or not, towards a hardcore couple drama/thriller. It starts clearly with an egotistical him who does not put enough effort into her. And it has a burning finale representing both literally and metaphorically her worst retribution--she made her own justice. If you might find her justice satisfactory, I also found it a bit overworked. I did not expect such a convoluted, complex, cultural 2 and a half-hour film to climax towards such a specific first-world idea. Like it says on one of those signs in Looney Tunes that Bugs Bunny sometimes holds: ""Was this trip really necessary?""<br/><br/>But who is him and her? He is Christian (Jack Reynor) and she is Dani (Florence Pugh). They go with a group of friends in Sweden for a special festival that happens once every 90 years. Christian and his friends are PHD students looking to work on their thesis more or less whereas Dani comes off a recent tragedy. I will not spoil it here but is devastating. Her cries of anguish will haunt you. Aster does not opt for the usual Hollywoodian ""cry beautiful"" nonsense. He wants us to feel her suffering and sympathize her--and trust me, you will.<br/><br/>As we join the characters into the Swedish pastures this movie becomes really beautiful. The shots of the green lands and the folkloric costumes and set design of the natives and various shackles, respectively are warm and inviting. The people are welcoming and indeed they do not despite the visitors. You feel this pagan cult has no hatred for life and humanity, they simply follow their traditions. It just so happens their traditions are, well, you'll see. The way Aster generates agoraphobia in the viewer is by keeping the shots close to its lead characters which often feel like they need intimacy. Even during the brief wide shots the landscape is still not contained and there are many bizarre dances and theatrics going on in the background.<br/><br/>And how interesting the cultists are. There are a few individuals which are given focus but most of their personalities come from their collective actions. The way they move and suddenly stop looking in a certain direction feels like they are a hive mind controlled by an unseen entity and their mystery and lack of historical insight make them more unknown and therefore more uneasy to be surrounded by them. Their part-fictive origin (the non-fictive part coming from some inspiration from Norse mythology) gives Aster freedom to create. This results in a few brief moments when he delves into classic shock methods as he attempts to inspire fear in the cult by reducing them to sadistic murderers. The reason why ""Hereditary"" was so unsettling is because Aster inspired himself 100% from real-life occultism and simply expressed its most dreadful rituals. Here, the film clearly lacks a certain ""real events"" power.<br/><br/>""Midsommar"" is much more than a horror film. Its meanings go even deeper than ""Hereditary"" did. This does not necessarily means is better. Yet through its lead characters, it hints at notions of white male privilege, even racism (albeit birefly) and, of course, couple inequality. The ending will feel like a hurrah for every woman who is mistreated in a relationship even if it will make some more stable non-drama-ridden couples feel a bit uneasy."

"aGlassofCinema_com","6","1","2","19 September 2019"," I wanted to walk out midmovie...
","Midsommar is Director Ari Aster's second feature film, which follows his surprise breakout hit Hereditary. I personally enjoyed THAT movie very much, but THIS movie was an exercise in frustration...<br/><br/>Midsommar follows five graduate students who take a summer trip to a Swedish village in the middle of nowhere. Dani (the main character) is an anxiety ridden disaster that Christian (her boyfriend) wants nothing more than to dump like a ton of anxiety ridden bricks. Josh is the token black character that ALMOST dies first, and Mark is the annoying rude one who DESERVEDLY dies first. Pelle is seemingly there as a plot device to get the group to the aforementioned setting of the movie (it's where he grew up.)<br/><br/>If it sounds like I don't like any of these characters, that's because they do nothing to warrant my sympathy or interest. They all fit their stereotypical horror movie roles and don't seem to deviate at all from them. The great part of Hereditary is that the characters were relatable and weren't passive vehicles to the plot. They all participated to create the monstrous ending (the husband choosing to do nothing, the wife performing the ritual that started the chain of events, the son being a part of the horrifying mid-movie accident) but I don't recall any of the goobers in this movie actively doing anything besides walking around the village and watching everything happen/letting things happen to them. Granted, many horror movies have characters that don't really fight back, and the heavy lifting is done by the creepy house, the scary monster, or in this case the village and the cult that inhabits it.<br/><br/>To give credit where it's due, it's clear that a great deal of effort went into the production of the story's setting, which was the only character in the film I actually cared about. The majority of the movie's run time is spent showing almost every detail of the village of Hårga: the houses are covered with unsettling drawings (that to the discerning eye act as foreshadowing for the film's conclusion), and the white gowns, robes and flowery wreaths of the villagers are beautiful and ornate. Yet it's surprisingly minimalist, as there is probably no more than ten or so houses/structures in the entire village. Part of the horror is that you can see the entire village for the majority of the film thanks to the excellent camerawork, and yet there is something lurking below the surface that you CAN'T see. The characters seem small in the wide open space, and there's a paradoxical feeling of claustrophobia you won't be able to shake.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the film's glaring flaw eventually becomes apparent: that promise of unseen horror isn't enough to carry the movie for almost two and a half hours. After 90 minutes you've seen basically the whole village, and being forced to visit the same places over and over (a long table for every meal, the same dormitory to sleep) becomes stale. I found myself becoming impatient and wanting SOMETHING to happen just to move the story a little bit faster. While the payoff is eventually reached, at that point I was so burned out that it's impact was much less than it could have been. Almost every character meets their demise off screen, and while you do find out what happens to them, it's all at once and the fact that they're already dead really deflates the the build up. Ironically, the most horrifying moment of the film for me was within the first 15 minutes. It's even telegraphed well in advance, and yet as the camera pans through the dark house and the music swells the plausibility of what has happened evokes true horror. Maybe that's why the prolonged run time is felt even more; the film starts with a bang, and forcing the audience to wait such a long time for the next horrifying moment just doesn't work.<br/><br/>Midsommar is not a horror movie that will make you jump. It's a slow burn psychological thriller that unfortunately takes way too long to reach it's conclusion. While the ending is horrifying, depending on your point of view, two hours of exposition for 15 minutes of pay off may not be worth it."
"susana-c-fernandes","5","1","2","14 September 2019"," Loved Hereditary, bored to death at Midsommar
","What a pity. The first sequence sets a disturbing mood only to become a poor excuse for two and a half hours of a single character development curve, while people are chanting, dancing and making other equally uninteresting/sleep inducing things to see on a horror movie. This wasn't entertaining in the slightest bit, it was simply boring... Not scary, not interesting, a bit intriguing at parts but definitely too funny for its own good. It doesn't pay off in the end. I think every director should ask themselves if they really want to subject audiences to movies this long... Maybe Ari got lost in his own success from Hereditary, because this was really bad. I only give it 5 for the photography and main actress' performance, all the rest kind of fell apart along with the (very basic) story."

","The movie isn't that compelling aside from the first 10-15 minutes. The main group of characters, aside from Dani have don't have anything development or personality wise to them. Which makes their deaths forgettable (they don't show like any of the deaths anyway). And it dragged for way longer than it needed too. I'm a patient guy and don't mind long movies, but when the scenes are boring and dragging, it makes it unwatchable. The movie tries really hard to be artsy and have meaning, but in the end just tries to hard in my eyes. Hereditary was better by far and honestly save this for a streaming service of some sort."

"sme3","6","1","2","13 July 2019"," A Long Trip to Nowhere
","For a film in which almost nothing happens, Midsommar is remarkably watchable, which probably is to the credit of its director, Ari Aster. On the other hand, Aster deserves blame for taking so long to tell so little. What little that does transpire in Midsommar occurs because of plot. Logic, rhyme, reason, and character motivations are almost completely absent from this film. Ultimately, the film has nothing to say about its subject matter and offers few thrills, which begs the question why was talent and effort wasted on such a pointless endeavor?"
"andrewhuk","6","1","2","12 July 2019"," Some breathtaking moments but ultimately disappointing.
","Ari Aster delivers his second feature film with Midsommar. Whilst it's undoubtedly a step up from Hereditary, the film shares the same problems as that debut, tangling itself so tightly in its own constructs and mysticism that by the time the final act plays out it disappears inside itself leaving the audience behind.<br/><br/>You can't help but admire the ambition of Aster. He creates a hazy dream world all of his own in which beauty and horror are one and the same. His technical prowess is certainly on display here too. The cinematography is gorgeous and the soundtrack will surely finish the year as one of the very best. His direction whilst at times misguided and heavy handed is also undoubtedly skilled and there are one or two truly stunning moments that linger in the mind, the first coming merely minutes into the film.<br/><br/>With all that said, whilst there is much here to commend, the film begins to unravel in the last 30 to 40 minutes. Much like in his debut Aster has big, profound ideas but the writing, pacing and execution of the last act is flawed to the point that any meaning he is attempting to convey here is lost amongst increasingly confusing and disjointed imagery.<br/><br/>There is enough evidence to suggest that Aster has the talent to make truly incredible work and as his writing ability gets better I'm confident he will. For now we have a film in Midsommar that although very good in parts ultimately falls short."
"archcorenth","5","1","2","10 July 2019"," The Least Violent Horror Movie I've Ever Seen
","That might not have been my headline had it not been for professional reviews which promise something that never comes. If you go hoping to see carnage you'll be disappointed. Similarly, if you go hoping to get scared, that is about impossible with this slow hypnotic drug-fuelled film. About the only thing it delivers on as far as questionable material is weird sex.<br/><br/>But is it worth seeing as a drama? The acting is generally very good. There are some neat special effects that do capture the psychedelics of the mushrooms very well. The message on the other hand is no more complicated than drugs are bad because they take away your ability to make good choices and to protect yourself, and also, cults are bad. (but there are much better movies about the latter). I think the movie's strongest quality is that it is two and a half hours long with no real suspense and yet never becomes boring."
"briz_boy_10","6","1","2","9 July 2019"," Just like other cult films, this is strange.
","A few years go i remember seeing Ari Aster's Hereditary in the cinemas. I was very excited to see it due to the reviews i had seen. However, by the end of that movie i was actually quite annoyed that I was pulled in by the same old tropes critics use for these kind of 'artsy' films by claiming it was a new classic. It certainly wasn't. Anyway, i decided to give Aster another chance after i thought the trailer for this looked very interesting. So here's my review:<br/><br/>First of all the acting in this is fantastic. Florence Pugh is the stand out in this as she goes through every emotion possible in this film and makes it feel believable as to why she feels a certain way at certain times. This is one of the things i DID like about Hereditary - the acting. Another thing to praise is that visually it's quite a stunning film. Every shot in this film feels like it was seriously thought out and in a strange way kind of makes you feel happy which i think the film is trying to do in a very strange brainwashing way. Almost to make us feel how the characters are feeling. Another great thing is that it's not the kind of film that relies on jump scares to make you feel uncomfortable. A combination of acting, setting, and camerawork do it just fine.<br/><br/>There are also some very funny moments in this. Will Poulter cracks a few jokes here and there but the main laughs in this film i think may have been unintentional. Without giving anything away, there's a lengthy scene towards the end that had my entire cinema laughing out loud. Its safe to say its definitely quite silly in some parts.<br/><br/>That said, this film deals with some of the same themes as Hereditary which is where it falls apart a little bit. Themes such as grief, paranoia, and sacrifice. The story doesn't really evolve too much and you can guess early on where this film is going to go. Also, like other strange cult films, there is never a satisfying explanation/conclusion to the film. It doesn't give enough for the viewer to really understand what the hell just happened.<br/><br/>Because Critics loved Asters previous film, lots of them talk highly of this one too. However, that's the weird 'artsy' part of themselves talking who think a slow burn is a bright burn.<br/><br/>Overall, I did find myself enjoying this film mostly for the reasons stated previously. It is a very well made film. Just dont expect to see anything you haven't seen before (except maybe that one hilarious scene i briefly touched upon!). It went on for probably 30 minutes too long and could have done with a more well developed story. If you liked Hereditary i think you will like this. If you didn't then you'll probably still have a more enjoyable(?) experience.<br/><br/>6/10"

","There are clear pararelels with ""The Wicker Man"" here but this film goes way overboard with the sex and gore apparently inherent in a fictional Swedish pagan cult. Some scenes linger for far too long and the film is teppered with moments of humour that just seem out of place. The transition from studious onlookers to victims by the invited foreign ""guests"" is not really smooth or even believable. After witnessing two suicides (one actually more akin to murder) one can't quite believe that all the ""guests"" wouldn't simply have run away. The film does deserve some artistic merit with its set designs and the performances of the background cast, and the location is well chosen, but the screenplay lacks quality and the direction is nothing more than average. The film too heavily relies on a huge shock factor to instill audience attention rather than building on genuine atmosphere and suspense (the latter of which quite frankly it has none). The relationship between the two main characters, Christian and Dina, is at best not fully explored, and at worst superficial with Christian labeled as untrustworthy from the start, but even by close we still don't really know who he is. On the plus side Florence Pugh puts in an excellent performance as Dani. Its a film that will split audiences and even if, like me, you are underwhelmed, I found it one of the oddest and strangest films I think I've ever seen. Judge for yourself."

","If you've seen a lot of movies (which you probably have if you are old enough and live in the modern world!), then you're probably bored from how similar and predictable the movies are nowadays.
This movie is different.
That makes it precious.
It touches such topics as psychedelics, nature, and off-stream society with scary rituals.
Of course the rituals seem exaggerated, but I believe in reality every off-stream countryside society has quite some inhumane traditions.
I think the movie is a masterpiece.
It left quite a bitter aftertaste. But I love how ""close to life"" it is, compared to most modern movies that are all about action. This movie lets you observe and feel in-depth.
Last but not least, it is visually beautiful."

","Rating: 7<br/><br/>The title is the best summary I can put up for the movie. I cannot describe this movie in a better sense for I myself couldn't understand the motive behind it. After producing a movie like Hereditary, I believe Aster failed to shine on this one. The only reason I am giving it a 7 is because of it's outstanding visuals. I like art-movies which have beautiful visuals and this does not sway from the trend. The theme of the film also revolves around manipulation. It shows how cults tend to manipulate the weak by seducing them in showing the world their way.<br/><br/>The Good - The cinematography and the acting. I appreciate the visuals, the vividness and the brilliant acting put up by Florence Pugh. I also like the fact how some scenes turn out to be outright hilarious, disturbing and sad.<br/><br/>The Bad - Although Pugh's acting was great her character was whining at every moment in the film. I don't know whether to sympathize with the character or just be depressed by it. The movie involves grotesque rituals which will either be comical or disturbing to you.<br/><br/>I could find symbolism in the movie and I wouldn't point it out as I would like for you to see it. The movie is for the people who appreciate experimental, art-movies. If you want to watch a horror movie for jumpscares, this movie is not for you."

","If you look at the larger picture, the overall plot is unrealistic: a guy leads his American friends to their ultimate demise, which is never going to happen because of the wider implications for him and his entire community. This is not a video game and police do not miraculously forget about a group of missing persons, making the basic premise of the film somewhat ridiculous.<br/><br/>But was I entertained, did I think about it afterwards and am I writing this brief review? Yes. And the more I think about it, it's almost horror genre gold. Gold in the sense of laughing out loud at a woman singing in a shrill voice while holding the hand of another female while literally getting ceremoniously fucked, but admittedly rolling my eyes and getting a bit bored by the end, but perhaps I'm just lucky at having watched junk TV on Netflix lately, which makes me appreciate the very slow pace and stupendous acting in this film while also understanding that it's not supposed to be serious or something you can draw real-life conclusions from, and also because I knew nothing about the film beforehand and had zero expectations.<br/><br/>Entertaining, unexpected, but rather too long and quixotic for many people's tastes, but with references to Lars von Trier in a less sinister but more directly accessible and enjoyable format, to in-bred horror communities and classy Wrong Turns or even Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut or Harrison Ford in Witness. So inviting, and yet you wish you'd stayed away."

","If you are not into artsy films, then probably this isn't the right film for you. I can understand why this has divided audiences, it is long, unlike most horror movies and the movie relies a lot on the shock effect and on its cinematography. Therefore, it is by no means another slasher/typical horror movie.<br/><br/>Ari Aster and the film crew did an amazing job with the cinematography. It is spectacular and it can only remind me of the one of 'The Shining', another film which highly divided the audiences and critics when it was initially released. It was even nominated for 2 Razzie awards!<br/><br/>The pacing is indeed slow, but in my opinion it gradually builds the atmosphere and sets the right tone.<br/><br/>The only con I found about this film, is the reaction of the main characters after they saw what the cult was forcing their members to do when they turned 72. You would have expected all of them to leave, but probably driven by their curiosity, they decided to stay and for the most part, they didn't seem to worry that much about what was going on.<br/><br/>Overall, I would highly recommend this film, but bear in mind that it isn't for everyone."

","The film looked promising because of the trailers and reviews, but I had my first doubts when I realized how long it would be. And it is long, for no real reason.

At a certain point I could almost not watch it anymore, was disappointed by the minimal tension-building scenes, and I was several times close to prematurely ending the movie. My date told me afterwards that I could have done it with pleasure.<br/><br/>It's not a real horror movie, but it managed to put me under psychological strain, which almost no other horror movie has done so far, therefore 2 stars. Unfortunately this psychological ""horror"" effect seemed more like a by-product of a really boring movie without climaxes or depth.<br/><br/>It reminded me somewhat of a phobia I once read about, the fear of hot summer afternoons, where nothing really happens except the sun burning down on earth, the crickets chirping and one realising how unimportant everything seems to be, how the Earth is just a spinning rock forever trapped around a hot Fireball, burning down forever and ever, not caring about us Humans, dehumanizing Life, just like this Movie.<br/><br/>It had some potential, but I do not want to see this movie ever again and I do not recommend it to anyone."

","If you enjoyed Hereditary you will enjoy this. This movie is well done and thought through in a thoughtful way. Every aspect and decision was made in a way to add to the unsettling feeling this movie pushed on you from start to end. This movie is made to make the viewer develop a feeling of ""tripping on mushroom tea"" just as the characters do. The times that the characters drink the tea, the trees in the background as well as Danny's flower crow start to move. This ensues a feeling to the viewer that they too, are tripping. I love the detail in the gory killings that take place, it may sound messed up but it shows attention to detail and that nothing should go unnoticed during this film. I could go on and on about why this movie it good. I saw this 3 times and noticed new aspects every time and grew my appreciation for it. The way that the ""cult"" feels the feelings that others feel, and grieve when others grieve is somewhat beautiful. Not to mention the stunning shot when Danny drags herself across the frame in her flower gown while the bright yellow building burns down with her boyfriend inside. Every shot and every placement of actors or props is on purpose.<br/><br/>Anyway, I hope everyone watches this (well.. those who appreciate f-ed up movies like this) and love this as much as I did.

","I watched this film last night after my friend and sister did. I knew it was violent, but holy moly does this film stretch its R rating to the max. Funnily enough, it was rated NC-17 at a point- albeit not for the reason I would have thought- though director Ari Aster managed to get it down to an R rating. However, in terms of artistic merit and thematic cohesion, this film absolutely rules.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is stellar. Florence Pugh provides so much soul in her performance, and at times, you can truly feel her grief towards what has brought her into the situation she gets stuck in for most of the film. The themes of the film are brutal and harsh, but not nihilistic, drab, or self-absorbed in the way that other experimental, artsy horror films can be (if you want to hate yourself, go watch the needless and pretentious film ""Begotten"" instead).<br/><br/>The cinematography of this film is just outstanding too. The pacing is slow, but the film has such a profound beauty in its sheer madness that I never got bored for a second (again, I'm looking at you, Begotten...). The film starts very simple and with a fantastically peaceful melancholy, but by the end, the film becomes the most chaotic thing I've ever seen on tape.<br/><br/>I didn't even like Hereditary all that much, but this film just rocks.

"emirfithri-12517","10","2","7","2 November 2019"," Innuendo of Religions
","A great film has many point of views and left the audiences wondering what the film is actually about. And as I read thru the reviews, true enough there are wide range of comments from praising the artful ways of the movie down to bashing how crappy the movie is.<br/><br/>Those who felt it was crappy, definitely were insulted by this movie. In a way we feel insulted when outsiders criticize and portray our religions as it is.<br/><br/>To me this movie portrays a typical religion - a cult that has turned the non logical actions (useless rituals, perversities, and even violence) into something emotionally joyous and beautiful. A character even said the elders who commited suicide felt 'JOY' when the tourist asked. The outsiders, aka the tourists, show a wide range of stances - staying ignorant, being absolute hateful, being an apologist (attempting to understand and keeping an 'open mind'), and even trying to gain advantage from it (completing a thesis).<br/><br/>The cult clearly lures outsiders to their ways - preying on the weak (Dani), and preying via relationships with one of their own (Christian). And they do this by advertising a fake, beautiful and peaceful front. And when the a few newcomers tourists saw their evil ways, they are immediately terminated, no way out.<br/><br/>And at the end, we can see Dani, the weakest of all, finally successfully being assimilated into the cult, joyously performing the useless rituals, and finally even feeling joy, smiling, when her boyfriend is burned alive. Dani finally converted into the cult and has become just another nutter religious person.<br/><br/>A great act by all actors. The nudities are unnecessary to be honest. The movie itself is staged beautifully so nudities spoiled it a bit for me. Overall a thought provoking and kind of traumatic, nonetheless a great movie that deserves a 15/10 from me."

"ccamp89","8","2","7","4 September 2019"," Solid 4 // Perverse Breakup Fantasy
","Given the speed with which Hereditary ascended to the company of my all-time horror favorites, Midsommar had a lot to live up to. Too much, perhaps. The weight of my expectations certainly burdened my initial viewing of the film as I hotly anticipated Aster's second helping of ratcheting tension, deepening dread, despairing tone, and delayed-gratification thrills. What I got instead was unexpected, though pleasantly so.<br/><br/>Where Hereditary is unequivocally steeped in traditional horror iconography and tone, Midsommar is difficult to categorize as horror at all. Though it certainly has a few horrific sequences, the prevailing mood of the film is lighter with a significant emphasis on dark comedy. It plays more like a perverse fantasy in which Aster uses a folk-horror setup as a means to externalize the innermost wishes of our protagonist as she slowly comes to terms with the failure of her relationship. All the hallmarks of such a scenario - growing distance, infidelity, finding new friends, cutting the cord, retreating back to family (or in this case, discovering a new one) - are playfully heightened in absurdist and operatic rituals that wring the comedy, tragedy, horror, and catharsis from the familiar.<br/><br/>Approaching the film on these terms is important if you're to fully appreciate it. It's just as technically brilliant and even more visually impressive than Hereditary, though lacks the immediate thrills you might expect from a follow-up. Where Hereditary is populated by numerous sharp, stand-out sequences that often result from unexpected plot turns, Midsommar operates more as a mood piece with far fewer moment-to-moment fireworks. Instead, it patiently accumulates and lands its impact in the final frames, prompting you to reflect on the clever construction of the film and retroactively unravel the subtext. At its best, the beautiful and bizarre visuals, languid pacing, and excellent score culminate in an intoxicating surrealism that's not easy to come by in modern movies.<br/><br/>What I miss the most from Hereditary, though, is the richness of its characters. Despite the increasingly bizarre story developments, the humanity at the core of its subjects is ever-present and does so much to anchor the film and keep the viewer invested. By comparison, the characters in Midsommar feel decidedly thinner. The only real exception is Dani, who's brought impressively to life by Pugh, though even she feels ill-defined next to Collette's multilayered and devastating turn as Annie. The extra 30 minutes of the Director's Cut thankfully does quite a bit to flesh out the dimensions of the characters and smooth the pacing, ultimately heightening the impact of the ending. It's the definitive cut by a convincing margin, though still doesn't fully rectify the somewhat insubstantial quality of the characters. I can marvel at the technical prowess, admire the carefully-tuned pacing, soak in the thick atmosphere, and contemplate the themes, but I do so at a distance, never fully losing myself in the drama as I have with Hereditary.<br/><br/>Still, Midsommar is a fine sophomore effort from Aster that boasts arresting visuals, bold direction, and a subtly surreal tone that sets it apart as a unique and memorable journey well-worth taking. Check your post-Hereditary expectations at the door and it will cast an intoxicating spell all its own.<br/><br/>Solid 4/5"
"dwremy","9","2","7","31 August 2019"," What a WILD journey...
","I watched this twice...I found Midsommar weird yet fascinating...it's clearly horror, but there are some interesting themes twisted into the movie. Florence Pugh(WHO WAS AWESOME) plays Dani, who's still reeling from family tragedy and seeking consolation from her distant boyfriend. They end up going to an obscure festival in small Swedish village with his friends(one of whom is Swedish, of course). That's where the madness slowly begins. I won't say much more about the story, but viewing it twice made it even more interesting to me. Of course I am reminded of The Wicker Man(both versions). You can tell Ari Aster made this because the ending gives me vague reminders of the ending of Hereditary(I SAID VAGUE so don't jump down my throat if you don't see it). I was also reminded of the ending of The Witch(also a film from A24).<br/><br/>Basically watch this movie with an open mind...see if you can see how Pugh's character is affected throughout the movie. See how the rest of the friends earn their fates(or don't earn them). This is not my favorite film ever, but I'd say Ari Aster made another good horror film."
"eddie_baggins","8","2","7","11 August 2019"," A unique & beautiful horror beast
","A strange beast of a film that's hard to pin down and even harder to review, Ari Aster's follow-up to his brilliant classic in waiting Hereditary is at times an equally impressive psychological and visceral horror but also one that struggles in parts to overcome its self-indulgent run-time, collection of unlikeable characters and a feeling that the slow build up isn't quite worth it come the nothing short of bizarre final portion.<br/><br/>For me it was around the 90 minute mark of the films 140 minute run-time that I couldn't help but shake the feeling Midsommar could've done with a healthy edit.<br/><br/>From an incredibly effective opening hour that perfectly establishes a sense of fear and ominous threat thanks to a hard-hitting pre-credits segment, some stylistically outstanding directing by Aster (never has a shot of a car driving along a highway been so engaging) and a captivating turn from rising star Florence Pugh who makes the very difficult character of Dani work thanks to her commanding presence, Midsommar does so much right but as things progress further and further into Aster's uncomfortable examination of grief, mental illness, folk music and cultism, Midsommar at times flat out stalls to a halt with murky character decisions and repetitive sequences that culminate in a visually arresting and shocking climax that sadly manages to tie things up satisfactory, not exemplary.<br/><br/>Hereditary will always be a two-edged sword for Aster, much like other filmmakers before him that have announced themselves with full-fledged debuts, as the directors products will now always come with a certain expectation of quality and while technically Midsommar is a masterpiece of sound design, production quality and performance management, it's hopefully a learning experience for Aster to remain on course and not get side-tracked with too much of a good thing.<br/><br/>There are a lot of these good things in this trippy, at times nerve-wracking and sometimes wince inducing holiday to the woods of Sweden as we follow the grieving and anxiety ridden Dani and her group of ""friends"" that includes Jack (letting it all hang out) Reynor's self-indulgent boyfriend Christian, Will Poulter's girl obsessed comic relief Mark, Vilhelm Blomgren's unnerving Swedish national Pelle and William Jackson Harper's thesis driven Josh, who discover quite quickly that secluded European festival's may not be the smartest of holiday destinations.<br/><br/>From the moment our group touch down in the fairy tale like fields of Pelle's home village and step through into what feels like another world entirely, Aster sets the scene for one of the most unique horror settings of recent memory, that is made all the more off-putting by the choice to film most of Midsommar entirely in the daytime sun, creating a vibe and feeling that is hard to put down in words but one that allows viewers to be taken away from reality and embraced by Aster's warped and singular vision.<br/><br/>There are scenes here that viewers will not soon forget, moments that genuinely send your body into a shocked feeling of catharsis and further establish Aster as a director whose way with storytelling can create mood and atmosphere that would match it with the very best of Hollywood's current crop of auteurs.<br/><br/>Without question one of the year's most visually arresting and shocking big screen experiences, there's many reason why one should ensure they catch Midsommar in the surrounds of a cinema, with willing audience members like mine that winced, laughed (both from humour and pure disbelief) and let jaws drop in unison and while it's a shame Aster takes us to a conclusion that doesn't feel entirely right, its undoubtedly that we are still seeing the beginnings of one of the industry's brightest and uncompromising talents who has so much more still to give.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>Filled with moments of pure unadulterated cinematic brilliance, an unforgettable world inhabited by white robed locals and anchored a fiercely powerful Florence Pugh performance, Midsommar is a trip unlike any other that suffers from a raft of unlikeable characters, lack of scares, an overly generous running time and a curiously disappointing finale. Close to being something truly special, Midsommar may not reach all its lofty goals but remains the horror film to beat in 2019.<br/><br/>4 sacred logs out of 5"

There is bad horror everywhere; The Conjuring universe, Insidious, Paranormal Activity are all tihs (except the first Conjuring) so this is so welcomed. This is horror for the mind that is ready to pick it apart and ingest whole. The only reason I'm giving 9 instead of 10, is because the movie did feel a bit too long and there could have been some better editing done.

That to me is horror. It's not always about getting that physical Jump scare rush from horror films because those are just momentary, but a movie like this.... it stays with you. The screenplay is unique and original. I strongly recommend watching this film if you like being left confused but also intrigued. I'd say watch it a few more times and read a bit more into the story online. You begin to discover more new and interesting things you missed before."

It feels like I am back in acting class watching first year actors try their ""scenes"". How this film even got funding is beyond me. It was so bad that I had to fast forward through some scenes not to fall asleep.<br/><br/>Secondly direction and script are tacky, weak, pointless and highly uninspired.

"isantistao","10","3","14","11 May 2020"," A Beautiful Masterpiece About Ancient Viking Paganism
","I just finished watching the directors cut version which is 3 hours long and I absolutely loved ever single moment of it. What a beautiful work of art. I can't believe that this has gotten any bad reviews at all. Or that people have said that it is just like wicker man. This film only has one thing in common with wicker man and that is it. That's like saying that any christian film is the same as any other because it involves some aspect of christianity. So please do not let any of those reviews deter you, those people are obviously extremely narrow minded and have no appreciation for the art of film. Because this film shows that art at its greatest.<br/><br/>This film is an absolute masterpiece. Ever scene is made with the most ultimate of film making artwork, making every second of every scene mesmerizing. It is amazing how they were able to create such a beautiful film that was ultimately centered around the darkest of ancient viking rituals involving things such as drug use, manipulation and seduction, ritual suicide, fertility/sex magick, and even human sacrifice. Of course the film does take some artistic liberties, these rituals were not practiced exactly the way it depicts. But there is some true history there, and it is amazing to see these ancient traditions brought to life and portrayed so artfully. And it is also great to see the experience of being on psychedelic drugs depicted so accurately, as usually it is not.<br/><br/>Of course this movie is not for everyone. It is very long, and is slower than most blockbusters. And there are a few parts that are deeply disturbing. So if you do not have enough of an appreciation of film that you will actually be able to see the amount of artwork that has gone into every scene, there's no point in you sitting through this 2.5 hour long film. But if you are an appreciator of film and know good art when you see it, and won't get too traumatized by a few disturbing scenes, I think you will be extremely impressed with this film and should see it. Especially if you enjoy the topic of paganism. If you are someone who likes the show Vikings, or movies like ""A Dark Song"" you will probably really love this."

"Vivkon","10","3","14","6 September 2019"," Once upon a time from Sweden
","This movie synthesizes <a href=""/name/nm0000233/"">Quentin Tarantino</a> and <a href=""/name/nm0001789/"">Andrei Tarkovsky</a>'s cinematic styles, incorporating, as well, certain flashback elements of Kubrick's <a href=""/title/tt0120663/"">Eyes Wide Shut (1999)</a>. Despite some references to existing movie traditions and acknowledging well-known artists, Ari Aster succeeds in creating a new approach to scaring and terrifying the audience with excessive light and psychedelic visions.<br/><br/>As with the last Tarantino movie <a href=""/title/tt7131622/"">Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood (2019)</a>, the movie, ""Midsommar"", refers to the subject of religious totalitarian cults. The attempt to tell a scary story with healthy sarcasm has <a href=""/name/nm4170048/"">Ari Aster</a> emulating Tarantino's style, as well as in his use of bloody realistic scenes of murder. Visual elements are applause-worthy. However, in contrast to Tarantino's meaningless killing scenes, Aster justifies murder for spiritual purposes in the cult's creepy community. And using a bright light during the movie adds a metaphysical and divine aura to all the murders and situations (even scenes of intimacy are acted out in daylight, losing any sense of traditional privacy). Bright light is absent in only 2 scenes - death of parents and the assassination in the barn. The absence of light might possibly underscore these events as the result of unexpected actions. Meanwhile, this movie satirizes elements of spiritual manipulation in closed societies, some religious organizations and certain historical societies, using censorship, speech suppression, total submission, ban on disputing anyone in power, while at the same time relying on the triad of food, reproduction and domination.<br/><br/>Following the Tarkosvky tradition, Aster's movie represents the recurring ebb and flow of pain and hope. The persistent anxiety and worries of the main character, brilliantly performed by <a href=""/name/nm6073955/"">Florence Pugh</a>, make the story look pictorially like it is told by <a href=""/name/nm0001789/"">Andrei Tarkovsky</a>, except that <a href=""/name/nm4170048/"">Ari Aster</a> utilizes more light and color. Moreover, the dancing competition and the moving of people around the village (especially, camera motion), also bind this film with Tarkovsky's artistry, focusing on the existential experience of his characters through the specific angle of camera shooting. <a href=""/name/nm4170048/"">Ari Aster</a>skillfully submerges the mind of the viewer in a spiritual quest to explore the deep meanings and exaltation of indigenous religions.<br/><br/>Looking at the Midsommars' occult rituals, some of them can be mysterious or profane. However, the hints and allusions contextually explain future events from beginning to the end in the bulk of images: photos, paintings, runes, cloth ornaments and wall decorations. These images predict the developing plot and everything happening in that mysterious forest. The forest is a significant element in enhancing the mystification that surroundings the Bacchanalia in the movie. Aster shoots in the forest and represents ""forest"" as an alternative metaphor to the Biblical paradise (""garden""). This work with forest as a location and the metaphoric use of forest as some unexplained and unexplored space (by the way, think about ""holly wood"" in the scenes with ancestry trees) brings together Aster with Tarkovsky (<a href=""/title/tt0072443/"">Zerkalo (1975)</a>, <a href=""/title/tt0060107/"">Andrey Rublev (1966)</a>), <a href=""/name/nm0327944/"">Alejandro G. IÃ±Ã¡rritu</a> (<a href=""/title/tt1663202/"">The Revenant (2015)</a>), <a href=""/title/tt0081505/"">The Shining (1980)</a> (<a href=""/name/nm0000040/"">Stanley Kubrick</a>). Nevertheless, a significant portion of the storytelling style in ""Midsommar"" looks a lot like Kubrick's <a href=""/title/tt0120663/"">Eyes Wide Shut (1999)</a> focusing on the couple's break up. If Kubrick used dark scenes with original set illumination (reexamine the small lamps and light position in certain scenes), then Aster utilized fully lit sets and colorful pattern. In Aster's filming, light plays a tool of blinding the conciseness of his characters.<br/><br/>Thus, ""Midsommar"" reconstructs the fears and worries of indigenous traditions and can prevent others from spiritual dangers. <a href=""/name/nm4170048/"">Ari Aster</a> is continuing in the tradition of great cinema directors and establishing his own star on the roof of cinematic heaven. After the ""Midsommar"" his star will never stop shining. And <a href=""/name/nm6073955/"">Florence Pugh</a>, with her outstanding contribution in the portrayal of spiritual existence, will be a part of Aster's asterism for the years."

A movie should have an engaging story, which is potentially there, and engaging characters with some depth that you will care about. None whatsoever of that, half an hour in and as far as I was concerned all characters were so obviously annoying (good acting with a terrible script?) that they could all just perish right there and then and I couldn't care less. It was a slow burn and the final scene and shot just flicker out into a general feeling of ""wow, this was disappointing, even though I suspected it would be half an hour in"". PS.

The story was not a masterpiece, but was pretty well done.<br/><br/>Trying to think of where there may be room for criticism. The horror was extremely over the top. Maybe a little bit of subtlety now and then could have actually made it more powerful. I can understand how many Swedes purportedly liked it as a black comedy rather than a horror film.

"rdolan9007","7","2","8","29 March 2020"," If you like your gory paganism delivered at a stately pace, then this might be your film.
","It maybe a bit unfair to define this film as gory paganism as described in the header. It is however hard to ignore those few but important moments of gore, because they are genuinely gory moments, and yet it doesn't destablise the film. The gore comes at the just the right moments and brings with it a necessary menace. This film might have been a long 2 hours and 20 minutes otherwise. .<br/><br/>Ari Aster's direction is skillful,but a little distancing at time. He does get away with it, because the acting is often excellent. Florence Pugh plays a damaged woman, whose tragic loss of her family, forces her to be both fascinated and horrified by the unfolding pagan ceremonies in a remote Swedish village. Her portayal of Dani is complex, and demanding. She reacts subtly to the horror, even though you know exactly how she is feeling. It is difficult acting,but exactly in keeping with the films overall mood.<br/><br/>Jack Reynor's performance as her boyfriend is very good as well. He had wanted to break-up with her but her tragic circumstances forced him to invite her to a midsommar festival. He hopes that she won't go therefore leaving it to be a jolly with him and three of his male friends..<br/><br/>Will Poulter is good as the ass-hole character who is one of those friends, and you kind of know and hope that he's going to get his. .William Jackson Harper is another friend,and he is possibly outside the two leads the most interesting character. Obstensibly someone who has integrity, but who takes risks he knows he shouldn't. It doesn't end well.<br/><br/>This is more of a pyschological horror film, although the gore does pervade your thoughts during the film. The film is beautifully shot, and yet I found it slightly disappointing. I'm not quite sure why. Maybe a tighter film would have been a better one. I know Aster has said this film is a break-up in pyscho-drama form. I do get that point in retrospect. There are also allusions as has been pointed out by critics to the wicker-man. I'm not a great fan of that film, which might annoy some people, yet strangely I think I preferred the Wickerman.<br/><br/>I accept Midsommar is a good film, which is why I rate it seven, and yet I'm not sure it went any where really new. Perhaps it tried to too much, and slightly missed the right emphasis on both the pagan horror,and the modern pyschological take on Dani's emotional struggles.<br/><br/>I don't need to see this film again,which means something is missing from it. I don't quite know what it is which puzzles me. Maybe the minor characters are not detailed enough to keep your attention in the many quiet moments. A good film, but not for me an enthralling one."

","As we went out of the theater yesterday, after watching Midsommar, my wife and I were in utter shock and out of words. My palms and my armpits were sweaty, she wanted to vomit and we felt completely shut from the outside world around us.<br/><br/>Midsommar is a deeply disturbing movie, but at the same time so hypnotic you can't stop but look as the event of the movie unfold, even when the most gruesome scenes happen. Before saying anything more, I would like to say that if you are easily scared, feeling depressive or having issues in your life, this might not be the best movie to go watch.<br/><br/>Now, what to say ? The opening act is, I believe, the most frightening scene of the whole movie and probably of many movies I have scene in the past few years. Without spoilers, here, is a scene that you feel could happen to almost any normal person: no demons, no evil spirits, no strange supernatural force at play. Just the pure harshness of loss of loved ones, in a demoralizing scene, weirdly beautifully shot, that will leave you wounded through the whole movie.<br/><br/>This scene, the death of the parents, is the kick start for the event of the movie and how the main character (Dani) has to deal with grief and the failure of her relationship. The rest of the movie is her slow descent into this peculiar family of Harga which she becomes part of, as her boyfriend and his friend are piecemeal punished for their selfishness, cowardice, rudeness and candor. She embraces the horror of Harga and joins the community, as she is completely losing a fragile mind to become strong with these eerie people. Dani finds another familly, another home, another place to share her feelings, her trauma and how death is part of life. Destroying and relinquishing everything that she had before, including her sanity.<br/><br/>This movie is incredible for this slow descent into madness after grief. We feel Dani's loss at the beginning, which reinforce the fact that we identify to her so strongly. The shots are beautiful, and we laugh, cry and are shocked, mesmerized through this deeply disturbing movie, this swirl of emotions so bizarre and gut wrenching.<br/><br/>A psychological horror movie, beyond what you probably saw before.

The costumes are aching to be copied by fast fashion, the set designs are intriguing and add a level of strangeness, the music by Bobby Krlic, aka The Haxan Cloak is very very good, reminding me of Karlheinz Stockhausen, Bjork and other (the best ones really) composers.<br/><br/>Isn't it funny how so many English, Irish, British actors have to put on crappy American accents to have a chance of a career in film and isn't it even funnier how they keep landing the roles over their American, Canadian counterparts. 51st state my eye."

The main difference, or at least the first noticeable, is the structure: Wicker Man was tight and focused and the '70's grime and atmosphere lent a realism to the film - this one was more loose, at times seemingly loosing focus and just having the characters walk around the grass, making awkward small talk (literally, this is like half the movie). It is very indulgent and they could've shaved off a few minutes overall - that's not to say it dragged, I was invested the whole time, but in practical terms, it could've been tightened up, particularly at the start when they're talking about the Swedish trip for like 10 minutes, and when they arrive at the Swedish commune (though the 'shrooms scene was hilarious - props to Will Poulter as the comic relief, wish he had more to do in this movie). It's a lot like a Grimm fairy-tale, one that's a joy to watch. It still stands upright by itself, but is slightly overshadowed when inevitably comparing it to its English ancestor."

","I sit here trying to write a review, and I just cannot find the words to write. This film will leave you thinking, and always wondering. I sat in my chair a good 5 minutes after the credits finished, merely contemplating what I had just witnessed. This movie is very intense, and MOST DEFINITELY not for the weak stomached or queasy. Know what you are getting into if you decide to view this film, it is a trip (wink wink:D). Aster's cinematography is PHENOMENAL and it adds a whole new level of storytelling, along with what he had already accomplished with the writing. There were several scenes where I had to pause the movie just to look at the cinematography itself. I often found myself spinning in circles with Aster's camera work, editing, sound design, everything. This film is a Mise en Scene dream. This film had its flaws, as all do, but everything else completely outshines them. An amazing and stupendous watch through and through."
"mike_diamond","8","2","9","13 June 2020"," A quaint little film exploring Sweden
","Folklore horror meets break-up movie in Ari Aster's Midsommar, starring Florence Pugh as Dani, an emotionally fragile university student, and her insensitive boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor). Unbeknownst to Dani, Christian and his three friends have planned a summer trip to Sweden and when tragedy strikes her family, Christian reluctantly invites her to join. Upon arrival, the crew begins their journey in the most acclimatizing manner possible: by taking hallucinogenics! It is the most realistic portrayal of what it's like to be on drugs that I've ever seen on film. This initiation sets the tone for what will become an increasingly trippy affair. The commune's pastoral setting is quaint and the people welcoming, albeit unusual. The Harga, an isolated pagan community, are clad in white floral smocks, each uniquely embroidered. The stunning outbuildings are out of a fairytale, painted and wallpapered in dalamalning style. The visitors are treated to a formal dinner, but when the post meal walk leads to the Ã„ttestupa, a ritual diving platform where elder members of the tribe perform senicide, we get the sense that not everything is as enchanting as the surroundings. The stakes only escalate from there. Let me tell you one last thing: no, you can't ignore the bear."
"mateusolivotti","9","2","9","5 June 2020"," That's how to make a good horror movie
","Before watching Midsommar, you must keep in mind that it is not a conventional horror film, the story is developed calmly during 2:30 of the film, so if you are going to watch the film unpretentiously and looking for just one form of entertainment, it is better don't even see the movie. Technically the film is beautiful, with a beautiful photograph and a great atmosphere, Florence Pugh, who plays the protagonist, is excellent, even, she is a very promising actress. The suspense of the film is very well built, as the film progresses it gets more and more chaotic, until it has an excellent third act. The only shortcoming of the film for me is that the film sometimes becomes a little predictable. In my opinion one of the best horror films of the decade, and the second best horror of 2019, second only to The Lighthouse."

","The reason for all the negative reviews is the result of EXACTLY what this story sets out to do, and understandably it isn't for everyone. It calls into question the way the modern world and society have been so deeply indoctrinated into people, takes you wayyy out of that comfort zone, confronts all of it head on and shatters it rather shockingly. And it is that very method that has turned so many people reviewing it off and left them with a bad taste in their mouths. It's also NOT a horror film, nor was it ever trying to be, and I think many people had that expectation going into it. If any of the positive reviews are speaking to you, and you want to be taken on a truly unforgettable journey STOP reading the negative reviews here and open yourself to the experience.

"andfloy","6","2","9","10 May 2020"," Amazing Garbage
","This was a beautifully filmed and incredibly directed terrible movie. Everything was absolutely amazing, except for the actual movie. I love movies that are weird, creepy, strange, and abstract, but I get the feeling that this one didn't have a reason to be those things as much as it was. Yes it was a very interesting movie, but about 3/4 of the way through I just wanted it to be over. My reasoning is that there were just so many scenes that were absolutely revolting (which is good sometimes), but there wasn't a message or statement that gave the disturbing things meaning. It's like how in all of the Marvel movies there's hundreds of people that die in the background and no one cares, but then when one of the main characters turns to dust everyone freaks out because of the emotional attachment you have with what the characters are going through and fighting against. With this movie, the characters weren't very likable to me so I didn't really care about them, but then they would show all these close ups of incredibly violent and disturbing actions. I also think it wasn't warranting of the graphic level of content because couldn't figure out which side the film was trying to take the side of: the kids or the festival people. Exploring the strengths and faults of both sides is good, but when it's about a conflict between them and you kind of dislike everyone and you do all of these shocking acts of violence it takes away the emotion. Your left watching a very tense, randomly repulsive gore fest for absolutely no reason. I give it a 6/10 because of how beautifully it was made. I mean the visuals were just incredible and the camera work was fantastic. Plus the story arc itself was very good. But overall it felt like I was watching a movie where someone just tried to be as creepy as possible, which in terms of quality can only be so good. Also I won't give any spoilers, but there is a place with a whole lot of naked old people moaning and grunting for like 2 full minutes and I will never be able to remove those images from my mind...

"nshelu","8","2","9","25 March 2020"," Overall gorgeous and brilliant, but succumbs to Suspira's problem
","Ari Aster you are one sick cat.<br/><br/>Firstly, I want to say this movie is undeniably one of the most visually appealing movies I've ever seen. Colors are what most people may point out, but by the Nine, the camera work is just perfect. This is one of those things many large budget movies really like to neglect, example is cutting 30 times in in one scene, even in uneventful scenes.<br/><br/>Second to the visuals is the soundtrack, careful use of music throughout the movie is just wonderful. Notably, the lack of music is also amazing, too many movies fear silence, but the creators here knew better. I think at some times I got sick of the repetition, but it wasn't that bad.<br/><br/>Next, the actors, everyone from the main characters to extras were phenomenal, or at least very good.<br/><br/>Now, about Suspiria 2018. That movie had this huge issue, I think, where it wanted a slow burn, but took it so fair it didn't realize just how scary it could get. The most famous scene is a women being twisted and broken. It was freaking brutal, but you never really get anything quite like that again. No, the blood orgy isn't anything spectacular. Suspiria had other problems, too, that Midsommer fortunately didn't.<br/><br/>Likewise, Midsommer kept it interesting, but I think tapered down too much until the end, more on the end later (no spoilers). There's an initial gore scene that's just outright unbelievable. It's stunning, gruesome, sickening. Perfect. Later on, at the end you get a couple quick scenes that are almost as frightening, but I feel as though Ari Aster didn't take it as far, as often, as he could. There was definitely more room for this shocking stuff, that would really make for an intense horror movie. Without the adrenaline filled gore scenes, movies need a compelling story to keep us interested, and it did, but the story here isn't necessarily anything incredibly unique. So while well done, it wasn't the story that drew me in. Once the mystery was unfurled, I was counting down the minutes until it ended, because there wasn't much left.<br/><br/>Well, except the last 30 minutes. The saving grace that made it all worth is the end. It ends on this amazing scene that I will take as the best moment from the film. So, even if I got lulled into wanting it to end, it went out with a sizable bang.<br/><br/>There's a director's cut that apparently adds more gore scenes, about 40 minutes worth of content. So I'm excited to see if that's what would take it to a 9/10 for me. 10/10's to me are my absolute favorites, so that's basically the best I can give without getting too subjective."

","Five students: one girl and four boys. The girl has a relation with one of the boys.
The girl has a bipolar sister that demands a lot of negative attention.
Result: she requires extra attention from her boyfriend and they struggle with their relationship.
The boyfriend gets advice from his three ""good"" friends to end the relationship and he gets invited by them for a trip to experience a Midsummer feast with a commune in Sweden.
The girl is confronted with the suicide by self suffocation of her bipolar sister that deliberately suffocated her parents as well in their sleep.
The boyfriend reluctantly invites the girl to come along to Sweden. He ""last minute"" tells his ""friends"", right before the girl unexpectedly meets them all.
However, when she's alone with one of the friends, he tells the girl that he is very glad that she comes along too. He previously used to be a member of the commune.
In Sweden they have an idyllic acquaintance with the commune members and the brother of the ""friend' that was a member.The brother invited a young couple to join the feast.
The second day of their stay the group of invitees is confronted with an horrific pagan ritual of the commune; two people in their seventies voluntarily step from a high place while everyone watches. The way those people crashed and died is explicitly depicted in the movie.
Despite the shocking event all of the invited students stay. The boy and one of his fellow students are intrigued and request to study the habits and rituals of the commune and are allowed by the elders.
The young couple that came with the brother of the ""friend"" that was a member, wants to leave. The boy from the couple suddenly seems to have left alone which seems strange. His girlfriend seems to have left a little later. During the stay of the invitees, more and more of them disappear. Commune members tell the rest that the others have left ...
The girl still doesn't get the attention she needs from her boyfriend.
She does get attention from the commune. After a pagan dropout match she's crowned midsummer queen.
At the same time, in a rather weird (and almost hilarious) pagan ritual the boy is lured and used by the members to impregnate a young female member of the commune. His girlfriend finds out and she's heartbroken.
Then it becomes apparent that the rest of the invited people have been horrifically sacrificed.
The midsummer queen gets a choice to have one of the members of the commune sacrificed or her boyfriend. A little later it turns out that she choose her boyfriend.
All sacrificed people have been ""dressed up"" in weird costumes to be burned in a wooden shed. The boyfriend was ""dressed"" in a bear that was slaughtered and prepared for that purpose.
The film ends with a satisfied smile on the face of the midsummer queen, while she watches the burning shed and hears people screaming from the shed. The boyfriend and two members of the commune that were sacrificed as well, are burned alive.
The girl apparently needed ""some"" compensation for her suffering ...
So what's the message? Be careful with people that are hurt. Let them go and get on with your own life ... before they involve you in their overcompensation.
What tells this about the writer /director and the elite critics that worship his work? Probably that's the most disturbing aspect of this movie.
IF you need to be overcompensated, watch this movie.
I wish that I was warned beforehand, because I detested it to be confronted with a very disturbing association between extreme malevolent horror and a beautiful, innocent and idyllic natural environment."

I think this movie is what Ari Aster wanted to achieve in the last half of Hereditary (director of both films). It didn't work with hereditary because there wasn't much time but Midsommar on the other hand takes it time and delivers what I could only describe as bizarre and the strangest things I have ever seen in a movie. My problem with the movie aside from the running time is that all the things that could have been the most scariest in the movie happen off screen. Ohh and why does his (Ari Aister) films have to have naked old women and start with the protagonist losing their loved ones. He did it twice now. I hope this won't happen in this future films."

But it's better than Hereditary. I'm interested what more we can expect from Ari Aster.

","This has been one of my most anticipated movies of 2019, I've been hearing all the reviews and reactions towards it that it's a one of a kind film that's shocking, traumatic and insane to sit through. Is it that? Well not really.<br/><br/>Premise: A couple travels to Sweden to visit a rural hometown's fabled mid-summer festival. What begins as an idyllic retreat quickly devolves into an increasingly violent and bizarre competition at the hands of a pagan cult.<br/><br/>I didn't need this movie to be a Hostel film or a Saw film but I needed something to justify all this press behind it. There's definitely violence here and there, but when we're talking about a two and a half hour movie, the director and the writer could've done something to fill in that time other than 5 minute moments of complete silence. Was that the horror? having to sit through long stretches of complete silence?<br/><br/>Good stuff I liked: the look of the village and its people, the eerie atmosphere it all gave off (but that's only there because I saw the trailer and the reviews, so I'm already expecting creepy stuff to happen). You do buy this village as a real society. The supporting characters don't get much time to shine but I liked Will Poulter and William Jackson Harper's performances. Other reviewers talk about the main couple of this movie, Dani and Christian and they go into metaphors and symbolism and that's all good to explore, but when you're putting that into a two and a half hour movie you need other stuff to support it so most of your audience can actually pick up on it with a second viewing. This movie really did NOT need to be two and a half hours.<br/><br/>There was nothing I loved in this movie and I don't think I'll be revisiting this movie any time soon. I get the feeling The Irishman, a movie that's a complete hour LONGER than this will keep me more involved, hooked and entertained throughout. I had to look up the director of this movie, Ari Aster, and to my surprise he also directed Hereditary, another movie that's overly long and overpraised, but I'll say Hereditary IS better than Midsommar. I might even rewatch Hereditary at some point just to make sure. But for my money Midsommar is just ok, just try and skip all the long drawn out moments of silence throughout it, you'll probably save 30 minutes of your life that way. I'll give this movie a 6 out of 10."
"salviolog","6","1","3","29 December 2019"," The Weaker Man
","If you through this movie is like the Wicker Man - then yes, you were right. It is exactly like the Wicker Man, only with prettier cinematography and a weaker script.<br/><br/>The story is allover the place, as if the movie is trying to tell us something using too many unnecessary details. The characters, at least the main ones, are interesting and they are portrayed very realistically by the actors playing them, as in they feel like real people with real goals and motives, but their goals and motives are just left there hanging, not really explored or concluded in any way, shape or form.<br/><br/>Thus one cannot escape the feeling that the movie is being disturbing just for the sake of being disturbing, without much substance to it, putting this motion picture firmly into the exploitation category. Yes, it is bright, trippy, perverted and beautifully shot in best visual traditions of Kubrick, but it's an empty shell of a Faberge egg: it's pretty to look at and it's very expensive, but it's not nutritious, it cannot provide sustenance.<br/><br/>The other weak point of the movie is that for such a long film, it paradoxically lacks patience. Instead of building suspense slowly and gradually, the movie practically spoils the ending right away with one of the earlier scenes. It's as if we would have seen Norman Bates casually strolling in drag about 15 minutes into the movie, and then trying to act normally again until the big reveal.<br/><br/>If you wanted a movie like the Wicker Man - you're better off just watching the Wicker Man instead, either the original or the unintentionally comedic remake with Nick ""Not The Bees"" Cage."

It seems like we now just have a bunch of critics rating things based on some sort of back story they make up themselves things like: ""the portrayal of pure sadness and loss, the intentions of the director were this and that, masterpiece is disguise""<br/><br/>My honest opinion: This movies lacks a good plot, feels cheap and if you want to wander of and give it some spiritual turn, feel free...it just plain bad"
"the_wolf_imdb","4","1","3","4 December 2019"," Nice cinematography but very flawed storyline
","Nice cinematography but I have a huge problem with storytelling. This is more like trip or dream than a story, especially dramatic one. There is a lot of problems, especially:<br/><br/>How the cult hides the murders in the long term? Well even if you consider Sweden to be the Third world country, there are still foreigners missing, which will be searched for. They traveled via plane so it is easy to track them. The students even do study folklore and one of them is directly from the place so even average policeman must track them.<br/><br/>There is no psychology of village people. None, nil, nada. Even the hot ginger girl is treated more like a thing or an alien from outer space than real human being. They seem to be reasonable people from the start, they even know English but in the end they are just completely bonkers.<br/><br/>Reactions of students do not have a sense. Only two want to leave after the suicide scene (by the way it is illegal just to burn bodies without some formal investigation in modern society). When the others start to disappear, everyone is just like meh, no problem or even ""we did not stole your book"". No one seems to worry even a little, they just eat everything and drink everything - this is not normal at all.<br/><br/>There is absolutely no explanation of the cult whatsoever. Only the love spell is somehow explained, but thats about it. They are declared to have a contacts with outside like selling products, but we see no proof it at all. Even David Koresh had a lot of interactions with people of Waco. The village people behave like lets burn thus building, no problem, public suicide, lots of corpses - no problem, probably no one ever goes here or something.<br/><br/>Psychology of the key relationship has no sense. The girl is dependent on guy not the otherwise. There are not any signs that she would suspect cheating - and even if, she sees only once and as a part of ritual. She should be pissed of to the villagers not to the guy! He wants to dump her but she really does not know that and there is not a single debate about that. On the contrary he is supportive to her even if he thinks he wants to dump her. So her hateful reaction is more like she would actually know je wants to dump her but we have no clue if she knows or even suspects that.<br/><br/>There are parts that are simply not connected to anything at all. Murder-suicide of girls family - is it somehow related to cult or the visions are just random? Is she also bipolar like her sister? Why the villagers seem to behave like hive mind? Why the students are competing about the dissertation? Why there is even the saint inbred motive? Is the sex ritual connected to the murders? It is like one sex per summer per village or how it works? If so - how is it possible that there are multiple people of the same age in the village? If the cult requires reciprocity - how it came they kill eight people and add only two (if the redhead is really pregnant)?<br/><br/>For such a long movie there is simply not enough explanation and scenes seem just to be placed here and there without much sense. It looks nice but story does not actually to explain anything. What is even worse I do suspect the author does not any theory how the cult works either, he seems just to collect some random motives from scandinavian folklore, add some extra and that all folks.<br/><br/>This is more like visual poetry than horror movie and if you have a smoke or mushrooms it probably works on emotional level, but I have problem with the story that prevents me to actually enjoy it."
"m_tensmeyer","7","1","3","1 December 2019"," A whole lot of potential that slowly fizzles out
","My rating of 7 is mostly for the visuals, which are in fact stunning. The horror aspects are intertwined with the beautiful in a unique and thoroughly unsettling way. However, the movie's length undercuts the tension at every turn. Sequences that need about 30 seconds get 10 minutes. The drug sequences are especially tedious. Every time a character takes a drink, prepare yourself for 15 minutes of weird daze-cam. Most disappointingly, the relationships crafted masterfully at the beginning never reach a convincing catharsis point.<br/><br/>That said, Aster delivers visually in a way few horror films manage, and the theme of self-serving ""educational vacations"" is quite well played out. For instance, an especially disquieting scene involves a character reacting to an extremely disturbing cultural practice with excitement for being able to use it for his research.<br/><br/>Visuals: 9/10.
Acting: 9/10.
Scary: 4/10.
Too long: yes."
"Michael Fargo","4","1","3","1 December 2019"," How I spent my summer vacation
","...or, a good way to break up with a crappy boyfriend.<br/><br/>Somewhere there is a good movie to be made of this material (already accomplished by M. Night Shyamalan in ""The Villiage,"" but Sweden is a lovely setting). It's very much like the commercial where the kids decide to hide in the chainsaw shed rather than head for the car with the motor running. But honestly, most films of this genre require a suspension of belief, but if you frame your horror movie in the pretense of academia, I think it's fair for the viewer to expect more than this.<br/><br/>After a long and, I think, pointless prologue, a group of graduate students arrive at a festival in Sweden that's a 4 hour drive from anywhere. It's a little disconcerting that none of the usually annoying need-to-know-more-than-your-colleague seems not to have infected this group. They get on an airplane without a care.... Well, everyone except the lone female in this expedition whose major is psychology not anthropology so we can forgive her for not researching the trip a little more than the rest, plus she's in the throes of grief which really annoys her boyfriend and his buds.<br/><br/>Ari Asher's previous film, ""Heredity"", was an infinitely more developed and visually compelling film than ""Midsommar."" And it's curious since there seems to be much more to plumb here. It has the look of something that the producers just gave up on and said, ""No more money,"" like some uninhabited, freshly built stage set. (Where is the kitchen? Where is the bathroom? Where does water come from? Is the puny garden meant to feed all these people? Maybe they live in Stockholm and just come to this location every 90 years to dance around a maypole? I don't know. Answering one or any of these questions would have helped make any of it more believable.)<br/><br/>I walked into this film cold. I'd not seen a preview or read a review. It just looked interesting from the poster. About the only expectation that was fulfilled was from the costumer, the set decorator and the score by The Haxan Cloak...and Florence Pugh who manages the best she can with the material.<br/><br/>The idea of the disabled having magic powers is offensive. And the Swedish Bureau of Tourism and Travel should sue. That was my take-away."
"robert_oneill2002","8","1","3","24 November 2019"," Wicker Man meets Man Called Horse
","Pretty decent. Any kind of bait and switch film like this can only ever be compared to the WIcker Man. A lot better than the Nicolas Cage version and retained the sense of weirdness of the original. The ending when she smiles demonstrates the transformation, much like Richard Haris going through the rituals and taking over the tribe.
To our protagonist, the community had a structure and a life plan, whereas her previous life had none, just chaos and betrayal.<br/><br/>The issue of why they don't leave is problematic to the script. They had small motivations to stay: the promise of sex, of glory through the thesis ... but in reality this would have been offset by the suicides. Perhaps we can infer they were drugged throughout in various ways, or deep down our victims knew that if they tried to escape, they would be hunted and killed.<br/><br/>
So sex and death, dolled out in some creepy scenes."

","I have to say ""Midsommar"" was one of my favorite horror movies of the year (2019) and probably one of my favorite movies of the year.
First of all, do not read anything about the movie and trust that it will be a good surprise.<br/><br/>This movie got into me because it touches themes and shows things that are so unconventional that will stick to your memory for a long time."
"vicenternse","8","1","3","11 November 2019"," A GREAT movie that could have been a masterpiece
","The best points out of Midsommar are its lead actress, cinematography, music, sound, editing, art direction and choreographies. All of these are astonishing, some of the best shots on any category this year. Florence Pugh deliveries a 10 performance and that's one of the main keys that made me see the problem there: The filler characters. This story follows a great main character with a boring, full of uninteresting, one-dimensional minor characters. The acting is kind of solid, but sometimes it's clear the protagonist is better written than them from start to finish and for so, Florence Pugh OUTSHINES the entire supporting cast. If this story was only about Dani, and only managed her storyline and the artistic spirit from its third act, this would be an easy 10/10. Great, great movie. I hope Florence doesn't get snubbed on awards season, but I don't have high hopes."

","Midsommar is an incredibly disturbing horror that, is in my opinion, a huge improvement over Ari Aster's previous film Hereditary. Florence Pugh gives an incredible lead performance. Jack Reynor and William Jackson Harper both give great supporting performances as well as Will Poulter, who is very funny. It's visually stunning and beautifully filmed with excellent direction from Ari Aster. It's expertly paced with an uncomfortable sense of unease that effectively builds throughout. The music by Bobby Krlic is fantastic. It's only brought down by one scene that is very uncomfortable and distribing for the most part but briefly becomes unintentionally funny."

I get that the film isn't meant to be a straight horror and more a folk horror of sorts? All the acting was spot on. The whole production was slick maybe minus the rubber used for body parts. I did enjoy it. I just felt it could of moved along faster. All in all though Aster is making good steps to fishing a very unique voice. Something we need more of."

"FigtherOfTheNightMan","9","1","3","25 October 2019"," A Surreal Dream turned Nightmare
","Let me just start by saying this film won't be for everyone. This is not a horror film in the traditional sense where something jumps out to scare you with the sound turned way up every 20 minutes. This is a deeply unsettling, slow burn, sense of impending dread kind of horror. And the less you know going in the better.<br/><br/>Ari Aster crafts a pitch perfect film, from the cinematography, production design and soundtrack down to the cast and script. The story and setting are truly original (yes, I've seen Wicker Man - both of them). I can honestly say I've never seen a film like this before, which is an accomplishment, especially in a genre where it's all been done before. This will be one of those films that stays with you long after it's over."
"smolsoft","8","1","3","25 October 2019"," Not the typical horror movie.
","I loved Midsommar but it's definitely not the typictal horror. There are no demons or Jason Voorhees types. No one is running through a forest and tripping. There are no real jumpscares here. I think it was the director who described it as folk horror. It's kind of a cross between Children of the Corn and The Beach."

"Kirollos-Noah","7","1","3","18 October 2019"," One of the best horror movies of the year!
","Midsommar was written and directed by Ari Aster, the writer and the director of Hereditary. And starring Florence Pugh, Jack Reynor, Vilhelm Blomgren, William Jackson Harper and Will Poulter.<br/><br/>And it's about a couple travels to Sweden to visit a rural hometown's fabled mid-summer festival. What begins as an idyllic retreat quickly devolves into an increasingly violent and bizarre competition at the hands of a pagan cult.<br/><br/>Hereditary was one of my favorite movies of 2018, I think it was an amazing psychological-horror movie,and I couldn't wait to see what Aster's going to do next! Hereditary was a different movie, and Midsommar is way more different and ambitious!<br/><br/>Midsommar is a great horror movie, which takes so much time to build the proper atmosphere, the movie is 147 minutes, so it took its time to create the tension, but sometimes you can feel that time, it felt stretched a little bit, but still it didn't go dull, and that's why this movie is so special, it's not flawless or anything, but it did live up to the expectations, at least it lived up to my expectation.<br/><br/>I didn't expect a gigantic jump scares, which are pretty expected nowadays, I knew that it's gonna be mind-disturbing and unsettling, and it was, it freaked me out, but the issue with the movie is, that every unsettling, or scary -psychologically- was in broad daylight, and that's my biggest issue with the movie, that it failed to reach the same atmosphere as Hereditary did, yeah the movie was scary, but it was always in daylight, I understand why it was in broad daylight, but there was a couple of scenes in the night, and they could use more of that to build an even scarier tension, but unfortunately they didn't, and that dragged the movie down!
But still, Midsommar is so freaky and scary, and I think it's one of the best horror movies of 2019 so far, this genre didn't get a lot of good movies this year, it might be the weakest, but Midsommar did justice to the genre, and to the fans of Hereditary.<br/><br/>The tension was there, and the grief was also there, and you can feel their fears and emotions in every scene, and thanks go to Florence Pugh's amazing performance! I watched lots of her movies, Fighting with My Family recently, and she's an amazing actress, but her performance in this movie definitely takes the cake, she does deliver every and each emotion, her agony, loss, suffering and fear, she was terrific in this movie! But there's a twist to her character towards the end that was so rushed, it made sense, because some of the action made during first and second act, but still rushed... BUT still it was welcome and unexpected!<br/><br/>As I said earlier, the movie is a little bit stretched, and you can tell that sometimes, there were some scenes that did not add anything to the movie, there was a dream sequence, which it felt it was so unnecessary, but still the movie didn't go dull, but what was bland was some of the casting choices, Vilhelm Blomgren as Pelle was my least favorite performance of this movie, his character is so important to this movie, but his acting was so bad and soulless, he didn't deliver any of his emotions well, he felt something for Dani, played by Pugh, and it didn't add anything to the movie, and they never got back to that point again! He was bad in this movie, and unfortunately there is a lot of him in this movie.<br/><br/>All the other foreign characters were so good and scary, sometimes even unsettling!<br/><br/>Midsommar is definitely a great psychological-horror movie, that discusses grief in a deep way within its unsettling disturbing presence, beautifully shot, though it failed to achieve its full horror potential.. and led by a mesmerizing performance by Florence Pugh, but let down by some of the others.<br/><br/>Midsommar is worth your time, and I think most of the horror fans are gonna find somethings to enjoy in it, not only to enjoy, but to love! I'm gonna give Midsommar a B!<br/><br/>Happy Halloween, guys, it's getting close, I'll be reviewing a lot of horror and Halloween movies a lot til the end of October, so stick right here if you liked this review!

I like that especially with his new feature Aster took time to really develope the characters and bringing them close to us before it all went insane. This really created a special atmosphere and made you care for the characters.
Florence Pugh is like Ari Aster a great new discovery for the movie world. Its not the first time she proved her talent but its her first big role in a Hollywood film and she managed it graciously. I really look forward to see how her career embraces. We could be in for someone really big who steps into the shoes of one Amy Adams or Kate Winslet at one point.
Jack Reynor was okay. A bit wooden, but I think this is what his character was mostly about. Towards the end he became more interesting. Will Poulter was in for good comedic relief and represented the great ignorance of most of the characters. The setting was really interesting and the film offered a great cinematography with many great ankles. Also the editing and score just added to the wonderful atmosphere.

","Ari Aster, director and writer of critically acclaimed Hereditary, has constructed another gorgeous piece of psychedelic horror, centered once more by weighted and captivating drama.<br/><br/>The script is smart and sufficient, one that not only creates realistic drama but makes sense of each character and moving them along in a natural way. Exposition is carefully delivered through the story and not the other way around - it's just a very well written script.<br/><br/>Aside from being a brilliant writer he knows how to make a movie. He manages to keep us hooked and unceratin while doing something very different with the genre. Most of the movie is shot in daylight yet it still manages to be uneasy and mysterious. Midsommar could easily have been something ridiculous that felt like a joke, but Ari keeps the movie on track with a strong vision, the balancing act here is impressive. The actors do a fine job as well, as it wouldn't have worked without them and the director being in sync.<br/><br/>Technically the movie is splendid, the cinematography and lighting is fantastic. The framing is really nice, especially the centerpiece pictures. There's subtle and interesting psychedelic effects happening at times. The set and art design is interesting and nicely woven into the sublime camerawork.<br/><br/>All of the costumes are accurate to something you'd wear during a Swedish Midsommar, especially for traditionalists. The native Swedish spoken in the movie is accurate and so is the geographical distances delivered during dialogue, a nice detail that adds authenticity.<br/><br/>The prosthetic work and violence is just like in Hereditary - blunt and unapologetic.

","As someone born and raised in Scandinavia, and have been studying into the old norse beliefs this movie left me with a bit of an odd feeling, if they just have been sticking with some of the traditional stuff including the myths it could have been even better, but its like they wanted too much out of the theme in the movie so they mixed a whole lot of other stuff into it and turned it up on 500, some is just really odd, others directly laughable but not in the intended way. the acting is pretty decent and the story interesting, the thing that bothers me that it wants to be more than it really is."

","Ari Aster's follow-up to his surprise hit Hereditary, once again deals with grief. This time not so much in a supernatural way, but a more ritualistic one up north in Sweden. In Midsommar, Dani (Florence Pugh) tries to overcome an unthinkable family tragedy. Her rocky relationship with Christian (Jack Reynor) was about to completely fall apart, but when they decide to join his college buddies on an ill-considered trip to a remote commune in Sweden, that's when everything truly gets put in perspective.<br/><br/>Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) invites his fellow grad students to his former community under a midnight sun. Folk horror and tradition lean against outdated superstition. Our American group of friends doesn't really fit in with these white robed, strangely calm Swedes. From their arrival, their destiny has been forebode in the illustrations and paintings on the wooden walls of the community's cabins. Without really paying attention to it, these guests have signed up for a one-way journey to death.<br/><br/>Lots of clues and unnecessary imagery get scattered throughout the film. Nothing ever gets an explanation, it's just there. As if the director expects audiences to know about runes and most of all, why there's a bear in a cage that no one really addresses. Aster mostly succeeds in keeping the eeriness steady yet flowing throughout the entire film. His Hereditary cinematographer, Pawel Pogorzelski, is once again gifting us with extraordinary imagery that is unique on screen. While his previous film had lots of nightly shots, Midsommar takes place in broad daylight. The pastels and soft lighting give a really soothing look, that is unknown to this genre.<br/><br/>The acting overall is strong, with Pugh being a standout. After watching her in Fighting With My Family earlier this year and soon to be seen again in Greta Gerwig's adaptation of Little Women, one can definitely say - 2019 is the year of the Pugh. Her Dani makes you feel for her loss and she owns the screen. Reynor is a pretty new face for me, but I'm curious to see him take more challenging roles like this, where he gets to shine and push himself even more.<br/><br/>Midsommar is nonetheless entertaining. Its first two acts are interesting and you want to see where this is going. The final act feels a bit stretched at a certain point and could've used a bigger punch when everything sizzles down at the end. As for the characters, it's a bit too unrealistic to see them all just go along with everything without asking the real question - ""what is going on?"". By the time this question does get asked, it's already too late and we're closer to our somewhat underwhelming finale. Midsommar is ambitious, unsettling and trippy. Can't wait to see where Ari Aster takes us next."

It was a film that I could enjoy and appreciate for its craftsmanship and story even if some of the plot wasn't to fully pay off. This film isn't scary but managed to keep me somewhat on edge throughout at what might happen next, even if it didn't deliver fully on many, if any shocking scenes as many of the more gross and violent aspects happen off screen and may not even be fully noticed by some of the audience."

","Ari Aster's second film, following last years ""Hereditary"", is another divisive movie that sits roughly in the horror genre, without ever really being scary and is probably going to bore as many people as it enthrals.<br/><br/>Dani (Florence Pugh) suffers a horrific family tragedy which encourages her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) to offer her the chance to join them on a trip to Sweden, to see a once in a lifetime festival on a remote agricultural commune. Dani's shaky relationship with Christian, coupled with the culture shock of this isolated community unsettles her but could darker forces be at work .<br/><br/>It's barely a spoiler to say, yes.... All is not what it seems in the idyllic village. You'll be able to predict the plot of ""Midsommar"" as it doesn't deviate very much from its template of a being a trippier version of ""The Wicker Man"". That isn't the point, there's a sense of inevitability about what happens and ""Midsommar"" is very happy about taking it's time to get there. This will, I'm sure, alienate some of the audience, it's a film about aesthetics and atmosphere, rather than twist and jumps, and I would understand anyone whose takeaway about the film was that they were bored.<br/><br/>A lot of credit need to go to the central performances of the leads. Though not expressly trying to, I am seeing everything that Florence Pugh is doing and I continue to be impressed with her versatility and vulnerability. Jack Reynor, who I'd previously only seen in the Transformers movie, is excellent too, fearless both in his willingness to do some of the scenes and to not try and redeem his character of his underlying resentment towards Dani. The cinematography is excellent, as is the use of sometimes subtle CGI to enhance backgrounds or illustrate the use of hallucinogenics.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the idea of sitting through it again doesn't seem particularly appealing now, which is why my review score isn't as glowing as it might have seemed from the comments so far, but I will keep my eyes open for Aster next film."

I'm not a massive fan of horror/thriller or whatever psychological type genre this was and I actually avoid them in fact but after seeing the trailer a few months ago I couldn't help but go see it because of how different it looked! Unlike many it didn't rely on jump scenes or the dark to evoke fear! It was just disturbing overall and made me feel uncomfortable at times which is exactly what I'd want from a film like this. It is around 1 hour longer than most other films of the same genre but didn't feel like I was in the cinema for as much as a minute longer due to how much it drew me in!

"giantbluemonkey","6","1","3","12 July 2019"," The Sum is Not Greater than its Parts
","I went into this movie very excited. I thought Hereditary was a very strong movie, and I was hoping this one would be equal to it (or possibly even greater). And while many of the same great elements remain (pacing/camera work/score/mood), I felt that this film ultimately didn't deliver.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it's still better than most of the drivel that's out there.<br/><br/>However, this was a narrative and it just didn't seem to hold up as such. To begin with, the characters' lack of concern for the members of their own party as they inexplicably (or barely explicably) went missing didn't seem believable. From a wider perspective, the idea that a community could lure in and murder 5/6 people from larger communities (every year or even every so often) in this day and age so wantonly doesn't seem to hold up under even the mildest inspection.<br/><br/>I guess we're supposed to feel that Christian is the 'bad guy' and think he deserved his fate? Really? Not the best boyfriend in the world, sure, but certainly not the worst. If he's a year deep into the slow breakup process (of a 4 year relationship), I'd say he's still being fairly sensitive for someone who's fallen out of love and is trying not to crush someone he clearly still cares about. He cheated? Yeah, well, I'd say the community did a pretty good job of ensuring that it happened. Not excusing it, but this version of infidelity is a far cry from getting drunk in a bar and having a one night stand with a random soul.<br/><br/>I read online that the ending smile comes from the director's own break up and a fantasy or daydream-like reveling in the destruction of the former partner. That strikes me as childish and fleeting, not something that smacks of long-term artistic merit. Clearly, time may prove me wrong on this.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and like people said in other reviews, it's too close to Wicker Man."

","I was very excited to see this movie, saw tons of hype on social media so decided to see it in theaters. Was disappointed in the fact that the movie wasn't scary or thrilling at all, just very bizarre and disturbing.<br/><br/>Dani suffers a lot and the plot basically revolves around her misfortune and her boyfriends pathetic attempt to make her feel better. Midsommar seemed more focused on their relationship than the cult itself which was interesting. Not much explaination about the cult and they are basically unpredictable pagans. The ending was weak in my opinion. Still worth the watch for the shocking scenes and rituals, and just a mind blowing psychological movie. My eyes were glued to the screen despite how slow and uneventful the plot was. Doesn't live up to hype and I believe critics are caught up on the interesting cinematography and good acting. Seems like an indie hipster movie."
"listofnames","5","1","3","8 July 2019"," Convoluted
","I thought Hereditary was one of the best films of last year (if not the best). So I hoped that Midsommar would be approaching the same quality. Alas no. Midsommar is convoluted, messy and doesn't really follow any sort of satisfying arc. It meanders along without any of the ratcheting of tension that Hereditary did so well. There is little that is exciting or compelling. It just seemed quite shallow but pretty looking. Perhaps there is a very clever hidden message in the film that explains everything and makes it much more compelling, but it wasn't present on screen. And for me, that is a basic film-making failing. The film is also massively long - which contributes to its unnecessary and meandering feel.<br/><br/>A real pity, I really wanted to like this. It seemed to follow hot on the heels of hereditary so perhaps Aster just wasn't allowed the same time to craft something as good. Hopefully he takes a longer time for his next film.<br/><br/>Something else that pops up with his two films are the themes of cults and family. Perhaps he could try not repeating the same themes for the next film? He has said enough about family and cults in Hereditary so it was unnecessary to retread old ground in Midsommar. Perhaps that is why it went wrong. It felt tired and 2nd hand."

","I was extremely affected by this movie. To me, it was about suffering and empathy. It reminded me of when I had to travel across the country to attend my father's funeral while my ex-boyfriend stayed home because he didn't care enough for me to go with me. I knew exactly how Dani felt when she was screaming on Christian's lap, while he detachedly stroked her hair, and I understood her vulnerability and fear of over-exposing him to her grief, fearing that he might stop caring for her. I understood Dani's isolation, having to excuse herself to grieve in restrooms because Christian wasn't there, even when he was. Honestly, if I were crowned the May Queen, I would have chosen Christian to be placed in the bear skin as well.<br/><br/>Midsommar was also a visually beautiful movie. The movie's scariest scenes took place in broad daylight, where most horror movies fear to step. The deaths were gruesome but it was mixed with beauty in the perfect ratio. Death always meant new life. Tortured bodies were adorned in the most vibrant flowers. What I loved the most: when an insider was suffering with pain - physical or emotional - everyone else screamed with pain as well, because suffering, like joy, is something to be shared.<br/><br/>I won't repeat what has already been said about how stunningly beautiful the cinematography is, or how amazing the acting is."

","Only on a few occasions have I felt motivated to write a review immediately after finishing a film for the first time, but after taking a quick scroll and seeing just how polarizing this film has become, I felt I needed contribute to the conversation.<br/><br/>Ari Aster deserves some recognition and credit for taking such a bold and unadulterated approach to the horrors of the grieving process. He's made 2 feature length films in the past few years and neither shy away firstly from the extreme violence, horror and neglect that humans are capable of. But secondly, and more importantly, he is disturbingly willing to show the horrifying ramifications of these atrocities on those who survive them.<br/><br/>No one escapes this life unscathed, we all have a personal relationship with death intermittently through our travels until ultimately we no longer can be distant from it. Aster's films act as a Rorschach test for the grieving process.<br/><br/>I dare to say those who are less willing to face the horrors of grief and the human condition are going to be the ones most likely to be repulsed by his films.<br/><br/>His motif is violent and abstract, and his subject matter is difficult, but ultimately Aster is Force feeding us the grieving process unadulterated.<br/><br/>This movie is a marvel of cinematography, it's disorienting it's so gorgeous.<br/><br/>The acting is fantastic, and the score is unnerving but tonally perfect.<br/><br/>This is not a horror film, this is a traumatic experience. But I believe those who are willing to view the film with an openness and an allowance for their own experience to shape their process, the film will offer them a sense of comfort and relatability that is really unmatched in cinema today.<br/><br/>No one in cinema today is making films that are an experience like Aster is, and he should be celebrated for it."

"nikxatz","8","2","10","29 August 2019"," It's tough to forget this one
","Well, summer never looked weirder.<br/><br/>Midsommar is the new nightmar by Ari Aster, who did a solid job with Hereditary. To me, Hereditary nver felt really scary or deeply disturbing, but it was definately entertaining and worked really smoothly as a family drama with Toni Collette giving a powerhouse performance. Midsommar, is a different film in a lot of ways. One thing is sure, though. I 'll never go to Sweden during the summer.
So, the film basically is about a group of friends visiting this society who live by their own rules and who are currently having this big event. In the group there is a girl who, after a tragedy, lives in pain and her boyfriend is trying to make her feel better.<br/><br/>
The best way to describe this film is that in the end it is more of a feeling, it stands as an emotion and a disturbing one indeed. The main reason I wated to watch the film except of Ari and A24 was its undiniably visual presention. It looks so colourful and beautiful. The sun, the trees, the flowers, all feel so immersive and tranquil and cinemaography geeks are going to love this one. Noth only the actual sets and locations are blessed with joy and colour, but the camera movement, the way Ari draws the camera to reveal more information, the upper shots, the dizzy feel in the ""tripping"" sequences, MIdsommar is a visual fiest. The amount of detail in the houses and walls and paintings all make the world feel alive and real. And all these beauty... in a horror movie. The apporach is just a new look at the genre of fear.Also, I am a huge ""Radiohead"", so as soon as I see these gorgeous pictures of nature, I got a lot of ""Burn the Witch"" vibes.<br/><br/>
The story is solid, though it has some issues. The first 1 and a half hour are mostly buildup , no problem with that and the third act might make somepeople feel disappointed and confused, but I kind of liekd it. Sure, it does not go to full extremes or uses every information we've gotten before, but we get 2 or three really disturbing and out of this world scenes and the thematic of the film about manipulation of the weak and sad and also the theme of family and bonds are explored beatifully.<br/><br/>Till the end, we get some great scenes with characters interacting with each other, some intentionally hillarious scenes with a guy frm the group working as really funny comic relief and I kind of loved how this iflm respects its audience.<br/><br/>The perfromaces are in most parts really good, the soundtrack is so atmospheric and dear lord, the ending scene is the most beautiful and horrific scene I've seen in a while. This is actually the best way to describe the film Beautiful and horrifc at the same time.<br/><br/>Okay, it is not for everyone. The pacing is slow, it could be shoerter for sure, nobody will ever really get it, but that's not to say I did not enjoy it.<br/><br/>
It is disturbing and a magifisently looking film for sure and even though my feelings for it are weird, I know I'll have a hard time getting tihs one out of my mind.<br/><br/>Let my hullicinating nightmares about flowery Swedish blonds and bears in cages begin."

For me, its message is that when placed in a context of light, of conservativism, of orderly tradition, we will accept evil.<br/><br/>This is a film that stays with you. It's disconcerting like a bad trip. It's acted with total commitment and directed with a singular vision. From a straight plot perspective it can be easily dismissed as a Wicker Man reboot, pagan folk horror for a new generation. But it has something new to say that we need to hear"

"casualist","9","1","4","15 March 2020"," A bizzare trip
","Midsommar is genuinely mind-blowing. The film is based on real Swedish traditions, combined with disturbing and extremely gory rituals.
A group of unsuspecting Americans are introduced to the cult by their friend Pelle. It is revealed later that Pelle's motive all along was to sacrifice them.
The supporting characters disappear pretty quickly and don't play a major role in the action, fact that makes us forget about them until the end, when we meet them once again. While they are taken away, Dani and Christian are the center of our attention. It's very interesting to see their barely-there relationship slowly fall apart, while both of them go through multiple trials within the community. The decay of their love story culminates when Dani, as the new May Queen, chooses Christian to be sacrificed.
While the movie is long and slow-paced, I never felt bored while watching. If anything, the slowness of the action only added to the ever-growing feeling of dread.
Another aspect of this movie that I really enjoyed was the setting and the visuals. Most of the film's action takes place in a picturesque region of the Swedish countryside, where the grass is a vivid shade of green and the sun never sets. Everyone is dressed in traditional clothing and their buildings, while charmingly simple, are architectural masterpieces.
Then comes the unsettling gore. While the film rarely trades sunshine for a moody ambiance, it remains eerie throughout its entirety. It is truly unique for a horror movie to combine colorful flowers with dismembered bodies.
My only complaint is the fact that Dani's family situation never gets addressed properly. We are only told that her sister is bipolar and that she has a habit of sending creepy messages, but we never truly understand why she killed herself and their parents, let alone why she committed the act in the way she did. To me, it just felt like they wanted something tragic to happen to the main character before the main events and this was the easiest way to do it.
Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It is multi-dimensional and thought-provoking and it perfectly combines visual beauty with utterly disgusting images. Don't watch if you have a sensitive stomach."
"yasminnatieli","9","1","4","15 March 2020"," this movie immerses you in drama and fear
","Right in the beginning the protagonist's mourning and her toxic relationship can provide shock and bad feelings, according to the plot evolution the movie became even more shocking and incommodious, inducing anxiety to the viewer's and distress by prolonged scenes with uncomfortable situations. The strangeness to a new culture it's almost an challange to keep watching, the horror is vivid and there's so many points that makes it an different experience which it's not to everyone apreciate.
It has to be watched with open-minded to enjoy every feelings and details made by the director's whimsicality, there's paintings all around the set which tells about the story, characters well introduced and the acting it's great mainly Dani's who make's you feel all of her pain, actually every feelings in the movie are tangible, together with an amazing photografy and the transitions scenes it's just incredible. I'm also in love with the Dani's evolution, the way she came into that place completly devastated and as the days go by, even with the strangeness of the culture, she's very respectfull and participative with the villagers, until reach to the end which feels like she finds herself in it, like she belongs.
That's the kind of movie who you can talk about for hours, and keep thinking about for days."
"fieldname","4","1","4","27 February 2020"," Well that was quite disturbing

The question as always is why didn't they go back as soon as they see, in this case, a field full of people who are clearly a cult and the red flags are so obvious.
But that would make it a really short film.
It also reminded a lot of the wickerman."
"ameliek81","4","1","4","11 February 2020"," Unoriginal
","If you're a true fan of horror, you've seen this type of movie 100 times before. Outsiders unknowingly enter a cult while on vacation/on a trip, they begin to ""mysteriously"" disappear one by one has the cult kills them off.
What made this movie particularly bad, was all the attention it received as a ""good"" movie, so I came in with high hopes, even after seeing the preview. I feel those who enjoyed this movie, haven't watched many horror films. For horror fans, there will be zero surprises. You have the main character with a history of family issues and experiences a trauma, obviously they're the hero. As soon as there's mention of the May Queen, you know she's going to be crowned. You know the jerk friend will be killed off for being inappropriate, the one who ""geeks"" out over cults will be killed for curiosity, from her conversation with Pelle in the apartment, you know Dani is the ""chosen"" one, etc. They even have the character who's disfigured because of incest.
I will say the only approach that was different, was the use of colour and cinematography. It's a bright, colourful, visually ""happy"" horror movie. It doesn't go the dark approach. The people of the cult are happy and friendly, even their rituals don't feel ""dark"". So that gets 4 stars."

"garethcrook","7","1","4","21 January 2020"," Creepy folk-tinged dramatic horror, check.
","I was expecting The Wicker Man. Creepy goings on in broad daylight. Although this starts much darker and doesn't have that diy aesthetic, it's hewn from the same tree. A bunch of mostly naive Americans follow their Swedish friend to his commune back home for a summer adventure. Of course they're in for much more than they bargained for as the Swedish friend is more recruiter than the friend they anticipated. It's nuanced though and they put the strangeness that surrounds them as mere cultural difference, which is admirable. Although by enlarge they're simply enamoured by the idyllic utopia they find themselves in and they are portrayed as being pretty stupid to be honest, despite their undergraduate status. Especially Will Poulter who plays the arrogant student with aplomb. He's very good at annoying, at least I always find him annoying. I don't know what it is, maybe it's that he reminds me of Sid, the sadistic kid in Toy Story.
Anyway, back to Midsommer... The ritualistic stuff is front and centre, with everything done for ceremony. It makes for wondrous cinema. Even the more brutal events that happen early on are almost swept aside with acceptance, what goes on in Sweden stays in Sweden. Of course, there's mortal danger and the luscious green fields are a disarming disguise as the comically named Father Odd and his community welcome the newcomers to their 9 day festival of Hargas. It's not long before the unease that we feel reaches the souls onscreen, as totemic signs are left, people are lost and rituals are slowly understood. It's not perfect, but it looks fantastic, builds really well, however it's quite predictable. I try not to put too many of any spoilers in these things, but one look at the poster for this, tells you things aren't going to end well. Despite its slow pace, it rattles along rather well as things get quite horrific for the visitors, but this for me fits into the journey being more enjoyable than the destination category, in that I didn't find the finale that satisfactory. I don't mind the hard cut finish, it can often work really well, but the end sequence was telegraphed a mile off and I was hoping for much much more. All in all though if you like creepy folk-tinged dramatic thrillers, this has you covered."

","I had a great expectations about this movie when i first saw the trailer and it is the movie of a man who created Hereditary which is one of my most favorite mystery/horror movies with so many symbols and details. However, when i first saw this, it was one of the most disappointing movie for me.<br/><br/>On internet someone said, ""this is a psycological situation, the woman had lost her family and then her boyfriend was cheating on her so the paing turns into pleasure."" It is nothing about that. The ending is tied to nothing. There is no subtle connection of the death of family and the onwards . The only connection is main character's travelling to Sweden but this connection is also weak. Pelle that eccentric guy who you can easily predict from the beginning there will be a plot twist about that, actually manipulated the main character tu change her idea on travelling to Sweden.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the bad guys.. Well, it is certain from the beginning but the main problem about that, everyone in movie see what you see but no one is questioning about ""WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE"" or ""SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT HERE""<br/><br/>Comparing this to Hereditary would be a blasphemy.<br/><br/>Performances are getting boring afterwards because for almost 2 and half an hours, almost all characters are in the same mood, no change in the mood.<br/><br/>Music is just meh.<br/><br/>Cinematography is good.<br/><br/>Let's review the symbolic language. In Hereditary, nearly all scenes have details on frames and have symbols about the content of the plot whether it is an object, a light, a visual or a text. It is not just the symbols also, the scene that seems the most unnecessary scene from the beginning is actually a metaphor that is reflecting the summary of the plot. However, there is nothing like this in this movie. There are used so many symbols actually but it is not necessary. It is like i was watching a documentary which is about an ancient pagan nordic beliefs and rituals.<br/><br/>A symbol should be hidden. It should be used inconspicuously, like in Hereditary but they didn't do that in this movie. So the main aim of a symbol becomes POINTLESS.<br/><br/>The old man fell down from the hill but his leg got rotten immediately, it was a cheap scene. All of our American characters are looking to top of the hill, there were an old guy and a woman. They are showing this for almost 5 minutes and not a single main characters (beside Pelle) reason that they will fall down.
Is this about the criticism of Americans minds? Because the stupidity of the main characters is too much to be real even there are 2 characters who wants to write an academic article in university about that."

","Midsommar has stapled A24 as my favorite production and distribution studio. Midsommar is one of those weird movies where I don't really have any issues with the film but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece but it is just shy of being one. The acting is pretty fantastic from everybody. Florence Pugh and Will Poulter are amazing in this movie while everybody else did a great job. Pugh's performance though was genuinely terrifying. What her character goes through and how she ends up at the end of the film is intriguing to watch. The script definitely helps these performances. It's very clever and well written and adds many different layers to this film. The cinematography is pretty great too. Each shot has a purpose and adds to the story and most of the shots are colorful and vibrant while the film has an incredibly dark tone and story. There are a lot of shots of some random things that come back into play later which I appreciated. There were also many great sequences. There is a dream sequence that was great and a sequence where the female characters have a dancing contest/ritual which was also great. Watching these characters watch and participate in different rituals was terrifying and the film isn't afraid to show everything and I mean everything. The film is incredibly gory and there were moments in this film where I was genuinely horrified by what I was witnessing. This is a film that will stick in your mind long after you watch it. Ari Aster definitely nailed it when it came to making a truly uncomfortable film. I really enjoyed the sets and colors they decided to use. It made the film look really pretty while all this really horrible stuff was going on. There was a temple set that looks absolutely beautiful. Overall, Midsommar may not be a masterpiece but its great acting, fantastic cinematography, and disturbing story make this film come so close to being one."

When you think of horror movies you think dark, scary, and jump scares. This movie was not scary to me at least, at times it was unsettling other than that it was not the scariest I've seen.

"alimran-25029","4","1","4","23 November 2019"," Predictable and slow. Starts with promise and then fails to deliver.
","This movie wanted to be the original 'Wicker Man' in a modern setting but failed right in the tracks. The whole scare factor relied on gore and cheap shock value. Within the first 30 minutes it was clear what was going to happen. The whole movie was so damn predictable and felt like a chore to watch. There was no sense of dread or looming terror and almost every single scary bit relied on simply graphic scenery and pointless gore. What was the point of dragging this movie to 2.5 hours when all of it could be done in a 1.5 hour setting?
The main characters were dumb as rocks and devoid of normal humane emotions. Otherwise, within the first bizarre encounter they would have bolted from the place. Probably the only saving grace of the whole movie was the main actress who showed phenomenal acting skills. This movie definitely does not deserve more than 6.00 points and giving it more than 6 is an insult to other horror masterpieces."

","Horror is generally associated with jump scares, darkness and the paranormal.
This movie throws all of that out the window and will have you covering your face wishing it would just stop, from the amount of tension, trauma and general horror it is able to create in broad daylight.
Jump scares are replaced with subtly building tension, demonic activity is replaced with believably disgusting acts that could, in theory, really happen.
If you're looking for a typical horror to laugh at with your friends and get a thrill out of, this movie is not for you. It will have you sitting in dead uncomfortable silence and shock. If you have watched Hereditary from the same director, you will know what I'm talking about.
The film is a work of art in the way it can so unconventionally create such a sense of horror and dread. The scenes and camera work are beautiful, the gore is raw without hiding nor emphasising it. Every progression of the film is believable and horrifyingly realistic in its conveyance.
This is not a typical horror movie but it is very much a horror movie. Again, if you are wanting a movie that you will 'enjoy', this is not for you.

","Ari Aster's feature length debut Hereditary was my favourite film of last year and became one of the best horror films I've ever seen. So I was very excited to hear about his next project 'Midsommar'. Did it meet my expectations?<br/><br/>Midsommar is about a couple who travel to Sweden with their friends for the midsummer festival but soon come to realise the strange and shocking practices the cult perform there.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, Ari Aster was on my radar since his last film therefore my anticipation for this movie was very high and I can say with full confidence that this film delivers. Do not go into this film expecting jumpscares or any other cheap tactics to scare you because Aster doesn't follow that formula. Here, he has made a film that goes along a more psychological route which delves deep into the mental and physical stability of our main character.<br/><br/>The performances are terrific all around. Florence Pugh gave an emotionally stirring performance that seemed very genuine. It's definitely her best performance so far. Her boyfriend, played by Jack Reynor, also gave a good performance. Throughout the whole film, you buy them as this couple whose relationship is on the rocks due to their dialogue delivery, tone and way they act around each other. All the other actors do a great job as well as the cult which provide some extremely uncomfortable moments.<br/><br/>Aside from the story, this film looks beautiful. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and the score alongside it creates such a magical and fantasy-like atmosphere which doesn't stray away from eeriness. Ari Aster's direction is immaculate, in particular a beautiful wide shot involving Florence Pugh and a lot of flowers. The general aesthetics are a visual treat and hypnotic to a major extent.<br/><br/>I feel the more and more you watch this film, the better the experience gets as there is so much to admire in terms of its story and characters. Much like Hereditary, this film brings themes of grief and pain but also adds meaning to bad relationships, the negative people around you and the sense of belonging. Aster explores these ideas through visual storytelling which makes me praise his vision as a storyteller. He clearly doesn't take the audience for granted and wants us to think and interpret Midsommar in our own way rather than spoonfeeding all the details.<br/><br/>Midsommar may be one of the weirdest films to come out this year but you can't deny the craft and thought process behind it. This is a movie that I would love to analyse further and get to grips with the multiple ideologies the film presents. This is undoubtedly one of the best films of the year and I'm extremely excited to see what Ari Aster can bring to the table next."

And although his second film wasn't as nerve-rattling as his first, it was still a very uncomfortable, unsettling & unnerving horror that established him as one of the boldest new filmmakers out there.<br/><br/>However, it is only after watching Midsommar restored with all the segments that were edited out to improve the film's commercial value does one realise the real masterpiece that Ari Aster's sophomore feature is. Clocking at 171 minutes, the director's cut doesn't modify the plot structure but instead provides additional richness & cohesiveness to the story that makes the overall experience far more fulfilling & complete.<br/><br/>While there are a couple extended scenes here that the film was better without, most of the new sequences add considerable weight & emotional wallop to Dani & Christian's relationship conflict, thus making the finale much more cathartic & satisfying. Add to that, an additional ritual of the HÃ¥rga festival featured in this latest cut also provides a closure to the final fate of a character who mysteriously disappeared.<br/><br/>Sewing new threads into an existing fabric in a manner that enriches the texture & quality of the whole tapestry by a considerable extent, Midsommar (Director's Cut) is a definite improvement in every conceivable way, and should be the only version available to viewers. Its almost 3-hour long runtime may seem daunting but the narrative flow & pacing feels much smoother & breezier, and expertly ties up all the loose ends.<br/><br/>In short, Midsommar (Director's Cut) is an undeniably better, darker, powerful, haunting & rewarding picture than the theatrical version, and is Ari Aster's folk horror in its true, original & undiluted form. Strongly recommended."

","I really could insert that shocked Kevin Hart GIF and end the review there.
This movie got high reviews for some reason and I totally respect that but for me it was just weird!
I usually enjoy slow progressing events, mystery and dialogues but this is just straight up weird and slightly disturbing! I will certainly never gonna watch it again"
"MooWoolf1","7","1","4","24 October 2019"," Surreal, slow and what?
","I'm gonna start with something from it's trivia.
""Despite sharing the same title and both being horror movies set in Sweden, this film is not related to the Danish cult classic Midsommar (2003). ""<br/><br/>So the ORIGINAL says ""Christian's sister commits suicide. Why? After his 4 friends graduate secondary school, they head off to a Swedish cabin for midsummer as previous years. Strange things happen.""<br/><br/>NOT RELATED? SERIOUSLY? Even the guy's name is the same.<br/><br/>About the movie.<br/><br/>I didn't like a few shots, the camera was simply in a wrong place.
Many scenes were too long for no reason. I could easily cut out 30 minutes and it would flow better.<br/><br/>The main character was not the main character. She was just a pretty object used to show us a very surreal world. Her character started out good but in the second act she was put away and there was no character arc anymore. After the second act because of it, it felt very odd that she kills off her bf.<br/><br/>So her character was very badly written. It was used well, I liked the movie, but I felt sorry for her. She is the ""main"" and all she had to do is go here, go there, ""cry"" a little and smile..<br/><br/>In my opinion the movie fails at the end because of the badly written characters. The movie and the shots show that she goes crazy but that happens out of nowhere, for no real reason.<br/><br/>It was very surreal and this is why it is good. In every other way I think it's not a good movie. The director should see a doctor. For real."
"narendra-pal","5","1","4","11 October 2019"," Cult ?? Ha ha
","Well looks like this movie is one of the favourite movie of *critics*.
I watched it as a lot of buzz was created for this and this really didn't met my expectations. This is too lengthy and slow paced with lots of unnecessary lengthy rituals scenes.
The only impressive thing about this movie is the idea of white color dressed cult. I mean it's difficult to remember such clean people doing dirty work.
The story is straight forward and if you survive 2 hrs than there is a predictable twist. First half of this movie is unbearable, means just to confuse viewers they wasted full first half which didn't support story much. After this shear torture of around 1 hrs they switch storyline now since you are already bored to death then any little baseless twist will gives a feel good effect. I think this is the real reason of good reviews/ratings. The second half is watchable hence my 5 stars.
Director has done really good job but editing is one of the lowest point. I am sure we have seen a lot of similar lower budget movies(No offence I love those) with similar storyline but once you add color white it becomes cult. Thanks"

"videorama-759-859391","7","1","4","19 August 2019"," Midsommer Hell
","I must say, this viewing experience was a different experience of story, and that in itself, is a good thing. We've read a lot about different cults and practices, and this near two and a half hour film, shows us from a fresh original concept, of a rather different nationality of cult, which was informative, and not so much off the mark, as to the real practices, of these sickening cult groups.The film walks a path of predictability though as to where it's going. Our foreign male character at the start, a Gerard Butler looking guy, + beard, whom jumps out at you, with menace, from the start, heralds the hell, of what will ensue for our young collegiate party. Midsommar is an impressive vehicle for sure, but it does suffer from a couple of flaws, where like I said earlier, it's painful predictability, as to the fates of our young hormone, adrenaline fueled characters. It's not what you call scary, but does disturb in a few parts for sure, some moments, graphically violent, but really it's occasional. I must say, the young lead actress was fantastic (you'll know in the first ten minutes of it's starting, in what is a great catalyst of story). Certainly intriguing at the start. The great unnerving music score used here, leads you to question if it's connected to what follows. A haunting catalyst image, still burns through me, in this. A real powerful scene, and the actress, who I'm sure was in a short film I saw (this film has a sea of unknowns) is so frighteningly believable in her grief. Only, she should of taken a vacation somewhere else, to deal with her loss. She's the only real character you care about in the movie. Disjointed some, the movie is drawn out a bit too. Knowing there's thirty minutes cut out of this film, that is scary, but a relief too. Worth the view, but don't expect to be shuddering in your seat."

"TheUserIDYouEnteredHasAlready","8","1","4","23 July 2019"," Too long and not very scary, but well crafted and entertaining
","First off, this film is intended to be a summertime horror flick, so it is required that you ignore a few too-convenient coincidences and unbelievable actions (or lack of normal behavior) on the part of the victims. There are several in this movie, as in most of the genre.<br/><br/>The film itself is well constructed and flows nicely throughout, with only a few minor parts that drag. The acting is pretty darn good from the entire cast as well.<br/><br/>I wasn't a fan of ""Hereditary"" because it just strained the limits of believability, and given the publicly advertised/reviewed nature of this flick, it would stand to reason I'd feel the same here, but I don't. This film is much more cohesive and steady than ""Hereditary"" and it flows forward with minimal of the absolutely unbelievable occurrences that plague the first film. (daughter getting decapitated in car; son doing/saying nothing at all to his parents, etc.), keeping the audience just engaged enough in wondering what's going to happen to our intended victims.<br/><br/>All in all this was a very pleasant film that I actually liked better than other films to which it is being compared (""Wicker Man"" for example). Perhaps it's a bit over-long and about a combined 30 minutes could have been shaved from various scenes, including the finale. Still, the positives outweighed the negatives for me and I'm comfortable giving this one a solid 8-stars."
"elliemayy-64913","8","1","4","22 July 2019"," Beautifully horrifying
","It is impossible not to appreciate the gorgeous cinematography in this film. The entire thing feels incredibly trippy and it's completely immersive. As a 'horror' this film is not ' scary' in the traditional sense yet it is undeniably horrific with many scenes being so genuinely chilling but leaving me on the edge of my seat. My one critique of this film would be the length , with a 2 and a half hour run time the the end seems somewhat lacking with a lot of content seeming compacted into a short portion of the film. Even considering this there is no point in the film I would consider tedious. For a substantial portion of the film I was in desperate need of a toilet yet I couldn't bring myself to leave my seat for fear of missing something and in retrospect there was no opportunity in which I could have left. There was a few plot lines I wish had been followed more thoroughly as they could be really interesting .Even with these criticisms I still found this film throughly enjoyable and would definitely revisit and recommend"
"christianwoodfilmmaker","9","1","4","19 July 2019"," This film is brilliant for the most part but has a few issues to stop it from being perfect
","Ari Aster's new film Midsommar is good, I recommend you all see it.
Aster's first feature Hereditary was one of my favourite films that I saw last year, I thought it was an extremely well shot and well orchestrated family drama that incorporated several horror elements along with a great soundtrack.
His new film Midsommar combines great cinematography with a good script, characters (somewhat) and amazing performances.
First of all, the cinematography: I really loved the opening of this film taking place in the snow with very dull, dark cinematography and imagery when placed in contrast to the beautiful sunny and warm cinematography that appears later in the film. This film carries on the extremely well framed shots that fit hand in hand Aster's character direction and blocking. During the first act of the film, there are a lot of shots that use reflections in the frame which I really liked, for example there is a great shot of Christian and Dani having a conversation with each other during which Christian is only ever seen in the reflection on a mirror in the left of the frame. I really liked this stylistic choice which really helped understand the distance and disconnection between these two characters and also feelings of regret and REFLECTION that the main characters would have been feeling during the sombre first act.
One of the best uses of the cinematography in the whole film is the reveal of the main conflict during the first act (which I will not spoil). The mix of the slow moving camera that snakes around like a third eye in the scene, the red flashing lights and the slowed down action really showed instantly that whatever the Dani and the spectator are about to find out is truly disturbing. And it was. There is an extremely powerful image in this reveal sequence that really stuck with me a long time after seeing the film, and it still does now. This image is later incorporated into the film in the second act during a surreal dream/hallucination sequence and heightens the disturbance very well as well as strengthen the character.
The warm and fuzzy cinematography with lots of perfectly framed wide shots of different coloured elements that all contrasted against the blue sky which features a lot in the frame was done very well and was the best way to tell this section of the story. There is a holy temple in the film, a bright orange pointy building which is beautifully shot in meticulously organised frames against the blue summer sky, almost how Wes Anderson would shoot it.
However, the cinematography in the film does conjure up a few minor complaints that I have about the film. The first comes with that disturbing image in the first act. When it is shown, the camera moves slowly up to it, creating a wonderful sense of dread, but then for some reason brushes past it after establishing what it is and focusing on something that is still relevant but not really worth showing. You'll know what I'm talking about when I see it. The second issue with the cinematography is just one single sequence, this is the moment where the group begin to understand that this festival has some sinister traditions to it. This horrific sequence which uses some great practical gore that would make Julia Ducournau jealous was strangely overexposed and whited out. Maybe this is a stylistic choice from Aster that I don't fully understand the meaning of or maybe it is a mistake (probably the former), but it bothered me slightly.
The second issue I have is with the sound. There's some really awful ADR in this film which just takes away from the otherwise great character dynamics. This mainly comes in the form of some extremely fake sounding sarcastic remark from Will Poulter's character, who sometimes isn't even shown to be in the scene in some cases. This was annoying and hurt the film quite a lot.
On the bright side, the main performance from Florence Pugh is really amazing, not even for a single second did I ever doubt her character or feel like I was watching an actor, I only saw the character which is almost as good as a performance can get. Pugh is surrounded with other great performances from Will Poulter, Jack Reynor, William Jackson Harper and Vilhelm Blomgren. Through the vast majority of the film the characters feel very real and make a lot of sense when held against their established motivations. The only complaint I have here is a decision that Will Poulter's character makes at around the midpoint of the film. I just thought it was kinda stupid and felt more like an excuse for something else to occur later in the film.
Another issue comes with the story and the way it all fits together and so. I just felt that the build up to what was going to happen was just a bit too much for what actually did happen. Maybe I'm not too easily disturbed or maybe it was A24's marketing that made me feel as if the third act of this film would be horrific and disturbing (which it sort of was but not to the extent that I expected).
All in all, I felt like this film was extremely well orchestrated by Aster with his previously displayed eye for great visual storytelling, imagery, reincorporation of subtle information and just visually pleasing images (that serve an actual purpose, take notes Mr Refn). The performances of the secondary cast were very good but Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor stole the show and their character dynamics were fantastic. All the characters were extremely believable apart from one or two moments like mentioned before. The only thing that really takes away from this film being a 10/10 was the really annoying and just plain bad ADR, the super build-up that never really paid off like I thought it would and that one sequence that was awkwardly overexposed and whited out.
I highly recommend this film and I'll give it a 9/10 (4.5 stars)."

","A group of young people travel to a foreign country for a getaway-but wait, it's not as by-the-numbers horror as it sounds, and if you're keen on brainless exploitation or action driven supernatural films, this isn't for you. It's not chock full of jump scares or fake builds. This is a movie for those who liked Hereditary, Mother, and VVitch, maybe even The Ritual.<br/><br/>Delve into a faux-Swedish pagan ritual culture where the natives are kind and communal, the countryside is grandiose and Village-esque, and the refreshments always look a bit iffy. No one is jumping out at you from dark corners, but you will never feel at ease throughout the runtime.<br/><br/>It's paced gingerly, filmed with flair, and relies heavily on human emotion and existential undercurrents to pull you into a story of grief, healing, separation, desire, and individuation.<br/><br/>Come to be unsettled. Come to be disoriented by bright environments, bizarre and sometimes silly symbolism, obvious shocks which still manage to be shocking, and blatant psychological metaphors. Come because gore and schlock are commonplace horror on streaming services, but slow-burn psychological stories are rare delicacies for theaters to serve.<br/><br/>Many, many people will come away confused, annoyed, and disappointed, but if you are willing to arm yourself with intellect and ask some difficult questions, you will find this compelling and ultimately satisfying as a moving piece of thoughtfully executed cinema."

","There is a plethora of words to describe Ari Aster's second outing. So many words. But at the top is unique. Midsommar remains captivating from start to finish. Midsommar is a Drama at its core; with elements of horror entwine in The Surreal screenplay. It's slow, methodical, eerie.
The film is fabulous to just stare at every frame and behold the transpiring of absolute madness. Its an absolute psychedelic trip from start to finish. I loved every excruciatingly paced surreal, bizarre, traumatizing second. 9/10"
"darkreignn","9","1","4","12 July 2019"," hey imdb why don't you tell my why this review has been declined there's nothing wrong with it at all and I've been a member for over 7 years
","""Midsommar"" is the newest film by Ari Aster, acclaimed director of movies like ""Hereditary"" and ""The Strange Thing About the Johnsons."" Now if there's one thing about me, it's that I'm depressed. More importantly than that, I absolutely loved both of the movies I just mentioned. I thought ""Hereditary"" was a perfect combination of supernatural horror and family drama, mixing the genres so well that the tragedy itself adds to and becomes a part of the horror before the actual horror even begins. With ""Midsommar,"" Ari Aster does something similar, starting with a family tragedy and eventually infusing it with the cultish horror that you came for.<br/><br/>Listen, I don't want to give away too many plot points; this is a film that greatly benefits from you going in as blind as possible. What I will say is, like ""Hereditary,"" ""Midsommar"" looks absolutely beautiful, if not more so. From the dark, dreary opening, to the gorgeously sunlit greenery, this movie made me think to myself, ""now this is why I love movies."" I mean, the opening alone, right before the end credits, was mesmerizing and had my eyes glued to the screen; I only wish my butt was glued to my seat because I had to leave every 20 minutes to pee. Rest assured however, I didn't miss much, because luckily the bathroom was right next to the theatre.<br/><br/>Now you might be wondering, ""just how scary is this film?"" Like ""Hereditary,"" this movie creeps along at a slow, methodical pace, becoming increasingly more disturbing to watch. In my opinion, it's never necessarily scary like ""Sinister"" or ""Insidious"" is, but the disturbing antics and actions that take place throughout the movie do make for an uncomfortable experience. ""Midsommar"" deals with real life horror. Suicide, break ups, and loneliness are all topics that are touched upon. And that's what I love about Ari Aster. There isn't a working director today who can portray grief so effectively. You've seen tragedies happen in other movies, but you've never seen them portrayed so horrifically. When a particular thing happens in this movie, seeing how a character reacts to it is a gut punch. I mean, it's scary to watch because of how realistic it is. ""Midsommar"" blends the horror of family tragedy with the horror of a primitive pagan cult to perfection. It's a fantastic combination, one I never thought I would see, let alone enjoy watching.<br/><br/>And like I mentioned, when the pagan cultic shenanigans happen, your jaw will drop. I could feel the tension in the theatre when the first ""big"" event happened. The suspense in the air was thick. I won't get into exactly what happens, but it's certainly worth the wait to get to it. Yes, this is a long movie, but it's never boring. It's always beautiful to look at, and there's always something interesting happening.<br/><br/>A technically amazing drama, ""Midsommar"" is a gorgeously thought provoking film. This isn't a movie for everyone because of its uncomfortable subject matter, but I do think it's more of a crowd-pleaser than ""Hereditary."" Unlike that movie, in ""Midsommar,"" my packed theatre legitimately seemed to enjoy the movie, even if they were saying things like, ""that was the weirdest f**king movie I've ever seen."" Look, I really loved this movie. It's not conventional, and it's not what modern audiences will expect from a horror movie released in 2019, but I for one cannot wait to see it again."
"yiw2000","5","1","4","8 July 2019"," would common people react the same way?
","I like the pace of the movie where it slowly introduces the story and gradually build into something, well, not hard to imagine. I wasn't disappointed in the cliche of the plot, but the lack of discovery of human nature in light of the events revealed in front of the characters' eye. The emotions they display are so shallow that keeps me wondering, would people's mind so superficial and naive? I actually anticipated a wake of humanity at the decision making time when there is conflict among the guest characters."

You keep waiting for something to happen, then it doesn't. The ""shocking"" moments became predictable and uninteresting. A lot of off camera deaths that weren't explained, or shown, but then they can show women dancing for 20 minutes straight. It was just annoying.

I won't go into spoilers, but i will say that ""Midsommar"" does not play as a conventional horror movie. It is barely a horror movie at all. Yet its themes can be horrifying, hopeful and bizarre for sure. It takes a visionary director to make such a film. At times, it reminded of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" by S. Kubrick. And this is only a second movie by Ari Aster, whose debut film ""Hereditary"" was better as horror movie, but this one was more bold and unique.<br/><br/>Overall, i'm affraid ""Midsommar"" is not for everyone's taste.

","Midsommar is a film that is hard to rate, there are some really great elements but also some very average moments. Florence pugh is amazing as Dani and most of the performances are really good. However Cristian played by Jack Reynor was not good, some of his line delivery was laughable. A storyline that I thought was really interesting was dropped very early on and that kind of disappointed about this, but I do really love the story that is told once the characters get to Sweden. The concept of this film is right down my alley so when the characters are introduced to the cult the film really picks up for me, I loved watching how the people of the cult live their day to day lives. Midsommar builds tension masterfully, there were multiple moments where I was gripping my seat waiting for a payoff, sadly I did not think the end of the film was good, the whole middle section is so great and I was waiting for something to happen during the third act and when it did I was not satisfied. The cinematography is something else every, single, shot is beautiful, infact technically this film is phenomenal, there was one transition that did take me out of the film for a moment but that's very minor. I found out something very interesting about this film today, so obviously it is inspired by The wicker man but a movie that you might not have seen called ""Midsummer"" directed by Carsten Myllerup in 2003. Midsommar has almost a similar plot to Midsummer, in both the lead characters sister dies and they go on holiday to Sweden and have a load of strange things happen. I'm not saying that Ari Aster stole this idea but I definitely think that Midsommar is heavily inspired by Midsummer. Overall Midsommar is inconsistent but definitely worth a watch."

And then you run through it, carry it with you throughout this journey, experience it in a surreal world where grief is experienced differently.

","I saw this in the cinema when it came out. First thing that caught me, was the music. It was done brilliantly, in my opinion it really set the tone for the mood, what could happen, a sense of creeping dread and question. A sense that something is not right. I do not think there were any flaws with the music. It had me spellbound yet feeling very uncomfortable at the same time, from the get go. The story itself was interesting, leaving you wanting to know more, even though the uncomfortable feeling is there and you should probably turn away. There was a bit in the movie that I found to be predictable. However I found more to be of intrigue. There were some moments here and there in the film that we had a bit of joined laugh at in the cinema (that seemed to be intended by the script/acting), and another moment where we laughed because we were struck by the bizareness of what was happening on screen (I have no idea what kind of reaction the writers and director expected, I wonder how others reacted). I want to say more but really don't want to give anything away. All in all, I thought this was a good film. It was worth seeing for sure. The music was composed and performed incredibly, very unsettling. I think the actors were very good too, especially the villagers. The thing I'll note about this film is it has a slower pace to it (however by this I do not mean it was dragged out, at least this wasn't my personal experience). It is like a churning build up. If you are someone who likes movies with storylines pertaining to cults, you definitely need to check this film out."
"ArthvrPendrag0n","6","1","5","9 April 2020"," This movie is like tripping, there's no meaning, just experience.
","I for a long time have been hearing about this movie, I knew people were receiving it with mixed feelings so I decided to see it for myself. At first I thought this was going to be a drama movie, trying to mix elements of horror with psychological themes - such as loss, depression - and more philosophical ones such as the cicle of life and finally death. The impression I'm left with after watching Midsommar is that either I totally missed the point of the story or that it had no point at all. I have no problems when movies turn out to be something totally different from what I expected, but I truly find it frustrating when you're left with nothing but a feeling of misunderstanding - but perhaps that's the very point of this movie.<br/><br/>Midsommar is a weird experience, maybe strong for the faint of heart, but at the same time quite predictable? It sounds like it tries to find the middle ground between horror tropes and left turns to shock the watcher. I did not find it disturbing, but that doesn't mean it fails to deliver the blows - they just don't really shock since they're to be expected. My conclusion is that what this movie might lack is substance and if the substance was meant to be found by the watcher then it fails, at least for me, to make the way visible. But like many of the weird experiences movies can bring, I find this one odd enough and probably nonsensical enough to be entertaining - it's one of those movies that forces you to find a meaning for its content, which can also be a deep flaw depending on the case.<br/><br/>To be fair I'm not sure if it tries to be deep or if it just embraces the very nature of the plot. Weird pagan rites engulfing the characters as the movie without a sense of directions engulfs the watcher. Weird experience, but also very slow and at times boring - when it is easy to see what's coming next the meantime is pure boredom. I don't find it ideal to be contemplating this movie to find a meaning, I'd rather try to see few individual meanings and symbols in some elements instead of trying to tie the dots - if that even is possible. If anything this movie makes me think of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring, but I'm not quite sure if they hold the same relevance in art - or maybe history will repeat itself and we'll see that this movie was something more than we see now."

Once the film starts at the commune, I started to fall asleep-partly because I was tired but it was just too tedious to watch. The gore and graphic scenes just come out of nowhere with not much suspense, and before I knew it the movie anti-climatically ends with the main girl smiling at a burning tent.

","Self-described horror fans have been telling me to see this since its opening weekend. I finally gave it a shot (the theatrical version), knowing that it was inspired by THE WICKER MAN (1973). I went into it prepared for it to be reminiscent of that film, but I didn't expect it to steal from other horror movies that most fans of the genre are already well aware of. This bothered me a great deal, and shattered the spell the filmmakers hooked me with in the beginning.<br/><br/>It starts very well. The characters are nicely drawn, much of the acting is uncommonly good, and the pre-credit sequence establishes a horrifying reality-based tone that sets the stage for what is to come. I was hooked. Lead actress Florence Pugh is quite good, as are the Swedish characters who provide the source for most of the film's horror elements.<br/><br/>I won't say much about the plot, except that it concerns a group of young Americans who are invited by their Swedish friend to a commune in Sweden where ancient rituals could put foreign visitors in danger. A premise like that can either lead to genuine suspense and scare scenes, or it can provide a series of laughable, clunky attempts at horror. Sadly, as this film progresses, it manages to fall into the latter category, especially for horror fans who have any memories of the well-trodden classics of the genre.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS*
The first real moment of on-screen violence is straight out of the original THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE (1974). It's not only lifted from that film, but isn't even reinvented in any way to conceal the fact that it's copied. It's just a blatant rip-off of the first kill scene in that film. I was shocked by director Ari Aster's nerve in doing this, especially since just about anyone interested in horror cinema has seen Tobe Hooper's classic. Aster was already leaning heavily on THE WICKER MAN, which in itself begs for some forgiveness on the part of the viewer, so the theft of the killing from Hooper's film is - in my view - unforgivable. It shattered the impact of everything the film was accomplishing, and it's so jarringly shameless that I couldn't get back into the film.<br/><br/>As the movie approaches its finale, director Aster's primary influences become more than apparent, as he hurls elements from SUSPIRIA (1977) and especially the third act of THE WICKER MAN at the viewer with reckless abandon. Are there potentially affecting moments that didn't remind me of pre-existing movies? Sure, but again, Aster blew it for me by alerting me to the fact that he's not only a big fan of popular horror classics, but that he isn't afraid to pick key scenes from them. A shame, because MIDSOMMAR wouldn't be a bad film if Aster had been more concerned with making a unique experience. That said, moviegoers who haven't seen '70s horror movies - or who don't mind cinematic theft that transcends the notion of ""paying homage"" - will likely have a rewarding experience here.<br/><br/>Some say Ari Aster is a filmmaker worth watching. I strongly disagree."

"Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews","6","1","5","7 January 2020"," Midsommar: Scream or Stream?
","The Stream: For a movie designated mystery/horror, the film was lacking in execution of both.<br/><br/>The Big Screen: The cinematography is top notch/Oscar-worthy.<br/><br/>The Final Bill: The movie delivers in weirdness but execution with suspense/horror is lacking.<br/><br/>-S2S<br/><br/>Midsommar is Director Ari Aster's follow-up film to Hereditary. Hereditary (check our review in Facebook review archive) garnered some mixed reviews, but most were positive. Let's see if Midsommar can continue with that momentum.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I don't believe it will. There are many things I could say that are bad about this movie, but let's start with the good. The movie's cinematography, especially when set in Sweden, is mesmerizing. Almost every shot is done intentionally and artfully. One of my favorite shots, occurs early on and is insignificant to the plot, but I just remember thinking the use of a drone was dope. You go from riding in the car with the characters to flying to floating upside down then coming back to reality in the matter of moments. This was just one of the cool shots throughout the movie. Outside of the cinematography, the only other good part were the random villagers. They were on point. I can't say the same for the actual cast. The villagers are fascinating and spellbinding. They are the magic of the film, but beyond them, there comes issues.<br/><br/>The first issue with the movie was the main cast. Do not get me wrong. They were not horrendous. They were just not good. I truly believe, if the movie were cast (or directed) better, my feelings of the movie would have been different. It: Chapter 2 was a trailer prior to the movie. I couldn't help but to think that if that cast were in this movie, we might be talking about an Oscar rather than a Razzie (no, it's not that bad). Each actor seemed to fit their character; however, each individual character was lacking or felt insignificant. Either way, each character had limited development; and, except for Dani (Florence Pugh) in the beginning, you ultimately don't care about the characters. It's hard to get engrossed in a movie you barely care about what happens to the characters.<br/><br/>On top of the poor character development, the thing everyone came to see was missing, the suspense/mystery/horror. Let's start with what there was of the mystery. (NO Spoiler Coming- all info comes from the Trailer see above) We know something went wrong with Dani and that's why she's deciding to go on this trip. But why and how does it fit into the overall storyline? We know they are going to a commune in Sweden where there is a interesting summer tradition. What are the traditions, the meanings and what is going on? These questions keep rolling through your mind throughout the movie.<br/><br/>That's where mystery ends. Everything else is either predictable or straight forward (if you take random villagers at their word). For as weird and psychedelic as it tries to be, the movie lacks imagination, especially after Hereditary's randomness. I'm surprised this director had an issue with imagination and originality. There are a couple shocking moments but even more anti-climatic moments. The movie feels more stagnate than suspenseful at times. In addition to that, for horror fans there are only 2 minutes worth of material that could be considered scary out of a 141 minute runtime. Talk about too long for too little payout. This was quite a letdown compared to the enthralling trailer. The only hope is that Hereditary and Midsommar are actually a part of a connected trilogy or universe.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, this movie looks beautiful but isn't worth spending the money in the theater UNLESS you enjoyed Hereditary. The movie delivers in weirdness, but execution with suspense is lacking. Wait for this to come to Netflix and do not expect to be scared or surprised."
"nebk","4","1","5","4 January 2020"," ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZmmar
","Given how much hype surrounded this movie when it came out and how much people praised it it is in fact a huge disappointment and a let down. As others have pointed out the acting is decent and the cinematography is great but the story is slow and makes little sense. There is little character development and in a movie 2 and half hours long that's a problem. Another thing that is annoying that the main characters make the same dumb mistakes in this supposedly clever horror as they do in every other c-grade horror flick and no amount of drugged up chanting pagans or nudity is going to hide that fact.<br/><br/>An elderly couple from the commune commits ritual suicide and one of the characters labels it a cultural difference. A couple from England shocked by the suicides decides to leave. They have been together for four and a half years and the boyfriend supposedly leaves the girlfriend without telling her and the rest just shrug and accept it. There is a scream later on and the girl disappears but no one questions that either. One of the characters decides he is going to do an anthropological PhD thesis on the commune even though his buddy is doing it already and starts pseudo interviewing the commune members for about 3 and a half minutes....because that's how PhD dissertations work...NOT. In reality he would have had to get an adviser, present a proposal to the faculty, get approval, do a literature review and years of research. One of the friends is an annoying joker type who ends up peeing on a tree considered holly by the comune..and it's no surprise that one of the commune members ends up wearing his face later on. Then there is more dancing, sex and chanting as well as human sacrifice and one of the characters joins the community after being declared May Queen through a dancing contest. I swear I'm not making this up.<br/><br/>In conclusion Midsommar is a pretentious and unoriginal movie that borrrows too much from the original Wicker Man and if it was any slower it would be going backwards in time."

"cappiethadog","8","1","5","6 November 2019"," Too many flowers
","Sometimes it's okay to be an ugly American. The problem with the young adults in Ari Aster's ""Midsommar"" is that they're college students. The humanities get them killed. Learned men and women taught these impressionable students not to bring their own preconceived notions of civilization into cultures that reject Western, or Judeo-Christian values. Characters in horror movies are largely stupid, willfully putting themselves into harm's way. ""Midsommar"" is different. They're global citizens, and acting as global citizens, the undergraduates keep an open mind about customs and atypical human behavior that they don't understand. Being too smart keeps them there. Nobody wants to be accused of being a snob. Besides, one of their friends is a cultist. Everybody loves Pelle(Vilhelm Blomgren), the gentle and soft-spoken Swede, so nobody says anything truly derogatory about his homecoming, except for Mark(Will Poulter), the sardonic American, who quips: ""So we're stopping in Waco before going to Pelle's village?""<br/><br/>""Midsommar"" can be read as a satire on ethnographic films, such as David and Laura Glen Shapiro's ""Keep the River on Your Right: A Modern Cannibal Tale"", a documentary about anthropologist Tobias Scheenbaum who not only studied the cannibalistic diet of Peruvian aboriginals, the Arkmbut tribe, he became a cannibal himself. For sure, the group composition doesn't lend itself to self-preservation. Dani(Florence Pugh) just lost her immediate family in a murder/suicide. Josh(William Jackson Harper) and Christian(Jack Reynor), Dani's boyfriend, are anthropology majors. Mark, however, differs from the rest, because he feels superior to these pagan cultists. Without permission, Mark vapes, as if he owns the place, never once taking into account that smoking of any sort could be against their laws. ""Those girls are walking funny,"" Mark observes, when the female villagers gather wildflowers in a backwards motion. Unfortunately, he takes a nap at the wrong time. If Mark was present for the attestupa, ritualized suicide in which village elders step off a steep cliff, maybe, just maybe, he could have caused a louder commotion, joining Simon(Archie Madekwe) and Connie(Ellora Torchia) in a chorus of American privilege, by calling a spade a spade: This is b****** crazy. And with a running start, lead his friends through the Scandinavian woods.<br/><br/>Babette Hersant(Stephanie Audrane) had no place to go. Her husband and son were among the French civil war fatalities, collateral damage in a counter-revolutionary insurrection against the Paris Commune, a radical Socialist movement that governed France for a short period in 1871. The Marxists were overthrown during what became known as La semaine sanglante(a.k.a. ""The Bloody Week""), when the regular army brought France back to normal order. Babette, suddenly, caught on the wrong side of history, escaped to Jutland, living alongside provincials who believed that ""earthly love and marriages were considered of scant worth and merely empty illusion"". Circumstances being what they were, this doctrine suited Babette just fine. Two women, Phillipa(Bodji Kjer), a budding opera singer in her youth, and Martine(Birgitte Feerspiel), the sister that doesn't sing, who could have been the wife of a high-ranking general, employs Babette as their live-in maid. Their father, an orthodox Papist minister(Pouel Kern), simply known as ""Papa"", in ""Babette's Feast"", a film by Gabriel Axel, invented a religion seemingly designed to prevent his daughters from leaving the commune. Being that his congregants are cut off from the larger part of Denmark, a demagogue like the pastor can invent bylaws that are atypical from societal and religious norms. The women are celibate, in essence, nuns, but instead of being married to God, both daughters seem engaged to their father, perpetually saving themselves for a wedding night that never arrives. Visitors come and visitors go, recognizing the place for what is; a cult, one man's own private Pietistic conventicle. Lorens(Jarl Kulie), as a young man, can't get anywhere with Martine because romantic love is against her religion. The disservice done to Phillipa by this Protestant sect is even worse. Under the tutelage of Achille Papin(Jean-Phillipe Lafont), a famed Parisan opera singer, Phillipa was destined to become a famous diva, before she suddenly puts a kibosh to the idea of fame and fortune, and perhaps, love, when she chooses this cult of personality over Papin, her safe passage to the real world. It's a human horror neither man wants any part of. Arguably, they don't fight hard enough for the women they love.<br/><br/>As May Queen, a title Dani wins in a dance competition that rewards endurance, she holds the power of life over death. Dani gets to choose the ninth human sacrifice for a purging ceremony that entails being burned alive. When her victory was still in doubt, this orphan, wanting to share with somebody her excitement, looks toward the sideline for Christian, who refuses to make eye contact with her. ""Does he feel like home to you?"" Pelle had asked her. No, he doesn't. In that instant, she makes a snap decision: Harga, a commune in rural Sweden, seemingly a million miles away from America, becomes her new living space. She pardons Torbjorn(Mihaly Kaszas), the pagan, the ""lucky"" lottery winner"", and selects her boyfriend for temple duty. During the ritual, Christian wears the skin of a bear that had recently been specially disemboweled for the occasion. Ironically enough, back at her dormitory room, Dani had kept a painting that showed a little girl peering into the face of a giant brown bear. The painting can be interpreted this way: The girl, of course, is Dani; she looks to the bear, symbolizing formalized religion, for help in getting over the loss of her older sister and parents, but is let down, just like how Christian, her boyfriend, lets her down, by participating in a fertility ceremony. Similar to Babette, the former head chef at the famed Cafe Anglais, in ""Babette's Feast"", Dani turns her back against the world because everybody she loves is dead.<br/><br/>Babette was once a sensual and vibrant woman, a Parisian, who lived the high life among artists and revolutionaries. With her lottery money, she orchestrates a grand feast for these Jutland provincials as a way of revisiting this past persona, one final time, when the world was her oyster. Babette is content to live out her days as a Puritan. Her employers' father, the minister, as it turns out, was right; ""happiness"" was an illusion.<br/><br/>The final shot in ""Midsommar"" is a close-up of Dani, smiling.<br/><br/>She is born-again.<br/><br/>A pagan."

","It is a beautiful horror movie but not an easy one. It is not meant to please the mainstream audience. It is a great movie but it demands to use your brain a lot.
You get hint all the time on what is gonna happen next, still it keeps you intense. It is full of symbolism.
There are a lot of things going on with this film. For instance, some scenes give some similarities with bees.
The uncanny feeling, the disturbing chorus, the whole feeling-idea ""they don't belong there and neither do I"" is always there haunting you. When people start to disappear, you know that this will not end good.
The greatest thing of all though, is the ending scene. That gives the whole depth of meaning to the movie in my opinion. Dani loses everything that was connecting her with her modern western culture, while she redefined herself as a part of a new family."

I almost felt like I was there with them in Sweden. There's also so many questions I have even after watching it. The ending left me disturbed.

","Since I enjoyed ""Hereditary"" a lot, I was excited about Ari Aster's new film ""Midsommar"". Gotta say... kinda disappointed. I remember hearing from someone that the ending is insane and s**t really hits the fan. Maybe that's where I set my expectations wrong, because it never really does. The film is somewhat disturbing, but it never got to me in the way that the events of ""Hereditary"" did. I really think it comes down to two things:
1. The films lenght. Not even the running time per se, just how long and dull most of it is. I'm not very scared of traditions, let alone Swedish ones, so it feels more like a trip through an ethnographic museum than a horror film.
2. The characters make some choices and react in ways that just took me out of the experience. Also dialogue in some crucial points of the film (very rarely) to me seemed stupid and unbelievable.
Biggest advantage to this film is the cinematography and set design. Both were truly beautiful and kept me interested through some boring parts. Performances are mostly fine, but Florence Pugh is top notch. Gotta love those screaming, crying faces amirite, Ari?
This was not a bad film, and I don't regret watching it, I was just a bit let down, but probably will see the next thing this director does. 6/10"

This isn't necessarily bad but it's subversive enough that if you don't pick up in that, you may be missing the point of the movie.<br/><br/>The Ugly: The movie tailspins a little towards the end.

"mikbanerjee1","9","1","6","18 April 2020"," Ari Aster Is a Legend In Making!
","My love for horror movies are deep. Especially for those deep, dark and disturbing ones. Hence My Niche for Ari Aster Directions has suddenly risen up. The way he presents horror is so unconventional yet so pleasing.<br/><br/>I loved his debut directorial 'Hereditary'. Though I hated the ending; because of how it felt unsatisfying for me considering how great the rest of the film was. This time though he improvised a lot.<br/><br/>It's beautifully shot, with some craftsmanship and innovation in cinematography. Every horror film maker should get some inspirations from. The sound score is greatly fitted alongside some creepy imagery. The tone was already set in the first few minutes. It gradually became better and better scene by scene. The shots grasped me by its sheer simplified yet haunting nature. I craved for more and more. The gorgeous locations helped in that regard too.<br/><br/>The Art direction should be applauded here cause the level is so damn high. The detailing in every scene is insanely done. Ari Aster really takes his game seriously on every aspect. And he never wants to compromise in any sort. The storyline is a twisted tale of Some Pagan Cult's Rituals, but cleverly foreshadowing an Important Character Arc. I would not discuss that cause that may ruin the experience for you. It's better to have it by yourself!
But All I can say that really got me by surprise. Cause how well these two contrary things have collaborated together and gave us a perfect outcome for both of them. The actors have done their Job with Honesty. Their commitment to the roles could easily be noticed.<br/><br/>Florence Pugh as Dani shines the brightest among them. The way she showcases her emotions/angst through only facial expressions and lesser dialogues is truly commendable. Mr. Aster surely has a great eye when it comes to finding a great actor for the lead. In some particular scenes she has shown pure brilliance.<br/><br/>Although I have few complaints in the same aspect here. Although Dani and Christian's character were greatly written. I wish the other friend characters had a tad more importance as well. That's the only Con I have.<br/><br/>Having said that, this film surely played with my mind. Even after finishing the movie; I felt an emptyness inside. A kind of unsettling vibe that made me at unease. I rarely get that feel whenever watching a film. And it surely means that it deeply affected me. And I love it when films do that. I enjoy this Deep Down my mind."

I was so disappointed but I saw it on Amazon prime to rent and I tried it again. When you go into it with an open mind watching it for what it is and looking at the subliminal messages this movie is truly beautiful one of the best I've ever seen."

"BB02","7","1","6","28 March 2020"," Ari Aster needs some serious therapy
","Like his previous movie ""Hereditary"" i'm just not as excited about this film as apparently everyone else. I love horror movies, but this isn't actually a horror movie, just like ""Hereditary"". Instead the director again only uses the ways of the genre to give us an extremely disturbing look into his mind.<br/><br/>I'm really a big fan of directors like David Lynch and David Cronenberg, i Like it when a horror movie disturbes me or challenge me or dares to be surreal and open to interpretation. In that way the movie is very interesting and effective, the missing daylight is also a very interesting and unique effect. But just like the continuously pounding music in ""Hereditary"" it doesn't really help the movie, it actually makes the shocking scenes less scary and effective.<br/><br/>In the end Aster took his personal problems, reused a lot of the same imagery as in his last film (dark rituals, unusually long shots of mutilated body's in unsettling graphic detail, a strange child, up and emotionally unrelatable characters in hopelessly lost relationships), all culminating in a variation of the same ending, combined with the end of ""The Wicker Man"". His ideas, concepts and characters are not as deep or interesting as he thinks.<br/><br/>However the movie is very well directed and Florence Plough gives a fantastic performance as always. Jack Raynor is also very good in a rather thankless role.<br/><br/>It's an interesting movie, but it goes on far too long, since you can not really invest in the characters or feel for them and the solution is not very clever, you can see it coming long before the ending. I'm sorry, but for me Ari Aster is not a master of the genre, he is just someone with a worrying interest in images of gruesome mutilated corpses."

","Midsommar's strengths are all of its technical aspects. The directing, cinematography, editing and music are all outstanding. The biggest strength of this film is Ari Aster's voice as a director and you can really feel his touch on the movie. He's a very talented director, maybe one of the best working today. This is not his strongest film.<br/><br/>The weaknesses of the movie are a) the family death setup that led nowhere. I actually think the best parts of this movie are probably before they even get to Sweden. Whatever it seemed to be setting up, was very interesting to me until they got to the cult plot. b) the plot is predictable. From the moment they get to the village, you know it's gonna be a kind of fish out of water cult horror movie. And it is. c) The characters are generic and disposable. Not even the main character has anything unique or particularly interesting about their personality. We know what ""they're going through"", but that doesn't really tell us anything about who they really are. From little we can gather, most of them seem like very unlikable people. d) The film is too long, maybe due to the opening of the film, which is great but unfortunately shouldn't have been in this movie because it has nothing to do with anything else that happens.<br/><br/>There's enough to like in Midsommar to watch it and there are enough excellent shots that will stick in my memory for a while (I think) to praise it for being what Jay Bauman called ""A slightly elevated Eli Roth movie."" I agree with Jay on this one. I will say I liked the main actress' performance, very good at conveying emotion. Also, possibly the best ""shroom simulator"" I have ever seen."

"timetopooptoday","10","1","6","25 September 2019"," You'll want to see it again...
","As usual with Ari Aster, you're going to be begging to watch this atmospheric masterpiece more than once because it's chock full of intricate foreshadowing and detailed explanations that are only clear at the end of the film that you will definitely want to experience. Similar to Hereditary, each viewing is unique due to the stealthy way these hidden gems are placed. That said, even if you're the type of person who can only watch a movie once and that's it for you, the way that Aster works his magic reminds me of a Grateful Dead concert in the respect that while you've heard the songs a hundred times, there was always something new to experience - even at the 101st concert.<br/><br/>While I'll compare Hereditary and Midsommar, they're actually nothing alike so far as plot, characters or story line. Like Aster's previous film Hereditary, Midsommar surrounds a family (of sorts) and of course, family tragedy with the incredible, genius foreshadowing that explains yet totally leads you astray but that's where the similarity ends. If you loved Hereditary for those traits as I did, then Midsommar will quickly become your favorite film.<br/><br/>A group of adult thesis-writing grad students in the middle of the Summer season of their lives who decide to travel to Sweden in the Wintertime with a common friend, an exchange student in the group named Pelle, experience things that only one could imagine coming out at night. However, the real creep factor here is that due to the location, it's broad daylight nearly 24 hours.<br/><br/>Pelle reigns from a smaller Swedish village and is excited to share his home with his new American friends. Each friend in the group has his (or her) own reasons for wanting to embark on this adventure which are all revealed during the progression of the film. The trip, which begins as a trip within itself (you'll see what I mean) slowly and methodically begins to turn darker and more sinister with each passing moment.<br/><br/>With Aster's films I'm never left feeling disappointed or asking myself obvious questions such as, ""Why didn't the characters do this or that, then?"" Or, ""Well, I guess it had to go that way because it's a movie."" Nope, there are NO negative afterthoughts. There ARE unexpected twists, and what you expect to happen doesn't, and what you anticipate happening sometimes does only to reverse your conclusion with yet a new twist. That is JUST SIMPLE, STELLAR WRITING and I've only ever experienced this with Hereditary and Midsommar. Yes, I actually bought both films because there's always something new with each viewing experience. Many viewers described this as a gore film due to the INTENSITY and realistic sense of the scenes although there were only 3 in total that I counted. That isn't a lot compared to slasher films.<br/><br/>This film will trigger you in the most primal, cerebral way and will give you nightmares for years. If you like TRUE horror then I highly recommend this."
"seige-hound","8","1","6","15 August 2019"," How to make flowers and sunlight scary
","Midsommar is a very atypical horror film, at least in presentation. The plot is not entirely unique, about outsiders stumbling into a small village run by a cult (reminiscent of other folk horror films like The Wicker Man) but the way it's filmed is incredible. Ari Aster has done something very special, mixing beauty with horror in a seamless fashion.<br/><br/>The plot goes like this, a college student named Dani suffers a massive trauma due to the sudden death of the rest of her family. The next year, her boyfriend and his friends are planning on going to a remote village in Northern Sweden to observe and study the village's strange midsummer festival. Dani wants to tag along too, wanting to escape from her life and trauma for a little while, but when they arrive, they get more than they bargained for, as the town's festivals prove to be much more strange and horrific than originally anticipated.<br/><br/>The film has a lot in common with Aster's previous film Hereditary, in that it explores themes of death, trauma and family connections, as well as the occult. However, Midsommar takes a very different angle to the concept, both in presentation and in plot. While Hereditary did have a great story, and did veer off the beaten path that is horror, it is still a fairly typical horror film in other ways, especially that film's climax, which very much fits in with more mainstream horror films like the Conjuring. Midsommar, however, avoids typical horror tropes for the most part, as the film is set almost entirely during the daylight hours (which makes sense, since in Northern Sweden, midsummer days stretch on for hours, while the nights are incredibly short), so hiding things in the dark of the night proves to be much harder when there's sunlight for most of the day. Aster solves this with the use of visual effects simulating the feeling of being on a bad drug trip, shockingly vivid portrayals of gore and death (that at the same time isn't too gratuitous like the Saw films) and the strange perplexing customs of the cult village that gives both the American main characters, and the audience, a growing sense of unease and dread.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil the ending, beyond saying that things don't go well for the tourists, but there was a certain level of ambiguity in how the story ends, similar to the ending of Hereditary. It's obvious that there's plenty of things to analyze and interpret on a rewatch, and it's a film that's ripe for Youtube channels to dig through and analyse frame by frame.<br/><br/>While I wouldn't say I liked it as much as Hereditary, Midsommar is a wholly unique horror film that deviates a little from horror norms and expectations, to create a surreal and uneasy horror experience."

","It's terrifying how potent and perfect Aster's direction is, helped of course by Pugh's standout turn. The long pre-title sequence is brilliantly done and unbearable, and this description applies throughout, as heartwrenching music, creative camerawork, and a beautiful aesthetic decorate the disgusting horrors, which regrettably get grossly self-indulgent in the second half as the intriguing story arcs (Dani's grief, the strained relationship, the thesis drama) fade into the background.

","Can't decide what to think of Midsommar. I definitely didn't like it as much as Hereditary, but there were things to appreciate in it that made it stand out for your usual Horror movie. It relies on building a slow creepy, unsettling atmosphere with these new group of people living with cultists on a day to day basis doing bizarre and unusual things in broad daylight. There's not really any scares per se and the gore/violence is there but sporadically placed. People went in my cinema expecting big things to happen constantly and ended up disappointed with it. I kind of liked the slow pacing of this movie, but I guess my biggest issue with it is not really caring much about the main characters. They didn't have much of a personality to me and I wished there was more to them. There were also weird elements of Comedy in there and it wasn't always obvious if it was funny or not, outside of one guy being Comic Relief.<br/><br/>Probably no surprises coming from the director's previous movie Hereditary that Midsommar is beautifully shot with alot of artistic merit and themes scattered throughout the film's running time. I also noticed many similarities with The Wicker Man while I was watching, but at times this movie felt a bit aimless and meandering in places. It did feel quite bit predictable in where it goes with the plot, and the ending I saw coming a mile away and was hoping for something better than what we got. Despite that, the acting is solid and the music is good, as well as the production side of things. Overall, this is most likely going to be a very polarizing movie. Some will love the artsy side of the Horror, where as others will find it boring and self-indulgent. I can definitely see Midsommar being an improvement on a second watch too, as there's detail to catch in the background that could be missed on first watch.<br/><br/>6/10"

Ultimately though, the film falls short to a slow-moving and fairly simplistic narrative, that spans over a largely excessive run time. I would recommend this film to those who are fans of the artistic and moody side of the psychological horror genre, who can also forgive the elongated runtime and the dismal, contemplative pace. 'Midsommar' scores a 7/10."

","""Midsommar"" mostly takes place in Sweden, but at its core is a particularly American sense of horror film. It is a movie about suicide, mercy killings, insanity, graphic nudity, religious hysteria, and the kind of grotesque imagery that exists for no other reason than shock value. While doesn't hit the highs of Ari Aster's previous film, it is still a good one. ""Midsommar"" is a dark horror (though shot in bright sunlight), full of disturbing images that will follow you home and possibly inhabit your nightmares. The film highlights all that there is to be afraid of in broad daylight and the director pushes the limits of the medium in almost every way, and the results are stunning. A must-see horror film."

","I didn't see Heredity from Ari Aster but I definitely will. I saw Midsommar 2 days ago and I'm still shocked, still with the atmosphere in my head, it's really bewitching.<br/><br/>We follow a group of american friends going to a festival in Sweden. The music is very harsh, tense, you can tell it's not gonna end well. Even before the trip, the setup is very dark because Dani's sister has suicidal tendencies.<br/><br/>And then it really begins. The trip is thrown away is a few shots, because it's about the festival.<br/><br/>Dani and her friends are welcomed by a community of maybe 100 people. They seem kind even though a bit weird, and I don't really understand how these young people could be interested in a traditional, local festival, but anyway. Some of the friends have actually related studies about anthropology, so I guess it all starts from here.<br/><br/>Quickly, a lot of unsettling things happen, and Dani and his friends feel more and more insecure. These locals culture is odd, to say the least. Quite shocking actually. Do NOT bring your children.
This cultural differences bring a really good reflexion about what is good and evil. It's not just about a bunch of weird people, we could actually learn some things from them.
Dani, even with the strange coutumes, starts to feel integrated to the locals, while his friends are freaking out (and they should). It's hard to see what's wrong and what's right. Ari Aster makes a perfect job at muddying the waters.<br/><br/>All I say sounds like a basic horror movie but it's not. The atmosphere is perfectly conceived, it's deep and captivating. I didn't even feel the 2 hours and a half. But it is really mentally exhausting, maybe like Funny games or Clockwork Orange.<br/><br/>The narrative progression, the tension is so well-rythmed it's a surreal experience.<br/><br/>Everything is beautiful. Even when horrible things happen, it's just shot perfectly, with perfect colors, and clever details ( some of the friends take drugs and sometimes you see subtle changes in the shots, in the background). The costumes, the dances, the architecture, the symbols and runes...they put a lot of work in details and creating this universe.<br/><br/>The actors are amazing, regarding the tough scenes they have to realize. Dani is a nice discovery for me.<br/><br/>It's impossible to describe really (without spoilers), but I loved it and I recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind some graphic violence. (a few shots)"

","If you're over 30, and were ever in a long relationship or two, this film will likely resonate with you. I have been on both sides, being the distant boyfriend as well as being emotionally destroyed by a girlfriend. So, I can relate to both sides of this amazing break up film, and it made the experience very personal on many levels.
Second, if you have ever had to endure a rough untimely death in the family, or been abandoned by your family in any way having trouble dealing, you will likely find catharsis in this movie.
Third, if you have ever enjoyed taking psychedelics, especially in the woods and/or at a festival, this film is must see for you.
Forth, if you can appreciate a movie that honors a Kubrickian style cinematography, as well as liking dark comedy, this movie will impress you thoroughly.

Even though it may sound funny (the director intended it to be a black comedy), it was really disturbing and horrifying. If you watch some scene individually it may seem kinda hilarious to you but the movie as a whole is just vigorously unsettling. The harrowing cinematography, the beautiful scores and Aster's attention to details made this movie a total masterpiece. Everything about the venue and the ambient was just pitch perfect.

","I found this film very interesting and very artistic.
I went in cold, not knowing anything except that it was a Swedish horror film. I was surprised that it is actually more ""International"" than properly Swedish. Although I am not an expert, I have the feeling that the religion portrayed in the film is entirely fictional, and serves as a device for the horror element rather than an exploration of pagan/Norse culture.<br/><br/>The film is brilliant visually. There is a mastery of shot composition and colors that make watching this film (almost) an enjoyable thing. There are a lot of very clever visual tricks that are used to reinforce and convey ideas of the plot that I liked very much. On the same note the costumes are genius because not only the characters stand out in any given scene; it also emphasizes the fact that they are foreign and that they are being watched at all times.<br/><br/>There are multiple great scenes when characters take drugs. The images start slowly, almost unnoticeably, to alter and change, and it gives you a sense of unease at first. And all of a sudden you realize that someone is full-on tripping and the images are completely out of whack. Flowers start moving, the colors change. That was well-done, it parallels the effect of drugs in real life and it was stylistically cool, with flowers/nature coming to life being also thematically linked to the story.<br/><br/>There is nothing much to say negatively about this movie. My only regret is that the movie is straight-up horror. There is no intent to hide it or to put you in a false sense of security. I wished the movie took more time to set up the religious or cultural aspects of the commune. The commune comes across a bit too cartoonish and the foreshadowing is very thick in my opinion. The film is not as subtle narratively as it is visually. I can easily imagine why in Sweden they took it as dark comedy instead of horror because the movie is (too?) open about it. You instantly understand the nefariousness and the evil of the commune; there is little/no mystery.<br/><br/>It also reflects on the characters. The actors and situations are great; the characters not so much. The characters are not very likable or really fleshed out sufficiently for me to emphasize with them. The third act of the movie pits the two main characters against each other? It did not make a lot of sense to me. The main couple did not work for me, they kind of hate each other and are selfish in their own way. They are not ""good"" people therefore they almost deserve each other. The stakes of the couple being together or falling apart were not strong enough. But it becomes the wedge of the movie, more than the death of the parents which would have been a bit more interesting.
In other words the emotional core of the movie did not touch me as much as it wanted to.<br/><br/>But it hardly matters. The strength of the movie is the visuals. And in that regard it is exceptional."

"anders-080582","9","1","8","23 August 2019"," LET THE SUN-SHINE
","Last night I finally had the chance to see Midsommar, Ari Aster's new horror. I saw it in Sweden, my home country, where the movie is in theatres. Whereas Hereditary's gloomy and unsettling atmosphere was dominated by darkness and nocturnal moments, in spite of some scenes shot in the daylight, Midsommar takes us into a sinister realm where the hallmarks are the brightness of white color and the light of the midnight sun in the northern hemisphere. A brightness which is the frame of a plot that is developed on the traditions linked to the summer solstice. An unsettling light which almost feels artificial, Luciferian. As seen in Hereditary, major themes have been preserved, such as the impact that the family tree and the bloodline have on a person's life, including the apparently coincidental consequences arising from it. Again, there is a family tragedy with the haunting ghost of mental disease, a family tragically marked by a devastating loss. Another recurring key element is the satanic power of manipulation and brainwashing: the concept of gaslighting in Midsommar is ubiquitous. Once again, we find a woman playing a pivotal role: like in the matriarchal Hereditary, it's a female character who eventually will come to pull the very strings. In Midsommar, the female character symbolizes Mother Earth, a primordial Gaia, a ""Persephonized"" Lilith: it's Proserpina who comes back to the surface from the bowels of the earth, bringing back the resilient and fruitful sunny season. Maya who tears the veil of darkness bringing back light and life. The male character is instead an allegory of a pseudo-anointed (the name itself, opposed to ""Dani"", which in Hebrew means ""Thus God has judged""), the ""ichtys"", yet with a cursed dark side; he's a man facing his own destiny to make atonement for ""the negative emotions"" narrated in the book of runes, energies opposing to light which are to be confined within the darkness of the underworld, in order to reach catharsis. The beginning of the movie wraps viewers in snowy darkness: it is the early phase of a descent, an initiatory journey, ultimately leading to enlightenment. It is a metaphor of the psychological evolution the protagonist, a psychology student, goes through; a character who struggles with her own emotional darkness made even darker by the fact Hades/Pluto claims her there in the underworld (the toxic relationship). The crops, the flowers, the nature and the fruits we see in the movie are a constant, just like various rituals and the orgiastic rites, featuring even more nudity than what we saw in Hereditary. Midsommar swings from a half-jokingly atmosphere to the utmost sternness, all while maintaining a horrifying and grotesque tragicomic tone. There's plenty of symbolism in this movie, symbols which Ari Aster have at this fingertips: he handles all these elements skillfully and meticulously, something which entails there is a thorough study behind: Ceres/Demeter, Bacchus, the Eleusinian Mysteries, fertility cults, maenadism and orphism as well as astrological and numerological references (number 9, 72 and 9 to quote a few of those) are revisited in a Norse-pagan spirit. The landscape of HÃ¤lsingland has been recreated by using the woody meadows south of Budapest. The final result is however pretty accurate, since Swedish is actually largely spoken throughout the whole film, there is even a major reconstruction of a still unidentified pseudo-Norse dialect (considering how it sounds, it might be the Elfdalian language but it could also be a crafty artifice). It is though sad to see that Sweden somehow is subliminally presented as a country where suicide is basically an everyday occurrence (this is only partly true). Midsommar lacks the heaviness and the overwhelmingly haunting atmosphere Hereditary featured, which instead have been abundantly replaced by the aforementioned comic-grotesque moments of diversion.
The music is a lyric-coral element which once again contributes to create an evocative and ceremonial atmosphere. Another constant which is recurring even in Midsommar is the symbolism the pyramid and the triangle encompass, something we have also seen in Hereditary. It is the initiatory ascension one has to embark upon in order to fulfill the plan and complete the journey, reaching the purpose, thus celebrating the ritual in the designated temple. Witchcraft, curses and the magic crafts, which unlike Hereditary, occur in terms of Wiccan filters, infusions, psychotropics and hallucinogens, are another cornerstone Ari Aster holds dear. Runes, unlike what most recent studies claim and the consensus anthropologists and philologists have come to, are given anew a strong magic meaning in the collective imagination. An attempt to relaunch Sweden had already been made with the remarkable and Blair Witch Project- evoking ""The Ritual"", which also takes place in the North of this Scandinavian country. Midsommar makes another attempt to focus attention on the ""Ikealand"", though enhancing the whole to higher levels imbued with syncretism, mythological elements, symbols and mysteries. Much emphasis is put on the lifecycle-theme, with Mother Earth claiming back what is hers, where everything must be held in a cyclic and perpetual balance in the big cosmic circle, in this panta rei where everything flows and returns in reconciliation with eternity. Ari Aster with meticulous elegance masterfully revises multiple themes which further broaden the archetype of the Wicker Man. As much as I adored Hereditary (a movie that you either love or hate, according to what many other people expressed; personally I found it brilliant), Midsommar adds something new to the whole concept: it's a broader work, which similarly to Hereditary bids its sweet time before reaching its acme, but which undoubtedly doesn't leave the viewers indifferent, once the pace unravels from its initially apparent slow rhythm. The final result is extremely disturbing, unsettling, grotesque, evocative and sinisterly bright: in conclusion, sun worship came back to shine. It seems like Ari Aster in the near future is going to embrace the path of comedy, as he finds the genre enjoyable and entertaining. As for the horror though, just to quote another tipically midsommar-feature which is by the way quite familiar to Swedes, the director in my opinion really did make ""Bingo!"""

","A different experience, although with the pace that movies have been taking recently, it seems that the rarer, the better, and so, no, not always.<br/><br/>Midsommar is unique, without a doubt; with a pagan atmosphere and a slow but burning narrative, the film manages to hold steady and steady as a large repertoire of intriguing and ambiguous scenes, but at the same time, it stretches/ lengthens these scenes too much and it can feel like we are watching a rather dramatic documentary or a kind of compilation of rituals that we don't understand (or even comprehend).<br/><br/>The film has a wonderful camera work, showing us quite brutal scenes and at the same time stylizing effects and filters that give it a unique, repulsive and fresh touch. Quite fresh, is here one of the factors where the film stands out, being made in its entirety during the day and in a beautiful green field, although as I stand out in that, also stands out in not giving fear, and to be a film of such genre, because honestly it was quite the opposite. The story, if there is one, leads nowhere and the characters are too dull and one moment they are there and the next they are not; in other words, their importance is really irrelevant.<br/><br/>Quite long, too long for something that could have been accomplished in less time; but with well-designed scenes and incredible montages, the film manages to entertain, even if it is like a documentary about a pagan culture. As a recommendation, see the theatrical version, DC is too much."

"fervidhead","8","1","10","7 June 2020"," Ari Aster rolls a few risky dices on ""Midsommar"" which seems to work out for him very well.
","""Midsommar"" is, without a doubt, a bold move ahead in terms of horror movies despite the director/writer Ari Aster presenting it to be more of a terrifying fairy tale than a horror movie. With visually pleasing scenes and brightness toned to its utmost colors, darkness is no longer the only medium of fear.
Its lengthy runtime of 148 minutes holds it tight by appealing the audience visually if not emotionally. The movie makes it clear that the pleasing smile plastered across its face hides terror beyond its facade. The risks that went into the making of the film cannot go unbothered. The aesthetic of it is very pleasing and the cinematography spells out to be masterful but the frames seem to be hanging on the whitest scale of the color palate. Had it been any brighter, it would've simply been unwatchable. The film walks that bare line and survives the fall with astounding outcomes.
It can be very hard to buy into the customs of a cult but ""Midsommar"" explains the conditions that would lead one to join them, fully accepting their norms. Ari Aster, who expects his scenes to be dark-humored, is benefited whether the audience is terrified by his presentation or is merely giggling at it. With every other hideous ritual Dani, the protagonist, settles down to participate with the members of the cult, she can be felt distancing away from her past and growing nascent roots in a new place that she might learn to call home. Death plays a vital role throughout the film and with every other death that Dani witnesses, she seems to cope with it differently. The atrocious echoes of the villagers mimicking cries sympathize and spread out the pain, the unsettling sacrifices made; all help the film sharpen its ends in the field of discomfort. The movements of the camera imitating the pleasing moves of all dancing trick us into believing that we might just be one of them. But it is not more than a distraction from the elaborate allurement that ""Midsommar"" is.
Florence Pugh's daunting cries do nothing but elevate the aesthetic of the entire film. It is clear to see that the Pugh carries the weight with ease. Not only does ""Midsommar"" come with a killer cast but also a killer score. Composer Bobby Krlic seems to be providing the film what it needs the most, a spectacular, dramatic score. Scenes, where the cries are submerged into his score, seem to engage the viewers better.
Like it or not, ""Midsommar"" is a trip one cannot return from. For long the images that haunted us had been stuck in the darkness or filtered but ""Midsommar brings it out bright and lets it blind our eyes. Walking the borderlines of being looked away from, it is a calamity captivating your eyes just to poke it when the time comes. It is just another A24 high point."

","I was NOT ready for this. Not after months of streaming (expletive deleted - Last-Jedi-like, expletive deleted) quote-content-unquote.<br/><br/>My VHS collection numbered over 5.000 titles (long gone), yet I still hang on to all my VCDs. I am not young, neither am I (very) old. Bought my first CED last week, yet my first Laserdisc in the 90's.

And as a self-identified millennial you feel no need to Google any of what you don't get? Great! Please leave and do not watch the reviewed film! You will be bored, give it a 1/10, and then go off to make your next TikTok video :-(((<br/><br/>Did you go back all the way on the ""HighSeas""-Bay to download Lars von Trier's early-/ student-films? OMG! THIS is for YOU! But even David Cronenberg fans that can stand slow pacing will love this!<br/><br/>Now, having only seen the second film from this writer-director this very evening ('Hereditary,' a far more common horror-film, though still exceptional), I do not feel I have the right to comment on his work in a general sense. And I do not feel, having watched the film only once, authorized to comment on this work in any broad sense. I lack degrees in anthropology and psychiatry.<br/><br/>I do however have field experience in psychology, a minor degree in (cinema-) photography and I am what Christians call a ""witch"". I am a high-priest of the old religion.<br/><br/>The old faith was a nature religion that was widespread in the region now called the West (Northern-Europe to Portugal, Ireland to the Crimea) from ca. 20.000 years ago until the introduction of the Eastern religions (Judaism, Christianity, Mohammedanism/ Islam) into mainland Europe starting ca. 2.000 years ago. It was the main religion (in various forms) among the Celtic people as well as the early Germanic people. It was also the start of all early modern religions. The true story is broader, with the Catholic church branding followers of the old faith as heretics and witches (late mid-eval period). While the religion was polytheistic, a God was depicted alongside the main Goddess. In modern Christian religion the mother Goddess was turned into the minor ""Goddess"" Maria. However, in the main religion, the main Goddess was female (moon), while the God (sun) served her to inseminate nature with his fertility.<br/><br/>This explanation of the old faith is simplified. As a male I should not be the leader of our circle. I am not good at it, and fear our faith will diminish.<br/><br/>The old faith is observed today in various forms by Pagans (a Catholic term, mainly Europa), Druids (mainly U.K.) and Wiccans (mainly U.S.). ""Witch"" or ""Hex"" is accepted by some as a badge of honor, rejected by some as a derogatory term (similar to the N-word).<br/><br/>Now, the reason why I posted this ""review"" was mostly in response to another review (giving this movie 2/10). Is essence saying ""In don't get this, I am from Sweden"". My reply is - no, you don't get this, being from Sweden matters not. This could taken place in Poland or Spain. Your country is just known to be one of the last places to have surrendered to the new religions (and yes, we are talking the -mere spec in human history of- 1000 to 500 years). So your country is a logical setting for this film. My country (Holland) was a swamp 1000 years ago, so not a logical setting. Living a modern life, worrying where your next paycheck is coming from, this means nothing to you? If some part of your life however, is in harmony with nature, say ""hey, it's spring, yet where is the rain, my lawn is turning brown"" - you will have some understanding.<br/><br/>Saying ""A Horror-film with Inga and Helga from Sweden - with lots of nudity"" will generate income. And no, if that is what you came for, you may not sleep trough the film... or wake up after, say an hour... Wrong feature!<br/><br/>I'm not sure what genre this is, if you like horror, go ahead. If you're attracted by the premises, but don't like this movie? Watch ""Hostel"" instead! I love that too, but if you like that, and didn't like this? Please come back and rate this in 2040?<br/><br/>But, and ""oh, dear"", in the title I promised; ""and correct from a high-priest's view""... Yes. Well, from a Paga-Wicccan point of view (what I usually call myself), it's all complete nonsense. Even the number of spokes in the wheel of the year is off. While the sun-moon thing is referenced, it's very watered down. Like selecting ""pick-n'mix"" based on the color brown (may I suggest fresh seasonal forest fruit instead ;-). Jumping off of a cliff however, in a paga-wiccan commune? At that age? Actually living that life? Not my modern western one? Note that the girl at the end (okay - small spoiler) is smiling?<br/><br/>The movie tries to warn you: start with some mind-altering mushrooms?"

You have a family death and/or tragedy? Deal with those emotions. This is a movie about a woman who cannot handle brushing anything else under, and finally is given an outlet to let it all out. Acceptance greets her in the form of eerie contests and rituals that culminate in her own rebirth of no longer needing to be burdened with trivial eventually meaningless compromise. As many ""oh, come on"" moments as there are, understand the situation in a foreign country; you are overly polite, trying not to smash customs of something you went out of your way to attend.

For those looking for Horror (aka slasher horror, this is not what you want). Every time I watch this, I like it more and more. It's like watching a slow burning fire roar through the wilderness- you KNOW the main characters are most likely in imminent danger but you really could never guess how or what will occur. You know more messed up stuff is coming and you just keep watching on the edge of your seat. I don't really understand why some of the deaths are so torturous and violent if this Midsummer festival is meant as a celebration of life but... Maybe I'm just dense. Once they occur though it's like the community then beautifies the death as if to cleanse the act of straight up murder. There are a whole bunch of times I would've noped out of there so fast though.
Also agree- the acting and cinematography were brilliant. But I do wish Francis pugh's character wasn't portrayed so pathetically. Like she just gave up and gave in. Oh well, I'm not the director.<br/><br/>To all the Swedes who've commented on the lack of reality here.... we know this isn't an accurate depiction of your culture, as much as, half naked teenagers running into each other and away from a masked man with a chain saw through the woods, is a reflection of the US.

","Usually, I don't have the patience for the new wave of ""elevated-horror"" films, like Hereditary, or The Witch. While I can understand the art, I prefer the more old-fashioned slasher or haunted house story. However, Midsommar weaves both together quite nicely. There's more than enough excitement to keep gorehounds and casual viewers interested, but if you're more inclined to watching an art film, there's enough layers for you there as well. Unlike most older horrors, the characters are well fleshed out and I'm actually interested in the subplots about relationships and the thesis. For a horror, managing to be smart, interesting, deep, and still scary is a hard tightrope act to achieve, and Midsommar is one of the few films of the new horror subgenre to do it."

"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","2","20 June 2020"," Pretty strange film, but this is exactly what made it worth watching
","After about five very prolific years of making short films, writer and director Ari Aster made his first full feature film not too long ago and ""Hereditary"" was a huge success. Now here we have his second full feature movie and while the first had major supernatural horror elements, this one here does not. Or well, it does in the minds of many characters and their deeds to serve their highers, but this is of course just theoretical. It is a horror film, however, there is no denying. Even when we are not yet in Sweden, the circumstances of the female protagonist's sister's death are as dubious as it gets and there is also a shockingly graphic image of that. But the vast majority of the film is set in Sweden, so it should be no surprise to anybody that this is a Swedish co-production and that there are many Swedish cast members, especially with this title. It's probably most effective to watch this film on a really hot summer day outside, but I only got half of that last night when I watched it as my second post-Corona movie at a(n outdoor) cinema. The weather was not so nice the way it was a few days earlier. But it's alright. By the way, this is a really, really long film at almost 2.5 hours and the one big name attached to this project is Florence Pugh. Well, the biggest name I should say. 2019 was an amazing year for her scoring her first Oscar nomination for ""Little Women"" and actually I am a bit surprised to see her in this film here. I would have imagined Alicia Vikander or so. Anyway, I think she does a fine job and she is also pretty stunning fur sure. I am growing into a bit of a fan I think. Also really liked her on ""Little Women"" and she was maybe the best thing there. But back to this film. The only other cast member I am familiar with here is Will Poulter and he is always easy to identify. I remember him very well from Bigelow's ""Detroit"" and he was amazing there, so I hope his career will rise in the coming years. His character here feels almost a bit too small given the actor's talent. He is mostly in it for comedic reasons. Be it his comments when everybody is stoned, how he regrets having missed some of the action, how he is delighted to be led away by the Swedish girl (while he has no clue what's waiting for him) or of course how he pees against that ancient tree trunk. His normal simple man character you could say went very much against conventions, especially in that secret society there. He was a riot at times. I must say nonetheless that I had no clue what eventually happened to him. It was him smacking down the Black dude when the latter went for the bible right? Was he also under some special drug? He was alive still in any case. Well, somewhat alive. These drugs are a big thing in this movie and the joints the group is smoking early on are definitely as harmless as it gets with what else is waiting for them later on. Just take a look at the protagonist's boyfriend near the end and the drink he is offered and reluctantly drinks and then this sex orgy starts. Now that was maybe the most bizarre moment of the entire movie. Not the act per se as you could see that coming with how the ginger girl is mentioned several times (although I did not think that it could be her pube there), but all the other women in this specific scene and how they interact with the girl (the weird singing next to her head) and also how the old lady slaps the dude's butt. What the heck? And of course, how ginger girl says right away she can feel the baby. So yeah, like I said it's all the awkward, bizarre and weird elements from this movie that turn it into something slightly fascinating. Not always fascinating as you can see from my rating.<br/><br/>Another example would be the comment about how all the tribe's (let's call them that) oracles are the result of inbreeding. Very messed up. This specific scene shows nonetheless that while they try to seem harmless to others, it is all part of a plan. At the exact same time, we have a member of the tribe tell the American characters that there is no coordinated big-scale inbreeding. So things are clearly not even close to what they seem here. It reminded me a bit of ""Get Out"" in terms of the overall scenario. And the characters here sure needed to get out as well. Also how two characters have the intention to write their thesis on this tribe and the elders reluctantly agree under certain conditions, but they only did so to keep the guys there because they knew they will probably never get out to release their thesis or tell anybody about this tribe. As for Christian (played by Jack Reynor), Pugh's character's boyfriend, I always somehow felt he could also be in on the entire project that there is something evil going on, especially how he reacted to the double suicide ritual (man, some nasty shots there from Aster, definitely nothing for young audiences), but looking at what happened to him at the end, he probably wasn't in at all. The only one really in on everything was the Swedish buddy who led them there and his talking to Pugh's character especially already implied that maybe he appreciated her more than he should have. It's alright though. I still wonder why. I mean he could not know that she would become the new May Queen. Probably he was just very keen on having outsiders there, so the tribe can do with them whatever they want. Okay, what else can I say about this movie. It is horrifying at times, funny during other sequences, very dark humor, but maybe the area where it delivers the most is the visual side. The costumes (especially the queen's massive flower dress we see at the end, she basically becomes a flower herself) are as spectacular as the cinematography and you could feel the burning light and heat very well through the screen here, almost like a knife cutting through and blinding you if we go with metaphors. This was very well done. And of course the make-up and sets as well. Nothing wrong there at all. So the only aspect where it did come a bit short (just a bit, not too much) is the script. I think they could have cut 30-45 minutes here and it still would have been a decent film for sure, even if it definitely did not drag too much. But there are scenes and sequences that feel like filler material. As I am approaching the end of my review, I also want to talk about the end of the movie, especially the scene when Pugh's character is really having her meltdown and the others there are screaming with her, basically following their new queen. Joining in with her. I also felt somehow that maybe she could get sacrificed, but she did not. She will have to wait till she gets 72 for that I suppose. Long way to go. That cut-throat gesture when the Swedish buddy was asked was also pretty good, pretty creepy too. And with Pugh in the end, her smile somewhat implied that her sanity was gone now too completely, even if the fact that she agreed that her boyfriend should be killed still felt more like an act of mercy than an act of cruelty or insanity with what they had done to him. This killing scene also explains the bear we see early on and that one was also very random and, as a consequence, very comedic. So yeah, I think I am in the minority here, but I liked this film more than ""Hereditary"", so this shows you that I am not as much of a fan when it comes to the latter as everybody else. I am still curious what Aster has coming up next. And in the future. The talent is undeniable. I hope he can continue this positive trend and make more good films. This one here is by no means perfect, but I give it a thumbs-up and positive recommendation. Never in doubt, but like I said: Don't watch it with kids or people who can't deal with graphic violence."

","There are 2,502 reviews of this movie so I'll keep it basic. The Director here also did Hereditary (2018). That was a very creepy ghosty movie with very frightening slashes, so to speak. By the end it was both creepy and borderline bizarre, and truly frightening, with all up against an insidious, evil and almost unstoppable power. Top notch modern horror, in other words. Midsommar has the shock slashes, but you have to wait an hour for them. Neither movie is deeply original in its story, but certainly the style is original to the Director, and I began to notice that notably in the last 45 minutes or so of Midsommar, which was certainly tense. Midsommar is an excellent horror movie. It's not as frightening or as shocking as Hereditary. With Hereditary you couldn't see around the corner what was coming up. In Midsommar you can, but it's done really well. It's the same basic premise as The Wicker Man, but the story is not the same, and it's a different style, different vision. I had to dock it a point or two for the length (over two hours) and the fact that it gave the lead character a serious backstory, which was, to me, lazy writing. It meant that aspects of the story were obliged to be related to a prior tragedy, aspects not really related to what was actually happening. Midsommar differs from The Wicker Man in this regard too. I thought that significant and a mistake, but it does make good drama. It was just a bit too 'extra' for me, and extra, for me, implies pushing believability. It's a debatable and minor point. Midsommar is easily a decent 8 stars. Thankyou if you actually read my review."

I am of course referring to 2017's 'The Ritual' which pitted guileless tourists against an ancient power they have no chance of grasping. A part of me wonders if there is an agenda against the lore of ancient Europe and then I realise, yes, of course. The church tortured it to the point of cultural memory so it is perhaps fitting paganism is the subject of modern horror.<br/><br/>If you liked 'Hereditary' you will like this. But I reckon this will be too weird, too highbrow in a way for the common audience. I am certainly looking forward to the next Ari Aster project as he is proving to be an evocative, deeply rooted director."

","I sat through the last hour of the movie with my eyes bugging out of my head and my jaw on the floor. All I could keep saying is ""What the fuuuddggge???""<br/><br/>It's crazy from the get go. WARNING The initial part can be very overwhelming for someone with a fragile mental state.<br/><br/>The acting is great. The directing is great. Scenery is on point and beautiful. The story itself is wicked, repulsive and gut wrenching. It's a terrible movie but in an oddly good way. Everything that happens just gets worse and worse through the movie. Like horrifying worse. Not the acting or story itself. Just the things happening. It's a serious mindf*ck. The movie is very slow but I feel like they can't take too much off and still keep the same feel. Maybe take 30 minutes out. But every scene has importance. It's a slow build with many hills before the ultimate climax.<br/><br/>I don't see how people think it's that predictable. It has some parts you can predict but in the end, you were only half right. It does keep you guessing. It definitely deserves better than a 1. The main actress did such an amazing job and you can feel every emotion she feels. I'll def have to watch more of her movies.<br/><br/>It is also pretty gruesome and very, ""open"" in other ways. There's nudity. There's sex. There's a lot of weird stuff. There's also death- quite a bit. Some cussing. Disturbing and very graphic. I'm still trying to wrap my head around it. I actually had to go play some video games with shooting and bloody bodies flying just to get some of the images out of my head.<br/><br/>I'd recommend it. Watch it if you have extra time and want to be shocked. Don't read much into the plot or reviews and go in blindly like I did. And don't go to Sweden."

","My initial review for Midsommar put it at a 6.5/10 with a note that I liked it but hoped to not have to see it again. But I did. And I changed my mind.<br/><br/>Midsommar is a beautifully shot, expertly directed and flawlessly acted film. The cinematography is nothing short of gorgeous, telling a story steeped in horror that takes place in broad daylight. The tension works perfectly, the score is solely responsible for some of the most intense moments of the film, and, despite being a slow burn, it's entertaining from start to finish. Ari Aster knows how to grab your attention and hold you in that place, and he pulls it off expertly in both Midsommar and Hereditary, although I do prefer this film, if only slightly more.<br/><br/>This is not an easy movie to pull off and, were it not for Aster's stellar leading lady, this movie wouldn't have been as impactful, entertaining and thrilling as it ended up being. Her devotion to the character and willingness to go through the entire range of human emotions required are nothing short of brilliance. The rest of the cast, including the extras, are all incredible, however, and this is a film to truly be proud of.<br/><br/>Ari Aster is a breath of fresh air for horror. He's got his own unique style that's fun and intelligent simultaneously with carefully crafted creations that tap into some intense emotions. I'm excited to see where he goes from here."
"andrewcaniglia","9","0","11","17 May 2020"," Ari Aster is a genius... but he keeps making the same movie
","Midsommar is an incredible film. What an idea to make a horror film where 90% of it takes place in perpetual daylight. The fact that this perpetual daylight is so creepy completely blows away presupposed ideas of what horror can be, and what a horror film can do.<br/><br/>I loved the story and most of its characters. There was so much life-like nuance to how the characters' interacted with other, even if some of them could be quite one dimensional. Specifically, Christian is a character that one can really imagine meeting somewhere, but not particularly liking. It is this ability to create unlikeable characters that partially explains Aster's effectiveness at making horror.<br/><br/>All of the films I have seen from him: Hereditary, Midsommar, and to a degree The Trouble With The Johnsons, follow a similar narrative pattern. All of these narratives deal with horrifying death(s), unbearable grief, dramatic irony, and transformation. This is a pretty good recipe, but the fact that it exists really takes away the impact for me. For instance, there is a scene somewhat early in the film that I am sure would be absolutely horrifying to people that haven't just seen Hereditary the day before, but which I kind of shrugged off. Maybe it's just because I'm a huge horror fan, but, in that moment, I had to really search myself for empathy for the characters who witnessed this act, who I imagine had to have been horrified in a way few people ever are. Yeah, it was sudden, it was gruesome, but there was something so plain about it that made me completely unaffected.<br/><br/>That's another problem with this movie. There's so much ridiculousness in the film that it seems like Aster is really trying to up the ante for its own sake. Unflinching macabre and insanity is part of what made Hereditary such an effective film, but after a certain point it's just a distraction.<br/><br/>However, the film does up the ante in a way that is meaningful. Even though it is so long, it doesn't drag. It's rare for a horror film to have so many characters but still be so effective. It's unheard of for a movie to take place mostly in the sunlight. It is unheard of to make that creepy in and of itself. If I hadn't of just seen Hereditary, I might have given this a 10."

","I watched this movie yesterday because it was available on Amazon Prime and because I liked director Ari Aster's last movie *Hereditary*; however, I came away here disappointed. It's not that the movie isn't gorgeous -- the eye-popping colors everywhere of the landscape of Sweden (or is it Hungary?) alongside the traditional garb of the cult contrasting with the soundtrack and unfolding events is beautiful to behold -- and the soundtrack isn't beautiful, it's that it's all been done before -- by Aster himself nonetheless -- in *Hereditary*. The same upside-down camera view as the characters enter HÃ¤lsingland, the same playful shimmering light on the face of the actress, and the same droning music all through the movie keeping the viewer on edge. And it was done much better in *Hereditary*, partly because of the superb acting, especially by Toni Collette. Here unfortunately the acting is best described as bland which makes it hard to identify with the one-dimensional characters: they come off as apathetic, uninteresting, and unsympathetic. This makes it hard to judge whether they have been acting under the influence of the psilocybin mushrooms the whole time they're in Sweden or whether they are just blissfully ignorant tourists (some reviewers argue that this is a commentary on privileged, culturally unaware American tourists but it is hard to really tell). It is hard for me to believe that the characters did not feel a sense of alarm at their disappearing comrades or a sense of dread at the events unfolding around them and their evermore aloof and taciturn host. What was even worse for me was the fact that I could foretell the plot from the moment the troop arrived at their destination and could see what Aster was trying to do while he was doing it, something that ruined the illusion for me. For example, during the Maypole dance it dawned on me that the director was trying to make us feel as if we are under the influence of the mushrooms and participating in the dance. I then went back in my mind throughout the whole movie to see whether this was the director's intention all along and couldn't. It felt tacked on. If the viewer did not see through the plot though, then there were hints peppered throughout to help along: the tapestry that foreshadowed a main event, the drawings on the walls, and even the part of the dialogue that went something like: ""May I photograph your secret book?"" ""No!"". Guess what happens next. If the director bothered to develop any of the characters, then this would've been thoroughly enjoyable movie where the events made much more sense and had a deeper impact on the viewer and Dani's revenge in the end much more poignant. The way it stands though, it is a beautiful journey through an isolated piece of land inhabited by a cult that performs a certain ritual every 90 years, much to the detriment of its unsuspecting outsiders who may or may not have deserved their fate (oh yes, also some body horror and sex is thrown in for good measure)."
"jayjaycee","6","0","5","10 April 2020"," Overhyped and way too slow
","""Midsommar"" is a 2019 horror thriller directed by Ari Aster starring Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor. The film company A24 has released a few hidden gems in the recent years and is becoming more and more popular as an independent film studio. Many of them even have come cult classics at times. While I've seen only a handful of them (""The Killing Of A Sacred Deer"", ""Ex Machina"", ""Locke"" to name a few) there are countless other titles that still have my curiosity. Two of them are the features by promising novice film maker Ari Aster. Judging by what I've heard about them from several people they both have to be secret masterpieces. While I'm not yet able to judge it in the case of the director's directorial debut (it's up high on my watchlist!) I can tell that this film here ... is not. Yeah, you read correctly. As I said, my expectations were lifted extremely high after hearing it's supposed to be great, many even stating it's the new ""The Wicker Man"" (no opportunity to compare there, too), but it simple isn't. Back then I've seen the trailer for this film and thought I would be in for some grotesque psychological thriller that would haunt me days after the credits have rolled. The only feeling that still accompanies me is confusion, as I still try to figure out where the extreme hype results from. Before we get to this, let's start with something positive: Florence Pugh. Not only is she one of my favourite actors since I've seen here outstanding performance in ""Little Women"" she's also showing her extreme talent in here. She's one of the most promising newcomers and once again proves why and additionally, she's such a beauty to look at as well. The most important thing though is how he conveys her whole emotional range and acts so outstandingly with her facial expressions, but even with an absolutely charismatic and powerful lead actress it doesn't change the fact the the whole screenplay is a confusing mess. Firstly, I gulped when I saw the total runtime of roughly two and a half hours (the extended cut adding thirty minutes more, but I went with the first) and thought how it's supposed to stretch its decent yet pretty simple premise to a format like that. To be honest, I was expecting an extremely tardy narrative structure, but this film is more than a slow burner. This term wouldn't make it justice. It takes a lot of time to introduce us to the characters that (except for Dani) I couldn't quite find any form of connection to. If you have seen the film you'll know that it literally spends a lot of time to show how characters introduce themselves to each other. I mean, literally. I was wondering if anything particular would happen, but aside from a drug trip and the introduction of dozens of side characters there was nothing quite interesting happening. Not until one hour and four minutes into the film (I paused at that moment) where I could experience why it was almost rated NC-17 (and why it is rated 16 in Germany) and what would partly justify its label as a horror film. It's definitely gruesome brutality, but there where less than a handful of scenes with a similar brutality. Aside from them, there was basically nothing. From there on I tried to view it as some sort of psychological thriller instead and focussed on that aspect, but even that wasn't quite what the film was. That's what I slowly began to realise. It had severe tonal difficulties and had problems to settle for one kind of horror. There are notable works in the history of cinema that achieved to create a combination of several subgenres of horror, but this film definitely isn't one of them. Therefore, it's a messy mishmash of poorly elaborated approaches. It's lacks the scary atmosphere and some sort of unnerving tension to be a classic horror film, it lacks extremely bloody effects to be a gore gem and it is way too tame to be a packing psychological horror thriller. It tries to be all of it, but fails to be something memorable in the end. Instead it focuses on the traditions and the way of life of a Swedish village and their cult. It felt like it was giving away some hints to something more sinister, a devastatingly shocking final reveal, but it built up to nothing. Nothing outrageous. Nothing shocking. Nothing scandalous. Not even the actually well composed and moderately unnerving sound score or the hallucinatory cinematography couldn't quite bring me in any specific mood. I indeed understood the subtle metaphor of loss, grief and a form of catharsis interwoven with a relationship/breakup subplot, but it's nothing that made the experience any more entertaining. I gotta say, on a percentage basis I was more bored than actually having fun in any way. I probably lasted to the end, because of Pugh's simple presence and talent. All in all, this film is anything but the masterpiece many claim it to be and suffers from so many problems that made it impossible for me to fully enjoy it in any way, the center flaw being the painfully slow pace. I generally love slow burners, but in other cases they offer something then. This film doesn't. It rather loses itself in its details and wastes much of its time to try out several genres without settling for one in the end, what makes it a sloppy rather than deliberately constructed mess. What upsets me the most is that it had so much potential and had a few correct approaches, but in the end is neither scary nor gory, at most mildly disturbing. It's wonderful to look at, but absolutely not the genre redefining masterpiece it's claimed to be. It's more forgettable than iconic. I couldn't really say what's more exciting: This film or shopping at IKEA. I can tell you, one thing is overhyped as hell and shattered my high hopes to experience a modern horror classic. It's a ""nej"" from me."

They went the whole film start to finish and shows entire scenes, just cut some stuff like walking or talking or sped it up. I basically saw it. I know what happens, and why. I know every character's name. I know the plot, I know how it ends. Honestly, what would make the film linger in people's minds is the long scenes and wondering.

That's what Midsummer, and the Maypole is all about. In Scandinavia the sun stays up virtually the entire day at this point of the sun's cycle. Human sacrifices were well known to take place in order to ensure success of the following years crops.<br/><br/>The ancient Druids had the practice of burning humans alive in a tree made of wicker.<br/><br/>Not quite a horror movie from that standpoint.

The slow-burning suspense works effectively until the genuine shocks of the 'cliff' sequence, but after this things really stop working. There's the usual sex and violent content, but it all feels very meandering and dragged out, saddled with unlikeable characters and a genuine lack of meaning and narrative cohesion. The cinematography is great and the actors certainly do their best, but by the end I felt this had become predictable, random (Viking execution methods for shock value, etc.) and a bit like a boring slasher film."

","The already troubled main character, Dani, must cope with extreme anxiety after her bi-polar sister murders both of their parents and commits suicide. Despite this being an obviously traumatic incident, the film does not excel in portraying one of its various themes: grief. While certain portions hint at Dani's desire for a supportive community, it is rarely brought up again after the first 20 minutes and it is almost as though the film used this specifically as a device to make viewers care about the main character.<br/><br/>Viewers are also introduced to Dani's emotionally unavailable boyfriend, Christian (Jack Reynor), who attempts to assist her through her breakdown. However, he appears upset due to the fact that he originally wanted to break up with her, but feels obligated not to due to this incident. After coming to the realization that it would be inappropriate to separate from her at this time, he invites her on a trip to Sweden that he and his friends had been planning. Their uneasy dynamic continues throughout the rest of the film, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. Dani's life falls apart and viewers see her rebuild it in a sunny Swedish town that eventually shows how daytime is just as haunting, if not more, than the night. Their unsettling relationship, filled with brainwashing and emotional abuse, only adds to the chilling experience one feels when watching.<br/><br/>Christian's friend Pelle (Vihelm Blomgren), takes them to visit this remote area of the country, where he grew up, to celebrate the ""Midsommar"" festival. Upon arrival, the group is offered a complimentary cup of mushroom tea and many characters remain under the influence of such drugs for a majority of the film. The film itself feels like experiencing an awful drug trip to the viewers at times due to morphing backgrounds edited in, and also the confusing plot that can be difficult to follow, especially for a more impatient audience. Christian pressures Dani into consuming the hallucinogens despite her recurring panic attacks and to no one's surprise, she undergoes a bad trip. Her lack of supportive peers does not help aid her pain, and the commune is only more off-putting. Despite the locals' practices becoming increasingly more disturbing, Dani is subconsciously in search of a welcoming community. She is eventually seduced by the commune not only from the influence of drugs, but also the sense of warmth they give her and the community she is longing for. This concept is difficult to understand without analyzing the film; the target audience is intellectuals, making it less appealing to the more close-minded individuals. This can be seen as a positive or negative trait of the film, but because it does not reach as wide of an audience, the negative does indeed outweigh the positive.<br/><br/>Some may find Midsommar a very intriguing film, but many will find it quite unlikable due to its inappropriate content, lengthy running time (138 minutes), and slow pace. Ari Aster takes an elevated approach to what is essentially a very simple story line. The viewer must pay close attention to every detail in order to understand the plot. A second viewing would be advised if one is patient and willing to withstand the disturbing events that take place. The first disturbing moment, where viewers begin to unravel the intentions of the Swedish cult, does not occur until an hour into the film. Prior to this, it appears as though there is simply a large group of people inebriated in a field. While the cinematography is incredible, for example, the gorgeous color palette, the impressive editing, and Florence Pugh's amazing portrayal of her character, Dani, the visuals are not enough to cover up how the film drags on.<br/><br/>Viewers see strange, rustic murals displayed in the film towards the beginning that practically give away the events that are too follow. Aster's previous film, Hereditary (2018) had a more appropriately developed plot where the events unfold in a very interesting and shocking way. While some could the director for his ability to transform a basic horror story into a multi-genre film was admirable, the execution has room for improvement. The film was generally very predictable."

","A group of young people goes to someplace they have never been to before, which then turns out to be a death trap. We've seen this a million times. This time the setting is in Sweden among nice looking white and blond people and lots of colorful flowers. This is a bit odd, as we are trained to expect horror in dark und unpleasant places among ugly and wicked people. As it turns out, the nice white local people in this movie are raging lunatic psychopaths. There are some bloodshed, violence, gore and random pagan craziness. The kids all die, except for one, who decides to join the local psychopaths' colony. End of story.<br/><br/>There seems to be a new trend now to make movies extremely long. The Irishman is for example 3.5 hours long for no particular reason. This one is 2.5 hours long, whereas 1.5 would have been ideal.<br/><br/>The story is very predictable since once you know that this is supposed to be a horror movie, the good guys must somehow perish. The only questions are when and how gory this will happen.<br/><br/>What I believe has upset people so much, especially Americans, about this movie - besides its length - is that the ""bad guys"" are depicted as extremely nice, unspoiled, extremely white, extremely cultured, respectable men and women of all ages, including elderly people, all seemingly living in perfect harmony with each other, the nature and the universe, thus they don't fit the clichÃ©s of the genre. You just don't expect them to be bad. I mean, really bad. They shouldn't be bad, period."
"carkol2005","6","0","1","14 December 2019"," Ari Aster has officially stagnated himself into his own ego
","Nonetheless, I can't say this movie is bad either. But this is often the problem with Ari Aster (the director of this movie): the guy usually gets intoxicated with his own style. Don't get me wrong, his movies show some talent, some skill and some directing style: his zenital shots, his unique composition of the frame or his strange sense of humor are some of the cards that always brings up to the table. Pity that the guy is so full of himself that these elements appear even when the narration doesn't need them to.<br/><br/>I have to talk (MASSIVE) spoilers in this one folks because the movie requires to, sorry. Basically you got these friends and this couple who take a trip to Sweden to make a research about a ""midsummer festival"" and (why not) to have a good time in summer... and what a surprise! It's actually a cult. We the audience and the group of friends find this out when the people in the cult sacrifice two guys because they ended their ""circle of life"" at the age of 72. Now this scene is really gruesome and shocking as we find out the way these people function, and thereafter we know that something bad it's going to happen to all of them. The movie has a really good job of building that tension, a good atmosphere and a good sense of dread, I have to admit that.<br/><br/>The problem of the movie (scriptwise) comes out later when every one of them ends up being murdered (except the couple). THEN is when I realise that these characters don't have a brain. They MUST know by then something is really off and that this cult is extremely dangerous, but as every cliche horror movie they act as stupid people because the script need it to. And yes, I know that I always talk about character development, but God these people are bland! Let's take for example the main character, the blonde chick. I don't understand her at all. I know that everyone is been drugged and all but, I'm sorry, this girl is completely retarded! She witnessed horrible things, she presences two suicides and she still stays there! Not only that, but none of her friends think that it's enough, that they should go! They want to make a thesis about the place they say. Dude, are you kidding me? Don't you see all the crap around you?<br/><br/>Another thing that the writing should have made better is what relates to the cult. In the beginning it was fine: the life cycle, the stoicism in their actions, all the craziness that define a pagan cult. But at,the end of the movie it just became too outlandish and bombastic, to the point it just feels unrealistic and artificial, just for the visual insanity. For example, all that dance contest was too much in my opinion, it just feels off. And speaking of that, the protagonist wins?? What a coincidence! But what condition does she have to win? She is not that strong, or mentally stable. No, they obviously didn't let her win in any way, even one chick at one point throws up! She CLEARLY wins by her own merits. These contrivances and conveniences are everywhere in the movie, and I found myself wondering""why? why? What is the reason behind this?"" several times while watching this.<br/><br/>What makes me sad the most is that there is a great great movie within Midsommar, somewhere. Take for example the scene when the girl freaks out in a panic attack when she finds out that his boyfriend is mating with a really gorgeous ginger and all the girls start panicking with her. Wouldn't it have been great if this showed how these girls do this to psychologically help her and condicionate her inside their group in a way a cult usually does? But nothing, this idea is not touched ever again in the movie.<br/><br/>And what about the ending? It's fine I guess. It has some mentioned problems, like what about the bear skin? What is the purpose other than being weird? It could have been much clearer if we knew a thing about these traditions or the ""train of thought"" behind the cult. Also it seems to me that the girl has become crazy? I don't know, it's too much vague for me to understand this girl and her motivations. And speaking of motivations, what about the Swedish friend (Peele was his name I think)? In the end it seems that this is all he wanted all along? Killing all of his friends? None of them did see it coming? How insane has a person to be in order to plan to kill 9 people and drag all to Sweden? Again, if the characters were better developed I might understand it but as we were shown in the movie we don't have any clue about his personality, his motivations, or anything. We just have to assume he's a crazy religious fanatic and that nobody noticed it ever before.<br/><br/>This movie was going to be a 7 until the second third of the movie, but as a whole the problems amount to a really considerable pack. I give it a 6/10."

"micheleroncarati","4","0","4","1 December 2019"," Nothing new, nothing great
","I understand why some people like this film. I can't bring myself to like it simply because it is full of clichÃ©s and the plot isn't solid. The beginning of the film is quite interesting. It's interesting to see the relationship between two people that are falling apart and...that's when the film decides to become just another medicore horror film.<br/><br/>There are nice visuals, interesting cinematography and the actors themselves aren't bad. The problem is that when you actually pay attention to the characters and the plot they are not beliavable. I'm not going to spoil anything, but quite early in the film, there's a quite shocking moment (or it supposed to be shocking) the reaction of the characters lasts literally 5 minutes and the next scene is just about them doing other stuff like nothing happened. Real people would act in a whole different way (even for a horror film).<br/><br/>From the very first ""distrubing"" moment that should give away the horror, a normal person, with an average intelligence would just act differently, while the characters of this film act in a ridicolous way. And the excuse for them to act that way are pretty weak. You'll hardly find yourself relating to their choices or even understanding the logical or illogical reason for being basically the usual ""stupid horror character"" of a horror film.<br/><br/>Finally this is a typical horror film, where the actions of the characters are determined in order for them to serve the ""horror plot"", they aren't people, they are puppet that act stupidly just because if they acted like real people, the film wouldn't hold up.<br/><br/>It's a shame because there could have been a lot of good material to use, even if themes such as ""cults"" and ""horror"" are really nothing new. The ending in my opinion is a typical b movie ending. And a lot of this film can be guessed from the very beginning, and I mean a real lot. I bet against myself, and my guesses were always right. I'm no expert and surely no genius, I just think that this film is made to impress the audience with some nice scenes and its colourful aesthetic sense, but if you stop and ask question about the plot you'll find yourself saying ""that does not make sense, even for a horror movie""."

"fciocca","6","0","1","20 November 2019"," A journey inside pagan rituals
","Ari Aster makes movies that are not for everyone, even people that love the horror genre, can be bored by its length. This is his style: really slow paced stories, I saw it in ""Hereditary"", I saw it also here. To fully appreciate his movies you need to like technical stuff, such as the framing and photography. We can almost speak about sperimental cinema, but that sells pretty well, considering the genre. Maybe because is the first director that is bringing something new to horror and thriller, after a long time, and people are simply curious.<br/><br/>The story is really simple: a group of guys is invited by a swedish friend to participate to a pagan festival in his small village, but soon, they will find themselves in a dangerous situation. It seems to stay in a trip: the location is very mystical and dark, even if the director decided to use warm colors: it is a nice contrast, because from one side is reassuring, but shots make often feel you uneasy. There are many scenes that are uncomfortable, and create a lot of tension. However this movie cannot really scare you: it makes feel anxious, it triggers some inner fears, and maybe it was this the purpose of ""Midsommar"". This is why, at least for me, it is way better than the average horror/thriller production. There are no jump scares (my prayers have been answered, finally). The sound part is very well done, and to fully appreciate this film, I highly recommend to watch it with a pair of good headphones. The sound in fact is very realistic and you can hear every single sound (including music) as the character that appears on screen hears: when the character is far from the music, the music is lower, but it becomes higher and higher while is approaching, or when he/she moves from one place to another, the sound pass from the right channel, to the left one. A nice detail that improve even more the technical quality.<br/><br/>Acting was just okay, the main character Dani, played by Florence Pugh, was convincing and I actually need to praise her job, because there were some scenes that were obviously really hard to shoot, I genuinely believe that she gave the best that she could. Unfortunately I cannot say the same thing about Jack Reynor, as Christian, the bad boyfriend that does not care about the girlfriend. The problem is that is not good in playing him: he seems more a coward that does not know how to reply, when he has verbal confrontations with her. Regarding the rest of the cast, I can't say that I was impressed.<br/><br/>""Hereditary"" remains for now the best Aster's job, cast choices were way much better, character were more credible and in general it was scarier and darker than this one. The director decided to take a different approach, but topics are almost the same, in both movie there is a cult, some pagan rituals and witchcraft. The location is different but conceptually speaking are very close to each other. Next time maybe we will be able to see another theme."

","Midsummer is the period that is centered on the summer solstice, and more specifically the Northern European celebrations that accompany the solstice itself or take place on a day between June 19 and June 25. In both Norway, and especially Sweden, these are great markings that mean a lot to many. A big party everyone is looking forward to, marking the brightest time of the year. So it is inventive to make a movie about this theme and try to make a creepy twist on it. And the film is in many ways well executed, well filmed, beautiful surroundings and costumes. But it fails. There are many reasons why I couldn't let myself get carried away. I think it was involuntarily comical, and that's not the point? This is supposed to be a scary thing, but it is far too long and tedious. It also lacks an understanding of why all the Swedish members do as they do, and the background to the horrific traditions we witness.

"williamrbabcock","5","0","2","19 November 2019"," An honest review from an aspiring filmmaker.
","I get it. Ari Aster makes movies for himself and for cinefiles, NOT the general masses, and I think that's fantastic. However, Ari Aster seems to be (at least to me), the George Lucas of slow-burn cinema. He has great concepts, and his films look great, but the execution leaves room for improvement.<br/><br/>Both Hereditray and Midsommar are self-indulgent, Midsommor especially. It felt like watching a more surreal, slightly less interesting Tarantino flick.<br/><br/>Aster seems to have a penchant for uncomfortableness, some of which he pulls off exceptionally well. Some of it, not so much.<br/><br/>With Midsommor, it's a mixed bag. I found myself intrigued and frustrated at the same time.<br/><br/>I know it's important to establish characters early on, but I feel the opening didn't really add anything to the movie. Most of what happens is just arbitrary and bizarre, which hey, not always a bad thing. In this case....<br/><br/>All I know is that tripping balls or not, I dont know if I could perform with random naked people standing around me, chanting. And believe me, I've been to an orgy or two (wink), yes, Tmi, I know.<br/><br/>Also, some of the characters seemed completely Ancillary, and once they disappeared, no one seemed to care or notice.<br/><br/>Again, this is a film targeted to a very specific audience, and I know that. I applaud Ari Aster and a24 for stepping outside the norm and delivering something that could/should have been something special, and I feel like cutting 45 minutes from the movie would have accomplished that.<br/><br/>
Ok, NOW, for the GOOD.<br/><br/>It was a beautiful film. As a person who did my fair share of designer drugs (acid/ Ecstasy/shrooms/K), in the 90's, I can appreciate all the tripping sequences, but they also pissed me off,,, everyone knows NEVER drink the punch at the party. Basic party rule number one.<br/><br/>The cinematography was outstanding, as are the basic set designs and wardrobe. It all felt natural and right.<br/><br/>But I think my biggest issue is that after watching the people what they did at the cliff, and the community's participation in the process, that everyone didn't just bug out. If I saw that, I'd peace. Like, byyyyyyeeeee.<br/><br/>I think the actors all did a great job with the material they had to work with, and the setting and idea are hitting it on the head, but the execution could use some work.<br/><br/>
However, I did enjoy this and the ending more than I did Hereditray (that ending pissed me off to no end).<br/><br/>
I will state one more time that I know Ari Aster makes films for himself and a very specific audience, and i always try to say that something doesn't ""suck"" or ""stink"", but more that it is not my forte, but Midsommor is surely NOT going to be for the majority of people.<br/><br/>I'm not going to mention the Wicker Man comparisons, as that's a given, but it just felt like an unsatisfying ending.<br/><br/>I feel like if we saw the Swedish friend who brought them all there at another school or something, convincing more people to come to the festival at his home town or something, it would have bookended it nicely. It just seems completely arbitrary otherwise.<br/><br/>There just happens to be a Random Swedish dude at a Random college who ropes in people to go to Sweden to his home town for a weird mid-summer festival because on eof them is doing his thesis on European summer rituals? A little TOO convenient.<br/><br/>But if at the end they show that this is something he does, it would make a lot more sense. But hey, that's just me.<br/><br/>
Should you see this movie? That's up to you. If you have 2 and a half hours to kill and like mind fucksfor no reason, then, yeah. Otherwise, no."

"Eric_Cubed","5","0","1","17 November 2019"," A bit more engaging than ""Suspiria.""
","""The Witch"" was a bit too Avant Garde or ""Artsy-Fartsy"" for me; it was interesting, even intriguing at times, but had too much desolation symbolism for the average viewer to make sense of much of anything, ostensibly to ""make the audience think, question and wonder"" about what it all means. Throwing in a Satanic goat here and there is nothing new. David Lynch, as much as I liked half of his movies, is the ultimate director god of this genre. It's a precarious fine line, like many of Bob Dylan's songs, between the artist bringing authentic and mythological meaning to contemporary problems in timeless fashion vs. bogging down into the drainless swamp of the individual's neurosis, most notably exemplified in the older philosophers, such as Nietzsche, who we must extricate the pathological depression from the gems of timeless wisdom regarding the human condition. There is a limited number of explanations available for psycho-phantasmagorical movies: the government, aliens, a dream, the devil, a hallucinogen, the matrix, purgatory etc. (did I miss any?). All of these are copouts, and why the TV series ""Lost"" imploded upon itself. Most movie audiences are not stupid and will know when they can or cannot suspend disbelief. This will be felt as boredom and an overall sense of stupidity, regret and anger for paying the high cost of the ticket. While slow at times, ""Midsommer"" does not betray the exciting premise, fortitude and engaging drama of the original ""Wicker Man,"" slowly leading the audience to more subtle and nuanced veils of what is true and what is not. Currently, I am halfway in, hoping the film does not degrade itself by indulging in the ""limited explanations"" described above. Unfortunately, the trauma story of one of the main characters does not weave perceptibly into the whole, and the movie makers would have been wise to apply a Gestalt to this film: the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, an almost fatal flaw, gladly resuscitated by the quality of the script, the direction and the performance of the young, talented actors. However, I'll just be honest, in the Nicolas Cage remake of the ""Wicker Man,"" as he burning alive in sacrifice for the harvest, there is a strong part of me that wishes, half on fire, he would have catapulted from the upper chamber, broke his arm, and ran screaming to the ocean, diving in, and after bashing his body on the rocks, clinging on, barely clinging on, only to pass out and awake half buried in a crag covered with seaweed and vowing his revenge, then surreptitiously crawling among the salty rocks and breaking into a warehouse-closed for harvest season, replete with all the necessary things required to recover and then turn the island into sausage proper. How much better would that have been? If only the actors, producers, directors and everyone else creating the stage had the vision of a revenge redressed! Okay, now it has dragged on for over 45 minutes, with the main character having orgies and more. I feel the ghost of Nicholson's ""The Passenger,"" and ""A passage to India"" now-a boredom resembling a sand dune. And so, in the final analysis, don't bother with this one."

","This film was a huge disappointment, I was expecting Midsommar to steal the show of the horror genre in 2019 from watching the trailer and after seeing Ari Aster's amazing performance with Hereditary (2018) but this movie just did not deliver.<br/><br/>I'll start off with the positives, first of all this movie was beautiful such good cinematography and direction. I know this is a horror movie it probably shouldn't be nice looking but the setting and the colours make the movie ten times more disturbing, seeing such horror and gore in such a picturesque environment you wouldn't usually associate horror with adds so much effect, which I really loved. The acting in this movie is very good especially from Florence Pugh, who plays the main character Dani, she adds so much dramatic tension to the film and she is an exceptional cryer. The music is great in this film adding so much tension but obviously no where near as good as Hereditary (2018).<br/><br/>With many positives came many negatives, the plot is the core of a movie and when the film doesn't keep you invested in the plot from start to finish, it's very hard to enjoy it. The first and second acts are great all building up to the end but the end does not deliver. Throughout the movie you feel as if they're slowly casting a shadow over the storyline, but they do nothing with that shadow. The movie felt honestly a bit pointless, the end is not there because the plot became too complex and weird where it seemed as if they were struggling to end it.<br/><br/>In Conclusion, this movie would be boring to the common horror audience, I think anyone looking to get into film making should most definitely watch it because the way it's shot is so inspiring but that doesn't make up for the terrible ending.<br/><br/>Grade: C+"

"evanston_dad","6","0","1","8 November 2019"," Relationship Horror
","Writer/director Ari Aster really has a thing for dysfunctional family dynamics. ""Hereditary"" basically gave us the family from hell, and ""Midsommar"" gives us more of the same. At the center of this horror movie is a couple whose relationship is limping along -- he pretty much won't break up with her because of some recent traumatic events involving a murder/suicide in her family and the guilt he would feel at leaving her. Not the makings of a great romance. It's no wonder then that both find themselves allured, though in different ways, to a psycho hippy community while traveling in Sweden. He's wanted sexually for some mumbo jumbo rituals while she enjoys being embraced by one big damn family, no matter how bonkers they may be.<br/><br/>Aster is an effective filmmaker and knows how to put together images that will unsettle and linger in the viewer's mind for a while. But this movie is too long and too lugubriously paced to be as effective as it might otherwise be. Florence Pugh is really good in the film's first half, but by the end she's so zonked out and hysterical that her performance grows tiresome. It's not really her fault -- it's just that there's far too much movie for her to have to fill.<br/><br/>People who like a hard ""R"" rating will get their money's worth, but much of what gives the film its ""R"" rating comes off as silly.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"benjithegreat-64198","4","0","3","7 November 2019"," Extremely and excessively gorey - to the point where it ruins the movie, and then some
","Man, I gotta say, I'm normally not into horror/gore/scary-type movies, but I thought this one looked kinda interesting. I thought that the initial concept might hold. I love the idea of a scary movie in a beautiful 24hour paradise of flowers and rolling hills, etc. Sounds like it could be pretty cool. Unique. I was thinking along the lines of A Quiet Place, which overall, I thought was great! It was a clever twist that made it a unique viewing.
And there are times in the movie, where it seems to show that it is a smart, clever movie, with some pretty decent acting. Then is knocks all that down and goes ""Nope"". This is a seriously up movie. Even before they go to the place where all the scary stuff happens, it's super messed up. An even happens that was waaay more graphic and excessive than it needed to be. And then they go to the Swedish meadow, etc, and it pretty much jumps right into overkill nastiness. Multiple times in this movie, I thought ""okay, you could have stopped this 3 minutes ago and made your point"", but they just keep tossing the guts and gore at you left and right, without a real strong reason. It could have been cool if they kept it somewhat believable and that would have gone a long way for us foreigners. ""Does this kind of $#!+ really happen here?"" But it goes so far beyond a possibility, and into just buckets of goo and jacked sensibility, and just plain ruins it. I made it to the end of the movie, but just barely. I give it four stars because it truly is a beautiful movie, cinematically and it is a clever concept. I really wanted to like this movie. It could have been great, and there are bits and pieces that are, but in the end, it's just a big, dumb gorefest."
"Watch-dawg","9","0","3","6 November 2019"," Midsommar - where the line between dream and nightmare blurs
","Midsommar is one of the rare movies that is extremely good at what it does. It completely captivates the audience with an immersive experience of summer at a Scandinavian countryside. The beautiful visuals and the warm hospitable natives only intensify the sensation of horror that slowly creeps forward as the movie progresses. This is horror at its finest. Ari Aster has once again proved his expertise in arguably the hardest genre of cinema. A good horror does not rely on jump scares or gore to be successful. It requires a tight plot complemented by appropriate atmosphere led by convincing acting and finally pieced together by smart direction. Midsommar excels in all these elements. Florence Pugh had already impressed me with a stellar performance in and as Lady Macbeth. She takes it up a few notches in Midsommar. Unlike most other movies of the horror genre, the director Ari Aster focuses on impressive acting to elevate the viewer immersion. Pugh deserves an oscar for her performance in this movie. She drives the movie right from the start as we experience pain, solace, suspicion, hatred and madness through her very eyes. Music and cinematography are in perfect sync with the atmosphere of the film as evident in a few scenes that are captivating and revolting at the same time.<br/><br/>As someone who had watched his own share of horror movies, I can testify ""Midsommar"", just like its predecessor ""Hereditary"" is a must-watch for any horror fan out there. Even if you are not a huge fan of the horror genre, give 'Midsommar' a watch because it is a pretty unique experience by itself."

""Hereditary"" was brilliant, and ""Midsommar"" arguably tops it.<br/><br/>""Hereditary"" reminded me of ""The Shining"", and even more so, ""Midsommar"" presents Kubrickian attention to detail, and perfection in the framing of each shot, and the way facial expressions subtly tell their own story.<br/><br/>I was completely won over by this movie in the end. I felt like I had ingested the same drug the people in the movie had taken. The movie's slow burn approach and subtle hallucinogenic effects gradually take over, like an approaching acid trip.

","Ari Aster's follow up to the outstanding 2018 film Hereditary is ultimately more style over substance, but still holds its own as an original piece of storytelling.<br/><br/>This tale of a trip to a Swedish commune is both beautiful and at-times terrifying, offering a unique exploration of themes of community, individuality and mental health. Employing the same ramp-up pace used with such great effect in his previous film, Midsommar just doesn't pack the same punch without the award-winning performance from Toni Collette at the core of Hereditary's success.<br/><br/>Where Midsommar does shine is in the subtly of its horror, purposely excluding the viewer from moments of death and destruction in exchange for an underlying sense of terror. Beautiful scenery is constantly juxtaposed with hints of horror and gore to make for an equal parts enjoyable and traumatic experience."

"namob-43673","7","0","1","22 October 2019"," Good movie! But no, not really... this only partly goes on in Sweden.
","First the question on everyoneÂ´s mind; Yes, this is to a large degree Swedish tradition. Of course it always rain on Midsommar, we drink a lot more, and we have a lot more sex, otherwise... well, we only sacrifice people in some areas of the country, otherwise goats, horses and such...<br/><br/>With that lie (or was it?) out of the way, this movie is pretty good. It is absolutely gorgeous to look at, the acting amazing (Florence Pugh should win an Oscar for this!), the directing, light, costumes, pretty much everything cinematographic is great. I also love the subtle nuances like the upside down sign during the car drive (learn Swedish and read...) which is a pro-""racist"" sign, or in the context of the movie I assume a subtle hint that immigration is good and those who oppose it are cultist nuts sacrificing people left to right...<br/><br/>I would argue there are 3 main treads in this movie and depending on which one you pull and focus on, I believe it will impact what you think of the movie.<br/><br/>The first thread is the psychological trauma, abandonment and family tragedy, and this is absolute spot on. Fantastic! It is mainly due to the absolute stunning performance of Florence, but the movie portrait it amazingly well and if this is your focus or what matters, then this movie is a 10/10.<br/><br/>The second thread, that partly goes to together with the first, is the focus on break-up and a sort of toxic relationship. This too is made really well, but not as well and I think a few things does not work. If this is your focus and what you take away from the movie its a 8/10.<br/><br/>The third and most important thread of the movie, and my main objection to it, is that the cult, their ideas, why, how, and such is not fully explained.
I guess it does not have to be, but since HÃ¥rga is a well-known little village in Sweden connected to the Devil (check out HÃ¥rgalÃ¥ten on youtube) it get a bit confusing. Is this a Devil-worshipping thing? Viking? Pagan in general?
Despite my little joke above, and despite midsommarblot (sacrifice) and Ã„ttestupa (the old people jumping from the cliff) actually did happen historically (yes, those parts are actually true), I cannot see any ""realism"" in the context of this movie. Again I guess it does not have to be... but as a Swede kinda confusing, perhaps more so for me than anyone non-Swede.
From my perspective this main thread is more a 5/10 in this movie.<br/><br/>Another negative is that it is very confusing that the outsiders do not immediately leave after the jumping-to-the-death-thing. I do get that they were drugged and such, and the movie sort of tells us this, but still... that did not sit right. Should have been something before or after explaining their motivation to stay.<br/><br/>The movie also get a bit dragged out and boring. Sure I get that the director want to build suspense and create an weird scary atmosphere, but it goes on for a little too long.<br/><br/>Since nothing of the cult was fully explained and we do not get a full explanation of the ending, I also felt a bit cheated. Of course we can fill in the blanks to a large degree and if you check out a lot of the symbolism you can sort of figure it out, but not... really... I dunno, it felt too abrupt and a bit convoluted.<br/><br/>And finally this movie is not really scary, it felt more like a weird attempt to thrash Swedish heritage rather than a horror movie (if focused on the cult and third thread).
The other objections I have I can partly swallow, but overall I did not buy the premise of the cult-part of the movie. Yes, I know it is a scary horror cultist movie and it is not fully meant to make sense from that perspective, but something about the wholeness of the movie do not sell it to me because if this. If the movie had focused on and been only about the trauma and psychological impact and Florence acting, this might have been the best movie of all time - not a joke, she and that part of the movie is beyond amazing.<br/><br/>Still I like this movie, it is beautiful to watch and it has several great traits, and if Florence do no win an Oscars we should all riot.
However for reasons mention I was not sold, I did not love it or take so much away from it.<br/><br/>In the end I give this movie a 7/10. Worth to check out and I sort of recommend it, but not a favourite and it is not for everyone. Or said in Swedish this is a: Hyfsad MedelmÃ¥ttig film."

I personally liked The Wicker Man (original and not the remake), but the latter two I have mixed feelings about. I do find movies about cults or the occult fascinating; however, I can only handle too much darkness before I call it a night, so for me it's about striking up that balance between terrifyingly watchable vs. a disturbingly one-time watch. This is a one-time watch for me.<br/><br/>I knew nothing before coming into it, but basically right off the bat, you get that spine-tingling score indicating that it's not a rom-com. It sets up a pretty chilling introduction with the main character's back story and once all the characters get to Sweden...honestly...if any of them ever watched The Wicker Man, they wouldn't even be stepping out of the plane...but, anyway, they didn't, and here we have the story.<br/><br/>The visuals ranged from borderline pretentious to out-of-the-box amazing. It nailed the picture-perfect with an ominous undertone atmosphere-props to cinematography, overall. The first half of the movie had a good flow, but midway the movie slowed down in pacing, and after a while I just kept thinking ""yes, it's a cult, I get it, please get to the ritual now."" When they do get to the ritual, the scenes just drag.

","The Director of Midsommar indicated that the Wicker Man was just one of a number of influences for this movie. Evidently, there is a fine line between influence and theft. It's not that the film isn't enjoyable, at least in parts, but one can never escape the obvious overlap with the 1970s The Wicker Man, throughout the viewing. And, to be fair, the original is far far superior in every single way. Midsommar is not only let down by a lack of originality, the characters are all completely underdeveloped. One simply does not care enough about what happens to any of the visitors and therefore the end of the movie lacks any sort of punch.<br/><br/>All that said, there is no doubt that the movie is still enjoyable to a point. After all, who doesn't like spending time in the company of a freakish cult?"

","Midsommar, or Midsummer.. the Summer Solstice that has been celebrated by people for over 2000 years and it's still practiced in many countries. Like other celebrations of the seasons, of nature, of change. Did the film capture this? Only to little extent. After all, it's a movie, and like most horror movies, they need to ""embellish"" things to attract the public that seeks for mystery and horror and rituals and everything evil in something they don't understand, especially common Americans who don't know these traditions since they are of European origin.<br/><br/>Some argued that this is not authentic from an ethnological perspective and that it tries to copy the classic Wicker Man from 1973. We must remember that this is a movie, and not a documentary.<br/><br/>HOWEVER... the movie itself is very, very well made. The acting is decent to good, the scenes are carefully made. Unlike most horror movies we have nowadays, this is not your usual jump-scare movie. It's a movie that unites truth with imagination, a movie that doesn't even need creepy atmosphere, dark scenes in the middle of the night, monsters or spirits or anything like that... Its charm is based on shocking experiences lived by a girl who gradually becomes mentally unstable due to the shocks, heartbreak and use of drugs, ending with a holiday that eventually destroys her. Its based on a gradual degradation of mental and emotional state, finally destroyed by something that is not understood (strange and unusual traditions, foreign land)... until it shows its face.<br/><br/>It was debated on the internet that the girl's attitude towards her boyfriend's death is unusual, but the explanation is simple. The girl was traumatized, she took drugs and was drugged by others (drugs and trauma don't make a good pair) and she eventually loses her sanity. Her mental state is deteriorated since the beginning of the movie. After all the traumatic events she goes through until the end, the conclusion is that she lost the sense of reality and lost her sanity, thus we can explain the smile at the end of the movie. Although she loved her boyfriend, she saw him reserved towards her needs, she sees him attracted by another woman, so she begins to blame him for her suffering as well, so if she suffers he must also suffer. It's a psychological horror.<br/><br/>The movie itself is intense from beginning to the end, but the intensity grows more and more as you watch it and events take place. The use of rituals, unknown traditions and symbolism, pagan cults, psychedelics, mental breakdowns is a perfect blend.<br/><br/>I consider this to be a very good movie, even if, like most movies, tries to destroy beautiful ancient traditions from our European ancestors. After all, people want entertainment, not knowledge. So from an entertainment perspective, this is perfect."

I personally hyped it up so much for an at home viewing the day of its release. I LOVE ""Hereditary"" as it is truly a horror movie for the ages. Now I know Midsommar and Hereditary are seprate movies but I still expected the directors touch. For me, it just wasn't there with Midsommar. Midsommar is a very long and honestly... Its boring... And it hurts me so much to say that.. It is definitely not really a horror film as it kind of lacks any real imminent tenseness. The story feels stretched for all its worth when it would have fit better into a run time of 120 min at most. The location and sets are very open and it feels that since this movie had such an incredibly short production time from start to finish that things just didnt come together well enough in fast enough time. There are almost weird low budget props and gestures in this movie that i expected to be more well done. This movie is thematic. It is powerful overall in its message. It is even horrifying at times. There is just too much meandering going on and it makes for an underwhelming experience... I am almost embarrassed for Ari Aster.

","I believe Aster's competence as a filmmaker showed once again with this film. The motivations for the protagonists seem real and allows them to explore their new environment in a way that seems meaningful. I also really enjoyed the pacing of the film. It builds tension nicely throughout, leaving the viewer suspicious of the tribe more and more as events unfold. There are only a few points in which that tension truly explodes, but they all have merit and I felt were appropriate for the progression of the story. All the actors did a fine job in their roles, and I really should commend the cinematography, as it did great work in capturing the beautiful scenery and building a mood; especially in those climactic moments, the cinematography focuses on images which stay with you throughout the film. I cannot help but compare this movie to ""Hereditary,"" and for that comparison I can only say I like the former more personally. I believe ""Hereditary"" has a better establishment of tone and hauntingness, but after all it is a psychological horror movie; ""Midsommar does not fit in line so much with that categorization. Ultimately I believe my expectation that ""Midsommar"" would be more like ""Hereditary"" dampened my perception of it after it was over. With that said, do not expect ""Midsommar"" to be a horror movie, because it is not. ""Midsommar"" is by no means a perfect movie, but it is a great one worth seeing for the reasons I provided."

It reminded me a lot of wickerman for obvious reasons and I don't understand the people who complain that these two films turned out to be predictable. A film exceeding all predictable notions is of course the best cinematic experience but a sophisticated viewer knows that each film should be seen and processed by considering the creators intention. Ari aster hasn't failed by making the film predictable but neither has he won on that regard.. where he has clearly won is in showing us exactly his intention and making it prodigiously his own.. a natural auteur. Unfortunately that win is not one with which, us, the regular audience could fully celebrate because idk about you but i wanted it to end differently than it did.

"msbreviews","7","0","3","27 September 2019"," Rating: B
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>This was easily one of my most anticipated movies of the year. Hereditary was my favorite film of 2018, so obviously, Ari Aster's second feature grabbed my full attention from the very first announcement. Fortunately, even though Midsommar is only being released now in my country, I was able to stay away from spoilers, as well as from any sort of images or clips. As you might expect, this is not a typical horror movie, even though it's being marketed as belonging to the genre. Sure, it has some horror stuff that indisputably connects it to the genre, but it definitely doesn't play out to scare audiences or make you have nightmares at night.<br/><br/>Hereditary was quite divisive among audiences due to the lack of traditional jump scares and generic entertainment, besides it being too excessive regarding spiritualism for the general public. Midsommar is undoubtedly going to be even more divisive. First of all, it drags. There's no denying it. The first weird cult scene only occurs about one hour in, which in a 140-minute runtime is a bit too far ahead. Granted, it's one of the most shocking and horrific sequences in the daylight I've ever seen, but its build-up (extremely well-done) takes a big part of the second act, slowing down the pacing too much.<br/><br/>Additionally, it's a film that entirely relies its entertainment value on the feeling of shock instead of fear. If you didn't enjoy Aster's first feature because it didn't have enough scary sequences, Midsommar isn't going to convert you to being a fan of his work. Similarly to Ad Astra (just released last week), it's a story that requires the audience to care about more than only superficial aspects. If you go in expecting to leave your brain outside just so you can be uncloudedly entertained, then you might want to think again. I can't stress this enough: you need to pay attention to what you're watching!<br/><br/>Hints to what the story holds for us are everywhere, especially in the walls. Through paintings, runes, and hand-drawings, Ari Aster spreads basically all the information you need to better understand where the movie is going. It's a film about two key themes: how to deal with grief, and how to handle a complicated relationship. These are the issues that people should be able to acknowledge and understand how they're being developed. I love how Aster addresses the latter topic (he wrote this screenplay after he ended a relationship of his own), but I'm disappointed by the way he put the former into the ""background"".<br/><br/>The first 15-20 minutes deal with what happens to Dani's life, and it's never approached again, even though there's a vague idea of what could have actually happened, by the end of the movie. Regarding the other point, it isn't exactly a ""toxic"" relationship that we've seen in previous films, but one where each person is waiting for an excuse to leave the other. Hence, some actions feel forced in the hope that they can trigger something. It's a strangely realistic yet uncomfortable take on something a lot of people go through. Technically, this is one of 2019's most fascinating productions.<br/><br/>From the colorful cinematography to the impeccable editing, from the stunningly impressive production design (again, the WALLS!) to the immersive score ... Ari Aster is no joke. The way he handles dialogues is a treat to someone like me, who cares so much about engagement through characters speaking. There are so many long takes with Florence Pugh giving her all, just raw and powerful emotions. It's her career-best performance, no doubt about it. Her character's storyline is partially what brings the ""horror"" to the narrative. Just like Toni Colette on Hereditary, Pugh is probably going to be ignored during the awards season, as well as the movie's technical achievements since the horror genre still didn't convince enough people to give a shot.<br/><br/>Regarding the other characters, they're my main issue. They simply felt like plot devices. Will Poulter (Mark) is funny as the comic-relief guy, but his character, like every other one besides Dani, doesn't do much to make me care about or feel invested in their own subplots (if there are any). They barely have any backstory, and their purpose is basically to help move the plot forward by giving Aster opportunities to show some pagan rituals of some kind. There are incredibly shocking, bloody, and jaw-dropping scenes, some might make you feel uncomfortable, others might make you laugh. But they're all meant to shock you in some shape or form.<br/><br/>Whether you love it or hate it, Midsommar is memorable. If you didn't enjoy Hereditary due to the lack of jump scares, the former isn't for you then. Midsommar requires full attention, patience, and an open-minded mentality. It's not a generic horror flick, so don't go in expecting to be constantly entertained by silly scares. Expectations are everything, so moderate them in the best way possible. It has one of the most abstract ways of addressing a difficult relationship and how to deal with grief, but if you LOOK AT THE WALLS, you'll be able to (maybe) follow the story a bit better.<br/><br/>Technically, Ari Aster delivers a masterful work, with exceptional production design and gorgeous cinematography, plus seamless editing. Florence Pugh carries the story on her shoulders with an astonishingly compelling performance, but her supporting cast didn't do much with their under-developed characters. The film drags a lot, and it can become tedious at some point, but in the end, it's one of those movies that sticks with you. A second viewing may be necessary, and it will probably be a better experience. Can't wait to find out. Go see it!"

","I think Ari Aster did one of greatest mistakes of his life.
For a newcomer it is better not to repetitive and do some thing new time to time. But he did exactly what he done on Hereditary.
He told us the story of a hidden community who have some thrilling intentions. Most of the story is predictable due to previous movie. With each hint you can completely what will happen. You know that Mark will get in trouble because of his lust. The British couple will die soon. Maja try to seduce Christiane exactly like the painting. And Dani will be May Queen. It was completely obvious because we expect all this because we do know how Ari Aster works. The only thing that we didn't expect was this amount of explicit scenes. He did some disturbing scenes in his last works, but this was completely out of my mind.
Along side this problem we can say the movie is too long, the back story is some how irrelevant and characterization is incomplete. Also I didn't like the way of presentation, because trough the movie you though that all the people were under drugs effect (and I wont be surprised if they really did ).

These people are intriguing to watch - even though I guessed through most of the commune's customs, the scenes played out well because of the reactions of the visitors. I will admit I was very hesitant to watch this because of the ending of Hereditary, but I felt like the ending of Midsommar complimented the rest of the film even though I found it predictable. If you're going to watch this, if this is something that interests you, I advise watching the extended version that I just watched. It's about 3 hours long and I even took a 10-minute break at the end of each hour - I treated it like a 3-episode mini-series. The camera work in Ari's films is impressive, whether it's a scrolling look at the road or a horrendous death (hardly any sound effects and it always feels so nonchalant, which is how it truly feels to witness something so horrible in real life - the shock immediately settles in and shakes you to your core)."

The depictions of the every-day activities was interesting to me (cooking, gardening, meals, etc.)<br/><br/>It is very difficuly to compare it to other horror movies, but I could see some similarities with the Wicker Man and the VVitch. Neverthless, this one has some gruesome visual depictions of deaths / rituals, which swing in the direction of Eli Roth's Inferno (just a little).<br/><br/>The biggest minus was the cliche characters of americans and depiction of the relationship between the main characters - Dani and Christian. I was very displeased in respect to acting and the depiction of their relationship in comparison to the depiction of the Hårga community leveryday and own traditions.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say that the movie itself was interesting in its difference from the standard horror genre movies. The interconnection between the novadays mindset of the ""guests"" juxtapositioned with odd traditions / culture of a remote and closed community gives the movie its psychological twist and challenges to realise that still, there are many cultures, which consist of traditions beyond our belief, but we are unaware of, as we are accustomed to the modern lifestyles.<br/><br/>Would not recommend the movie to minors due to graphic violence, nudity, etc."

"chuftyjones","6","0","2","19 August 2019"," All too vague
","I was really excited by tbe idea of this film. Not one for gore and jumps I thought this would be a ""not want you think it is"" type of chiller rather than out and out horror-rather like Wicker Man (alluded to in other reviews).
The problem is everything (and everyone) is started off well then just wanders.
Aside from the lead character, Dani, there is little character development. The main group don't even seem to be friends, just a collection of people who randomly trudge off to Sweden. Their relationship with Pelle isn't explained snd you don't really even realise that Josh is interested in Pagan history until quite late on (in fact, he is effectively the same character as he is in ""The Good Place"")
My biggest problem is there is no sense of being trapped and there is not enough realisation amongst the group that they may have made a mistake coming. No one cares (or even barely mentions) when people start going missing. If Josh and Mark really had left in the night where would they have gone? Why is no one worried? It was a 4 hour drive through the wilderness-where were they going to go?
Mark, the token millenial, upsets a local-and worries he is going to get killed but goes off with a girl and, errr gets killed by.........? The fact he is dressed as a fool at the end (nod to Wicker Man) may relate to the blink and you'll miss it, game of skin the fool played by the children at the start but who knows?
You get the sense that Josh has a dawning realisation that this is a bad place but he is wiped out before you get to find out if he did.
Dani's boyfriend starts off being a chap that wants to split up with her but is staying out of duty but by the time they arrive in Sweden he is so two dimensional it's almost as if they have never met.
The two English characters are clearly there for cannon fodder but it would have been more interesting to see them taking their ""truck rides"" so you are left with a ""did they escape or not""? feeling until their fates are revealed qt the end.
Actually aside from reflecting the modern throwaway generation, what was the point of Mark? He was presented as being interested in the beer, drugs and girls, there was no way he'd have been interested in the trip!
Overall this film can be summed up in a few words;
""Trauma, happy, happy, happy, everyone dies, the end"""
"tbuchalski","8","0","5","19 August 2019"," Midsommar: My Good, Bad, and Ugly
","The Good:
Florence Pugh's performance really holds this film together. The men in the cast do okay to support her, but she is really the shining star of this film. The pain from her recent tragedy and how that pain makes her fear of loneliness and acceptance so much worse is made real by her stellar performance. Without Pugh the film would fall flat as most of its themes find their outlet directly through her. The alternative horror subplot provides suspense as Aster's reputation precedes him into this film, but the shock value of certain ""unexpected"" moments is unimpressive and forgettable. Pugh is the reason that this film has any real value, particularly for value in repeat viewings.<br/><br/>The Bad:
Although Aster's work on Hereditary (2018) places him in a place of arguably refreshing critical praise among horror directors he does little in this sophomore feature outing that isn't predictable. Hereditary had a few surprising moments that grounded the film in the horror genre while still experimenting with the conventions. Midsommar does little to accomplish that feat again. Each ""scary"" or thrilling revelation is terribly banal as with each one's coming and going the audience is left thinking, ""Yeah, that makes sense, rather than ""I can't believe what I just saw!""<br/><br/>The Ugly:
The appeal of Midsommar lies primarily in its revelations of the Other and what audiences might see as cult-like behavior. While Midsommar moves slowly and predictably almost entirely throughout - the first act tragedy being the exception - Martha Marcy May Marlene (Sean Durkin, 2011) explores the darker, and arguably scarier parts of those themes with more effect in a more unpredictable way. John Hawkes horrifies in limited screen time as the audience unexplainably knows exactly who he is and what he's capable of. The similar predictability of Aster's Swedish village is more expository than it is terrifying, and thus misses the mark."
"Cinematic_Bullshit","7","0","1","15 August 2019"," Good Atmosphere, Lackluster Characters
","Midsommar is about a couple, who after having some turbulence in their relationship, travel with a group of friends to a festival in Sweden. When they find out they've entered cult territory, things soon turn ugly.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Midsommar. Definitely more than I enjoyed Hereditary, yet it didn't fulfill my expectations. The best thing it has going for it is it's atmosphere. The unnerving feeling of being stuck in this foreign place with strange people who have strange rituals will stay with you the entire time. A few scenes near the beginning are shot to make it look like an LSD trip. These are fairly accurate, though a psychedelic experience is impossible to replicate. These shots and the cinematography in general add to the atmosphere.<br/><br/>But the central focus of the picture is the relationship of the two main characters. Or at least that seems to be what the director was going for, but I think whereas in Hereditary he was great at building characters and their relationship to one another, here he falls short. There are only a couple scenes where the two argue with with each other and you don't get to know them that well in these. There was a clear effort to tie the shakiness of the relationship to the events that happen involving the cult, and to some extent it manages to do that, but many things are left ambiguous and it feels lazy.<br/><br/>Another issue I had was that the whole creepy cult cliche is just that-a predictable cliche. Pretty much everything you think is going to happen happens. The danger that the group of friends have put themselves in becomes more apparent as the film continues, ""these people are dangerous"", yada yada yada.<br/><br/>Regardless of the issues I had with it, I still give it props for managing to keep my eyes glued to the screen from start to finish. And I highly recommend watching this movie high."

","I watched this movie in the theater, and upon it's ending I did not know how to react to what I had just witnessed. I couldn't decide if I liked the film or not, and I had never seen a film with such a contrast between gorgeous and grotesque imagery. Having already seen the director's other film Hereditary, I had an idea of what to expect in terms of content. Midsommar is basically a horror movie that does not present itself as a horror movie, which kind of makes it more disturbing.<br/><br/>I will not go into much detail because doing so would spoil parts of the film. However, there are a few specific things I wanted to point out. For one, towards the start of the film, there is a scene in the protagonist's apartment where we see a couple of intriguing (but somewhat gory) paintings in the background. They're easy to miss if you're not paying attention, but I'm pretty sure they were meant as foreshadowing. Later on, the central character has a nightmare in which disturbing aspects of a tragedy in her personal life and an event she had witnessed the day before are mixed together. This sequence is effectively upsetting but well put together. Also, the interior of the cabin which the main characters sleep in is decorated with illustrations, but the more you see them the creepier they seem to become. The final scene manages to look bright and colorful yet visually disturbing and extremely grotesque. The conclusion of the story itself can be a little confusing, but the director likely wanted to leave it open to the audience's interpretation.<br/><br/>I've seen a little bit of criticism on social media claiming that this film demonizes pagan/folk culture. While I understand that viewpoint, there have been many cults and pagan cultures to exist with bizarre rituals similar to that of what we see in this film. I don't suspect a lot of people are going to watch the film and think that Sweden's pagan/folk festivals are exactly like what's depicted in Midsommar. The May Pole is a real thing, though.<br/><br/>Finally, in comparison to Hereditary, Midsommar is more visually disturbing, while I found Hereditary to be more nightmarish. Also, Midsommar feels more surreal, partly because of the amount of drug use, which plays a major role in the film. Florence Pugh gives a petrifying performance that really seems to mirror that of Toni Collette in Hereditary. Both films contain a lot of aesthetically striking shots, and each film has a psychologically deep plot. Hereditary is a nightmare; Midsommar is an acid trip gone horribly wrong."

"bazzer-57663","7","0","2","10 August 2019"," Nicely horrible
","Midsommar is a satisfyingly horrific watch, if a bit long. Not particularly original (The Wicker Man, ahem!) but very well scripted and directed with suspense and shocks well-balanced - which is good news, because I was very disappointed with Hereditary.<br/><br/>Some glitches:<br/><br/>Why were they crowning a May Queen at a midsummer (June) festival?<br/><br/>The supposedly-idyllic location looked like a scrubby playing-field with a few sheds on it. I couldn't help thinking how well they did to keep the rusting, netless goalposts out-of-shot, for surely they were there somewhere!<br/><br/>When the first murder occurred (for murder it was) the British couple (unlike the Yanks) were suitably horrified and decided to leave, but why didn't they just whip out their 'phones and call the police? Seems unlikely that they were in a dead spot in a country as modern as Sweden, and we know their phones weren't consfiscated 'cos there were several scenes in which the Yanks were taking photos with their phones.<br/><br/>How does the tiny community survive when it slaughters its members in such numbers?<br/><br/>Dani was well-played as the obligatory confused, wide-eyed innocent but the character was nowhere near as compelling as Edward Woodward's straight-laced virgin cop in The Wicker Man.<br/><br/>But these are minor quibbles: for fans of horror/suspense Midsommar does not disappoint and is well worth a viewing. You do need a strong stomach though (not because of the gore - of which there is surprisingly little - but rather the way the movie leaves you feeling like you've just taken a punch to the gut!)"
"andblom-robin-190-557744","7","0","1","8 August 2019"," A beautiful crazy chocking insane trip!
","Watched Ari Aster's new movie Midsummer yesterday. When I saw Hereditary, I loved the few elements of unpredictability, discomfort, shyness and occultism that were in it. I know I thought it was much creepier than most horror movies, the psychological really creeps under the skin.<br/><br/>Maybe hard to know what to expect from a new movie by such a director (who seems to love sects btw), but I had some idea that he would experiment more with the unexpected, shock / shame and discomfort. Maybe Midsummer was not very creepy but he really creates yet another feeling of discomfort and ""wtf"" mood.<br/><br/>Sometimes there are long scenes when nothing special happens at all, but it works pretty well to build the mood for the next sick thing. In addition, a regular dinner or dance around the corn bar becomes absurd in concert with everything else, just as if nothing has happened.<br/><br/>I really think you either love or hate this movie but I often like odd experimental movies. The film uses camera technology and music in a way that also makes one screw up. Also love how everything gets silent during some really brutal scenes. As if the main characters are in shock. Fantastic acting and fun to see collaboration with a Swedish company.<br/><br/>Ari plays with scenography and props as if he were painting a surrealistic painting. The whole movie is like a long trip.<br/><br/>If you like movies with unexpected end then go and see Midsummer. Don't expect a classic horror movie, but expect an odd bird in the movie art character. Possibly difficult to see when you know what is happening. Best movie of the year!<br/><br/>Gives the 7/10."

","Let me start this review by saying Florence Pugh is an absolute star and if she doesn't win an Oscar in the next ten years I'll be amazed. What a wonderful performance - even outshining the brilliant Will Poulter and Jack Reynor. I really liked this film but I felt it was a bit overlong and maybe could've been cut in places. And one particular place I think it should've been cut is the scene that has left me puzzled. It's a cult film on the same vein as the brilliant The Wicker Man (the original not the embarrassing Nicholas Cage remake). I get that. No need for any supernatural elements. The supernatural is imagined by the Swedish cult, not real. So why do we see Will Poilter with demon eyes when he killed his friend? For me there was nothing apart from this scene that made it non believable. That was what was so good about the Wicker Man - the supernatural was imagined, not real. And the Will Poulter transformation occurrs with a good hour of the film left. I exptected more supernatural events (I'm not a fan of supernatural horror BTW) but everything that followed was perfectly feasible. Am I just being a bit thick and have missed something obvious?

","When I went with a friend to see Christopher Nolan's 'Interstellar', the first thing my friend said to me as the credits rolled was an apt summation of the film: ""Well, you certainly can't accuse him (the director) of lacking ambition"". Interstellar is flawed; but like all Nolan's films, the flaws somehow enhance it. The scale of his vision is intoxicating; his work consistently sweeps me up. I'd far rather see a film that shoots high but falls short than one that is shrivelled by lack of ambition.<br/><br/>There's something of that in Ari Aster's first two films. I found Hereditary to be, for the most part, a chilling and occasionally shocking study of grief, loss and trauma. The last 20 minutes, when it suddenly turns in to the bizarre lovechild of Rosemary's Baby and The Wicker Man didn't work, but was also kind of endearing even as it let down what had gone before. Midsommar takes those last 20 minutes and turns them up to eleven.<br/><br/>As with Hereditary - and many other horror films - the film deals with grief, loss and trauma. It also throws in the vivid experience of a slowly dying relationship being kept alive long past its best. The film's opening chapter - laying the groundwork of the trauma and loss that sets the film's agenda - is superbly evoked. As the characters deal with the aftermath, the film shifts to the increasingly bizarre and horrifying, isolated, neo-pagan Swedish community for the Midsommar festival. Central to this is a mesmeric performance from Florence Pugh who imbues her character with more complexity than the script might try to give her. There are many touchstones as things unravel - The Wicker Man (again), and crucially The Crucible. It's visually and technically stunning - the cinematography, the colours, the composition are all exceptional. Many hauntingly beautiful images remain the mind for a long time.<br/><br/>The film is gripping, and I love that the narrative is unhurried, given room to breathe. But if it's seeking to be a horror film, it never really manages to be; plenty that's horrifying happens, but it's not frightening. The general arc - if not the specifics - is pretty clear from a long way out. There's plenty that's problematic (to put it mildly), that's hard to get past; the familiar trope of American movies that 'bad things happen if you go to Europe'; the wafer-thin (to be kind) characterisation of people of colour; to a rape scene near the film's finish that is used as a troubling motivation for a key decision; the film's use of mental health issues in characters is unhelpful.<br/><br/>Hard as these are to get past, the scope and ambition of the film remains intoxicating; and I do wonder if Ari Aster is consistently, if subtly, trying to suggest throughout the film that none of the events actually happen - a fantasy of sorts in the mind of its central character. Ari Aster hasn't said this publicly (or at least, that I've heard); if this is the case, what's problematic in the film would remain so even with this explanation.<br/><br/>How to summarise? Impossible to do so; if ever there was a film that shows the reductiveness of rating a film out of 5 or 10, then this is it. It overreaches significantly, but is endearing and intriguing almost because of that. It has many problems that are hard to get round. Ari Aster has a great film in him that he hasn't yet made; that much is clear. To get to it, maybe he should leave The Wicker Man further behind him."
"themichaelvu","7","0","2","4 August 2019"," Isolation and Anxiety
","Midsommar captured a very distinct flavor of unease and restlessness. The film's ability to slowly bring the story to a boil is a worthwhile journey, and throughout that progression, it pulls you through a horor, both still and motionless. The cadent framing that drowns the idyllic scenery in perpetual anxiety really does its work, and I find the protagonist's expressions and emotions crucial to this development. However, its poignancy is lost in its cinematography, and I find its characters to be rather flat-footed. The plotline felt generic by the way the story elements developed, and my expectations were rather carried out. Overall, it was an interesting perspective in the picturesque horror of psychedelic and emotional trauma."

","Midsommar is a movie that unfolds long after you have actually watched it. Its rich cinematography might grip right from the start but the numerous allegories will make you think days after you have experienced this film.<br/><br/>This movie is quite an experience indeed. It makes me think of a mixture of The Village and Mandy. It makes me think of the former because this movie is falsely advertised as a horror movie and could rather be described as a tense drama. Both films take place in secluded areas involving traditional societies and their rituals. Both movies have a slow pace and are controversially received. It makes me think of the latter because the visual aspects are quite vivid. Especially the use of colours has psychedelic elements that make viewers think of uneasy drug trips. Both movies slowly intensify and end rather grislily.<br/><br/>The story is quickly told. Three anthropologist students are invited by their Swedish classmate to assist Midsommar festivities in his secluded hometown but what starts as a fascinating trip soon becomes a horrifying experience.<br/><br/>The characters in the film are quite intriguing. Lead actress Florence Pugh plays an insecure young woman suffering from panic attacks who has to cope with the grisly fact that her bipolar sister killed their parents before committing suicide. Her boyfriend played by Jack Reynor has a hard time dealing with his girlfriend's negative moods but doesn't want to let her down and actually invites her to the trip to Sweden to help her change her mind. Another loud-mouthed student played by Will Poulter resents her coming with them and feels that she has a negative impact on her boyfriend and is spoiling everyone's anticipation. The third student played by William Jackson Harper keeps a lower profile and is the more intellectual type who gets into a heated conflict with the young woman's boyfriend because he wants to steal the idea for his thesis. Finally, there is the Swedish student played by Vilhelm Blomgren who seems to be very calm, compassionate and friendly but actually has a love interest in the young woman and feels that her boyfriend doesn't treat her correctly. All those underlying conflicts surface as the characters face extreme situations in Sweden.<br/><br/>Revealing you anything more about the movie would spoil its mezmerizing enjoyment. There are a few negative elements to point out however. The movie has a very slow pace and slightly overstays its welcome which might be frustrating for less patient viewers. The plot is relatively simple and predictable even though many critics try to interpret too much into the movie to forcedly fill the void. Let's mention that the movie features some gore and nudity and shouldn't be watched by anyone who isn't eighteen years old.<br/><br/>In the end, Midsommar is a unique experience that deserves to be watched on multiple occasions and discussed with friends in order to be fully appreciated. The unique atmosphere, intriguing characters and stylish cinematography make up for some lengths and an at times simplistic plot. As someone else has pointed out, this movie might give a blow to the Swedish tourism industry as grisly horrors unfold in bright daylight which is once again quite unique for such a grisly drama."

Immersion in the picture of the world of ancient people.<br/><br/>For me, the film became a study of the collision of modern European culture and the ancient, archetypal.<br/><br/>A complete negation by a modern man that used to be STRONGLY differently leads the main characters to a bad trip (imho psychedelics in the film also for laying a bridge between the audience and the world of the ancients).<br/><br/>It was alive, it surrounded people and was present in the very fabric of everyday life. For them, the relationship with the earth, water, all sorts of offerings, spirits, celebrations was as much an integral part of reality as a smartphone and YouTube nowdays. This is a different relationship with life, death, sex, birth, the surrounding nature.<br/><br/>It's all in the shell of horror stories. But without ""wooh, it flew around the corner.""
With slowly coming to an Happy Ending )))<br/><br/>Pregnant, sensitive, I do not recommend."
"gleasonjon","9","0","3","22 July 2019"," Beautiful film and spoilers/thought/questions
","I found this to be such a beautifully shot film. Aster really has his own unique style and, if you've seen Heredity, a great insight into people's feelings of doubt, remorse, pain and acceptance. Not a scary film, just creepy. The shot in the car and plane really makes you feel off kilter and on your toes. He certainly has a style with his ""gut punch"" moments.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Spoilers and questions
When the elders jump off the cliff, Dani finds Christian with the woman, and of course during the sex scene itself and the villager who sacrificed himself, the rest of the villagers in the immediate vicinity react to the pain, anguish, delight. Are they actually feeling this, in some sort of supernatural bonding thing with those that are close to them or are they mearly acting as a form of spiritual or mental bonding with the person? I feel as if they do actually feel it, and somehow that helps the victim.<br/><br/>I do feel that the visitors were never to be part of the sacrifices. But that it happened due to rules being broken. Pissing on the ancestors, freaking out over the elders death, possibly telling others and photographing the sacred book. Had none of that happened, I do think those people would have lived."
"alexryn","6","0","1","21 July 2019"," Imperfect, but talented attempt in deconstruction of horror genre
","I'd like to start by saying that Ari Aster is great artist, in my opinion. Hereditary for instance was a true revelation for me. A new word in horrors and a proof that they are not necessarily need to be shallow and can be truly scary and artsy (in the very best way possible) at the same time. I'd like to think of his debut as a deconstruction of horror genre (successful, unlike this one), more specifically: movies about demonic possession. Not to get into details: it was atmospheric, scary, clever and even funny towards the end - all the aspects of horror, in other words. Besides it had some great character development, deep psychological take on family drama and many more. Why do I get so much into the first one? Well, let's have a look how Midsommar fails by comparison.
Being, again, in my opinion, an attempt of deconstructing horror genre (here - about cults) it also, like in previous one, has really cool insides and analysis of romantic relationships, dealing with trauma and personal take on the family as a concept. Again, great cinematography, the actors are all top notch, interesting story even, exciting conflicts established etc. BUT! Like his characters-anthropologists Ari Aster here is not able to finish his thesis. Why? Because the movie is getting lost eventually in all the genre features and attributes. It's all in the bad (in my opinion) finale: character development? Forget it, the main character becomes just a simple offended girlfriend and not a complex character worth sympathy as she was introduced at first. Deconstruction of a genre? More like typical example, representative of one if you will. Deep analysis of psychological family drama? Try just a precursor of this banal horror story to reveal itself in the most ordinary fashion.
All the more disappointing it was for me that all of this could have unfolded beautifully since the movie had it all. But for the ending. However I would recommend watching it due to the talents involved and most probably will watch director's cut myself if it ever arrives."
"muchswagfunzies","6","0","2","20 July 2019"," The good structure of the story falls apart.
","If the movie had introduced the cult, and the second act was about Dani and her family (the actual intro), the film would have felt complete. But instead, you go in wanting answers, wanting character development, wanting so much things that never fully get resolved. I felt unsatisfied at the end. But had it started with the cult, it would have been phenomal and the loose ends, plot holes and insanely long uncomfortable scenes would not have felt so unattached to what we think the story was going to be about.<br/><br/>It's a shame it didn't live up to the hype. Until halfway through it felt like this was going to transcend the horror genre, but rather, it reinforced the importance of story and structure and how it's all essential to a good ending."

","Calling this a horror is really quite misleading, thats not an accurate moniker to give this movie.

Some of the story is told in very interesting ways as well, from the less subtle like panning across telling local pictures to interesting hints such as the runes on the hand drawn picture of the girl along with the same runes on her tunic later.<br/><br/>Its very difficult to explain a lot of this movie without a lot of spoilers and frankly I would very strongly recommend you watch this movie without any spoilers.

"griffinberiont","8","0","3","14 July 2019"," Fantastically Disturbing
","This is hands down one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen, and I mean that in the absolute best way possible. 'Midsommar' constantly had me saying ""what is going on"", ""what the hell"", and ""oh my god.""<br/><br/>The only downside is that I came into it expecting it to be more of that supernatural horror, like 'Hereditary', with a little more of a jump/pop scare, but I was not disappointed by the end.<br/><br/>This movie won't have you afraid to sleep at night, keeping one eye open for the boogyman, but it will unnerve you, make you squirm, and surprisingly make you laugh a little. There is a perfect amount of comedic relief, and it is well need with the amount of disturbing images.<br/><br/>This is hands down a movie that needs to be seen to understand the gravity of how disturbing it is, and again I mean that with the most praise. An excellent follow up to 'Hereditary', the absolute chaos that is 'Midsommar' will undoubtedly stand alone in horror genre."

Midsommar I totally was all in from the start, for its long running time it didn't feel as long as that, we must credit the film for setting a good pace.
2 scenes in this film had me quite shocked, when you see you'll know exactly what I'm going on about.

"jceidem9123","9","0","3","13 July 2019"," A story about grief
","I thought this was a stunning movie- beautiful art direction, cinematography, acting, music and story. Although this movie has its moments of gore, I personally don't think it's as gruesome as the reviews are saying it is- I found Suspiria far more gruesome and disturbing.<br/><br/>What really intrigued me about this story was the concept of grief. For me the story was about grief and how to truly live life and experience that grief in order to be set free. Life is messy and filled with moments of pain and sorrow and this film explores the complexities and horror of it all in a beautiful yet eerie way."
"craigthomas90","6","0","1","12 July 2019"," Horror...?
","It's not a horror movie! It has moments of suspense but is unfulfilling. I was disappointed and bored to be honest. It's fair to say everyone may have different desires when it comes to horror movies but this does not fall into the category of horror. If you venture to see this un-complexed film about a cult, you may enjoy it more than I did. My biggest mistake was believing it would be a horror film."
"feinberg","7","0","2","11 July 2019"," Are you ok?
","I found this film enjoyable and visually stunning, and also fun to think about. There are many critiques one could make - the unfortunate use of a ""disabled"" person as a signifier of corruption, the way the cliched way that the European non-Christian Other is sinister and sadistic.<br/><br/>But I will only talk about what I thought was the main theme, which came through pretty clearly-which is the contrast between two ways of dealing with trauma. The film starts with Dani's shocking trauma, and Christian's inability and unwillingness to engage her fear for her sister or her grief afterward. He interprets it, he tells her what to do, or he asks her, repeatedly, ""are you OK?"" without any actual empathy. Her trauma, as his friends point out, is a burden to him. When she feels real embodied physical pain from her grief and trauma, she always goes off to experience it alone--in the bathroom of his friends' apartment, in the bathroom on the plane, in the weird house during her mushroom trip. She has no one to hold her, no family, as Pelle tells her. Christian does not know how to comfort Dani; he just wants to ignore or talk away her suffering. His attempts to be with her--saying he probably won't go to Sweden at the party after getting the tickets, or offering to delay taking mushrooms, are not genuine. Her troubles are something for him to escape or manage, not to feel.<br/><br/>Once we get to Sweden, it becomes more important that Josh and Christian are anthropology grad students, as the movie enacts Renato Rosaldo's critique of his discipline in the classic article, ""Death and a Headhunter's Rage."" After witnessing a gruesome ritual, neither of them have an emotional response. They are interested in the ritual for only two reasons: 1) analyzing it's meaning or origins (and not much of this); and 2) as an opportunity for their own competitive ambitions. They cannot experience the emotional ""force"" of the ritual, and in fact appear to be emotionally dead--even motionless in the subsequent meal. Their professional ambitions make them unable to collaborate. They are loyal neither to each other nor to the values of their host community; Josh violates ethical standards by photographing the book, and Christian eagerly betrays him.<br/><br/>Rosaldo argued that only by experiencing intense emotional trauma after the death of his anthropologist wife in the field could he understand how Philippine Ilongot headhunters feel compelled by rage to respond to family members' deaths by hunting for a victim and taking their head; before that he just wanted to analyze or interpet this as a interesting piece of ""culture.""<br/><br/>The villagers, on the other hand, do not talk about each other's emotions or traumas; they experience them. Pelle tells Dani that he shares her grief because of his parents' death, but the theme really comes out in Harga. When one of the ritual suicides does not die in his fall, but writhes in pain with a smashed leg, they all moan and cry with him. When a drugged Christian consummates his destined tryst with Pelle's young sister, all the assembled women writhe together, sharing her sexual pleasure. In the fire, they all feel their comrade's pain as his legs are consumed.<br/><br/>During the dance, Dani finally feels pleasure and connection as she dances with the Harga women. She wants to share her joy with Christian, but he is completely oblivious (though he isn't entirely to blame here). But after she peeks through the keyhole and sees him having sex, she runs off as usual moaning. But the other Harga women don't console her; they share her emotional agony, mimicking all her sighs and anguished shouts.<br/><br/>There is a critique of Western society here; we are too isolated and emotionally disconnected to deal with trauma. We can talk about it, or label it; but lack the ability for true empathy that can only happen in a real community.<br/><br/>Of course, Dani is also a selfish jerk, just like the others, even though she is a psychology student and they study anthropology.<br/><br/>The film draws on a melange of different cultural tidbits and beliefs. When I lived in Mexico, I heard many stories of a similar ""love potion"" using pubic hair and fluids from the genitals; I believe that Clarence Thomas was referencing this folk belief when he joked about finding a pubic hair in his Pepsi."
"dsohn7","3","0","2","11 July 2019"," passive characters; frustrating to watch.
","I enjoyed the set up-the backstory, the characters, their relationships and the unspoken tension between them...I was hooked. But as the movie went on, they all remained passive throughout, which is frustrating to watch for 2.5 hours. I was hoping for character arcs, especially from the lead, but she doesn't make any decisions and is pretty much driven by the plot, at least until the VERY end, which didn't feel earned because there was such little growth and change to her character. Although Hereditary ultimately explores similar concepts of a lack of control, there was at least active decision-making and answer-seeking from the lead, with an illusion of control. Midsommar was packaged in such a unique way, it came as a disappointment to find the story was nothing more than a cheap slasher with no substance."
"jg244-1","7","0","1","11 July 2019"," Stylish, Yet Derivative
","There is no doubt that director Ari Aster is emerging as a 21st century horror auteur along with contemporary Jordan Peele. HIs style has become rather noticeable, with frequent use of runes and symbols, slow and intentionally uncomfortable tracking shots, unsettling atmospheres, uncompromising and almost scenery chewing levels of acting from his performers, etc. Midsommar is no exception here. The production values are astounding, from the flowery costumes and accessories, to the serene yet off-putting setting on the Swedish countryside.<br/><br/>The film is not without its faults though. Firstly, at a running time of 143 minutes, the film tends to drag a little while setting the atmosphere, particularly in the beginning where it spends a little too much time with Shining-like driving shots and prolonged introductions to the locals. Secondly, the setup of our protagonist feels somewhat half-baked. The film starts our protagonist's sister committing a murder suicide with her parents to set the overall tone of the film. It's attention grabbing yes, but as the film progresses, it is more or less forgotten with the exception of some spirit cameos. In the big picture, I feel it wasn't really needed considering the bleakness to come. But where the film really falls short for me however, is surprisingly the originality of the story. To Aster's credit, there are only so many things you can do with the twists and turns of the human sacrificing cult narrative, but there are one too many moments where I was reminded of The Wicker Man. Even down to the point of a possible nod of its remake involving a... bear skin.<br/><br/>That being said, I still enjoyed the film. It wasn't exactly the second coming of the Wicker Man, but it certainly shows promise for its talented writer/director. I will be looking forward to see the next nightmarish vision to come from this emerging auteur."

This movie was amazing visually and the way it was filmed, but the storyline was SO SLOW. It honestly was the longest 2 and 1/2 hours of my life. There was never really a climax point where everything just broke down and went marbles, and that made it quite boring for me. One exciting thing would happen, then it would be boring for 30-45 mins, and that cycle would continue the whole movie making it difficult to follow the plot. Definitely not worth the 13$ I spent, and my friend who I saw it with agreed. I had high hopes after jordan peele's review, but am very let down and disappointed!!!!

"davidsaid","8","0","1","7 July 2019"," Ok but not a patch on Hereditary
","I thought this film was ok, but not nearly as successful as Hereditary. Things i admired about Hereditary have been stripped from the film, the confidence to leave any humour from the film for one. Secondly the use of teen early twenties good looking actors to add some sex appeal, which the director used here. Both of which bring the terror notch down a peg or two. Hereditary was a very good exercise in directing a film that kept the seriousness alive, making it that much more daunting and cold, unlike most modern horror films; The Witch (2015) by Robert Eggers also succeeded in getting that right. Here we have a few teen giggle jokes 'pube in my pie' which yes are fun but i was hoping that Aster would be intellectual and individual enough to be able to not bow to such demands. I don't know its just to my taste i guess, but i feel that the best horrors dont need such humour, Rosemarys Baby, The Exorcist to name but a few. I haven't lost confidence yet in Aster as we cant expect to epically good horrors in a row. I look forward to seeing if he can come back to form with his next film, although we'll be lucky if its another horror for the comparison. Go see i Midsommar for sure, but for me it wasnt what i was hoping for."
"jmjoneill-43100","6","0","1","7 July 2019"," A well made but overlong mystery movie.
","At two and a half hours long Midsomar isn't afraid to take it's time. Set primarily in a remote commune in Sweeden we're given plenty of time to take in our surroundings with wide, lingering views of the scenery. With that time however the film fails to say much.<br/><br/>Soon after the main plot begins I could shake the feeling that I'd seen this all before. It shares too many similarities with The Wickerman (1973) for it to be a coincidence. It feels like a reboot for the post Get Out era sharing a similar sounding score to Jordan Peeles debut.<br/><br/>There are moments of brilliance in this film, from the representation of people's expeience on Mushrooms to some excellent direction and scene transition. The leading light is Florenece Pugh however, her character suffers an unimaginable loss in the opening scenes and her sense of grief is palpable. I empathise with her immediately as she attempts to rebound and life her life but struggles with panic attacks and depression. Her experience in the commune in ways gives her an emotional outlet, she is allowed grieve and she is given a support system which she never knew she lacked.<br/><br/>It is the other characters in Midsomar that fail to garner any semblance of empathy or connection. Christian (Jack Reynor) is written as the archetypal asshole. Every decision he makes is worse than the last leading you to think that he is purposely trying to upset everyone around him. While Reynor is immensely watchable his character is just so unbelievably self centered that it begins to grate.<br/><br/>The other characters here aren't fleshed out nearly enough to be thought about, merely tagging along for plot devise purposes which is a shame because in Will Poulter and William Jackson Harper they cast two brilliant actors for light roles. Instead we spend time getting to learn the rituals of the community. While interesting I feel as if too much time is spent establishing that the practices are ancient and related to the mid summer practices of old. There is beauty in the scene choreography however and I could watch the dining scenes all day.<br/><br/>At the end I wasn't shocked or excited by what is seen. It's certainly a film that deserves to be seen and if you want to watch it watch it in the cinema because it looks and sounds spectacular. It's just a shame that it doesn't capitalise on its own hype of being something bold and new when really it's been done before."

The lead actress is also magnificent and you can't help but feel so sorry for what she has had to go through! The opening of the film is extremely upsetting!<br/><br/>However . . . Yes this is an artsy film I know but it really does drag too much! This dragging of events along with the added strange humour leaves you feeling rather not much at all! So many scenes that would've been quite shocking or chilling all lose their impact and even though what you're seeing is crazy it doesn't feel it due to the incredibly slow pacing of this film! I just never thought I felt too much of any emotion during the film, not too much fear, not too much shock, not too much of anything, which for me is why it was disappointing!
I can understand why maybe the characters never felt too much fear and it was shot this way as they are often under the influence of drugs, but this numbing of the main characters senses also numbs the viewers experience!<br/><br/>Hereditary is up there as one of my favorite ever horror films by the way I really like this director.

Ari Aster is a brilliant visual stylist, but with Midsommar he utterly failed to develop believable characters and situations. Characters start out annoying and then don't really develop at all despite the extraordinary circumstances.. Everything that happened was pretty much locked into place as soon as they stepped onto the ceremonial grounds, so why all the half-assed subplots?<br/><br/>Hereditary also had that sense of watching the inevitable play out, but with that film you cared deeply about the family and were deeply horrified by what was being done to them.

Everything was going great until the last 25 minutes, the movie was slowly bubbling up to an anticipated horrific ending, and then it happened.....stupid singing and frolicking overload that makes you feel embarrassed to be sat in the theatre justifying all the nonsense as anything but. There is a ritualistic sex scene at the end that should make you involuntarily exclaim 'WTF?!' unless you're a total potato. Ari just got a little too 'creative' and totally killed the scene. Overall, it doesn't leave you feeling satisfied - it never quite lives up to the intriguing trailer. And that's a shame as had it not been for that sudden hard-left in the last 20 mins, it could've delivered an enthralling climax worthy of any cult classic. Another example of a gifted filmmaker that gets lost in their own ideas and drifts off the track and crashes head on into a tree!"

","In spoiler free short summary, a woman grieving for the loss of her entire family accompanies her boyfriend and his anthropology studies group to Sweden, invited by a member of the group, to partake in his village's solstice ritual. They first witness, then become unwilling participants in, some DEEPLY disturbing rituals. Oh...and there's a bear. Sadly there's not much more to it than that. People will try to explain the film as metaphors of grief, relationships and entitlement etc. but if that was what the story intended, the metaphors were too deeply buried in the subtext for me to process them during my viewing. I will spend some time trying to figure out how a film so well acted, so beautifully filmed and so atmospheric failed to deliver a fulfilling experience.<br/><br/>Being a fan of Hereditary, I was looking forward to this for some time. I saw it in a packed theater on a Tuesday night opening, and I assume it was packed on the strength of Hereditary, which I consider the best horror film of the last 10 years. Midsommar is daring and ambitious but unfortunately this film did not deliver the same satisfaction and I could spend hours/days trying to analyze why.<br/><br/>This is definitely not a film for the masses, although the grotesque scenes alone may garner enough word of mouth to draw in the curious. It may even become obligatory viewing for anyone who enjoys cult movies. Some scenes were so hard to process that the audience I was with often laughed innapropriatly to clear the air. There were other times that scenes of horror were presented so comically I could not help but chuckle under my breath. I find it hard to believe that is what the director intended. Despite my disappointment, Ari Astor has such complete control of his films, I cannot wait for the next one. The studio,A24, was bold to back this film and I hope they continue to put their faith in Mr. Astor.<br/><br/>I would definitely not allow anyone under 16 to see it.
