","Don't get me wrong; this movie is very well made. It was well acted, shot and directed. I was never bored.<br/><br/>But I started out watching a movie about a hit man who shoots mob victims sent back in time from the future, and knows that his final victim will be his older self. Interesting idea--even if it's not very plausible. But okay, let's just run with it. That's the movie I saw in the trailers, the one I expected to see.<br/><br/>So, when his future self comes back, present-day self hesitates for a moment and future self gets the drop on him and runs off. Now present-day self must hunt down and kill future self. Also interesting.<br/><br/>SPOILER FOLLOWS<br/><br/>But then, it's all about a telekinetic farm kid who will one day rule the world with an iron fist. . . er, brain. . . if he isn't stopped.<br/><br/>Huh. . . ? Where the hell did that come from? I know, I know, it's foreshadowed by showing us that 10% of the population has trivial telekinetic powers. They can make coins float above their hands.<br/><br/>But to me, this film starts one story and then switches in mid-stream to a story stemming from a second, unrelated science fiction premise.<br/><br/>While it was refreshing that the movie didn't just turn into a series of action sequences in which JGL tries to kill BW (which would have been a pretty one-sided conflict, admittedly) I found this shift in emphasis to be far more distracting than Joseph Gordon-Levitt's prosthetic nose. Which I never had a problem with.<br/><br/>Anyway, I appear to be the only one bothered by this so just go ahead and enjoy the movie."

","Looper was enjoyable enough but I really can't understand all the praise. Maybe I expected too much of this film, but I was looking forward to a slick piece of speculative sci-fi that was thought- provoking, realistic and fairly deep. Instead, I got a lazily strung together generic action movie with a splash of time travel and super- powers.<br/><br/>""I don't want to talk time travel sh*t"" or something along those lines is commonly used in this film to breeze past any plot holes and presumably stop the narrative become too complex. This irked me as it was one of the main draws in my opinion.<br/><br/>I was very frustrated by the little amount of effort that was put in to creating a futuristic society. Forget the realistic near-future depicted spectacularly in films such as Children of Men. This world is more akin to the recent Dredd 3D film. Shallow and lacking in realism. Personally, I would love to have had more information on the state of government etc as the mobs seemed to be running everything but there really isn't any explanation given to this at all.<br/><br/>The dynamics of time travel in this film are completely unbelievable. The notion that you can chop someone leg or whatever off and their ""future self"" will lose it is completely absurd. You're clearly creating a brand new entity when you come back in time. Put it this way. If I created a copy of myself from 0.1 seconds ago next to me. Are we going to be magically linked? Probably not. It also presupposes some sort of multi-verse scenario, in which case, Bruce Willis's character shouldn't even exist in that eventuality. I don't want to rant about this too much but I thought of all the ways they could depict time travel. This was one of the worst. <br/><br/>And then there are the superpowers. Come on. Everyone has pretty much agreed biological evolution is basically over for us and it's all about technical augmentation now. The idea that in 33 years we'll be developing telekinesis is laughable to the point where the fact you're meant to accept this is almost offensive. <br/><br/>On top of this, the whole plot in general is very hard to swallow and lacks in verisimilitude. Again, I find myself being forced to accept these absurd scenarios such as the fact that the mob can't dispose of bodies, but can set up secret time machines?? Or that they have to send them 30 years back in time and not just 2 billion years or whatever. <br/><br/>And then there's the 30 year montage. Oh dear lord. I turned to my girlfriend and said. ""Man, don't you just hate it when you get old and suddenly you're Bruce Willis"". There was actually laughter in the cinema when Levitt morphs into Willis. <br/><br/>All in all, I really wouldn't agree with the reviews saying its clever etc. In my opinion the plot is extremely lazy and is secondary to the action. Which is fine. If you want to watch an action film. One of the main reason's I've even written this view is to counterbalance these reviews raving about this very mediocre film calling it a ""masterpiece"". I read reviews touting it's cleverness or how it goes to extra lengths to not leave plot holes and I think: am I even watching the same movie here?<br/><br/>Personally, I found myself rather disappointed."
"o1191108","1","476","775","6 October 2012"," A disappointing let down from start to finish - caused by bad plot
","!SPOILER ALERT! Contrary to the trailers, this is NOT a film about time travel. It IS a film about a telekinetic toddler (who is not in the trailers).<br/><br/>If you are expecting this film to be like Blade Runner, Primer or 13 Monkeys, then you may well be VERY disappointed.<br/><br/>Only about 5 minutes of the film seemed to actually involve time travel or Bruce Willis fighting his past self. When the story does attempt to explore these issues it does so embarrassingly badly. Half way through the film the plot changes AWAY from time travel and becomes a film about trying to kill a telekinetic little boy in the current day. A boy who has only a very weak connection to the initial plot about time travel.<br/><br/>This is really two entirely different plots badly mixed in to one. One plot is about time travel. The other plot is about the dangers of toddlers with uncontrollable telekinesis. Unfortunately the film does neither of these plots well, and ends up ruining both.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, the film moves very slowly in certain places. This just gives the audience time to think about how bad the plot it is.<br/><br/>There is virtually no action either - unless you count Bruce Willis's character shooting defenseless toddlers (for which the certificate should surely be more than 15), or needless torture and execution scenes. There is just a lot of running away from people taking badly aimed pot shots. (This happens a lot). Apparently nobody can shoot straight in the future. The only action scene worthy of the name comes in the last 5 minutes where Bruce Willis suddenly turns ninja and takes out ALL the bad guys in about 30 seconds, and then walks off. It's almost as if the writers got to the end of the story and then thought, ""Oh yeah - we should probably have Bruce Willis firing some guns or something ..."" <br/><br/>This film fails so pathetically to deal with time travel that it is frankly insulting to the audience. They don't give good explanations about why time travel exists, or how it works. Fair enough. There is a certain suspension of disbelief in any time travel movie. However, they DO establish certain rules about time travel during the film, which they then break, re-establish and break again whenever it is convenient for the writers.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis attempts to explain time travel, and give a justification for the writer's itinerant stance on the matter, only to then smash is hands on the table and angrily shout ""It doesn't matter!"". This makes it clear that the writers didn't even think they were being clever or original. They clearly knew the plot made no sense, and they were just making a pathetic excuse about time travel being ""flaky"" to justify their random plot lurches and inconsistencies.<br/><br/>The whole premise of a ""Looper"" was never satisfactorily explained: 1) Why did the mafia boss who supposedly ""owned"" the city live in a little basement? In his pajamas? 2) ""It is almost impossible to get rid of a body in the future, because of tracking ... cough ... something ... cough-cough."" So NATURALLY using time travel is the EASIEST of the available options to dispose of a body!? If a body disappears from the future, for example in a furnace, then surely it also disappears from the future in time travel? Same difference. 3) If mafia in the future are the sole owners and users of time travel, then why don't they just use it to take over the world so that they don't need to even worry about disposing of bodies? 4) Why didn't they just send the loopers back already dead when closing a loop, so that there was no possibility of failure? 5) Why did they always get THE SAME looper to close THEIR OWN loop? Asking for trouble. 6) Why even have more than one looper? Surely the job wasn't that strenuous that they needed to take shifts? <br/><br/>They broke their own rules on time travel, and made the ending of the film impossible and irrelevant given the events in the middle: As soon as the younger version shot himself at the end, then he couldn't have lived to meet the woman in China and eventually travel back in time, which means he couldn't have ever caused his past self to meet the rain man, and so the rain man would not be standing there in the corn field. Everything would have reverted back to how it was before - in exactly the same way that it DID DO EARLIER on in the film when he fell off the balcony and died and the bit where Bruce Willis traveled back in time got repeated. The rain man would have grown up and taken over the world in the same way he did before, and Bruce Willis's wife would still be dead.<br/><br/>They never actually explained WHY the first thing the rain man wanted to do was to kill the loopers in the future. Presumably it was because they were the only people who could go back in time and possibly stop him? So why didn't he just kill them with telekinesis like he did the rest of his enemies? Why did he chose to kill them in the ONLY method which would actually give them the opportunity to stop him in the past - namely, by sending them back to the past, alive. <br/><br/>The story never really addressed or capitalized on Bruce Willi's character being evil. This could have been a great angle to really explore, but instead they just washed over it.<br/><br/>This film was a dismal train wreck of ideas with great potential."
"janus-20","10","523","857","29 September 2012"," Very clever, very original and very welcome.
","I would have thought it doubtful that anyone could have anything new to add to the sci-fi sub category of time travel movies. After watching Looper yesterday, i'm happy to report that Rian Johnson has removed those doubts and given me hope that sci-fi in Hollywood can be more than just empty spectacle.<br/><br/>First off i would say, don't get discouraged from watching the film if you think its going to be too complex or difficult to follow. To follow the story and recognise characters motivations does require a little concentration, but not to the point that you wont enjoy the action beats and other more visceral elements.<br/><br/>The story is well constructed, information and plot points are presented at an entertaining and well judged pace. There are some nice little throw away visual references and metaphors which, if you catch them, add a nice texture to the story and stop it feeling too clinical in its plotting.<br/><br/>The script is tight, hard edged and very dry in its humour, the actors are fantastic. I think its fair to say that Joseph Gordon-Levitt is well on his way to being ""one to watch"", Bruce Willis pops back to life here, clearly enjoying himself again, (although i wouldn't say this is solely a Bruce Willis movie in that definition).<br/><br/>This is a brilliant movie experience, its an wholly original and entertaining idea, that the writer/director has managed to successfully transpose to film without, it would appear to a layman, pressure or interference from external sources.<br/><br/>No matter how much of a good time you will have watching this film (and you will), Hollywood could stand to learn much more from it."
"markdroulston","8","226","363","27 September 2012"," Refreshingly original
","Sitting here the day after viewing Rian Johnson's Looper, parts of it are still falling in to place. Standing out amongst this years crop of mostly underwhelming sequels and comic book adaptations, Looper thunders onto the screen, showing, much like Inception did two years ago, that there is a place in 2012 for fresh material and just how good it can be when it's done right.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a hit-man for an organised crime syndicate tasked with assassinating targets sent from the future. After being confronted with his future self (Bruce Willis) and failing to perform, Young Joe is forced to track down Old Joe and finish the job before being tracked down himself by the nefarious mob led by Abe (Jeff Daniels). However there is much more to the story than the basic premise, and Johnson isn't afraid to keep details close to his chest until later in the film than most movies of this type, so I won't spoil them here.<br/><br/>While certainly paying subtle homage to its predecessors, Looper is a stunningly original sci-fi masterpiece, vastly superior to any of the higher profile action releases this year. While certainly made on a much larger playing field than Johnson's previous work (Brick, The Brothers Bloom), there is still a small-scale, independent feel to the film, and it benefits from clearly staying completely under the control of the young director. Delivering excitement sprinkled with thoughtful themes of personal sacrifice, he offers us much to chew on.<br/><br/>Johnson understands that a successful action film doesn't need an explosion every ten minutes, and allows ample time for developing character and story, something which will likely divide audiences. Looper is very deliberately constructed, and after the highly charged opening establishing the intricate time-travel premise and direction of the plot, Johnson scales back the action almost too much as he ambitiously juggles the many and varied story elements he has created. Thankfully, any weakness in the middle of the film is largely overshadowed as Johnson launches the third act with such ferocity that the stark change of pace leaves you breathless.<br/><br/>Despite the problems in the middle of the film, Looper overcomes its flaws purely by being that rare beast in Hollywood nowadays, the totally original script. Not an adaptation, not a sequel or remake, but a fresh idea from the mind of an immensely talented young film-maker. In a perfect world, Looper would be the game changer it deserves to be, slapping Hollywood studios across the face and announcing that not everything has to be a PG-13 franchise based on a comic book. It's unlikely that this will the case, and it remains to be seen whether or not the film will even be a success, but it's encouraging to see that there are young auteurs at work who are fighting to craft new and exciting stories, even if we only get to see the results every year or two.<br/><br/>tinribs27.wordpress.com"
"Turfseer","3","266","446","29 September 2012"," Terminator meets Twilight Zone, Season 3, Episode 8
","The near universal critical acclaim for 'Looper' is something I'm having a hard time fathoming. I suppose we haven't seen a great sci-fi thriller in such a long time, that as soon as a mediocre to average flick such as this one comes along, everyone is jumping on the bandwagon, practically calling it a masterpiece! <br/><br/>My first problem with 'Looper' is the overall concept. A crime syndicate in the future (2074)wants to dispose of its victims by sending them 30 years back into the past and have them disposed of by hit men, who they pay with bars of silver. Once these hit men (the loopers) live their lives for thirty years, the syndicate decides to dispose of them by sending them back to 2044, where they'll be disposed of, sometimes even by their younger selves.<br/><br/>It's explained that in the future bodies are 'tagged' so by sending them back in time, they cannot be traced. But why can't the syndicate send their victims in the present immediately back to 65 million B.C. where they would probably be immediately eaten by a dinosaur or other prehistoric animal, thus preventing the time-line from being tampered with? And by cutting out the middlemen (i.e. the loopers) in this way, the syndicate can keep all the profits for themselves.<br/><br/>Once we're introduced to the novelty of the how the looper scheme operates, the novelty soon wears off. We see Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) traveling to the cornfield and then performing executions one too many times. Finally, there's a plot twist: fellow looper Seth appears at Joe's apartment, explaining that his 30 year old self from the future appears in the cornfield and he's unable to finish the job. Abe, the enforcer from the future, forces Joe to betray Seth, who's tortured and his alter ego from the future is hunted down. You might ask what this has to do with time travel or science-fiction. Actually nothing--it's simply all action-thriller at this point in time in the script.<br/><br/>Soon, Joe finds himself in the same position as Seth. His 30 year old future self (Bruce Willis) appears but manages to prevent younger Joe from doing him in. In a rather derivative idea borrowed from the 'Terminator' series, Willis must dispose of a child who will one day grow up to be the 'Rainmaker', the sinister figure in the future who is now bent on eliminating all the loopers.<br/><br/>It might have been interesting had we seen what this Rainmaker character looked and acted like in the future, but that never occurs. We're asked to be content with meeting little Cid, our future Rainmaker, who has telekinetic powers coupled with a severe anger management problem. One is immediately reminded of Billy Mumy in the Season 3 Twilight Zone episode, ""It's a Good Life"", who plays a mutant who terrifies adults by 'wishing them away to the cornfield'. So the second half of 'Looper' feels much more like fantasy-horror than Sci-fi action thriller.<br/><br/>The meeting between the younger and older Joes in the diner is perhaps the most interesting scene in the film as it underscores the contrast between the more impulsive younger self with the more seasoned, experienced older one. Unfortunately, there is hardly any additional interaction between the two altar egos, with older Joe stalking off to blow away Abe and his crew of malevolent meanies. In true Bruce Willis fashion, the aging 'Die Hard' legend, is up to his old tricks, by machine-gunning most of the bad guys, sans Kid Blue, who appears out of nowhere on his flying motorcycle and immediately gets himself killed, instead of Joe, who is his intended target.<br/><br/>If the Looper second half feels a bit slower than the first, that's because director Rian Johnson spends a little too much time out on the farm, with Joe courting Sara (Emily Blunt). Although there's a feeling that we've seen this before, the ending proves to be passable as we finally have something to feel good about. Younger Joe sacrifices himself, preventing older Joe from killing Sara. He does this after he's able to foresee that Cid, growing up as the Rainmaker, will hold a perpetual grudge due to the murder of his mother and will take it out on all of humanity (including all the loopers) in the future.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Joe's sacrifice, is not enough to make either young Joe or older Joe, likable. Younger Joe, before he takes his own life, is a criminal and a drug addict and older Joe, is responsible for murdering the second child on his list of three potential Rainmakers. In terms of a sympathetic protagonists, there's little to like here at all.<br/><br/>'Looper' is also unable to score points with its look at the dystopian future. One feels that one is simply viewing a second hand set from 'Robocop'--in that film, 'Old Detroit' looks remarkably similar to Looper's Kansas City of 2044 including the grimy 'futuristic' cars and emphasis on vagrancy as a national blight.<br/><br/>The performances in Looper are all acceptable, with an honorable mention going to little Pierce Gagnon as Cid, who manages to handle a number of complicated lines and take direction in a fashion way above his chronological age.<br/><br/>In the end, Looper proves only mildly interesting. While some of the action sequences are entertaining, the sci-fi premise is not developed into something clever enough to deserve all the the accolades that have been heaped upon it to date."
"luckynumchris","9","205","350","15 October 2012"," Unfortunate this movie is getting so many negative reviews and comments
","I've been reading many reviews and the discussion boards on this site, and after just coming back from enjoying it, I was very disappointing to see so many negative reviews and comments. I'm definitely going to be responding to some comments in the discussion boards from some specific details of the movie, but for now I will just write a review. And a positive review since there is so many haters out there.<br/><br/>Firstly I have to say I am a big fan of sci-fi and specifically time travel. And as a huge fan I can see how since you're doing a movie/story about something that doesn't exist, or something we don't understand, of course there will be some plot holes and always ask, ""why didn't he do this"" or, ""why couldn't they do that"" or ""he could've just done this"" but being a film with only so much time to tell this unique story I think it did a great job with it. It takes a black-noir sort of character and puts him in the year 2044, where time travel hasn't even been invented yet but eventually does and used by only secret criminal organizations. These organizations seem to gather future ""trash"" and are disposed by loopers who are told to wait at a specific time and wait to pull the trigger. Which so happens to be our protagonist (who suspiciously reminds me of Max Payne). Now the kind of people that are sent back in time to be killed by ""loopers"" (yes there is more than one), we are given no prior knowledge of who they were or what they have done. What I really enjoyed was the fact of, what they considered is bad? Who deserved to die? <br/><br/>Anyway we are given a few glimpses of how the rest of the city looks in this time and how a first world country in some parts, looks like a third world country in others. People thrive on scraps, constantly stealing from one another and just surviving. While the rich are comfortable and most probably criminals or in some way affiliated with the crime land. Now I know this can be considered very cheap and cliché, but clichés are clichés for a reason. It's supposed to show how the world is brought down by it being run by criminal minds. People from the future who come from the past to make the past ""better"" and how these people are ignored for rich people to think of themselves. Which was the point of the movie, because when you are talking about changing the future, do you want to change the future to make it better for you? Or for the rest of the world? This would make more sense to people who have seen this movie, but for those of you that haven't, I just hope you don't read a lot of these ""reviews"" and decide not to ""waste your money."" It talks about time travel, different dimensions and for being a time travel movie leaves very little holes (of course they are some but it's inevitable in a sci-fi). <br/><br/>I can't finish this review without saying how great the cinematography of this film was. At time you could just feel how the character was feeling, when he was giving narrating sections while showing all he did was murder faceless people, over and over. And he actually has plans, and start to care for who he is and what he becomes. <br/><br/>I could probably talk about this movie all day, but I don't want this review to be a novel, so I'll finish it here but my main objective of this review is for people not to miss out on this great movie, as the acting is top notch and at some part comical, with a great new actor who is no older than 10! How the director makes Joseph Levitt's character act like Bruce Willis and either Rian or Joseph does a great job depicting it, it's as if I was listening and watching Bruce Willis most of the film. My biggest complaint was the action sequences when it came to gun play. I found it lazy how everyone shot at Bruce Willis but the bullets flew all around him. There were times he took cover and I guess because his character is just smart enough he knows when to take cover and just shoot because the opponents he's dealing with are clumsy and inexperienced. Anyway small complaint for a very well done film. 9/10 Enjoy!"

","i always approach a film especially when it is classified as scifi with liberal suspension of disbelief. because it is only through that that i was able to appreciate such scifi gems as Stargate and Fifth Element and many other that were otherwise written off by these so-called critics.<br/><br/>Looper is one of those films that should be appreciated by its message more than its genre. it uses the science fiction medium, complete with action stunts and wonders, as an apt and well-sculpted vehicle to a very beautiful message of self-sacrifice and positive reinforcement parenthood. the film goes to extra length to make the story plausible and solid and the actors, including the 'rainmaker' child, did a marvelous job of pulling it off.<br/><br/>i've always believed that the soul of any film, even as i appreciate great plot twists and great special fx and great acting and direction (yeah, i said great too many times!), is the message and/or portrait it intends to get across. Looper made a kill for it."
"tgooderson","9","359","638","24 September 2012"," Intelligent Science Fiction Thriller
","Looper is a film that goes to extraordinary lengths to leave every base covered in its quest to avoid plot holes and inconsistencies and in my mind it deals with the problems associated with time travel very well. One thing I liked is that the older Joe is aware of everything the younger Joe is about to do which gives him an edge if they were to do battle. I also liked that the older Joe in true Bruce Willis style bypasses the whole idea of trying to work out how and why what is happening is happening by saying he can't be bothered to work it all out. As well as the older Joe having the advantage of memory over the younger Joe, the younger Joe in turn has his own advantages which become apparent. There were several times when I thought I'd worked out what was going to happen or what a particular character's arc was going to be but the film cleverly manipulates its audience, leading them down alleyways only to jump out at them from behind and spin them around. There is a nice early twist which gave me a smile and plenty more to keep you guessing right the way to the end. In the end it turns out that time travel plays second fiddle to another phenomenon which I was pleased by as there was no mention of this in the trailer which I've been trying to avoid for several weeks. The plot is multifaceted with each character having their own reasons for being where they are, when they are and doing what they are doing. It is a dense plot which explores several different ideas and concepts both personal and scientific.<br/><br/>As well as confidently dealing with a complex script which would have been very easy to either make too complicated or too full of holes, Writer/Director Rian Johnson (Brick) also creates a very believable future and fills it with people and events which feel plausible. Cities have continued to expand upwards and outwards but they themselves are filled with tent cities in which a large vagrant class live. Life is cheap and hard in this world in which the have's and have not's are much more separated than today. There is enough in the film to make to world feel as though it is our near future and the technology on display feels as though it is a few logical steps along the road. I especially liked the ingenious solution to running cars after the inevitable the oil crisis and there's also a great line about China in there which had a lot of people laughing.<br/><br/>The writing and direction are superb but another strength are the acting performances. Joseph Gordon-Levitt wears heavy makeup and prosthetics to make him look more like Bruce Willis and although this is occasionally a little distracting, it looks unnervingly good at times, especially closer up which is odd. The effect is actually better in close up than when JG-L is in the middle distance. Underneath the prosthetics though Gordon-Levitt delivers a fine performance, adopting a few of Willis' telltale mannerisms and affectations but avoiding pure mimicry. He appears confident and at ease in the dense lead role, carrying off a mixture of hard edged killer and caring young man while switching from one to the other with ease. Bruce Willis equally is very good but we have seen this kind of performance from him many times before. Nevertheless he is on good form here. The chemistry between the two leads was great and really helped with the believability of them being one person. Emily Blunt was another actor who performed very well and in a departure from her more familiar roles. She adopts a convincing American accent, drops a few F-Bombs and looks comfortable holding a gun. She brings to the fore the feminine caring side when it matters though. Probably the standout actor though despite the three A Listers is Pierce Gagnon, a very young child actor who is incredible in a pivotal role. He and Gordon-Levitt have some funny and tense scenes together which work very well.<br/><br/>Overall there was little I didn't like about Looper and it has gone straight into my Top 10 films of the year so far as well as being probably my favourite Sci-Fi since 2009's Moon. It treats its audience with respect and isn't afraid to keep you them of the loop for a while as it teases them with false and sometimes seemingly false information. It is well designed and acted and features a wonderfully multifaceted and intelligent story which rewards patience and concentration with a fantastic ending.<br/><br/>www.attheback.blogspot.com"
"haosstoposto","1","248","436","1 October 2012"," To quote the main character: It's messy.""
","This story was written by someone who does not comprehend even the basics of time travel problems and paradoxes. It is a mystery why this chaos received so high grades. The plot in short: mafia from the future sends their assassination targets into the present to be disposed of; in the present there are killers, so called loopers (organized by a sadist from the future) who await their targets and kill them. Before or later, the looper receives a mission to kill his future self. Some of them fail to do so. And then the chase begins. First of all, the premise is pretty stupid, to use such advanced technology for such mundane goal. In the movie they have explained, that in the future it is impossible to get rid of someone without being tracked. It is, as it seems, far easier to build a time machine then to avoid tracking technology from a collapsed society. Then we have a pretty horrifying (and illogical) scene of punishment for a failed looper. His present self is mutilated and his future self loses his limbs one by one. This is wrong, all his wounds have been inflicted in the past so they would appear all at once in the future. And it is unresolved if his present self has been killed or will they keep him alive for the next few decades without his limbs, until he is sent into the present. Then we have our hero"", Joe who escapes his captors in the future, escapes his present looper-self and begins his search for a mysterious future mafia boss, the elusive Rainmaker"", who in the future has killed his wife. Then begins a Terminator-rip-off"". Terminator-Joe from the future does not have exact information about Rainmaker, only his date of birth and he manages to narrow his search to only three kids he will have to kill. He eliminates two targets and of course, his past self protects the real Rainmaker, the fact that it HAS TO BE KNOWN to his future self even before his trip to the past, because it is past, no matter when the audience has find out this. Then the Terminator-Joe eliminates his entire (ex-)gang and there is a showdown between him, his present-self and the Rainmaker-Kid. The situation is resolved when the present Joe kills himself and the Terminator-Joe disappears. Which would set in motion time traveling paradox: Terminator Joe does not exist so he cant be sent into the past and all his actions would be reversed. But no, all his actions in the movie remain. The Rainmaker-kid survives and he will grow up not to be mafia boss but exemplary member of future society. The end. Oh, and this Rainmaker-kid has a Carrie-like telekinetic abilities, which has nothing to do with a plot and is complete superficial. As for the pacing of the movie, it is horrible. We begin with a bang (literary), then a movie comes to a halt and we have an hour or so pure boredom (or character development""). Then we have a final shoot out. All in all a very bad experience, caused by a fanboy-hype. If you want to see Bruce Willis travel through time, watch 12 Monkeys"", a far superior movie in every sense."
"billygoat1071","10","133","231","18 October 2012"," High Concept Intrigue
","Looper seems like it's inspired by Philip K. Dick's several works. It's a Sci-Fi story that is set in the future with a quite interesting concept. The ads shows this as a typical nonstop action film. Surprisingly, it's much better than anyone would expect. It's actually a mind blowing film that tells an unpredictable story and has a great amount of thrills. The performances are strong and the directing is solid. Unlike most modern Sci-Fi films they depend on the action and the explosions. Looper is all about letting the audience intrigue all the way on the concept.<br/><br/>The important thing you should expect in this film is the brilliance of the concept than the action. Yeah, there's fighting and gunfights but it's mostly about the idea. The film tells it in a stylish and mind boggling way which makes it compelling. The story development is clever. The first half lets the viewers root for the film's world until the plot twists. It's great when a scene suddenly becomes confusing then it all make sense afterwards. Aside of its storytelling, Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a great job playing the young version of Bruce Willis as he imitates Willis' accent and gruffness. He still plays the role with his own style. Gordon-Levitt is energetic and striking. The rest of the cast are excellent.<br/><br/>The production design is decent. Its futuristic world looks magnificent and their weaponry looks awesome. The camera-work is one of the merits of the film. It makes the action look stylish and brings cool vertigo to the trippy moments. Every shot of the film is impressive. The most interesting one is when Joe was in the fields, you prominently see a cloud trail on the sky remarking the scene. The script is smart enough for explaining its concept and making things gripping.<br/><br/>Looper is one of those films that would stuck in your head in a long time because it's plain brilliant. It's so different to popular modern Sci-Fi films. This film is not an action movie cookie-cutter that leaves the high concept as the background of the film. This film simply narrates, mind-bends, and intrigues which makes it amazingly interesting. The idea is original with some inspiration. Looper has the art, the heart, the tension, and the brains that any science fiction fans would love."

","To begin, Looper is a sci-fi film set in the future, dealing with the implications of time-travel, although it is very much a film about the past. The film is all about the past, how it affects the present and the future and how it drives people with the majority of the film building characters and establishing plot.<br/><br/>Anyone looking for an action film will be sorely disappointed because this is first and foremost a writer's film, focusing on plot, character and dialogue. As mentioned above, the brunt of the film falls on development, more so than action set-pieces and CGI. The portions of the city and the near future Johnson has created, whilst some may see as unoriginal, I see as tributary. A lawless country split socially in half, poverty on one side, excess on the other, the world Johnson has manufactured carries an air similar to that of Alfonso Cuaron's Children of Men, a comparably important sci-fi film in the struggle to build the credibility of the genre in the realm of modern cinema.<br/><br/>Not only is the film intelligent, it also acts as a courier for Johnson, a director of hit (Brick) and miss (The Brothers Bloom) repute following his sophomore outing. <br/><br/>If you support intelligent science fiction in the intellectual vein of Inception and Primer, Looper is a film sitting firmly in the middle of the two. Break the box office with this film and bring intelligence back to film-making."
"ben_loyal_royal","5","105","187","30 September 2012"," A Disappointment
","The premise for this film is fantastic, the cast appears great, and its a movie that wants to be seen. However, it is a major disappointment. The whole concept of hit men and time-travel is intriguing- and the concept of your future self being the target, even more so, but this, in truth, is not what the film ends up being about. In a Terminator esque manner Bruce Willis turns his antics in the past to a 'save the future' kill quest wanting to destroy a future-crushing ""rainmaker"" (whom we know very little about and have little incentive to want killed) whilst he is still a child. The aforementioned has 'TK'- the films terms for Telekentic powers- and this is barely covered and feels like one idea too far, almost an add on that is ultimately crucial to the narrative but is not presented to us enough. In all the film leaves you dissatisfied, feels clunky, and disappointing as on paper it could have been so much better.."
"drnova79","1","170","312","8 October 2012"," Waste of time
","Rian Johnson fiction film (as it contains no science) Looper should be the line in the sand to say enough. Cinema going has turned into such a trite state that a film like this could be critically acclaimed and mass released. In the day and age of no heart films, torture porn and saccharine dramas we again have to endure the waste of time, resources and column space that a films like this garners. At a time when other worthwhile films slip into obscurity of small openings and DVD bargain bins.<br/><br/>Looper commits the most atrocious of cinematic crimes it abuses the viewers trust in a way that even Von Trier would be embarrassed by in all his emotion manipulation. Looper's first thirty minutes run by smoothly. It appears self-assured, paced confidently and even though the science and exposition is at best first grader and a worst lazy film- making we can forgive all of this and just go with it. Taking in the sub-standard portrayal of the future with none of the background social commentary of other genre films. Apart from some lazy shorthand referencing Doretha Lang's depression photograph of Mother With Seven Children replaced with future vagrant mother and child leaving behind any social cause and effect. <br/><br/>Then as Bruce Willis Old Joe meets Joseph Gordon Levitt's Young Joe the prosthetics take on a comically feel (recalling Pachino's villain in Dick Tracy). We feel we are getting to the meat of the story instead we find derivative shoot-outs, chases and uncompelling dialogue. At this point it all falls apart and the film runs into the dangerous space that modern cinema is not only touching on but beginning to permanently occupy. <br/><br/>The portrayal of females in the film is typical of the misogynistic movement in modern America's cinema. Women are passive objects to be both lusted and tortured. In Lopper all the women portrayed are Whores or Junkies or have a perverse struggle with motherhood. <br/><br/>Emily Blunt's character is given a back-story from a daytime drama. She shown to have no motivation apart from giving into compulsion. Any chance at positive female representation is at utter loss when she makes an-out-of nowhere unconvincing booty call with her child's adapted frog toy to Young Joe. This scene is complete with ridiculously out of place romantic piano score. One gets the feeling the film-makers have misogynist issues that should have been worked out in therapy and not in celluloid. <br/><br/>Before all of this trite we get Bruce Willis's terrible act of killing a child an act in cinema that Hitchcock in his conversations with Truffaut remarked is a guaranteed way to lose an audience. It has been done with a level of respect in films such as Afflecks Gone Baby Gone. In Looper it is unforgivable not only because of the act, but also in the way Johnson manipulates the audience and scenario for maximum effect (making him parallel with pushers of Torture Porn).<br/><br/>We are asked to believe that a child straight off a Disney set walks into the wrong film and towards a pretty suburb home, which is unguarded, in this state of societal collapse and mass crime. All this is for effect so when Old Joe shoots him we are more shocked, more horrified It is one of the more distasteful and undoubtedly manipulative scenes in recent cinema. <br/><br/>At the midway point the films personality splits, and it turns into a horror film about telekinetic abilities? In what seems like a pinned on sub-plot brought to the fore because they didn't know how to end the film. The ending of self-sacrifice was a laughable attempt at catharsis. <br/><br/>This infantile film should be laughed off the screens, especially given the sub-standard performances, Emily Blunts failure at acting 101 in the miming smoking scene comes to mind, . <br/><br/>Critics drawing positive attention even with the quip that it entertains should be ashamed. The role of the critic should be to enlighten. To shine a light towards the possibly unseen both within popular entertainment films and the unseen films that push the art form forwards."
"Rollum","1","95","170","12 October 2012"," Not even close
","The whole premise of this story was flawed from the beginning. For SciFi fans time travel is what its all about. Its meant to be intriguing and full of conundrums that most importantly, some how make sense. All the best time travel movies have a consistency that holds the idea together. This is precisely what Loopers does not have. There where so many holes in the plot that it became impossible to go with it. If your going to beam someone to the past to be killed why do you need a Looper. why not beam them straight to the furnaces. And if you have to use a Looper why rely on him to kill himself - let someone else do it. Seriously this was just a few of the canyon like proportions of the gaps in the plot of this flop. If Bruce was not in this i would have walked way before the end. I was fooled. You don't have to be."
"TheSquiss","8","135","248","25 September 2012"," This time travel crap; just fries your brain like an egg""
","Time travel films open up all manner of questions because of the paradoxes every action and reaction produce. If X occurred, surely Y would happen, which means X wouldn't happen after all And so it is with Looper. <br/><br/>Alas, to avoid dishing out hugely unpopular plot spoilers I need to skirt around the concerns, so you'll just have to come round with cake and we can discuss it in private. But there are some pretty substantial issues with Looper that cause questions to be asked and lead to more than a couple of possible explanations as to what exactly is going on. Don't see it alone; you'll need a friend around to discuss it on the journey home.<br/><br/>Equally, don't be put off. You don't need to be Einstein to enjoy Looper, as some of the audience proved <br/><br/>In 2072, time travel is both possible and illegal and murder is more easily solved because corpses are harder to lose. However mobs and Mafiosi types are prevalent and have ingeniously devised a solution: tie your victim up and send him back in time to a location where a looper will be waiting to blow his/her brains out. However, when a looper's contract is up, they find themselves blowing the brains out of their older self. Except when looper Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) stares down the barrel at a version of himself that is thirty years older, Old Joe (Bruce Willis) outsmarts him and so begins a cat and mouse chase where there are multiples of each species and most of them aren't called Joe.<br/><br/>Confused? Good. Don't think any more or you'll confound yourself with your wondering and wandering along all the possible flows and tributaries that lead from them. Like, Is he actually... Dammit.<br/><br/>Along with the quirks, possibilities and matters left to interpretation, there are one or two clear boo-boos that cut against the rules writer/director Rian Johnson (Brick, The Brothers Bloom) has set himself. I'm sure you can work out from the subject matter that there are occasional murders so I'm giving nothing away by stating that a particular murder in 2027 cuts against the rules. It's not a major problem in terms of enjoyment but it does cast a shadow over everything if minor errors are not avoided.<br/><br/>There's only one way to watch Looper: suspend all disbelief, put your logic in stasis and get on with enjoying the romp. With that frame of mind employed, it's a superb film. No, it's not as intelligent a film as Inception, but it kicks the ass of Wanted and Gordon-Levitt is potentially a bigger star in the making than either Leonardo DiCaprio or James McAvoy.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that I buy Gordon-Levitt as a young Willis but the transition is simple and effectively executed and it needn't stand in the way of a couple of hours of great entertainment. He's matured as an actor and, though he's been stamping around Hollywood for a good couple of decades, it's the last five years or so that have really seen him ascend the ranks and there's no sign of his climb slowing with both Spielberg's Lincoln and Don Jon's Addiction (which he also wrote and directed) in the can and Premium Rush earning plaudits on both sides of the Atlantic.<br/><br/>As for Willis, it's good to see him earning his fee again in a film worthy of his presence rather than phoning it in for a fat wad in the truly awful The Expendables 2. Emily Blunt (Sara) and Jeff Daniels ably provide support, the former, sadly, barely stretched and the latter, as Abe, the loopers' boss, clearly enjoying himself. Equally, Paul Dano gives a wonderful, trademark sniveling wretch performance that is all too brief. But Looper belongs to Gordon-Levitt and One Tree Hill's Pierce Gagnon as the child, Cid, whose middle name is probably Damian. Unnerving is an understatement! <br/><br/>There is a very strong argument that the best person to direct a film is the writer because s/he knows it better than anyone. Clearly that wasn't the case with Maximum Overdrive (Stephen King being the fine writer who should never be allowed either in front of or behind a camera again) but with Looper it's a very strong case in point.<br/><br/>Johnson, though he bends his rules, has created a multi-layered, rapidly paced trip that is littered with bodies and to-die-for quips, to wit, ""I cleaned you up. And put a gun in your hand."" He juggles the time zones effortlessly and maintains the excitement while allowing sufficient moments for us to pause, cogitate and catch up before whipping us to the next sprint, jump or shoot-out. Though he has nothing (publicly) on the slate, there'll be plenty more from him in the next few years.<br/><br/>As is increasingly the case, my biggest complaint with last night's viewing has nothing to do with the film itself but with the screening, namely the blown speakers all along one side of the auditorium (big thumbs down to Cineworld) and the moron in front who played with his phone and gave muted shrieks of excitement every time there was a shot or splatter of blood, even taking the time to relive it with his friend. Who are these people? Why are they allowed to breathe? When will time travel come to my aid? Ah, but these are niggles and hopefully you won't be subjected to such when you watch Looper. And do see it. Maybe you'll absolutely hate the confusion it causes you, but if you don't mind giving a film some real thought and you enjoyed the possibilities of Inception, then Looper is for you.<br/><br/>Just don't think too hard.

","No Spoilers will be shown, the story is basically the public knowledge shown on the trailers.<br/><br/>The story is about this man named Joe who is played by both Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis. Basically his job is a looper. In the Year 2074 civilization has created time travel however it is highly illegal to use it. It is then controlled by the highest criminal mafia in the world. In the future they cannot kill a person, so instead they send them back 30 years and the looper will kill them. When the young Joe saw the Old Joe standing there, he hesitated and the plot clashed.<br/><br/>The story was very confusing at first, but the movie does a good job to explain to us as it goes along. To be honest at first I thought this was going to be bad, the story took some time to build up, and the plot just didn't seem to have any structure. Once the movie did pick up, boy did it pick up. It became intense as the hunter became the hunted.<br/><br/>The story had emotion, action, we laughed and cried. Many places where things appeared to be stupid ended actually be part of the story and working out. There are though, a lot of silly moments in the story that to my opinion could have been left out and the story would have been just as good. The acting was very good. Also kinda shows how much Bruce Willis is getting old, but can still pack a punch. I give this movie an 8.5/10!"
"FlixChatter","9","70","129","7 October 2012"," Looper is a thrill ride that has a nice blend of thrilling action and matters of the heart.
","Time travel sci-fi movies are inherently intriguing to me, so when I first saw the trailer with THIS cast, I knew I wanted to see it.<br/><br/>As in the trailer, Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Joe, a specialized assassin, in an outfit called the Loopers. He lives in the year 2042 but the mob he works for lives 30 years ahead where time travel would've been invented. When his employer from the future wants to get rid of someone, they zap that person back 30 years where someone like Joe would be waiting with a big gun in hand, ready to blow them up to oblivion. The only rule is: never let your target escape... even if your target is you. The job seems easy enough, I mean, the targets are blindfolded, so it's not like they could really escape. That is, until one did, and that target happens to be his older self, in the form of Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>Now, before the action begins in full throttle, Director Rian Johnson sets up the story by introducing the Looper doing their jobs and how these junkies hit-men spend their lives in a dystopian future (is there any other kind in the movies??). ""Loopers are well paid, they lead a good life..."" Joe said in his narration, but what he means by 'good' doesn't mean a happy one and it's clear that Joe is disillusioned with his life.<br/><br/>Let me just say the less you know about the plot the better as I went in pretty much 'blind,' other than seeing the trailer weeks ago, and it's fun to see the story unravel in ways I didn't really expect. There's really a lot to chew on here, as do most time-travel movies, and I have to admit it was a bit mind-boggling to digest it all as I'm watching it, but now that I've processed the movie more, Johnson actually told the story well enough without an overly drawn-out exposition.<br/><br/>The strengths are in the performances, especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who seems to only get better and better as he grows to be a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood. Seems like every time I see him, even in minor roles like in 'Inception' or 'The Dark Knight Rises,' he never fails to impress. I've got to admit though, his prosthetic make-up to make him look like Bruce Willis is distracting at times, but once I get into the story, I got used to it. In fact, in some scenes Gordon-Levitt's mannerism and expressions really do remind me of Willis! Now, I've always been a fan of Bruce. He's a bad ass guy with a heart and I feel that he sold me on the emotional moments as well as on the action front, in which he channels his iconic John McClane in the 'Die Hard' franchise. In fact, I kept waiting for him to yell 'Yiippiikayee' during some of the shootout scenes! I'm also impressed with Emily Blunt and child actor Pierce Gagnon who plays her little boy. Both played two key roles that serve as the emotional center of the story. Their paths crossed with both the younger and older Joe in a way that not only affect their own lives but the lives of Joe's fellow Loopers. Their scenes with Gordon-Levitt are well-played, though it could perhaps be tightened a bit as it does feel dragging at times. Jeff Daniels and Paul Dano also lend memorable supporting performances, Daniels is sort of a comic relief as Joe's manager who happens to be sent by the mob from the future.<br/><br/>It's refreshing to see a movie based on an original script, not an adaptation nor a remake. Despite all the time travel elements, the film also doesn't feel too science-fiction-y. I'm also glad Johnson doesn't pile on one action set pieces after another, instead there are a lot of quiet moments to establish character development that help you get immersed in Joe's journey.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: Looper is a thrill ride that has a nice blend of thrilling action and matters of the heart. There are brutal action and some totally-unnecessary nudity here, but fortunately not so much so that derails my overall appreciation for it. At the core of this movie lies a heartfelt love story between a man and a woman, and also between a mother and his son. Highly recommended."
"zardoz-13","1","98","194","28 September 2012"," ""Looper"" Is A Pooper!!!
","""Looper"" qualifies as a sordid science fiction thriller about time travel with an awful ending. Stir a little H.G. Wells in with some Stephen King and add a pinch of ""The Sopranos,"" and you've got the basics of ""Brick"" director Rian Johnson's contrived, unconvincing chronicle. Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are cast as one in the same character in this disappointing actioneer that pits them against each other with a no-win outcome. Furthermore, both protagonists emerge as more anti-heroic than heroic. If you dismiss the fact these talented thespians bear scant resemblance to each other, you must still consider the scarcity of information about a distant future as well as a warped premise. These shortcomings constitute the chief flaws in this imaginative but predictable sci-fi saga that unfolds in an erratic manner, lacks quotable dialogue, and features one character with no qualms about shooting innocent adolescents. By the time this uninspired, R-rated, 118-minute, spectacle has worn out its welcome; you have no reason to care about anybody, including an obnoxious telekinetic tyke who doesn't know when to keep his trap shut. Mind you, the future has never appeared more dystopian. Some people are born with a mutation that enables them to levitate objects, and these fellows find that they can lure facile-minded babes into bed by making quarters float above the palms of their hands. The economy has hit bottom, and vagrancy has become epidemic. Citizens can execute vagrants on the spot if they feel so inclined. Any time Hollywood undertakes a time travel tale, the filmmakers conjure up some of the ugliest vehicles. While the cars and trucks look hopelessly tacky, the motorcycles resemble something Luke Skywalker might ride. Basically, you see a guy straddling a cylinder with handle bars. Computer-generated special effects blur everything beneath his feet so he appears to be cruising on a cushion of air.<br/><br/>Johnson's screenplay is as amoral as his narrative premise is warped. Imitating the best Mafia movies of director Martin Scorsese, Johnson relies on the voice-over narration of his lead character to acquaint us not only with his unusual profession but also with the seedy world in which he thrives. Kansas in the year 2044 serves as the setting. Presumably, Johnson is making an ironic ""Wizard of Oz"" joke with his futuristic fable. The premise of ""Looper"" is that a guy can live the high life by killing individuals from the future who have been sent back to the past. Joseph Simmons (Joseph Gordon-Levitt of ""The Dark Knight Rises"") is a killer who was brought up the ranks by his boss, Abe (Jeff Daniels of ""Blood Work""), to do his dirty work. Actually, Abe was beamed back from the future to coordinate the equivalent of Murder Incorporated. In the 1940s, the Mafia relied on out-of-town gunmen from to ice enemies on their own turf. For example, if the New York Mafia wanted to dispose of an adversary, they contracted a Chicago gunsel to eliminate him. The rationale was that the authorities always sought a motive. What motive would a Chicago mobster have for killing New York mobster that he didn't know? This remained standard operating procedure until the authorities figured out the connection. <br/><br/>Mobsters in the year 2074 cannot murder their adversaries because humans have become too easy to track. Since the mob cannot kill their own, they contract hits out to mobsters from the past. Gunman designated 'loopers' kill and dispose of these victims that the mob has beamed back so nobody can find them. Our hero wields an exotic shotgun called a 'blunderbuss,' and the looper waits near a cornfield in the middle of nowhere with his weapon and a tarp spread on the ground. Eventually, a bound man with a bag over his head and silver ingots strapped to his back materializes. After he murders his prey, Joseph incinerates him so no traces remain. When a gangland assassin in the future has worn out his welcome, however, the mob sends him back to the past so he can kill himself. They call this 'closing the loop.' After Young Joe botches the job of killing Old Joe, he has to dodge the bullets of his former associates—known as 'gat-men'--until he can corner and kill himself. Losing one's older self is referred to as 'letting his loop run.' Joe's quick-witted alter-ego from the future (Bruce Willis of ""Twelve Monkeys"") escapes and searches for a mysterious person known only as the 'Rainmaker.' This enigmatic individual wants to eradicate any trace of the loopers. Older Joe has been given a map with three possible addresses for this 'Rainmaker.' Joe wants to wreak vengeance on the 'Rainmaker' because the ladder dispatched trigger-happy gunmen who accidentally murdered his Asian wife. <br/><br/>Instead of keeping things simple, Johnson complicates matters with a subplot about a kid with telekinetic powers. Cid (Pierce Gagnon of ""The Crazies"") lives on a sugar cane farm with his mom, Sara (Emily Blunt of ""The Adjustment Bureau""), who runs the place by herself. One of the locations that the Old Joe has is Sara's farm. He suspects Cid may be the reason that assassins are knocking themselves off. Essentially, what we have here is a good assassin and a bad assassin who share the same body from drastically different decades. Young Joe stakes out Sara's farm so he can terminate Old Joe with extreme prejudice. This uneven, high body count stinker doesn't flow well and is often confusing, too. Moreover, the logic is questionable. Wouldn't it be easier for the future mob to kill their enemies and send the remains back to the past for disposal? Furthermore, what would happen if the victim that they sent back managed to escape like Old Joe and gum up the works? In most movies, you look for a character that you can either love or envy. Nobody is lovable in ""Looper"" and parts of this movie are just plain downright dull."

","I hate to be a cynic but I have a hard time believing that the 8.5/10 rating on IMDb is genuine. As for originality, I guess the film could be described as a unique combination of other story lines but definitely nothing innovative. It moved quite slow at times and there are also some serious contradictions and plot holes. In the future, homeless people fill the streets and the US resembles a third world country, yet all of the high rise building are brand new and futuristic. The cars use solar panels to power internal combustion engines which would never be a possibility. In the end, the main character commits suicide, causing his future self to disappear. If he had killed himself at his younger age, the older self wouldn't have existed. There are also some unbelievable coincidences that keep the story moving. I am sure the filmmaker would have some complex explanation but I base my realities on known science and if they have an alternative science, it should have been introduced."

It left me with the impression that he was the young boy on the train and he too was from the future, a kind of echo. If that were the case then why did he not disappear too? Why would the gold stay when Willis disappeared. His disappearance indicates that he was not sent back and neither was the gold. Finally why would you leave a kid alive who you know is going to turn into the most monstrous person in history? Are we to believe that a kid with those powers will turn himself around with the help of his mother? Had he changed the time line that much?

Honestly, I can't imagine how deceiving Hollywood has become with flashy trailers. <br/><br/>There's nothing there in the story. As you guessed from the trailer, it's about a guy who is hit-man who kills random people(who are masked) for money. So these random people are from the future apparently as disposing bodies become impossible in the future, the criminals transport these random folks from 2072 to 2042 where this guy kills them and cremates them. The guys who kill these randoms are called Loopers. And then there comes a time when his company wants to shut down and wants to terminate all the loopers. So this is where he meets his future self(older self) and has to kill. Of course he doesn't kill him because the future self knows every move he could think of. Finally after 118minutes of nonsense, this guy finally realizes, "" oh wait, I could just kill myself and the future self dies with me "". <br/><br/>With a poor storyline such as this one, there was no way in hell the producers would have agreed to invest, so the writers create a few more characters, ( such as a 2year old kid and her mommy to prolong the movie with some emotion/drama) some telekinesis disease(it's like HIV of the 2040s) and more bla bla bla. <br/><br/>This was the time I felt like walking out of the theatre if I hadn't paid $16.

Emily Blunt's accent is so forced and obvious. <br/><br/>I really like all the actors that play in this film, in other films of course. I really hope they got paid well because this movie is total crap. All the other negative reviews here pretty much some up what is wrong with this movie. Time Travel was suppose to be the star of this movie. Without it the movie can't be rewritten to make any kind of sense whatsoever. However the writers completely failed to be educated enough to even come close to making sense. <br/><br/>It would have made more sense for current Joe to shot his hand of to stop future Joe rather than kill himself. Still a paradox but at least it wouldn't have been so blatant a paradox.<br/><br/>If the rainmaker doesn't care about is committing mass murder in the future why is he bothering to send the loopers back to ""Close their loops"" he has access to the information just go back himself and clean house with his telekinetic self.<br/><br/>I am not pondering the movie because I found it mentally engaging I am pondering the failure of the studio that hired people so stupid that they would green light this garbage."

","Looper is a hell of a ride, but in the end it unfortunately feels like it. It is the prime example of bad marketing: it talks like it will be a sci-fi action movie. In reality it is more of a slow burning romance story with elements of The Omen and Terminator. The real problem with the movie is that things are not thought out well; no one has ""feelings"". There is an obligatory sex scene that will make your skin crawl (it also fades out before the sex part). There is a character (Kid Joe or something like that) that has no real use in the story, but is hard to kill and just kinda drifts around, culminating in a new movie high for being a bad shot with a gun! The acting, direction, and cinematography are top notch..but the story is all over the place! Why does the movie shift to the farm? Why don't i feel like the idea of killing children is ever justified? Why is there a big shoot out with Bruce Willis for no reason??? Why does that poor kid have so many scenes of awful screaming? Looper means well and is plenty ambitious, but that makes its failure all the more painful. Rian Johnson should have had someone with experience help him write the script. A bad script really ruins a great idea for a movie."
"roystephen-81252","1","20","36","8 March 2016"," 'Time travel is messy' – as is this poor excuse for a movie
","Another 'universally acclaimed' dud. Contrary to what critics claimed, Looper is neither intelligently written, nor competently executed, and the blame falls entirely on Rian Johnson, being both the writer and the director of this mess.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't have a clear focus, shifting halfway from being about the hero having to kill his own future self to being a mild Omen-type horror featuring a little boy with frightening telekinetic abilities. The pacing is slow and uneven, the cinematography (offering plenty of particularly badly executed, saturated blue lens flare effects) is ugly, and the poor establishing of time-frame, environment and characters, paired with the sloppy editing, makes certain scene changes hard to follow. Even the casting choices are odd. (Frankly, I don't see any similarities between Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis. I feel sorry for the former as he had to wear prosthetics to make him resemble Willis more, yet the result is utterly unconvincing.) The film wastes precious time trying to round out Kid Blue's totally pointless character, while glossing over Old Joe's much more important wife, Suzie or Abe. In fact, what we do get to know about Abe is conveyed through the laziest filmmaking device possible, Joe's hurried voice-over monologue.<br/><br/>Why Rian Johnson was given the opportunity to write and direct Star Wars Episode VIII is a mystery to me. His style is completely different, and in Looper he failed to come up with a coherent script. The only thing he proved is he can't even handle an action sequence involving only three characters (see the poorly edited final confrontation between Kid Blue and Joe 1&2 – where did the Kid disappear?). The answer must lie in the lazy approach of the material. 'Time travel is messy', says Old Joe, as if that solves the problem of the incoherent plot. Just like 'That's not how the Force works!' in the dismally bad The Force Awakens. OK, I do understand. Lazy writing, odd casting, poor characterisation and world-building, choppy editing, lens flares – check, check, check. Johnson might be a 'worthy' successor to Abrams."
"talentedripples","2","30","58","19 October 2012"," Bored to Tears
","If I was bored to tears why is this getting two stars, I hear you ask? There are two simple explanations really: the acting of Emily Blunt, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis, all of whom were typically good and believable as their characters; and making Joseph Gordon-Levitt look not only ill half the time but plausible as Bruce Willis's younger self - they did more than simply give Joseph contacts to wear (his eyes are typically a dark brown).<br/><br/>The movie starts off slow, with the hint of a promise of improving. Unfortunately it doesn't. The peaks of interest in Looper are small, too few and far between. First of all the tag line: 'Time travel hasn't been invented yet, but thirty years from now, it will have been' is badly worded and used too much for comfort.<br/><br/>There is too little happening for too long. All we do is see Joe kill a few too many in a corn field. Boring.<br/><br/>The story continues on slowly. One of the interesting points was the time travel, actually, when they chop up young Seth so they can lure in the old one. It was rather horrible to watch pieces of Old Seth vanish before his eyes until his legs literally fell off. It was rather accurate. If your younger self doesn't possess something, then you don't either. The paradox comes in that you don't have prosthetics for you lost limbs: you wouldn't. You're in the same time as your younger self which creates a paradox.<br/><br/>Then there's the pathetic yelling and fighting between both Joes.<br/><br/>By this point I was playing a game on my phone.<br/><br/>And the story edges onwards slowly, to the point where nobody cares anymore. Neither old Joe or young Joe are particularly likable which is probably the point. Old Joe changed but not that much - he's still the childish selfish man he was when he was young, just toned down. And young Joe is entirely jealous, selfish, childish, doesn't know how to be responsible and has like... no emotions. His only redeeming point comes at the end of this long journey.<br/><br/>It turns out Sid is a demonchild 'rainmaker' whose presence in the story appears to be the only justification for the time travel. Why rainmaker appeared in the first place is never explained, only with the thin explanation that maybe the rainmaker became a big bad man because something happened to his mother. Joe's sacrifice at the end was touching.<br/><br/>The various themes of fighting for survival, and how far are you willing to go to survive, as well as what will you do to exact your vengeance, various moral issues etc. However none of them worked."
"romouele","4","46","94","30 September 2012"," Dull and pedantic sleeping pill.
","The premise of the movie sounds great murder isn't possible in the future so they have to have people do it in the past, great idea, with several problems, firstly why transport a person through time and not a slip of paper with their name, you could then erase them from the time line and thus prevent the need to try and kill them, no bother of disposing of a body from the future, no problem with someone finding the motive because It doesn't exists yet. Even if you accept that there could be consequences you couldn't foresee why not kill the people and send them back for disposal. The plot of this movie just isn't as good as it seemed on paper, once you look beneath the surface it looks a little weak. You have the standard problem of time travel, the very act changes the future so that it isn't needed, by going back in time you change events so you never go back in time, and hey presto movie paradox.<br/><br/>Apart from this the movie just seems dull, it starts to heat up, with some great and clever scenes but then it dies just as quickly and leaves the audience unengaged, an little over an hour into it and people are looking at their watches wondering how much more they need to watch, I think a little of this has been from the marketing, it's being shown to be more action orientated than it is, more complex than it is and just more than it is. Some of the touches in the movie are good, the solar cells used to power just about everything is a nice touch and a nod to the coming fuel crisis, but these little touches cannot cover up the gaping holes in the movie, I wanted this movie to be good because it had everything it needed, unfortunately it didn't come out as it could have."

So I went to check it out. The beginning was alright, action, everything makes sense. But then, in the middle of the movie it changes from action film to a boring not making any sense drama. It's like the director forgot what movie he was making and started making something else. Bruce Willis's character kills kids randomly, who the heck came up with that idea?

"abuse-this2","4","22","41","1 September 2013"," Entertaining but very poor story line.
","Plenty of reviews here go into detail on this movie but I thought I'd add my two cents.<br/><br/>Before seeing this movie, I saw the plot summary listed by the Media Center TV listings and thought it a pretty lame idea. Bored I turned it on anyway at one point. The acting, the direction, the entertainment factor are all good, but the base plot line stinks.<br/><br/>Why would you have an mob assassin kill his future self and why would you pay him so much better for that hit than others? He just shot his future self, him. He knows that he is going to be murdered by the people for whom he works. Why would he continue or want to work for them? The premise of murder in the future being too difficult to deal with bodies ... just because you can't hide the body doesn't mean people stop killing each other. Either they get caught more often or the number of disappearances reduces and more unsolved murders are on the books. The Mob could still kill people all sorts of ways.<br/><br/>And why send them back 40 years earlier to be killed? Why not send them to the middle of the Atlantic rather than some cornfield. You wouldn't even need the assassin in the early years. Just drop your victims in the middle of the Pacific. Much cheaper and cleaner.<br/><br/>The handling of future self verses younger self is very poorly handled. Everything that happens to the younger self would be in the memory of the older self such as the identity of the Rainmaker and he would never go after child 1 and 2. The rainmaker is supposed to have a plastic jaw from the gunshot at the closing scene. If is jaw had to be replaced, how is it he is still talking?! With young Joe falling for Sara and Cid, why would he ever continue his life to become old Joe in the first place? And how is it these GAT men of 2044 act as almost a police force and so brazenly? Jesse for example carrying a large caliber hand-gun at his waist in a front holster. And why would 2044 be so much easier a place to dispose of bodies than any other, like a war zone or the black plague? Why even transport the back alive? There are far too many problems with the plot of this movie to warrant any sort of rave praise or recognition, but it is somewhat entertaining."

","""Time travel has not yet been invented. But thirty years from now, it  will have been.""  I went to an advanced screening of this film last night, upon leaving  the cinema I had a feeling that I had not got from a film for quite  sometime. The film contains a balance of both intelligence and action,  too much of either and the film risks failing, the is a perfect example  of a science-fiction thriller movie.  Looper is set in the year 2042, Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is one of  several mafia-employed assassins known as 'loopers' who are tasked with  'taking out the future's garbage'. The targets are delivered from 30  years in the future to a waiting looper, who puts a bullet in their  head, burns the body and collects their earnings. Loopers are well  paid, but when the bosses decide it's time to 'close the loop' and they  send back your own future self back for assassination, leaving you with  only 30 years to live. Later in the film Joe's loop is to be closed,  but his older self (Bruce Willis) escapes, which is very bad news,  bringing the mafia on the hunt to kill both Joe's.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis both show strong acting  performances throughout, you wouldn't of seen Willis this good since  probably Die Hard as he full-fills his action man status once again.  And even with Gordon-Levitts slightly distracting make-up (in order to  make him look like Willis) he is definitely one of movies huge upcoming  actors. Along side Joe, in the third act of the film introduces Emily  Blunt's character Sara, her character is strong and independent and  brings extra emotion and drama to the film. One of Loopers greatest  strengths is that you are constantly surprised, being full of twists  and turns the movies narrative is very original and leaves you not  knowing what could happen next as both of the Joe's battle for  different situations. With keeping up with the story and concentrating  you are rewarded with a mindfull ending. Released in four days time,  Looper is a sci-fi movie that you should definitely see!"

","This was a film i was really looking forward to being a Sci Fi fanatic but this film was a huge let down.<br/><br/>I was unlucky enough to get to see this a week before release due to have a Cineworld unlimited card, and what a load of crap it was,. The film is completely stupid the mob in the future sending people back in time to get wacked because disposal of a body is almost impossible in the future. However time travel is also highly illegal and one of the worst offences you can do so carries a high charge than murder so all seems silly. Any way story aside this film is down right boring nothing really happens most of the film takes place in a field and i was expecting more than that. I also didn't like the fact that they included telekinesis in this film as it seemed completely pointless and they still didn't use it to its full extent. For example the Rainmaker is said to have killed loads of people in the future there should definitely have been a scene showing this as it would have instantaneously made the film much better.<br/><br/>I would give this film 2/10 initially it was a 6.5 but the more i though a bout it the more i hated it."

"ghost_dog86","8","25","50","2 October 2012"," ""Disney's The Kid"" Part 2
","If you could go back in time and kill baby Hitler, would you? Like ""The Terminator"" with a touch of ""Firestarter"", ""Looper"" is the newest attempt at creating the next revolutionary Sci-Fi film (because everybody wants to make the next ""Blade Runner""). Written and directed by Rian Johnson, the writer/director of the under-appreciated ""Brick"", and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis and Emily Blunt, ""Looper"" tells the story of a dystopian year 2044, where 10 percent of the population has developed laughable ""super powers"" that don't seem to go beyond levitating quarters and time travel has not yet been invented. But in thirty year's time (in an even more flawed future) time travel will have been invented and quickly outlawed, only to be used by mobsters and the very rich, to send people back to 2044 that they want killed (because in the more distant future it is nearly impossible to get rid of a dead body) and that's where Loopers come in. A Looper is a hired gun of sorts from 2044, who is paid a substantial amount of money (silver) to kill those who are sent back in time by the mob and said very rich. Joe (Levitt) is one of these Loopers. One day he hears a rumor about a man called The Rainmaker, who, from thirty years in the future, is attempting to rid the world of Loopers by sending each Looper's future self back in time for the Looper to in turn, kill. OK, I'll stop here only because I have undoubtedly confused you all by this point, even though there is so much more to this story I could get into, such as the aspect of futuristic drug use, important terminology such as ""closing your loop"" and how much makeup one would have to apply if their future self came back in time and looked like Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>Levitt's notable transformation: The fact that Levitt and Willis' face look nothing alike, even with a heavy coat of makeup and prosthetics, isn't as distracting (or intriguing) as one would think. In fact, most audiences will become so wrapped up by the story, that they will be inclined to simply ignore any visual flaws this movie has to offer. And aside from the much anticipated makeup aspect of ""Looper"", the acting from the two male leads isn't all that memorable. In fact, Emily Blunt and the young boy who plays her son (Pierce Gagnon) practically steal the show. But even more interesting than Levitt and Willis' overshadowed performances, is the tone of ""Looper"" throughout. At times playing for laughs and at others playing more for extreme violence, Johnson seems to be in control of most of his story. Issues only arise when the tone of this film is drastically thrown off on two separate occasions. The first major tonal disruption comes during a crucial plot point (aka when the goal of Willis' character is revealed) which I won't give away, but let's just say when the audience I saw this movie with was blindsided by this aggressively dark plot development (involving children) the somewhat light atmosphere in the theater was thrust into an immediate and very uncomfortable silence. The second tonal aberration comes into play with the introduction of a small child (Gagnon) who throws nasty temper tantrums. Though the real star of the show here is Johnson's script, with an almost perfectly structured plot, ""Looper"" is only flawed by a few visuals that go awry; all of which are centered around the child character. In short, and not to give too much away, the sequences when the child has his ""tantrums"" are filmed in such a way, as to resemble something out of a bad episode of ""Heroes"". And while the unavoidably over-dramatized and unintentionally funny scenes of this child having a fit, in slow motion, doesn't take away anything from this massively intriguing storyline, ""Looper"" is a perfect example of a film that would have been much more impactful as a book (if you know what I mean).<br/><br/>Final Thought: Is ""Looper"" the greatest Sci-Fi movie of the year? Yeah, it probably is, seeing that the amount of movies which would fall under the Sci-Fi genre in 2012 is quite thin. And it is worth seeing for the story structure alone, but visually I wasn't as blown away (aside from a few scenes of visual brilliance) as I thought I was going to be. In saying that, the hype machine may have gotten to me far too prematurely, because at the end of the day ""Looper"" is in fact a well constructed piece of Sci-Fi entertainment, which will be thought of by many as being as innovative as ""Inception"" was a few years ago (even though ""Inception"" was a better Sci-Fi film).<br/><br/>Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

Why? Who knows, but they exist and apparently peacefully coexist with the rest of the population.<br/><br/>So the plot manages to put together these two elements without any kind of explanation. I call it plot, but would need to apologies. As in the end I cant really see one. It seems more of a pretext to give Bruce Willis a job and make some money out of an audience for which the producers probably have very little respect for.<br/><br/>I give it a 2/10 as the ""product"" itself is watchable. But wouldn't recommend it to anyone."

","I went to see this film on Saturday night, and didn't know what quite to expect. The film starts off with a narrative from Joseph (as he plays the main character alongside Bruce), and explains what he does for living as he waits to kill this guy from the future. The story then goes on to detail what a Looper is and how when they come to the end of their usefulness the mob send back their older selves and the younger version to kill himself. So far so good. Just before Bruce (older version of Joseph) gets sent back, it shows you what the mob does to people who let their older selves escape ie they don't kill them. This is the start of the movie not making any sense. They capture the younger version and begin to remove his limbs, the older version starts to see his limbs disappear (this is quite disturbing and stuck with me a little). One question, if the younger version has had his limbs removed, how the hell did the older version run in the first place. Surely, when he appeared in the first place he wouldn't have any limbs. Without telling you the rest of the story, the film pretty much goes on like this all the way through. It's like they had a script that made sense and somewhere along the line it has been altered so much that now it mite as well be used for toilet paper. I will be keeping an eye out for this director and be sure not to watch any more films by him. Oh yeah, if you do watch it, the end of the film makes no sense at all, I could have put up with minor time paradox mistakes, but the end of the film just makes me wish I hadn't watched it. Hope this helps."

","We were really looking forward to this movie - most of Bruce Willis' movies are fun, exciting and tongue-in-cheek humor scattered throughout to make for great re-watching. There have not been many good sci-fi movies about time-travel and after reading the glowing reviews here (on IMDb), I even dragged my husband to this movie. He enjoys Bruce Willis movies but not scifi. This movie is at least 60 minutes too long. Bruce's role is well-played. His 'past' self is also well acted. It's all the stuff between that is an unbelievable, awkward time-travel/scifi story. For those of you who liked the 'Terminator' plot where it starts in the future, with Kyle looking at a picture of Sarah Conner that's taken in the past, at the end of the movie - closing the 'time' travel circle - Looper does nothing even close. Changing the future by altering the past is the typical time-travel story, done well in many movies, and unfortunately - done very badly in others. Looper is in the middle. While the stories being told in the past and future are interesting and well-acted/directed, the story linking the past-future is an 'eye roll' moment. In 'Looper', Bruce is not a good person, though he becomes one through the love of a woman. That should be the first clue to - oh brother - not one of those! So he tries to convince his 'past' self to change without figuring out what really needs to be changed to alter the future. It's so hokey in some parts that it's embarrassing. Like watching Bruce in 'Color of Night' or 'Hudson Hawk' - it's like - geez. Nothing about how the world is in the future is described except that a very bad guy is in charge and that's what needs to be changed in the past. Things keep happening at this diner in the middle of nowhere with no customers, black-and-white - and all the bad guys continue to meet up there. The people in the cities are living in the usual dark, cramped and lots of crime - future. How does this woman get a huge house, with electricity, out in the middle of a corn field - that theoretically - she is maintaining by herself? And why is she out there? None of that is explained. Maybe these are all metaphors - which are lost on me - I go to see an action movie not to try to figure out why the director shot a scene in black-and-white or why Bruce is running through a corn maze that's actually dead in the past. So - be fore-warned. This is not a 'Die Hard', not a 'Terminator', nor even 'Vanilla Sky'. It's OK if you go in not expecting much. It's got really hokey moments ala 'Knowing' and 'War of the Worlds remake'. And it's too long so you'll keep looking at your watching wondering how much longer can this movie drag on ..."

Let's look at the cinematic values. The characters were dark and superficial. The big bad city sets were seedy, unconvincing and depressing. The dialog was pedestrian and obvious. Most communication consisted of people glowering at each other for long periods of time. That is, when they weren't blowing each other up.<br/><br/>There was a pointless love interest that was as sexy as week-old spaghetti.

The 2nd half of the screenplay is very slow, gloomy and totally idiotic. The movie actually has 2 plots, 1)time travel and 2) the dangers of toddlers with uncontrollable telekinesis. Unfortunately, neither of these plots are well executed and so it ruins the whole movie.<br/><br/>The climax defies all logics and the time travel has big a goof up and you end up thinking, how can the director can be so stupid!

","Of course when you sit down with the popcorn to watch a movie about time travel you should be prepared for the time paradoxes and contradictions. In Looper they come in spades but unfortunately in this case they really don't make even a little sense<br/><br/>A quick summary of what the film is about: In the far future it is impossible to criminally dispose of bodies so the mob instead beams them back 30 years where ""Loopers"", in league with the future Mafia shoot them dead and crimate the remains. To tie up loose ends these Loopers themselves are also terminated in the same way by their younger selves, 30 years after they retire. This all goes swimmingly until a retiree escapes after being beamed into the past. Chaos ensues...<br/><br/>I have to say as I watched the movie unfold I enjoyed it. There was a good balance of action and drama and it was unpredictable enough to keep me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>However, now I am home I am thinking more about what nonsense the end actually was, (yes, a time paradox) and worse than that I also realize there is not one character in the film I liked. This makes it difficult to rave about later on.<br/><br/>Looper currently has a very high IMDb rating. I think over time it will come down to less rarefied altitude as it certainly doesn't deserve to be listed among the all time classics.<br/><br/>All that said, it's great fun, so don't let my tepid review stop you from seeing it.

4) The film definitely kept me engaged enough to want to know what was going to happen at the end

2) The film tries to feel very grounded in reality, but there are elements such as the flying cars and the telekinesis that are fantastical and don't quite fit with the otherwise grounded tone
3) Jeff Daniels (who I love) gives a very caricatured performance in what is otherwise a very serious film
4) Young Joe is positioned as the hero of the film but I struggled to like him because at the end of the day he is a junkie thug who almost runs over an innocent child at the start of the film whilst high on drugs

The problem is that even with the rewriting of the laws of time they still couldn't create a plot that would hold true. <br/><br/>But the biggest mistake they made is that they only tell you at about 45 minutes in that you have to forget everything about time and space to get your head around this movie.

","Looper presented itself as a promising movie before coming out without generating too much hype. I realize now that maybe that was the whole trick.<br/><br/>All I knew was, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt turned down a role in Tarantino's upcoming feature 'Django Unchained' to play the younger version of Bruce Willis in this action-packed time- travel flick that has them facing each other. It's an interesting premise and at times, it leaves the audience to decide for themselves who the protagonist and antagonist is, though they're both the same person. It also deserves credit for its unprecedented take on Time-travel, which poses an interesting question: What would happen if you had to face your future-self? But that's where the cool ideas run out and the movie gradually abandons its premise altogether, branching off in several equally un-suspenseful sub-plots, none integral to the story.<br/><br/>It's hard to discuss the plot without giving too much away. The events take place in the 2070s but you wouldn't know it if you weren't told so, as it doesn't look so different from 2012. The movie tries to account for that by explaining that America has fell into bankruptcy, yet it seems far-fetched that while Time-Travel is supposedly a mere couple of decades away, the cars still look the same as they did 50 years ago. It comes off as lazy and quickly puts you off. Meanwhile, the budget was apparently spent on building a diner set from scratch for our stars to shoot holes through, in what you later realize was the climax of the whole movie. After that, begins a slow and uneventful chapter, one that says goodbye to most of the cast and shifts focus from Time-travel, to romance. 30 long minutes and several clichés later, we arrive at final face-off, but it never comes. The movie takes a detour from answering any of the few questions that you may have had, and offers nothing in their place. There are no twists, no shocking revelations or any suspense. I can't say I saw the ending coming, but I can't say I was blown away by it either. <br/><br/>To cut a long rant short, this movies offers so little you haven't been offered before, and fails to deliver on any of it. Its multiple sub-plots contribute nothing to the story and rob the movie of what little pace it starts with. It even seems pointless not to spoil anything, since I wouldn't recommend you waste time with it anyway."
"Ben_Horror","5","24","52","4 October 2012"," Loopy
","The time travel genre is nothing new to movies. It's been done brilliantly (The Terminator/Back to the Future/12 Monkeys) and not so well (Timeline/Freejack/Time After Time). Even still, it's a story arc that offers so much potential for imaginative plots, filmmakers continue to come back to it again and again. Which is fine, providing it's done with some panache. Looper is yet another addition to that long traveled path to the time travel well and with a cool sounding premise, promises the same kind of dizzying concepts and brain muddling story arcs. At least that's what you expect. That it falls a bit short is really a surprise. And a shame.<br/><br/>Upon release, critics were literally creaming themselves and foaming at the mouth over this movie. There simply wasn't enough descriptive expletives in the dictionary to summarize how amazing this movie was meant to be. It was also not uncommon to hear it being compared with such esteemed company as The Matrix and Inception. While it's not as good as the former, and not as clever as the latter, it's still an okay – if unremarkable - watch. Basically, take one-third Terminator, add a touch of 12 Monkeys and mix in some Carrie, and the result is Looper. And if that sounds a bit on the loopy side, that's because it is. <br/><br/>In the future, there is time travel, but as it's banned, the only people using it are criminals. They send back ex-colleagues and other targets to be executed in the past by 'Loopers' – specialist executioners who incinerate the future garbage. Literally. So when a Looper called 'Joe' (Gordon Levitt – in makeup) gets his latest victim, he's in for a huge shock when he discovers it's himself. Or rather an older version of himself (Bruce Willis). And so begins a sometimes interesting, though occasionally confusing chase/hunt as the younger Joe tries to zero in on his older self.<br/><br/>On the plus side, this has lots of really good ideas and interesting concepts in it: the younger version of Joe can send messages to his older self by cutting his instructions in his flesh; memories are simultaneously created and rendered vague by the actions of the younger iteration; and in one scene another older Looper - who escaped death earlier - starts to literally fall apart as his younger version systematically loses limbs though surgery performed by the bad guys who are financing all the Loopers. It's a scene that is slightly reminiscent of the Black Knight's demise in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, though much more grueling and shocking. Also, the makeup on Gordon Levitt is quite subtle and very effective: you actually believe both him and Bruce are the same person, albeit from different places in time. The future world looks unique enough without being completely alien and unfamiliar to us. So where does it all go wrong? About half way through<br/><br/>For a movie with such an intriguing premise, promising every manner of head spinning older assassin against his younger self interactions, along with the customary shootouts and all the ensuing paradoxes resulting from traveling through time, this takes an abrupt turn that is so left-field you'll feel you stumbled into a different movie It's almost like writer-director Rian Johnson ran out of plot after breezing through the first half and said: ""Where else can I take this I know: a farm where  etc"" This sudden turn is so out of sync, as to feel it doesn't belong in this movie. The clue is in one of the movie references mentioned above. It is a shame because it's fifty-per cent a very good movie.<br/><br/>The cast are very good too: Gordon Levitt doe a really good job as a younger Bruce, while Bruce himself starts off sympathetic but gradually changes into something that is both ruthless and quite monstrous. Emily Blunt also does good work as gun-toting farm owner. So if they're all that good, then where does this go wrong? Obviously, this movie probably looked brilliant on paper, but after execution, is decidedly lacking. What you're expecting is not what you get – and not necessarily in a good way. You think you're going to get something dazzling - something with the intricacies of the brilliant Spanish time travel movie Timecrimes; but what you actually get – at least for half of it - could easily be a standalone, and pretty pedestrian horror movie. Again, you wonder: why wasn't somebody standing at Johnson's typewriter with a cattle prod, telling him to come up with something better?<br/><br/>There's a lot of inconsistencies too: without being overly specific, stuff is done in this movie that makes no sense when you think about it after wards (heck, even the central premise makes no sense – surely the criminals would be using time travel for something more ambitious than to just bump people off?). Also, there is a central antagonist that is meant to play such a huge part in ruining older Joe's life, older Joe wants to hunt him down; yet we never actually get around to meeting this evil doer, only a different, more vulnerable version of him.<br/><br/>Inconsistencies aside, you're left with a movie that somehow misses the mark despite the groundwork being laid for something really special. It's not as action packed and visionary as The Matrix, and not as clever as Inception. Maybe it's the type of movie that could get better on a re-watch – i.e., once you're familiar with the direction it ends up going, it might actually be possible to end up liking it for what it is – but as a first time viewing, the movie falls a bit flat and that's entirely a legacy of the final half. Want some advice? Go watch Timecrimes instead."

However, once you get some time to think about the time travel sequences (and in fairness the movie dialog warns you not to at one point) it will probably bother you a great deal.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd have to say that the movie is moderately entertaining, but the writers should have spent more time patching the holes in the plot."

","The first 30-45 minutes of the film were fantastic. The pace was great, the action and set up was entertaining. Not only are we presented with a lot of story that raises questions about this future world, but we're also fed a reasonable amount of eye candy to keep the movie grounded in a seemingly digestible reality. Everything up to this point was making this movie great, exciting and leaving you excited for the next act. However...<br/><br/>The remaining part of the film robbed the audience... First off, the scenery drastically changes and is barely revisited (from cityscape to rural farm lands,) leaving many plot holes and many questions unanswered.<br/><br/>Why are there so many vagrants? Why does it seem like there is no functioning government? Is the mob running this city?<br/><br/>These are merely a handful of questions that are never answered. It's as if they were neglected and cast off in hopes of fooling the audience. I wasn't asking for the entire movie to be about exploring these topics, however I think that these were a few of the more important questions that played an integral part of this movie.<br/><br/>Additionally, I think that the story of the Rainmaker is almost laughable. It's force fed to us. There is no intrigue, there is no mystery. There is a line drawn from point A to point B. Where is the creativity? Again I want to mention that the thought and idea of this movie was very original but failed to deliver. There were so many other options available to solve this issue of the Rainmaker, but the director sold out and took the typical UN-ORIGINAL Hollywood path. Disappointing. In summary I feel like this was a movie marketed to draw large crowds, keep them in their seat for a third of the movie before seemingly trapping the audience, forcing them to endure a disappointing and lackluster performance.

The plot is full of more holes than Swiss cheese with them very poorly and lazily papered over with ""I'm not going to talk about time travel"" being mentioned throughout.<br/><br/>Levitt just looks weird throughout, and IMO looks more like John Travolta, compare that to the recent MIB III or Star Trek where the cast members were believable as younger versions of the characters we know, They would have done better having ME play Bruce Willis' younger self!<br/><br/>The TERRIBLE insult to the viewers' intelligence that is the mob seemingly having time travel, but somehow being unable to dispose of a dead body in any other way makes me want to cry, the ""the Mob sent a guy back to head the Loopers"" MIGHT work if it wasn't for them somehow knowing when a Looper hadn't done their job, and how exactly the Loopers even know when they need to be waiting for their kill.<br/><br/>Spoiler<br/><br/>Add to that the scene with the old Seth losing body parts because they were hacking up the young Seth which makes little, if any sense, but when they killed him his older self disappeared so why on earth wasn't that possible to start with, the whole ""it would cause problems"" attitude with once again zero explanation is annoying.<br/><br/>END SPOILER<br/><br/>Then we get on to the ""future"" society in 2044, 31 years in the future, and all they seem to have achieved is plugging Solar panels into rubbish cars from the 90's, almost everything else around (save for the pretty shot of ""future China"") is identical, or even dated by todays standards. Compare this even to films such as Aeon Flux or Blade Runner, let alone modern future-set films, and it would appear the budget for the film was very poorly spent.<br/><br/>There are other reviews saying this is a let-down as a sci-fi film, but enjoyable as an action film are being too kind, it is just an utter let down on all accounts."

"Kickass13","8","17","37","1 October 2012"," A sci fi masterpiece that combines heart, brains and excitement to make possibly the best film of the year
","Sci-fi films often strive for originality. Contrary to what many spiteful internet fan boys claim, Hollywood is not afraid of new ideas, It just doesn't come up with them that frequently. But every so often amidst the failed attempts at being the next matrix or blade runner, there's an inception or a district 9 that makes you believe in the movie industry's commitment to quality once more. With Looper Rian Johnson manages to do something very few films ever do. It makes us think, feel and sit on the edge of our seat often all at once. The premise is not that mind boggling. Whereas other intelligent sci-fi's have convoluted plots that we try to decipher amongst the spectacle Looper sets us up with a basic idea, but an idea that deepens and grows more dimensions than the trailers suggest. To give away too much would be a crime, so its best to go in knowing the basics. Joseph Gordon Levitt plays Joe, a specialised assassin known as a Looper. These Loopers are hired for the not too taxing job of assassinating people sent from the future all tied up with a bag over their heads. They then receive payment in the form of ""silver"" attached to the targets back. The looper then disposes of a body that technically doesn't exist and so wont be looked for. However with the job comes a specific requirement. A looper will also have to retire himself by assassinating their future selves this is called ""closing the loop"". And this is where the core of our story begins, but crucially it is not the real focus of the story as it moves on. As you'll know from the trailers Joe is tasked with killing his future self (Bruce Willis) and when he fails to do so is on the run from the criminals who hired him to do so in the first place. Where the story goes from there is unexpected and in places rather dark. There are many smart little details in Johnsons phenomenal script, that really flesh out the world he has created for his film. The characters use their own lexicon and slang, they have their own type of future drugs (taken through eye drops), and some of the details regarding the time travel are inspired. Again to say too much would do the film a great disservice but its clear Johnson has an eye for both ideas and spectacle. The camera moves in such an organic involving way, each frame is so precisely positioned you know if you got the chance you wouldn't change a thing. Techinically the film cannot be faulted. The look is warm and believable, stylistically there are moments that will stay with you long after you've left the cinema (a moving and thrilling ride through 30 years in particular is very cleverly interwoven into the story structure) and the soundtrack fits exquisitely. The characters are all sympathetic and deep with multiple dimensions. Even when one character goes to do something unspeakable mid way through the film, its believable through the brilliant direction of Johnson. The cast are all superb, especially Gordon Levitt who plays a complicated character and evolves him masterfully with the aid of a screenplay that puts character in the foreground and lets the action merely be the cherry on top. Thats not to say that the action is anything less than outstanding. Looper proves that action can still be thrilling with just a few men and some guns but at the same time provides us with some fantastical comic book fantasy spectacle with a dash of surprisingly brutal violence. As the film powers towards an awe inspiring and heartbreaking conclusion we begin to realise just how involved we've become. It actually matters to us what becomes of Joe and how this stylish, smart tale will end. Perhaps its down to a great cast giving it there all. Perhaps its down to great technical wizardry, but most likely its down to the vision of Rian Johnson, who does that rare thing of proving, Hollywood can take risks."

"Ncasaletto06","9","11","22","30 September 2012"," Thought provoking, time traveling, science fiction...Seriously!
","Time travel has been something integrated in cinema for decades now. Usually, when you hear about a film with some sort of time travel element involved, you're in for a fairly cheesy ride, full of plot holes. Very rarely can a film take a premise so out of this world, and make it grounded in reality. I am very happy to say that ""Looper"" is one of those rare occasions.<br/><br/>The film takes place in 2042, Kansas City. Time travel has not yet been invented, however, in 2072, it has. The mob in 2072 sends their target back in time 30 years, where a Looper will than shoot the body on site and dispose of its remains, making it forever untraceable. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (500 Days of summer, The Dark Knight Rises) plays a Looper named Joe; he is the youngest Looper to be hired. Always doing his job without hesitation, he doesn't look at their faces or ask any questions, he just gets his job done and collects his money. However, his life takes dramatic twist when one day, he is face to face with an older version of himself.<br/><br/>That's about as much of the plot that I will give away, going into to this movie as fresh as you can will benefit your cinematic experience, dramatically. The film is written and directed by Rian Johnson, who made his directorial debut with the detective film noir, ""Brick"" which also starred Gordon-Levitt. Johnson has a unique style to his directing, which is clearly present in this film. He uses unorthodox angles and lighting to add a certain dark and gritty feel to most of his scenes. While also using mostly practical effects, it gives the film a certain feel of realism that is refreshing in today's film culture, to say the least. There are no weak links here acting wise, as Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a breathtaking performance as a man who is troubled with his past, that is also trying to protect his future as well. His portrayal of a young Bruce Willis is spot on, getting all the little mannerisms down to a tee. This is the best I have seen Bruce Wills in years, giving his all in the more emotional scenes in the movie. For once I felt like I wasn't just watching Brice Willis playing himself, I was watching the character of Older Joe, who happens to be portrayed by Bruce Willis. <br/><br/>Time travel is nearly a back drop in the story. It is explained in fragments, not giving you a clear cut explanation how it works, yet not dumbing it down as a cheap plot devise either. Johnson paints a not so glamorous take on the future. The look and feel is rather dark and bleak, rather than a flashy, technology driven future, we see in most science fiction epics. The story is small in scope and just deals with the characters at hand. Every scene, plot point, and action, has a purpose to how the film will eventually rap up, in its ambitious conclusion. <br/><br/>If you are going into this film expecting a big sci-fi chase movie with none stop action, you may be disappointed. It is a character based movie with science fiction and time travel elements. Elements that are done extremely well and also very entertaining. As a huge fan of sci-fi, it was nice to see the genre have a more personal and unique take on it. Seeing a character, played by two different actors that are from two different time periods, brought together in a smart, thought provoking manner, was a two hour rush that is gladly worth the price of admission. It reels you into this futuristic universe with its opening shot and doesn't let go until the credits are rolling. There is a period in the middle of the film that takes place at a barn which is a little slow and some of the CGI effects that are present aren't exactly top notch. Yet those are just minor setbacks, to one of the most original films I have seen in years. In a world where we are surrounded by reboots, sequels and prequels, ""Looper"" was a brilliant breathe of fresh air."

The many worlds can create histories that make every narration untrustworthy even if they are locally true. The prevailing theory (used by writers, anyway) would have events in the future affecting those in the past just as much as the intuitively more reasonable changes in the past influencing the future. Causality becomes folded. It is a blessing for a writer who understands.<br/><br/>But not so here. The story is told from one time frame that loops back. Every view you see is trusted. The end is unexpectedly straightforward. Things do not become retroactively untrue. Lives are not undone, though the Bruce Willis character tries. It is as if the writer was tempted to take us on a wild ride, but ended up writing in events that prevent it.<br/><br/>This means that we don't have the luxury of plastic causality, and some of the explanations here just don't add up. The complex scheme of sending people back to be killed is explained by saying that tracing humans in the future is thorough, so corpses are hard to get rid of. This makes even less sense as we see some action in the future. The tantalizing existence of the coordinator from the future is treated as if it were not tantalizing, but ordinary.<br/><br/>It hurts that the character we hope will stir the pot is played by Bruce Willis, clearly chosen because of his role in 'Twelve Monkeys,' where (if you did not know the original film) he really did mess with our heads.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

Complicated set-up is actually laid out quite smoothly, with a concise Gordon-Levitt voice-over and good work from both he and Bruce Willis. Other elements of the film, such as Jeff Daniels' casting as a no-nonsense syndicate boss and Emily Blunt as a single mother on a farm (who adds plenty of nonsense), do not work.

Gore can be of quality, and it can be just like it's forced to be there. There was nothing surprising in the movie, even the ending. It just felt like it was trying to make a statement, a great impact maybe; it did not.

","Looper drew me in with its interesting premise; a hired gun (Joe) who assassinates targets for a criminal mob from 30 years into the future until he comes face to face with himself. It was a unique idea and the concept of 'modern-Joe vs. future Joe' translated to film really well for the first half of the movie but at around the half-way point the barebones explanation of the details of time-travel, paradoxes and alternate timelines is waved away with a succinct ""I don't want to talk about time travel shit."" (yes, an actual line in a movie about time-travel) as the plot became more complex. This was a disappointment in a movie who's main draw (for me) was its potential for thought-provoking questions on its sci-fi premise, what I got instead was a more character-driven plotline within a looser framework of sci-fi concepts which, while enjoyable, still left me somewhat let down. <br/><br/>The de-emphasis of time-travel and the minutia of its consequences contradict the grounded tone of the rest of the movie, a focus is placed on the feelings of human beings, and the world seems feasible but the hand-wavey fashion that the film deals with the core idea of time-travel (which is vital to the plot) ruined the immersion for me. It demands a suspension of disbelief so great that it softens the emotional impact of the performance of Joseph Gordon-Levitt (who is the star of the show), and the supporting cast of Emily Blunt and Pierce Gagnon (who are central to the plot) The characters are the main focus of the story but even this isn't perfectly executed, Bruce Willis' character, while competently acted, is mostly just used to further to plot and shoot things which did not make for a compelling watch.<br/><br/>The movie suffers for its deviation from the initial premise and its confusing venture into a low-effort and ill-conceived dip into vague, supernatural thriller territory on the biological super-evolution of humans (which is about as unexpected and awkwardly introduced as it sounds) and the claims of movie's cleverness are only half true, while on the one hand it presents the motivations, desires and emotions of its characters with some skill and humanity but on the other a surprisingly low-effort attempt is made in fleshing out the mechanics behind the time-travel which I believe to be a major misstep on the writer-director's part, holding back what could have been a truly great, original movie."
"Leofwine_draca","6","3","4","7 May 2014"," Not bad, but not as good as it thinks it is
","LOOPER is the latest Hollywood movie to tackle the thorny topic of time travel. This one's a little bit like the Van Damme vehicle TIMECOP, although it strives to be less cheesy and more realistic thanks to the presence of former indie director Rian Johnson, who also made the high school murder mystery BRICK with Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Gordon-Levitt plays an assassin who executes criminals sent back from the future for spurious reasons, although inevitably he soon finds his life spiralling out of control when things take an unexpected twist.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this film. It feels fresh and appealing in many ways, and visually it's a triumph. Gordon-Levitt's performance is fine, although that prosthetic make-up is distracting, and it's fair to say that Bruce Willis is pretty good too, as this is probably the best performance he's given in a while. The action sequences, when they come, are efficiently handled.<br/><br/>So what gives, then? Well, the truth is that LOOPER isn't quite as entertaining as it thinks it is. For once, the story doesn't really work under close scrutiny. All of the other time travel movies I've seen have made a point of not allowing the characters to encounter themselves in another time period, as this would cause a paradox. In this one, Willis and Gordon-Levitt share cups of coffee together, and it never quite gels.<br/><br/>In addition, the pacing is off, with long, boring and tension-free interludes spent sitting around in a farmhouse with the miscast Emily Blunt. Yet another twist involves characters who are telekinetic, which is all a little too much; wasn't the time travel plot enough? Although it's not bad for what it is, LOOPER doesn't hold a candle to the ultra-efficient low budget Spanish time travel movie, TIMECRIMES."

","It's rare to see a movie nowadays without its trailer spoiling all the plot points and action but Looper certainly scored points for allowing me some genuine surprises throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Let's start with the film did well before I get to my gripes. Willis and Gordon-Levitt put in their usual good, albeit stoic, performances and the other characters add some colour to the proceedings.<br/><br/>It's a good looking film too with subtle FX work and great change of lighting styles between the city and the countryside. The premise, which I'm sure I don't have to explain, is very nice also with plenty of scope to explore.<br/><br/>That said, I had some serious issues with this movie, specifically the plot. The more I think about this film the more it dawns on me how completely flawed it is. I understand that time travel is always going to offer certain challenges but Looper offers no consistency with the way it handles action and consequence. Rules established at the start of the film are conveniently ignored by the end. It's fair to say no-one knows how time travel works and how actions changed in the past would manifest themselves but I am certain Johnson has got it wrong. It's the same with motivations of the characters, which are not just shortsighted but verging on the ridiculous.<br/><br/>And don't get me started on the 'TK' sub-plot which was included for no other reason than lack of imagination from the director. Just because it was introduced at the start of the film doesn't mean it not a deus ex machina.<br/><br/>I feel this was a wasted opportunity by a talented director who gave us a great idea and then destroyed it."

","I've read a few of the negative and positive reviews of ""Looper"" and find myself completely in tune with the negative. After the disappointment that was ""Prometheus"" I was hoping the Sci-fi action genre would redeem itself with something more entertaining and intelligent.<br/><br/>I'm not going to get into the faults in plot, as they've been recognized and pointed out by other reviewers in this forum: Like the idea of sending the bodies back to prehistoric times where the Rainmaker and his goons don't have to rely on, and pay hit men to dispose of the bodies. Or the idea proposed by another reviewer: killing the guys first, and then sending them back in time.<br/><br/>Anyways, I found it hard to sympathize or empathize with a character who callously kills people in such a coldblooded manner and then dopes up and hits the party circuit; likewise with the way he has no qualms about killing his future self – perhaps if more angst was conveyed, I might have believed it. Early on there was a failed attempt to make him more empathetic when he was conscientious enough to stop his car instead of running over the kid in the street, but it wasn't enough for me.<br/><br/>Speaking of drawing sympathy and empathy, the movie would have benefited if Bruce Willis's wife was more than just a cardboard cutout ""revenge inducer"". It may have added some emotional meat to the story, but instead, a vacuous montage is served up, as director, Rian Johnson, deems the image of the wife extending her middle figure (flipping the bird), as enough characterization.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis dueling submachine guns near the finale was trite, Piper Perabo's bare torso was nice (not sure what else her character was doing there), and the casting against type with Jeff Daniels as the bad guy was original, albeit a total miscast. ""Looper"" is a film that combines the wonder of pedestrian cinematography, punctuated by average performances, pointless characters, perfunctory dialogue, and a porous plot.<br/><br/>I have no problem with movies portraying profanity, brutality, nudity, and all the stuff pompous, pretentious, prudes persecute and pretend to hate, but there has to be a purpose and a point.

Plot holes everywhere, story couldn't make up its mind about what it wanted to be, the future world was incredibly poorly realised and practically not even visible apart from insignificant, out-of-place elements such as hoverbikes and tiny, transparent cellphones.<br/><br/>The worst of it all, however, is the complete idiocy of how time travel worked. Apparently in the future you can't dispose of bodies, so you have to send them back 30 years (yeah, 30 - not back before the beginning of human civilization or anything, which would have been easier) to be killed and disposed of by someone there. Why send them back alive instead of killing them there and just sending the body back? We aren't told, so we're forced to suspend even more of our disbelief and assume you can't KILL anyone in the future, despite that not being what we're told. But then why are people in the future threatening each other with guns? What are they going to do if the target doesn't comply? Not to mention that later in the film they DO in fact shoot someone in the future, completely ruining the already terrible plot device that you can't kill there.<br/><br/>Why is everyone using civil war era firearms prone to jamming, when there are plenty of high tech weapons around in both eras? Must be some sort of honour or fashion thing among the loopers, right? Nope, Old Joe has no problem grabbing a couple of P90's at one point, which he of course drops after a few seconds of use, to go back to his trusty six shooter that already failed him once.<br/><br/>Oh, and without spoiling the story: If someone is coming to kill you and those you love, and you know that person can't track you but just knows where you are now, what do you do? If you answered ""leave that place"", you are smarter than any of the characters in this film.<br/><br/>|Slight spoiler|: The entire premise of the film is that character X is evil and must be stopped, because X is killing off the loopers. But the loopers are murderers - yet not a single person wonders if X may be doing a good thing by getting rid of them. No, we're supposed to accept it as obvious that someone getting rid of hired killers is evil.<br/><br/>These are just what I can remember off the top of my head, but not ten minutes went by during the film where my palm didn't come into contact with my forehead over some stupid, pointless or completely self-refuting brain fart. I've never seen anything pretending to be intelligent fail so hard at it."
"AlienByChoice","2","20","48","4 October 2012"," Mediocre, over-hyped, and an insult to science-fiction fans
","The last movie I saw in a theatre was District 9. That was a long time ago, so when reviewers called Looper ""an instant science fiction classic"" I knew I had to see it.<br/><br/>Well, let's start by saying that Azimov, Bradbury and Heinlein must be turning in their graves because ""sci-fi classic"" it is not. Sci-fi rip-off - maybe. I find it hard to remember the last time I saw a movie with such mediocre wooden acting, boring plot (let's not talk about plot holes, shall we), artificial direction, such blunt plot devices (Bruce Willis character:""let's not talk about time travel because it will give us headache"" - REALLY?!), such clichéd execution, and such a huge pretense. But if I try really hard then there is indeed a movie from a completely different genre that fits this description - (500) Days of Summer. Ah yes, the Joseph Gordon-Levitt link. So what do we have here? A rip-off of X-Men, Terminator and Blade, directed by someone who tries very hard to be Christopher Nolan but ends up being McG. I could carry on insulting this film, but the final insult that I'll share with you is that it failed the pee-break test. A science fiction thriller based around the concept of time travel is not a movie that should tolerate a pee-break. And yet I walked out, and returned to my seat 5 minutes later and I didn't miss a thing. <br/><br/>2/10 - no redeeming qualities except for tolerable special effects."

","This movies starts as a good sci-fi entertainer, then quickly turns into a romantic, save me mummy, remorse story. What happened!<br/><br/>Let's look at the story – Yr. 20xx, disposing anyone's body in future is almost impossible. But Mafia will do what they need to do so they send the trouble makers back in the past e.g. John is a naughty man in 2075 so mob sends him back to 2045 to be executed, simple!<br/><br/>Considering from the present, future is just a possibility, so even if you get rid of someone from the future that man (only men do dirty things, the movie didn't show any mischievous ladies getting killed) may grow up from the past to have the exact same life. Hmmthis will get you thinking.<br/><br/>Also how come a guy who kills for a living suddenly has a cry baby heart and goes out to protect people? He suddenly notices the innocence of lifewhat was he blind B4!<br/><br/>In short it's a movie fit for Bollywood, senseless & random."
"jefflouvre-435-77367","5","19","46","30 September 2012"," It's Terminator revisited in this assassination-romance flick
","TIME travel is a popular theme in movies as it allows directors to postulate the idea of humans travelling across time either to change the past (Terminator, 1984) or to realise that you can't change the past (Twelve Monkeys, 1995).<br/><br/>In 'Terminator', John Connor sends a rebel soldier back in time to save his yet-to-conceive mother from a cyborg attack. The mother conceives a baby with the soldier and the baby grows up to be John Connor. Viewers must accept the fact that the foetus continues to live even after the soldier dies.<br/><br/>In 'Twelve Monkeys', in a bleak future caused by a virus attack, a man (Bruce Willis) is sent back in time to find out what caused the attack. The future society accepts that it can't change the past; it just wants to finds out what caused the present situation. In this movie, the adult Willis meets his child self. He also dies in the past, but his child self lives.<br/><br/>The past comes alive once again in writer-director Rian Johnson's Looper, about a bunch of assassins who kill scumbag sent back in time.<br/><br/>Here's how it works. Villains 30 years into the future send back those they want killed. The loopers blast these baddies into oblivion, get rid of the bodies and pocket a sizable amount of silver for their deeds. The catch is, the villains must knock off these loopers in 30 years to ""close the loop"".<br/><br/>I found all of this rather confusing, and if most viewers are like me, they'll spend most of their time figuring out what's going on instead of enjoying the movie.<br/><br/>Young Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt in swept-back hair, a fake nose and darkened eyebrows) is immensely rich because of his unusual profession. He snorts drugs (eyedrops), drives around in his sports car, goes clubbing and enjoys the services of an escort, single mum Suzie (Piper Perabo)<br/><br/>The landscape of the future is pretty much similar to what you've seen in other movies, but there are more street people and shooting thieves is definitely allowed. In this case, Looper misses a chance to comment on the social discontent brewing in the streets. And if it didn't do so, then why show these scenes?<br/><br/>Young Joe moves to Shanghai, China, and becomes Old Joe (Willis), who marries Summer Qing (Qing Xu). There's not much talk between them, and I presume she's in the movie to open doors into China's huge market.<br/><br/>Old Joe thinks he's reached nirvana, but his 30-year tenure is up and he must now face his own extinction. He blames a new villain called the Rainmaker for breaking up his idyllic lifestyle.<br/><br/>He escapes his fate and travels back in time, narrowly escaping being killed by Young Joe.<br/><br/>Old Joe tells him that they should find and kill the young Rainmaker, who just happens to be in the county they're in.<br/><br/>All this talk and lack of a female presence means its time to introduce the lovely Sara (Emily Blunt), a farmer whose son Cid (Pierce Gagnon) is 10 and is one of three suspects scheduled for termination by the Joes.<br/><br/>It's interesting to note that an assault on Young Joe is felt by Old Joe, which is really cool, but not until you realise that this first happened in Frequency (2000).<br/><br/>In the meantime, syndicate boss Abe (Jeff Daniels) is hot on their heels, so all this makes for a lively finale, if you have the patience to sit through this remake of Terminator.<br/><br/>www.jeffleemovies.com"

","The movie lacks of sense, I don't understand why people is calling this a clever plot!!??

","The problem here is the script and overall way of telling the story, because the idea of filming point blank executions of so many individual people close up and personal is too gross to handle. The director has no idea how to make a film watchable. He just causes stress which spoils the good bits, and in fact he makes me wonder if he's a freak who needs an outlet for his sadism. I liked two things about the whole film, and for their visual aesthetic only. Frankly, I felt so disturbed by the idea of this being on general release and that I had seen it that I wished I hadn't gone to see it - and the strange fact that people have given it good reviews on IMDb makes me wonder if EVERYBODY is desensitized to extreme violence and I am the only one who knows that you don't have to kill and maim to make things exciting and fun..."

","This movie starts strong, and then takes a very slow turn.<br/><br/>It's not the movie that I thought it was going to be. No spoilers, but the time-travel element didn't need to be there at all; the same story could've been told without it. So I thought that was kind of disappointing, since I wanted a movie that focused more on that.<br/><br/>It had a few comedic moments, but nobody but me in the theater laughed- I wonder why. Mostly it was the ""action"" movie it looked like it would be, but not the sci-fi one. Though it's the same kind of action you've seen in every other movie.<br/><br/>The ending felt very rushed to me, and I suspect the original concept for this movie was lost in translation, or that some script-doctor tried to ""fix it"" to appeal to a mass audience. Or it was just never a story that deserved a two-hour film (maybe 30 minutes).<br/><br/>That said, most of the performances are good, there are a few good conversations that can come out of it (philosophical stuff), and I'll give it credit for trying to do something different. It's just not the movie I wanted it to be."

"markgraham280","9","13","31","26 September 2012"," A nicely balanced Sci-Fi action film.
","Looper tells the story of two dystopian worlds: 2042, the film's present, where time travel is yet to be discovered, and 2072, where it exists but has been outlawed. Time machines are only used, however, by organised criminal gangs that cunningly abduct their enemies and send them back 30 years for special contract assassins, called loopers, to execute and cremate - no trace and no questions asked.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the young, drug-addicted half of the film's protagonist, Joe - a looper whose narrative exposition is as blunt as his merciless killing style. He does not kill out of blood-lust, though, only for the silver bars strapped to the backs of his faceless targets. Indeed, as well as the drug he administers to his eyeballs throughout the film, Joe is addicted to the fashionable clothes, classic cars and glamorous women his murky profession affords him, while at the same time being keen to get out.<br/><br/>When the criminals of 2072 decide to cancel a looper's contract, they simply transport his future self back in time for him to eliminate, along with a generous severance package that he may use to see out his remaining three decades in luxury. This is called 'closing the loop'. However, when Joe's future self (Bruce Willis) materialises before him one day, he escapes, condemning them both to death. Young Joe's only hope is to track down and kill his older and wiser self, a man who's on a mission of his own to change the future.<br/><br/>Like all time travel movies, Looper suffers from a lack of originality. Name your film - The Terminator, 12 Monkeys, The Butterfly Effect - they're all here, or, at least, bits of them are. And yet Rian Johnson (Brick, 2005) somehow manages to splice together numerous familiar ideas to produce something fresh. The thing about time travel as a theme is that it's fundamentally irresistible: we yearn to see the paradox's resolution like impatient time lines straining to reorganise themselves. Fortunately, Johnson has taken great pains both in his writing and direction to avoid the plot holes that usually ruin films such as this.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt builds on his reputation as one of the most talented young actors currently in the business, but he's not really the star of Looper. Willis brings all his vintage action man credentials to the fore; Emily Blunt impresses as Sara (Conner, anyone?), the single mother trying to protect her son, Cid (Pierce Gagnon), from the violence heading his way; even Jeff Daniels puts in a decent performance. No one stands out particularly and no one lets this film down - it's a collective triumph on every level.<br/><br/>Looper's film noir style is also one of its strengths. The CGI works well and thankfully doesn't saturate. It's a believable, compassionless world that Johnson creates and one that's sadly becoming increasingly familiar in the present day. It's a Sci-Fi action movie first and foremost with plenty of chase scenes and exciting shoot-outs, but it's also replete with truly disturbing moments. What is a telekinetic child capable of when he gets angry, and what happens to future-people when their past selves are viciously mutilated? There will be blood.<br/><br/>I knew from the opening scene that Looper was going to be special, but it got better by the minute. I have a suspicion that I'll be doing some time travelling of my own very soon - returning to the cinema to see this marvellous film again.<br/><br/>For more film reviews: http://ins-kino.blogspot.co.uk/"

I'm always interested to watch a new time travel movie and see how they resolve the paradoxes and puzzles inherent in the idea. Unfortunately, this movie didn't even try for the most part. While Joseph Gordon-Levitt is pretty enjoyable in any role, I felt like Bruce Willis was phoning it in and expected something more for such a highly-rated movie.

"redrawn","3","8","17","14 January 2013"," Disappointing
","This movie is slick, intense, and well acted. It has an interesting concept, and the basis for a classic future-noir. Instead it has two disjointed story elements, messily pasted together to stretch the movie to the two-hour mark. The initial concept of time travel, and its implications of meeting your future self, are entirely thrown away to stage a series of well crafted, action set pieces, complete with a blaring electronic soundtrack, and lots of shooting. The pace never lets up, the movie is an adrenaline rush from start to finish.<br/><br/>But it is also a wasted opportunity. Aside from the distracting CGI involved in morphing our lead actors' faces together, the movie looks great, a combination of film noir and western designs spruce up the speculative future. The production design, including costumes recalls Blade Runner.<br/><br/>The story is a messy pasting of confusing plot elements all thrown in to make you forget how ultimately pointless this exercise was. And when it degenerates into an action chase filled with throbbing music flashing guns, all is lost.<br/><br/>Half an hour too long, unfocused, and in the end nothing more than an action movie that dreams of being Inception. A wasted disappointment."

I went into the movie expecting it to be very good, but it was so good, it became one of my favorites ever! The story is so well written and put together and the whole time travel thing is very complicated as to make you think really hard and intrigue you, but not too much as to make you not understand the movie or plot. I recommend this movie to everyone who wants an exciting thriller that keeps you at the edge of the theater seat and delivers awesome action-packed scenes, all while you try to figure out what will happen next.

","Looper garners a richly deserved ""dumb and a half"" rating with this reviewer. Now viewers get that time travel is not possible, never will be, as proved by the fact that the present isn't already overpopulated with temporal tourists from the future. We're ready to set aside belief on this point in exchange for a decent, believable storyline: the first rule of verisimilitude. Unfortunately in this loopy story we are supposed to believe that it's impossible to kill someone in the future so organized crime sends its trash back to the present for disposal and incineration by hired guns called 'loopers.' So we viewers are supposed to buy into the idea that the bad-asses of the future are daft on top of nasty. Wouldn't they just hire a single guy to keep the fires burning and time-zap their chosen victims directly into the fire? Or dispense with that expense and ferry the intended directly into the fiery maw of a fusion reactor? Since they seem able to direct location as well as instance with their illegal chicken-wire-lined time machine couldn't they then just ship undesirables off into the earth's core, outer space or a studio session of the Ellen show? <br/><br/>Now let's deal with the syrupy implication that our hero's final act saves the dopey telekinetic kid from a life of crime, allowing him to turn his special powers towards the betterment of humanity. Come on, with a little self-control, this kid's powers are tailor-made for evil and destruction. The best he can hope for by going over to the bright side is for a life of picking up litter wholesale, maybe popping the odd litterbug's head for sport and punitive measure once in a while. That's it. While his powers are awesome, they have little value outside of the underworld.<br/><br/>If you value your time set your own time-machine on bypass for this stinker."

"theycallmemrglass","8","17","46","25 September 2012"," Great storyline but a missed opportunity to be something more
","I saw this at a preview screening in London.<br/><br/>Its thought provoking and certainly intelligent sci fi. For Willis fans, of which I am one, I'm happy to say that he is at his laconic and bad-ass best with a complex emotional drive attached to his character's purpose. Levitt, who plays a younger version of Willis character, is however, doing more of a Robert De Niro impression than a Bruce Willis one but thats not a big deal because he does it damn good. Jeff Daniels also makes a mark as a no nonsense gang boss of the Loopers organisation, not the type of role one sees him do often but he's effective. <br/><br/>I don't relay plot, you got the synopsis for that but don't expect this to be a big sci fi action film because its not. The visual aesthetics of the future setting is unspectacular, very basic and unimaginative. Its the sub standard ghetto look of a lawless society. It has absolute bare minimum of any signs that the film is set in the future with just two or three shots of a hover bike and one shot of holographic computer monitor). Focus is on story here that drives a moralistic catch 22 type narrative. I think the film is meant to be a thriller too but rather than being thrilled for any of the main protagonists I was simply intrigued which was enough to keep me engaged.<br/><br/>There are only a few action scenes, most of which are basic chases on foot and gun fight set pieces. Some do pack a punch especially when Willis is involved but on the whole they are not anything special. The direction is placid but to the point. Dialogue is OK, there's a tiny sprinkle of dark humour but overall it lacks spice.<br/><br/>The time travel element is certainly imaginative, and well thought out to serve a fluctuating storyline that doesn't trap itself in restrictive rules. I do find it has holes though but perhaps with a bit more thought on it and adding a time travel rule here and there, you might be able to fill those holes.<br/><br/>So does it live up to the hype that its currently getting from press critics? No, not really but thats because the hype was too high. Its a very good film, it tells a superb moralistic high concept story and I reckon it is still the best sci-fi film of the year. I just cant help the feeling that its a missed opportunity, given its excellent storyline, it could have had a much bigger impact with a more punchier and exciting execution. Its just not the all round entertaining experience as I perceived it would be from the general consensus. <br/><br/>So lower the expectations and enjoy the great story, some vintage cool Willis moments and an intriguing finale. If you enjoy everything else about it too, then good for you."

"Galina_movie_fan","9","5","10","14 December 2012"," Then I saw it..
",""".. I saw a mom who would die for her son, a man who would kill for his wife, a boy, angry and alone, laid out in front of him the bad path. I saw it and the path was a circle, round and round""<br/><br/>I wanted to see ""Looper"" (2012) written/directed by Rian Johnson as soon as I read the first reviews about it. It intrigued me for several reasons. The critics and viewers praised it. The first two Johnson's films were interesting and original and I wanted to see his new work. I am a fan of the time travel genre. Where else does the hero sit at a table in a roadside diner facing himself, either thirty years older, or thirty years younger - depending on which side he is sitting? Or where else rather clichéd phrase ""he was in a deadly conflict with himself"" means just that? And more. What does a man feel at gun point, with himself holding the gun, either thirty years older, or thirty years younger? <br/><br/>Another reason for me was Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the main character Joe, the looper. He is a convincing versatile young actor, one of the most interesting of his generation. For Rian Johnson, Gordon-Levitt is kind of mascot. Johnson made all three movies with him, and Joseph was a leading man in two. An interesting feature of Gordon-Levitt's role (Joe ""closes the loops of time"" working as an assassin for the Mafia) is how he based Joe on young Bruce Willis. He plays young Willis' on- screen tough guy persona that we so get used to identify with and root for, and he does it very good. Bruce Willis also plays an important role of aged Joe. If you guessed that Willis would be saving the world that got into a serious trouble you may be right. This is what Willis does in the movie well: saves lost children, city, country, planet, and the universe. In ""Looper"" Willis plays retired hit man, whom his crime bosses sent with a bag on his head from the future, 2074 to the past 2044, to get rid of him with no trace. What happens to him when he arrives to the past, who meets him, how will he try to change the past to save the future - it's all in the loop, tied by Rian Johnson.<br/><br/>By Johnson's words, despite the fact that ""Looper"" was a time travel film, he was more interested in creating the human characters, in choices they make in a situation that was caused by travel from future to past. This film is about making difficult choice, the possibility of one person to change the course of history, and how far he'd go for it. Dedicated to the paradox of time, ""Looper"" mixes futuristic science fiction and dark noir known for biting dialogue and off-screen sharp voice in Humphrey Bogart's movies style. Johnson adds the stories of love, not the least the love between a child and his mother. As befits a film about the possibility of time travel, the focus centers on whether it is possible, knowing exactly how the future will turn, to change something fundamentally important in the past, to correct it, and how this change will affect the lives of everyone involved. It would seem that nothing new, original and exciting can come out of the time travel genre after Terminator 1 and 2, 12 Monkeys, The Butterfly Effect, and their granddaddy, Le Jetee that started them all? But Johnson did it and even without a big budget, not trying to make a future in his film looking like a futuristic super modern giant metropolis. On the contrary, not so far removed future of 2044 looks more like the abandoned and gloomy suburbs of big city, shaken to its foundations by deep economic crisis, where the power is already in the hands of large criminal groups that control the time travel and use it to effectively get rid of the enemies sent from the future.<br/><br/>Using the elements of the time travel genre, Looper goes beyond the borders. It asked interesting questions, and gave different answers. Rian Johnson, writer/ director, does not mind to break the rules of genres in his films. His films are more of stylizations, pastiches of genres he likes and interested in. The elements of genres are the building blocks, the bricks for him which he makes his films from. No wonder, his first film was called ""Brick"" (2005). <br/><br/>To create a smart, interesting, original stylization, a game of mind - is not an easy task, and Johnson has the gift for it. His first two films, ""Brick"" and ""The Brothers Bloom"", were both intelligent, curious, but, rather, cerebral variations of films and books that Johnson likes. ""Looper"", his third, is also clever and gripping but what makes it the best of three, it's got heart in the right place. ""Looper"" affected me on a deep emotional level. ""Looper"", in my opinion is one of the best independent American movies of 2012. Being an independent filmmaker, Johnson is able to assert his creative ideas, but without super-budget. But I am glad that ""Looper"" did not look flashy and glamorous. It is more than just an eye-candy. It has a plot, intrigue, and the loop that it will close in a truly original, searing manner. While closing this loop, the film will answer the most important question - can you destroy the source of evil, which will bring tragedy and death to the future, if you look at it right now, this minute and ""you see it. You see a mom who would die for her son, a man who would kill for his wife, a boy, angry & alone, laid out in front of him the bad path. You see it and the path is a circle, round and round..."" Would you change it?"

","This movie had an interesting storyline. It had way too much gruesome violence & torturous scenes as well. There were topless women which were unnecessary for the plot of this movie.

I definitely would not recommend this movie to anyone. I wish I had saved my money or seen something else. I do admit the main characters acted well.

","Four stars instead of two only because it has Bruce Willis, whom I like.<br/><br/>What do we learn from this film? We learn that the future is bleak, but not really as bleak as in Blade Runner. We learn that Ford Motor Co. has at least 30 or 40 years of life yet. We learn that the drugs of the future will be administered as eye drops. And we learn that people will develop mutations which will enable them to circumvent the pesky laws of physics at will.<br/><br/>But the most important thing that we learn from this film is that internal consistency in a script is now obsolete: two different plot points in the film use two vastly different solutions to the same (time-travel related) problem. The first solution is just silly, but acceptable in a mindless sort of way. The second solution is conventional, but it also completely invalidates the need for the first solution.<br/><br/>The pacing is somewhere between slow and glacial. I would say that this is not a science-fiction movie, but rather a bizarrely slow-paced action movie with some science-fiction and some fantastic elements. It's a little better than a typical Syfy Original, but not by much."

","So time travel has been invented thirty years into the future, and crime bosses are sending back dudes in time to be killed by hired assassins of the present day, thus easily disposing of bodies. They cut their contracts off by having said hired assassin kill their future self and enjoy the next 30 years of life to their fullest. But one dude doesn't want to kill his future self for a few split seconds, and he now has to kill his escaped older self while also on the run from the Mafia.<br/><br/>Now from the perspective of a Hollywood executive, what I just stated alone, is likely viewed as gold. You have the perfect blend of science fiction, thriller, crime, and not only that, but throw in Robin from the Dark Knight Rises AND Bruce Willis? That's the kind of stuff that's green-lighted within mere moments.<br/><br/>And, for the most part, the first (probably) hour of this movie pulls things off with ease. Although it certainly shows a few flaws, such as laughable choreography and occasionally shoddy camera work, everything is explained in an interestingly stylised fashion, the writing itself is fairly well done and the characters have a pretty good amount of depth; very few share similar traits and all have a different way of relating to the viewer, that could potentially come in handy later on.<br/><br/>That is, assuming, there actually is a ""later on"".<br/><br/>Following the aforementioned first hour, the entire movie gets the impression its on the wrong bus, and quickly finds a different coach to board. We go from an almost grind-house-style Mafia film with an absolute army of characters to unload, to a slow-building Sixth Sense meets Cowboys vs. Aliens. Suddenly, a multitude of points from the premise gets scythed. The protagonist's, Joe, love interest is never mentioned again, his often-shown drug abuse problem is never brought up, the Mafia essentially takes a backseat for about half an hour, hell, even the idea of time-travel gets axed for a good 15 minutes. What these have been replaced with is a carelessly written, unnecessary family issue, concerning two only vaguely related characters known as Sara and Cid, that takes up an equally unnecessary amount of time within the movie. <br/><br/>This could be considered jumping the shark, if instead the Fonz accidentally smashed into the shark, killing it, and using its corpse as a raft back towards land. By the time civilisation is in sight however, Fonz has already died of hunger, and floats lifelessly through the ocean.<br/><br/>Drearily cynical and drawn out metaphors aside, the acting from this point on was inferior to beforehand; characters showing a single, lock-jawed facial expression for absurd amounts of time, the love story between Joe and Sara comes completely out of nowhere (that is to say, no buildup whatsoever), and they re-introduce a plot point regarding telekinesis in a few characters, that was brought up once at the beginning of the film, uninteresting and unimportant, that suddenly becomes the plot device that is now keeping everything moving. Occasionally, the movie cuts to Bruce Willis killing children, which is actually some pretty damn heartbreaking stuff when you see the amount of emotion he's overcome with afterwards, yet these are few and far between.<br/><br/>But really, those manly tears he sheds could well embody the mindset of myself as I saw what this movie had morphed itself into as a whole. I'm legitimately convinced that this was handled by two producers that really couldn't call compromise with what they envisioned the movie to look like, and essentially sabotaged each other's scripts. It's one of the most tragically squandered prospects for, as I said, a seriously intriguing premise, that I've seen in film."

The situation opens field to a set of narrative and slightly philosophical questions. One just never understands why the closure of the loop isn't done by someone else besides the self. This option would surely make the whole situation so much easier, and surely there would not be loopers tempted not to kill their self selves. Why didn't the big bad guy that rules the world in 2074 thought of this? Forgetting that basic but yet so important plot fail, it is a well put together action film and Emily Blunt is beautifully filmed - i guess Rian liked the girl. If the narrative would go on in 2012, and being the future the time where the to-be-killed guys would be sent from, everything would be exactly the same. So, not much of science fiction here besides cool design cars, sophisticated weapons and a few more ordinary things that don't bring anything actually essential to the plot."

","Looper is an exciting and mentally stimulating science fiction movie that goes above and beyond in the realm of creativity. Original and thought provoking in its execution, this is a movie about time travel with a future that is gritty, plausible, and fantastic to absorb.<br/><br/>Taking its cues from hard hitting gangster movies, the story follows Joe, a young man living in 2044 America that is crippled with economic collapse. He works for the mafia as a ""looper"". This is a job that requires some explanation. You see, 30 years from 2044, time travel will be invented. It is highly illegal, but is used by the mob to dump bodies, because it is impossible to do so in the future-future. Loopers get set times and places where they wait for their victims to appear, bound, gagged, and with a mask over their head. Sometimes a looper ends up killing himself from the future. This begins happening quite often, and rumor has it that a man named the Rain Maker is ordering the killings of all loopers. Joe does not seem to think much of this until his future self arrives, without a mask on. His future self escapes, looking for the child who will one day become the Rain Maker. Young Joe finds a woman and her young, troubled boy who are one of the people on Old Joe's map. He decides to wait there to confront his older self, to try and make things right with the mob.<br/><br/>The movie twists and turns in unexpected ways that create a true feeling of suspense. Rian Johnson takes major influences from the likes of Martin Scorsese to craft a cold and calculating crime film. However, Johnson makes a movie that is so original and eclectic that it is obvious this is the work of a man who knows how to tell a story. There is plenty of action, but it never becomes more important than the story or the characters. Johnson also wrote the script, and he brings humanity to all of the players involved. The introduction of alternate timelines is only the beginning of the insane subplots that pop up, and all fit nicely together. The gritty and subdued style invokes a noir aspect that only serves to enhance the movie.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays young Joe. He is fantastic as the cool, calm, and collected gunman. His face is altered with makeup to make him look more like old Joe, played by Bruce Willis. Levitt even speaks like the action star. Willis is really great in a subdued and complicated performance, although it would have been nice for his character to have had a more expanded role; he seems to fall into the role of the antagonist too quickly. Emily Blunt plays the hardened and self reliant mother of the boy old Joe is hunting. Blunt's character is used well and she gives an excellent performance.<br/><br/>Looper is a bizarre movie, and that is a very good thing. Exciting, thoughtful, and at times disturbing, this film is mesmerizing to watch. It's not often that an action film is even half as good as this one, and rarely are movies so much fun to watch.<br/><br/>thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com"

"Likes_Ninjas90","6","6","14","2 October 2012"," There are conventional elements at play that don't allow the film to free itself from the imprint of the modern studio system
","In the future criminal organisations have access to time travel, which has been made illegal by the government. Since people are easily tracked, criminals have had to think of new ways to dispose of bodies. They use time travel to send back people they want killed and to have their bodies disposed. The people hired to kill them are called Loopers. If a Looper misses their target they will have only thirty years to live their life before they are killed. One of these Loopers is Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who was taken away from petty crime and given a job by his boss Abe (Jeff Daniels). One day Joe is shocked to see that the person sent back to him is an older version of himself (Bruce Willis). Old Joe manages to escape but then later explains that in the future his wife is killed by the crime boss the Rainmaker. He vows that he is going to track down the Rainmaker as a child named Cid. The younger Joe discovers that Cid is being sheltered by his mother Sara (Emily Blunt) on a farm and that the boy has special powers. <br/><br/>Hollywood is afraid that we won't ""get it"". If a film is deemed too confusing, or too ambiguous, it is a failure amongst audiences. The safety net for Hollywood is therefore to reproduce previous successes, through sequels and remakes, because they're already proved with audiences and therefore bankable. It saves Hollywood from the potential embarrassment of funding something that is too risky. This ridiculously naive attitude to mainstream audiences, not only denies them the opportunity to think for themselves and to be tested against new concepts, but also restricts filmmakers from providing something truly unique. Established filmmakers, those who are profitable at the box- office, are granted more creative freedom and control, which means that their work can remain intact. Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010) and Duncan Jones's Source Code (2011), for example, escaped from the net of the studio system and were rightly labelled as the 'thinking man's blockbuster'. Looper has similar ambitions. It is written and directed by Rian Johnson, who made the post-modern noir drama Brick (2005). Johnson says he idolises the Coen brothers and isn't interested in studio projects. Although his film is overflowing with interesting ideas, both old and new, and you can admire it alone for that, there are conventional elements at play that don't allow the film to free itself from the imprint of the modern studio system. It's tense, funny and action-packed, but it could have been better.<br/><br/>After such an engaging and original opening scene, it's difficult not to be disappointed by much of what follows afterwards. It's a fantastic start because it catches you off guard with something entirely unexpected, providing a wonderful platform for mystery. Why then does Johnson impatiently diminish these feelings of shock and disorientation by explaining exactly what just happened and why through voice over? Were there scenes cut explaining these crucial plot points more organically? Some of the exposition is admittedly useful later in the film, as the shape of the narrative becomes tricky, but this opening is just downright lazy. It is also unusual that as original as the film's premise sounds, the creativity doesn't flow through to the character of Joe. Aside from his unique line of work, he is not a particularly interesting or unique character. His reliance on fast cars and women, as well as his decision to sell out a friend, means that there is a conventional track of progression to follow here. He shifts from heartless killing machine, to surprise, an unselfish nice guy, protector of woman and child and potential love interest. Who would have thought? Comparatively, Old Joe's narrative is at its simplest a tragic love story, which is detached and uninvolving. This brief subplot with Joe and his future wife is presented through montage, reflecting faded memories (a clever stylistic touch). But it also means that not a lot of time is spent developing their relationship, so a significant plot point is more like a minor footnote. It reminded me a lot of Cobb and Mal's relationship in Inception, but that was developed over the course of the entire film, with great dramatic results. <br/><br/>As conventional as some of the character development is, there are finer details in the screenplay that are small but intriguing, building up to a bigger picture of the film's universe. One of the more fascinating aspects is how impoverished the streets are in the future, which means that scavenging is a necessity for the lower class and those who have guns will use them. The way the film scans through some of these images of poverty, weapons and violence is occasionally more brutal and confronting than you might expect. That is until the last quarter where the film itself relies on these gunfights itself, opting to have Bruce Willis dual wield twin machine guns and wipe out rooms full of bad guys. The point being that as the film becomes increasingly straight forward, with its structural gimmicks and dark themes unravelled, the more it lulls. There is definitely a large dip in the amount of energy in the second half, with a lot of time spent on Sara's farm. It is here that the film also feels strangely derivative of the Terminator films, as two men from different time periods have the conflicting roles of shaping a child's future history. For many of Looper's flaws though, it is still a film of ideas. Some of them contribute to a slickly produced sci-fi story and others merely try to hide the more conventional elements of the script. There is little doubt that it's far more sophisticated and ambitious than the recent Total Recall (2012), but it's also a few steps well short of the craft and the emotional hook of Inception."

The MOB (the Mob will always be around) uses it anyway to send someone they want whacked back 30-years where a Looper, an assassin who closes the loop and shoots him and disposes of the body. Young Joe (Gorden-Levitt) is a Looper and because Time Travel is as complicated as it is, a now Older Joe (same guy) (Bruce Willis) comes back from 2074. Now Young Joe sees himself as Older Joe and he needs to whack Older Joe. What to do? What to do? But, Older Joe escapes and has an agenda and that is to find and kill the Rainmaker, who will abolish Loopers.<br/><br/>This was quite enjoyable.

"consciousgeometry","5","5","11","20 November 2012"," Embarrassingly ill conceived
","As it is often the case, this movie's badness itself didn't really stun me to any serious degree- rather did the praises and loads of positive reviews it received.<br/><br/>In my eyes, as can be easily deduced from the rating I gave it, the film wasn't anything critics promised. Rather than being clever and intelligent about the time travel premise, the writer/director didn't seem to deem it necessary in any way, to waste one thought about what is relatively plausible and what utter idiocy. <br/><br/>I will assume that the reader has already seen the movie and therefore take for granted that she or he has the plot still in mind. I also won't give a comprehensive list of plot flaws, as many other users have done, i.e.: pointing out the fact that it's plainly unbelievable that time- travel should be used by some criminals to dispose of bodies . Such ""little"" flaws maybe could have been acceptable, or even gone unnoticed, if the central element of the story wasn't a giant singularity of writer-stupidity.<br/><br/>In order to see this, we have to consider some vitals segments of the course of the plot. The passage I have in mind isn't really shown linearly and continuously in the film- maybe the director tried to draw the viewer's attention away from the completely illogical structure of the narrative:<br/><br/>At first, we see our protagonist Joe (1) standing in the field, that is his murderous workplace, waiting for a victim to appear. Then, of course, Joe (2) from the future arrives (without the standard victim's apparel: his head is exposed), overwhelms his younger ego and escapes. The younger guy wakes up some time later and heads to his apartment, where he fights some goons and in the process gets thrown off the balcony. After that, there's the above alluded to inexplicable break in the narrative, which I at first interpreted as a stylistic device.<br/><br/>The screen blackens. Later we see young Joe- standing in his field again, exactly as before. Again, Joe-from-the-future appears- but this time only to get shot down helplessly by his younger self (he has his face covered, in this scenario). We see young Joe (Levitt) getting transformed into old Joe (Bruce), who after 30 years is sent back to be killed.<br/><br/>This old Joe (Bruce) manages to break the loop and escape his younger self. The plot then continues at the point where the screen faded to black before.<br/><br/>So what happened here? The ""old Joe"" (Willis) managed to avoid his execution, therefore ""breaking the loop"". But this ""old Joe"" (Willis), in his youth, managed to kill his older self. Actually the only way it was possible for the ""old Joe"" to become the ""old Joe"" he is, was to kill his (then) older self, when he was still young. Therefore by ""escaping"" the execution through his younger-self, he (Willis) already completely annihilates himself.<br/><br/>To generalize this explanation: The older Joe depicted by Willis, after having escaped, necessarily must now have a different past than the young Joe depicted by Levitt. Because when the now old Joe, was still a young Joe, his respective old Joe, did not survive. So the Joes, that are the movies protagonists, cannot be identical. (Nothing that interacts with a temporally displaced version of itself can be the very same thing it interacts with) There is a section of their lives (namely: the execution on the field) that is temporally the same, but not structurally. The causal link between young and old Joe is completely ruptured at this point.<br/><br/>And this, my friends, is an utter outrage: The premise of much of the movie is an error in thought. There is no way, young and old Joe could coexist.<br/><br/>The ending later, again, is a cheap bluff: Young Joe ""realizes"" that a temporal-causal loop will always lead to the uprising of the rainmaker and his murderous spree in the future (this of course is nonsense- there is no real loop present in the film, as I went at lengths explaining above; it's more of a causally incoherent, fragmented spiralor something). Because he wants to prevent the telekinesis child from becoming the Rainmaker, he kills himself, so that his older Willis-self won't be able to kill the child's mother, as this would lead to the child becoming a sociopathic sorcerer.<br/><br/>As young Joe thus dies by his own hand, old Joe obviously immediately disappears. Apart from that nothing else happens. Mother and child (not so) merrily cruise away.<br/><br/>But let's remind ourselves: Young Joe is only in that field, because he had to confront the old Joe. But the old Joe's existence, as it happens, is already, and always has been, terminated because of his younger versions suicide. So the younger version never having been confronted with angry old Joe never had any reason to walk into a field and kill himself there. So how then could mother and child have gotten into this field, let alone, how could they have even seen the older Joe (who never existed)? etc. <br/><br/>Does this sound familiar? Yes: It's actually a slightly different version of the grandfather paradox. Instead of murdering his own grandfather and therefore cancelling his own existence instantly and trough all time, making the murder itself impossible, young Joe is compelled to kill himself, by the arrival of his older self, which could have never existed because he killed himself still a young man. The old Joe is necessary for the young Joes decision to kill himself. But this exact action makes its own cause impossible. <br/><br/>Interestingly, this is what Roger Ebert has to say about the ending: ""This film leads to a startling conclusion that wipes out the story's paradoxes so neatly it's as if it never happened."" Well said sir, well said."

If you are going to watch a time travel movie, you are going to have to shelve some questions, no doubt. But this movie asks you to leave too many basic questions unanswered.<br/><br/>Such as:<br/><br/>Why is it so hard for the future mob to get rid of bodies? If it's hard for the future mob to get rid of bodies, why did they shoot Old Joe's wife? Particularly given that she was simply walking around and was not a threat? And further given that they had a future stun-gun device in their hands that could have immobilized her? Why not kill the victims before sending them back? You'd hope by 2074 they'd have a lethal method of killing people that didn't shed blood. I mean, they have flying motorcycles in 2044, and a time machine in 2074, so surely they would have a quick way of zapping people. In 2012 we can't even make an affordable EV, but we have flying motorcycles just 32 years later? If the future mob has the precision to send people back to the exact spot in a cornfield, why not send them back to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean? Or the North Pole? Or a volcano? Or 1 mile under the Pacific? Or New Jersey? Why, exactly, is it a problem for ""loopers"" to be alive in the future? If loopers know that they are going to be captured and returned in 30 years, why are they sleeping in bed with their wives? You've had 30 years to prep. Why does young Joe have attached ear lobes (cat's ears) but old Joe has ear lobes? ;) Gold is preposterously heavy. How does old Joe move around so easily with what amounts to several hundred pounds of gold on his back? Why not send the older loopers back to be killed by loopers who aren't them? They clearly have no issue shooting strangers. How does a major crime boss from the future leave himself open to having old Joe shoot and blow up everybody and every thing in 5 minutes? There are many others - those are just the obvious ones.<br/><br/>This movie was not clever. It was anything but clever, in fact. But, if you don't ask too many questions, as the movie implores, you might be able to eek a bit of enjoyment out of it.<br/><br/>By the way - the movie was more gruesome than it needed to be. I felt a bit guilty watching the violence."

When I go to see a Sci-fi film that involves time travel I take it for granted that I'm going to have to ignore some technicalities that tend to crop up in time travel plots. In Looper I didn't really have any trouble over looking the time travel plot holes. My problem was how much I had to suspend disbelief for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of Science fiction but I felt Looper crossed over into the Fantasy which is a genre that I don't enjoy.

"zkonedog","9","2","3","6 March 2017"," Willis Gets Time Travel Right Again
","Back in 1995, Bruce Willis starred in a movie (""12 Monkeys"") that managed to do what most time-travel movies cannot: make even a modicum of sense. In ""Looper"", Willis (this time sharing the screen with Joseph Gordon-Levitt) once again gets time-travel right.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Looper"" is set in a future where time travel isn't invented yet...but will be in thirty years, primarily used by the mob to get rid of their ""dirty laundry"". Each day, Joe (Gordon-Levitt) waits in a field and guns down time-looping individuals as they appear. One day, however, Joe must ""close the loop"" on himself by killing the older version of himself (Willis). When the time comes, though, Young Joe hesitates and Old Joe does not, leading to an interesting scenario filled with astounding possibilities.<br/><br/>Where ""Looper"" primarily succeeds (like ""12 Monkeys"" before it) is that it perfectly walks the fine line of successful time travel fiction: it doesn't come off as hokey, yet it doesn't spend too much time deconstructing the science involved. This is a story about people and their relationships, with the time travel being the vehicle towards that end. It also gives the viewing mind a lot to think about.<br/><br/>Only helping matters is the acting of the two leads. It is absolutely astounding how Gordon-Levitt was made to look like a young Willis. He is almost unrecognizable from his previously roles in films like ""Inception"" or ""Dark Knight Rises"". Their chemistry with each other is both intense and interesting, a fact that is only bolstered by the fact that they are one in the same person!<br/><br/>Overall, ""Looper"" is just a well thought-out time-travel flick that also packs a ton of drama and character emotion. High praise must be given to director Rian Johnson for making what can be a maddening subject into a coherent screenplay. It makes you think, makes you feel, and always keeps you guessing as to what will happen next."
"Tweetienator","4","2","3","10 January 2016"," Just Another Time-Travel Failing
","Well - I don't like time-travel-movies much because most of the time imo the writers screw the story up. But the high-ratings and the fine actors involved dared me to give the movie a try - and ofc it failed... Far too many holes to the plot (e.g. if the gangsters in the future got a time-travel machine there is no need for loopers at all, just think about it.) Also the movie didn't hold my attention well - too much dialogue for my taste which lead into the kingdom of sleepiness. The implementation of the mutant kid didn't make the story better at all. Another aspect are all the action scenes - uninspired and at best mediocre stuff. Summa summarum: imo one of the few good time-travel-movies is the original movie Time Machine of George Pal from 1960 with Rod Taylor in lead. If a director or writer wants to rise chances for making a bad movie - he/she makes one about time-travel."
"lou-45632","5","2","3","2 January 2016"," Weak plot
","This movie fails already at the premise. If the criminal gangs of the future can send back people in time, and do so with very high accuracy for both location and timing, then there is no need for ""loopers"" at all. Simply send them back to 100m above the ground, from where they will fall to their death, or to the middle of the Pacific Ocean, or to 5000 BC. Any of these options will guarantee that the victim will die immediately - no need to hire a looper and take the risks that this entails (as seen in the movie).<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is the usual time traveling mumbo-jumbo. No time traveling movie will ever make sense, because the concept of traveling back in time is physically impossible and causes all kinds of unsolvable paradoxes. So if you like movies which make sense and where the characters behave in a rational way, stay away from this. However, if you like movies where you just turn off your brain and watch Bruce Willis shoot a bunch of people, you might enjoy this."

","Looper is a movie that deals with time-travel, and is mainly about a group of people called ""Loopers"", who are basically modern-day assassin's working for the mob. Everything is going well for one particular Looper (Joe) until something happens when one of his targets gets away, but that isn't the only problem because this particular target is Joe's future self.<br/><br/>Now, story-wise this movie is pretty decent. It's a really good idea, but to be honest, it actually gets pretty confusing a lot of the time. I know that movies dealing with time travel CAN get confusing, but Looper just jumps around far too much, and if you're not paying attention to it right from the start you will get lost very easily, very quickly.<br/><br/>The performances, however, are good, and Jeff Daniels actually plays a pretty decent mob boss. On paper you wouldn't have thought that he could have pulled off the part of playing a bad guy, but he does a surprisingly decent job of it. Bruce Willis is probably the best in the movie and if it wasn't for him, the movie may well have been worse.<br/><br/>Looper, unfortunately, was just far too boring for me. It was 30 minutes of decent action & viewing but the other 1½ hours was pretty much just sheer boredom, waiting for it to pick up again. If it kept up a good pace with the story ticking over it would have been much better. I know that movies - especially ones like this - need wee ""breaks"" in them so you can catch your breath so to speak, but there were just far too many times where you thought ""finally, it's picking up"" for it to only just slow right down to a crawl again.<br/><br/>Overall Looper is worth a watch - just - but in all honesty don't expect anything brilliant."
"rawiri42","5","2","3","14 November 2014"," Strange.....
","Well, this is one movie that I have absolute;y no idea what I think of it! So, you may ask, why am I writing a review? Good question. I suppose the answer is that, once I started watching Looper, it was too difficult to stop. Several times I wanted to but then I thought, that, if I did stop, I would miss something great. (This was not diminished by the fact that the movie had a score of 75 on IMDb, by the way!).<br/><br/>Looper is certainly not a movie to watch if you're hoping for some light entertainment. It takes not one, but two science fiction themes - time travel and telekinesis - and mixes them all up so that there's no guessing what's coming next. Whilst Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon Levitt (who both play the same guy 30 years apart) share the star billing, for me, the real star of this movie was Pierce Gagnon who played Cid, a 10-year-old telekinetic kid. Some of his facial expressions were brilliant for a child actor and I have no doubt that we will be seeing a lot more of him over the next 60 years (if he doesn't destroy the world before then, that is!)<br/><br/>The biggest disappointment for me was Emily Blunt's American drawl (albeit very well done) because her English accent (Young Victoria for example) is so delightful - but then I guess that just shows her star quality.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm a bit slow, but, right up to the end, I was wondering how the whole thing was going to work itself out and, yes, I was surprised!<br/><br/>So my advice is, if you aren't into real complex sci-fi, Looper is probably not for you. I would say the same if you're thinking of hiring something for some pleasant light entertainment. However, if you're a real sci-fi and film noir enthusiast, you'll probably love Looper. Good luck with it."
"jb_campo","3","2","3","15 July 2014"," Looper Fails to Excite
","I had high expectations of Looper, but ended up disappointed in the final product. The story falls flat and gets caught in its own repetitive loop, which drags it down the tubes.<br/><br/>Joseph G-Levitt lives in the past, does drugs, and is a looper whose job is to kill people sent back from the future by mobsters. Apparently the bad guys cannot just kill someone in the future, so they grab them, send them back in time, illegally, and the looper kills them for silver. This guy is a loser who just goes around killing people with no soul or purpose or respect or really anything at all. He just does what he's told to do, sleepwalking through life, and getting paid for. His only marginal friend is not really a friend. He shows his social side by studying French, a useless throw-in that served no apparent purpose.<br/><br/>How many times do we need to see this guy shoot somebody with his special gun? I didn't count the numbers, but enough already!! We get the point - he kills people. Kind of reminds me of 8 Mile, when the first few F-bombs have an impact, then you just get numb from overuse. Obviously, the plot didn't have enough depth, so the director used this tactic as a filler that added no value.<br/><br/>Enter Bruce Willis, Levitt's older version from 30 years in the future. OK you think, now it's going to get interesting. Not really. Willis and Levitt had no real chemistry. Casting mistake here. You learn some stuff about Willis in the future, and you learn he's trying to preserve his future by controlling his past. OK, yep, we saw this in Terminator 1, 2, 3. Nothing new here.<br/><br/>There are chase scenes, and killings, and an interesting Diner scene, but really, the story drags. I started using fast forward so I could get somewhere where something would happen. The final scene takes place on this farm which I think lasts a good 30 minutes, and brings in Emily Blunt. She does an OK acting job, but her role again lacks depth of character, so there's not much to work with. The ending, oh wow, what a surprise...not. Figure it out yourself, you don't have to be too imaginative.<br/><br/>Boring plot, disappointing chemistry, ad nauseum killing, standard b-grade acting. I cannot recommend this film, despite the advertising you see. It's just a poor film all around. I recommend instead Source Code which plays on a time travel theme, without the killing, and a superb storyline with superior acting. Skip Looper - it stinks."

","Looper wasn't a bad film, however it fell well short of its potential and no doubt falls into the category 'only watch when bored'. My biggest issue with the film - aside from its climax being predictable - is the plot, which seemed confused and noticeably switched focus midway through the film. <br/><br/>Whilst I'm not against that if done correctly, it was the subsequent lack of character development that really made this film suffer. Most of Looper's characters seemed insignificant - you found yourself simply not caring about them. This to my mind was caused by the surface level knowledge you're given throughout the film. That said I did enjoy Blunt and Levitt's performances, whilst Bruce Willis does what he does best. The action set pieces are okay - nothing you haven't seen before - but are thankfully good enough to hold an audience's attention.<br/><br/>Overall a decent watch but nothing that will make a lasting impression."

","Looper is set in a mob controlled society in the not too distant future. The mob use 'loopers' to carry out death sentences by transporting the victims back in time to a pre-arranged time and place. When their usefulness is over, loopers themselves are transported back in time to be terminated by their younger selves (closing the loop). If a looper fails to complete the termination, the looper then becomes a target. A new mob leader takes over all 5 mob syndicates and orders all loopers to be terminated. This leads to an attempt by one looper to use time travel to prevent the mob leader taking over.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is good. There is action, suspense and good acting.<br/><br/>The time travel used in the movie leaves a few people scratching their heads. When a looper fails to close the loop, they change their own history. If they kill their older selves, they get paid out and retire, whereas if they fail, they are tracked down and killed. The movie is confusing in the way it shows both possibilities taking place at the same time. Also, no one knows if the paradox of changing your own history (grandfather paradox) is even allowed in our universe. This includes meeting yourself (to close the loop).<br/><br/>Another issue is Joseph Gordon-Levitt is supposed to be a young Bruce Willis. Everyone knows what Bruce Willis looked like 30 years ago from Die Hard (well 25 years ago). Gordon-Levitt looks nothing like him - this failed for me.<br/><br/>And what is it with Bruce Willis and aspirin.<br/><br/>Some of the story elements are far fetched. The time transportation devices used in the film can transport in space and time. It would be easier to transport someone a few kilometres underground than elaborately transporting them back in time to be killed.<br/><br/>So what score to give it? Has a few deficiencies but Bruce Willis is in it - 7/10."
"mjk280","4","2","3","17 March 2013"," Had Potential
","This was a pretty good concept and when the film started I thought I could've been in for something special. Unfortunately it seems like a concept was mostly all they had, because this movie simply doesn't hold up the further along you get into it.<br/><br/>The first 1/3 to 1/2 of the movie is pretty entertaining. You've got the looper concept which is new, and even though it doesn't make complete sense the film moves at a brisk pace so although you might have some issues with how time travel works in this universe you can set it aside and just enjoy yourself. After a certain point in the run time though the movie just loses where it wants to go, or they decided to go in a direction that doesn't serve what they've built up to this point all that well.<br/><br/>Soon after Bruce Willis inserts himself into the plot the movie starts unraveling somewhat. We are given each character's motivations, but not shown much to prove them. Characters who are absolutely crucial to the plot show up halfway through. We are told of a character or characters that will have an immense impact on the life of the main character Joe, but most of it is only alluded to and we just have to take the film's word for it. <br/><br/>This could've actually been a sweeping, epic 3 hour journey and it may have paid off to take that risk and film the movie as such. I say that because some plot points are breezed past very quickly and a good bit of emotion that should've shone through doesn't.<br/><br/>One dynamic of the movie I felt was new and unique was when Joe meets his older self (Bruce Willis). Bruce is trying to convince Joe that he has to take certain action to keep his future intact, but Joe isn't interested because that's his old self's life and not really his own. This brings up a lot of interesting questions. If you could communicate with yourself 30 years into the future, would you take their advice so your life would turn out a certain way or ignore them in order for things to turn out naturally? The movie doesn't explore this beyond one scene, and it's not the main focus of the story, but it could've been.<br/><br/>One final criticism: You cannot have a movie about time travel and then whenever characters are forced to deal with the implications of it, have them say ""Don't start talking about all that time travel stuff, it'll just make our heads spin."" That's unforgivable. It's like having a character shoot someone in the head from 10 miles away and when another character asks how they can do that, they reply ""You wouldn't understand."" No, no, no. Unacceptable. You need to address those things or you don't have a story. Nevermind the fact that a lot of people are going to see this movie based on those types of conversations. It makes the plot more interesting not less!<br/><br/>Overall hardcore sci-fi fans will hate this movie but most people might enjoy it. Other than Bruce Willis killing children (offscreen but still), it's a 'meh' Hollywood product that will entertain those that don't think too hard about these sorts of things. For me even though I am a big sci-fi fan I was able to forgive the plot holes but only until the movie started dragging and took an odd turn. At that point it just added up to a somewhat nonsensical experience that didn't stick with me at all."
"gorillapimping","6","2","3","22 November 2012"," error in continuity and fluff
","For a two hour movie it was simply too uncompressed. The plot could be told in little over a minute with a clear understanding of the point. At its base it was of a martyr who altruistically gives up his own life for the greater good and without any public recognition. With plenty of unnecessary fluff, they managed to expand this concept into a slow progression film. I do admit that some of the time travel paradoxes are well developed like the creation of old memories for the old Joe. However there is one major error in continuity- It could not be a cycle as described at the end because if young Joe didn't kill himself, he would grow up to know what caused the Rainman's violent mannerisms, and thus old Joe would not have gone back in time to do justice the way he attempted. For Rainman to turn out evil the way he did, Sara would have had to be shot by old Joe, and young Joe would have seen it and grown into old Joe with the knowledge of who Rainman was and why it happened, and thus would not have continued the cycle by going back in time and failing to kill child Rainman again, but would perhaps take different measures. In short, If Rainman is evil, old Joe must know why, and would not go back in time to make the same mistake. I think it deserves a 6.9 IMDb score, but I'm shooting it a 6 to bring its overrated current score down to justice."

","I went to see Looper when it came out in Finland, and I was in love with it since then. <br/><br/>I've always liked the idea of the story. It's complicated in the way time travelling stories are always complicated. Still the plot is mostly straight forward and it's clear what people want. Also it's brutal just in the right way.<br/><br/>Of course if you're serious about the time travel aspect, sometimes the time travel paradox doesn't seem to make awful lot of sense, but if you're just in it for an action thriller then you're going to be fine.<br/><br/>One of the weirdest things in this movie is to see Joseph Gordon Levitt look like Bruce Willis. Like he pulls that off, and it's not completely awful, but it just look odd. You could've made that happen some other way too, not just make JGL copy Bruce Willis completely... <br/><br/>I'm usually not a big fan of science fiction, but when it comes to only small doses of science fiction, I might love it. With Looper the only doses of sci-fi are the time travel element and the telekinetic abilities possessed by some of the characters. Even if time travelling is a key element in the story, it doesn't make the story feel too futuristic. The weapons look pretty regular and there are only few futuristic looking vehicles in the world. <br/><br/>This makes it possible for the story not explain the world too much. It looks and works pretty much like ours apart from the few details that are explained very clearly. It's not necessarily only a good thing: you might want to know more about the world, but you can't. You can only see the slightly dystopian aspect on how there are clearly wealthier people partying and then there's so much poverty on the streets and all that.<br/><br/>If I absolutely hate something about this movie it's the sound mixing. Sometimes watching this movie is painful because the characters talk quietly but then there's all that action noises and shouting... It's easier if you have subtitles on, then you don't have to blast the movie on full volume. I often stop paying attention to it, but there's that one diner scene where I always pay attention to it, it's just super annoying.<br/><br/>It's always a risk to rewatch a movie you used to like 5-6 years back, because you might ruin it, but also can you be neutral in reviewing it if you already like it? The thing about Looper is that while it's a good action movie, watching it too many times doesn't make it good, unfortunately. It's still alright, and there are still some scenes that are breath-taking, but everything between those few amazing scenes feels dull."

It's forbidden to let someone alive but it happens therefore it changes the whole future of a two main characters who are both the same person. One of them 30 years older him who he didn't kill. As the future is inevitable older him has to influence on the young him because he is changing the future but the old him want his wife back so there is many action how they are both trying to prevent each other. Even as they are the same person, their goal is different and both won't let another change it. Movie contains many action which is nicely implemented but future 2034 is poorly made, it only shows future gen. computers and smartphones but dinner restaurants and the fashion does not look from the future at all. Not to mention 2076 when older guy goes back to prevent young self, building shown give you a little SF moment but that part is not good made though.

","In my opinion if you want to make a brain teaser like this then you have to pay attention to all the smallest details, but unfortunately i do not think writers had that on their menu that day. The movie breaks its own rules when it comes to time travelling, the ending of the movie is completely impossible if we take into consideration their rules for time travelling and what happens when someone dies. When Joe shoots himself at the end, the only thing that happens is his future self disappearing. But according to what we have seen during the film, everything should have changed, if Joe killed himself, that situation out there in the field should have never happened, therefore it could not have affected the Rainmaker kid and his mother, so the grand finale itself is completely irrelevant.<br/><br/>Otherwise it was not that bad, was fun and enjoyable at times, acting was fairly decent and it was not boring. Bruce Willis had his classic tough guy role pleasing the viewers with one of his usual rampages 1vs20 wiping everyone out. I thought we are going to see the ''future'' as well and why this whole mafia thing is actually happening, but they did not even bother showing a single glimpse of that by just simply shaking it off as an irrelevant fact at the start of the film.<br/><br/>Could have had way more interesting details, a look in the future/mafia actions and so on.

Levitt transforms himself in to this role, and the quality of the make up really makes him look like a younger Willis.<br/><br/>I did find that the film took place in Sara's house, played by the versatile Emily Blunt, far too much. It made the Science Fiction elements become lost in translation as the intimacy of this secluded area made it feel more like a drama. <br/><br/>The effects are the most underwhelming aspect, for today's standards and with a cast like this, I was expecting much more.

I break it down, so go no further, unless you want to hear it in its bare bones state.<br/><br/>I have seen this film at least 3 times. Its fun and intriguing enough for just about anyone. The things that have been foretold are way more realistic in this movie than in most other ""futuristic"" tales. But not very heavy on action.<br/><br/>In terms of actually dealing with time travel, this film uses it as only the remotest plot device while focusing more on the what and how that lead to events, not the actual world shattering event itself. But instead of messing with our minds with an endless conundrum like in Predestination, which was great because it WAS about causality and an endless loop, LOOPER the film keeps it simple.<br/><br/>Now considering that in terms of time travel, before anything there is always a time line that precedes all others, flowing in a natural rhythm and pace. In that time line little out of the ordinary happened, so this would be Timeline 0 (zero), like the initial bearer of a disease before its outbreak (a patient zero, if you will).<br/><br/>In the year 2044 the world has no doubt changed in terms of financial powerhouses that have risen and fallen, ushering what most would have once considered only fictional Blade Runner scenario of a very Chinese influenced America. YUAN!<br/><br/>In this age most all people are impoverished, living a vagrant life that is cheap, pointless and easily spent. The currency of the realm in this time seem to be black bills like the Chinese Yuan, which annalists in reality have been saying for decades will one day take over our own monetary system. Its likely that other catastrophes have happened, but crime simply runs rampant next to the crippling poverty rates.<br/><br/>So 30 more odd years down the line time travel is created, but supposedly outlawed, allowing JUST powerful mob organizations to utilize its efficacy (lol). The mobsters send an unusual man named Abe back into time to begin monitoring and hiring thugs in the 2040's. These loopers assassinate undesirables sent back by the future mob in the 2070's. Abe may even be the older version of the revolver totting young dummy whom shot his own foot off. Abe eventually spares and hires (and maybe recognizes from his past in 2030's) a young child named Joe. <br/><br/>This is the beginning of time line Alpha 1. <br/><br/>Through some unforeseen events a boys mother is killed, possibly by one of the loopers. This boy, whom happens to be the most powerful telekinetic amongst the sparse few in the world, grows up bitter vowing to kill all vagrants, murders, and especially loopers. Thus the boy in the 2070's, all grown up, uses his powers to take over the time traveling syndicate as the eponymous Rain Maker for his knack for exploding people with his telepathy. He makes it literally RAIN...BLOOD. In essence it is this angry boy turned homicidal maniac with TK (telekinesis) that began having loopers in the past receive their severance pay by offing themselves. Its possible that with his magnificent mental prowess and abilities, he can affect a change or even undo the harm that he himself had initiated as the Rainmaker. <br/><br/>So the main lead, Joe, in his old age is abducted, many years down the line in China and sent back in time to be killed by his younger self, which happens , leading to an endless paradox that is unbreakable, except maybe by the future TK user, Rainmaker. LOL<br/><br/>Like in the Terminator franchise, the true meaning of the use of time travel might be far more altruistic if its to undue further harm with just a little mayhem. Like breaking a few eggs to make an omelet that might otherwise save generations of chickens. *ahem*<br/><br/>But in the course of all this happening, something ( which the movie fails to state, maybe the protagonists friend also failing to kill his future self, but that would be too easy and still not make sense) occurs that changes the mind of the young looper, Joe, (Joseph Gordon Levitt. Really?). Maybe all the mind altering drugs and the effects of something that caused Tk in the first place began to help change the time lines. Joe, recognizing himself much much older, delays pulling the trigger of his blunderbuss, which leads to a new string of events. OR DOES IT? <br/><br/>For arguments sake, lets call this TImeline Alpha 2.<br/><br/>Through it all the Old and tired Joe searches desperately for the past whereabouts of Rainmaker in his younger, more vulnerable form, eventually shooting the boys mother, and leading to the very events that created the first looper age, TImeline ALpha 1, that I previously mentioned.<br/><br/>By the end of some bland gun play and drug usage, and vaguely rabbinical neo mobsters, the younger version of Joe chooses to shoot himself, erasing his older counterpart and finally breaking the endless chain of events. MAYBE.<br/><br/>The young boy whom was targeted now has no reason to become the future Rainmaker. So he goes off to grow up with his momma and a PHAT payload of raw bullion, after the mother strokes the hair of younger , dead Joe, whom might also have planted a bun in her oven. NOICE!<br/><br/>Will the boy mature into a benevolent, maybe even god like champion of mankind? Or will things in some other way, not be as right...as rain? <br/><br/>Here begins Timeline Beta 1. <br/><br/>The film ends with a new unforeseeable future rolling out as do the credits."

","SPOILER ALERT!!!! I gave it an 8 out of 10, but was split between a that and a 7. It was a good film with some original ideas. I felt that the acting was a little weak by all. A little uniqueness could have made a big difference. The little kid had the most unique look out of all of them. That look in his eyes before all hell broke loose was convincing, and I hope to see him in some future films. Bruce Willis' character could of easily been replaced with any other actor. I didn't think he brought anything unique to the film. Only thing he had going for him is that the eyes looked like a little convincingly like Joseph Gordon- Levitt's. Even to see that, I think you needed to look a little hard. Maybe squint a little. Overall, I liked what they did with the little kid, even though his powers seemed like it was stolen from X-Men, with the all powerful TK girl. I hope to see him again in the future.<br/><br/>Overall, it definitely wasn't a disappointment. Well worth a watch. Some good surprises, but it definitely isn't the movie of the year..."

","No, this is not a bad movie. There is a lot to appreciate from it and it is one of the better action movies of the year.

This is definitely a movie that would make you think, but unfortunately that is my biggest problem with this movie.<br/><br/>Let's just say, if you are planning on seeing this movie with the intention to find flaws, then good for you because you are going to find A LOT of them. These are mostly found in its confusing and inconsistent time-travel plot. Personally I don't think you can make a perfect time-travel movie, but you can at least make a decent one. When a time-travel film leaves the results of the events unanswered it is mostly presented to be left up to assumption, but when the film does give the results and it doesn't make sense, you're going to have a lot of questions. And by that I mean: Why would they go through the trouble of having loopers? How did Old Joe even defeat his captors when it clearly shows he wasn't able to do so in his own time line? And finally (SPOILER!!!) If Cid's mother Sara didn't die, thus not leading up to the events of the future (as well as Joe being shot in the process), shouldn't the entire plot not even exist?<br/><br/>Despite its flaws, it's still a lot of fun to watch, but if you're the type of person that isn't able to enjoy a movie because of the plot holes, then you should probably just skip this one."

One can kill somebody who is in the present either in past or in future! If happens otherwise, then that should roll back everything related with that somebody.

","On my way home I was thinking about what was wrong with this movie and why I didn't like it. It wanted to be too many things at once, and didn't deliver any of those. If you expect good action , you won't find it here. If you expect a good story, you won't find it either. If you expect drama , there is a little . Special effects, some really good , some really bad. The first 30-40 minutes are the best , the time travel is not a plausible reality but it is cool to imagine and with suspension of disbelief i was really into it and it was quite original too. Then it started falling apart. It turned into a drama of some kind that seemed to be the slo-motion version of what just preceded it. And it made you wonder, 'where are they going with this?'. Then three quarters into the movie everything is revealed to the audience with the most absurd and un-original idea that they could possibly come out with. Let's just say that if a wizard had come into the middle of this movie and had started doing some magic tricks it would have made as much sense as the actual story plot of looper. (As a side note the special effect in this revealing scene is very good and I think it makes people forget how bad the whole movie has just become.)<br/><br/>Think about Minority Report. Not among my favorites movies because of the implausible premise but it's a good solid sci-fi and it's everything that Looper isn't. It has action, drama, great special effects, plot twists, all mixed together seamlessly with class and style in a story plot that keeps you entertained and involved until the end, without never losing its tracks. <br/><br/>Too bad because looper could have been great."

"EmmaDinkins","9","9","25","28 September 2012"," Chix Chat on Film Review: A very creative loop.
","Looper as seen in the trailer has to do with hit men thirty-two years from now in a future that includes time travel. The thing with time travel that continuously tends to be the case is the probability of a paradox. It always comes down to which came first the chicken or the egg, but this film does a masterful job of taking the audience through a finely crafted tale that is creative, captivating and in some instances just plain sad. Young Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) provides the narrative behind the story so that the audience understands what a looper is and some of the terminology that accompanies the vocation. I say vocation loosely, since it seems that there aren't very many jobs to be had in this future other than crime figure if you're a man, vagrant and working girl. With the narrative we learn that there is the possibility for a closed loop, a running loop, and that the business of being a looper really has very few if any redeeming factors. Old Joe (Bruce Willis) makes the latter aspect of being a looper painfully clear. For a fleeting moment 12 Monkeys came to mind, but the two films have time travel and Bruce Willis in common and nothing else, not that I would mind seeing a crazy eyed Brad Pitt, I digress. Emily Blunt (Sara) does a great job of playing a country girl, she seems to have a knack for taking parts in creative stories. The Adjustment Bureau is one of my favorite movies, for the single fact that it is creative and the story was new. This film was not at all what I expected. It is so refreshing when the trailer doesn't give away all the goods. I had an expectation and I am glad to say that the direction that this film took was nowhere near what I had thought, in fact the trailer was a bit misleading which was an added plus. To say that I was impressed by the writing is to say the very least. I was floored by the writing, the special effects, the shocking manner in which Seth (Paul Dano) was dealt with, and the nose bridge that made J G-L look like BW. There was a time that I was asking myself where is this film going and as each scene unfolded I became more and more engaged. This film was very well done, green light."

I thought the idea was compelling (sending people back in time to be executed) but then it got confusing to the point where it was laughable. Lots of people running around shooting stupidly designed weapons. A child is shown getting shot, which was bothersome. The tender moments of this film are about as meaningful as a fabric softener commercial. Even the cars of the future are pathetic in this film. Maybe the director used up the budget on actors and couldn't hire anyone proficient for anything else.

Their was so much hype over this and I am kicking myself for falling for it. Their were more holes in script than a piece of swiss cheese. The camera work was lazy. The editing ignored a lot of basic film making rules. <br/><br/>But the worst bit was the how unoriginal it all was, I could count at least 15 films the director copied bits from. Sometimes it was underlying pastiches in the script and other times it was right in your face such as the landscape shots directly taken from the opening to the new Star Trek film. <br/><br/>This film could have been great with the cast it had, but for me it was huge cinematic flop."

","""This time travel crap just fries your brain like an egg."" (Abe)<br/><br/>Not since Children of Men (2006) and Source Code (2011) have I been as jazzed up as I am now about Rian Johnson's Looper. Here's sci-fi that will happily fry your brain as you figure out the implications of changing the future by altering the present. Also throw in thoughts about Christopher Nolan's Memento and Inception to get the flavor of Looper.<br/><br/>But as Sinatra sings, ""Regrets I've had a few, but then too few to really mention,"" this film challenges you to think of the implications of reversing those regrets or keeping the future the same because you kind of like the way things went.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon Levitt's Joe is a ""looper,"" an assassin who goes into the past to murder someone needed to be absent in the future, 2072. The Mob, headed by a very relaxed and dangerous Jeff Daniels as Abe, determines to eliminate all loopers, and Joe is next on the list to kill himself by flashing back. Yes, it's existentially a difficult task, and therein lies the drama of this satisfying sci-fi.<br/><br/>With less CGI and few glitzy machines (in fact most of the vehicles look shabby 2012 and the loopers' weapon is a sawed-off Steampunk shot gun—how's that for past and future?), this thriller relies to an effective degree on the excellent cast to relay the challenges inherent in altering any past.<br/><br/>Because it's an intelligent tale, the overall theme of responsibility for our actions (the existential part) flows quietly from the action, be it as simple as running from the bad guys to the complexity of deciding on the sacrifices willing to be made to alter the future.<br/><br/>A leitmotiv of this film is that no one is immune from the effects of the past, Sinatra notwithstanding in his apparent satisfaction with how things turned out. For Looper, cult status is its future."

","The movie was just nonsense. It contradicted itself from scene to scene and was not very cleverly constructed at all.<br/><br/>But the worst thing about this movie for me is that I did not get the make-up on Gordon-Levitt. I, as we all are, am capable of coming to grips with the fact he is playing a young Willis, without attempting to make him look like him. I did not get to the point in Superman where Clark shows up in Metropolis and said ""No way, that's not Superman. I saw him in an earlier scene, he's a different man. That can't be him."" No, my brain had enough about it to cope with different actors playing different aged versions of the character. So the make-up is odd, and I actually found it took up more of my thoughts than the action/story itself.<br/><br/>The movie lacks anything that sets it apart. That makes it special. That makes it interesting. Generic attempt at an action movie, with ill-thought out Sci-Fi elements added as a plot driver, and poorly in my opinion."

","Wow, SLOW DOWN HERE, PEOPLE! 8.1? you guys REALLY think this is worthy of that high of a rating? Don't get me wrong. It's not a terrible movie and it certainly is better than most of the crap littering cinemas nowadays but there's no way this could be rated 8.1, with a straight face either. <br/><br/>Now I enjoyed the movie. I won't lie. It was fun to watch and it has an interesting premise. However, that doesn't stop it from being crap. As fun as it is to watch, it's very poorly written. Having done a bit of research on the director, Johnson made a previous film, Brick, which has a cult status. I can ultimately see this movie having the same fate, and it's very ambitious. And in a way, it deserves a cult status. That doesn't stop the film from being insanely flawed though.<br/><br/>WARNING: TONS OF RANTING<br/><br/>1. If the future is THAT poor, how are they suddenly rich again in the further future? Their currency is silver bars, do they just suddenly make counterfeit bars or do they hire some company to make silver? This isn't really thought out well and just seems like an excuse to find some way of explaining how the characters get paid<br/><br/>2. Do they need to use just the blunderbusses? Can't they use their own weapons? The bodies are disposed of immediately in some inferno anyways. And if the shells are left behind, well, there's ways of using untraceable bullets. Blunderbusses aren't that conspicuous of weapons anyways, there seems to be no reason for it at all.<br/><br/>3. Huge plot hole- Time travel isn't legal, neither is the job of looping. At one point in the film, the protagonist goes so far as to explain in detail why it isn't legal too. But then, when he can't kill his own character, the cops are suddenly looking for him too because he couldn't close his own loop.<br/><br/>4. At one point in the film, we get some ridiculous plot about the ""Rainmaker"", which goes nowhere and exists only so that Bruce Willis can  kill some little kid.<br/><br/>5. Why oh WHY did they have to turn the movie into a ripoff of X-Men at the end? With how the kid can eviscerate people with his mind alone... They never give an explanation except for some silly story about the kid accidentally killing his grandma. <br/><br/>6. That really stupid cliché of ""I'm all bitter because they took the love of my life!"" people actually laughed out loud at the cinema because of that that subplot. In fact, how they managed to have Bruce Willis say that with a straight face is mind-blowing.<br/><br/>7. The kid is strong enough to control 3 people at the end? But they say somewhere in the movie that HIS POWER HASN'T FULLY DEVELOPED YET!!!!!! <br/><br/>8. That whole ending with how he shoots himself to prevent the future self from wreaking havoc, total copout. Couldn't he have just shot his future self so he could have lived with the pretty girl and gone to France? I do like downer endings but it seemed like here they were building up all this tension between the two then suddenly got lazy and killed him off for no good reason.<br/><br/>Okay, so the film realistically would be a 7/10 from me. However, I'm giving it a 4/10 because people seem to be hopelessly jumping on the 10/10 bandwagon, and they seem to be oblivious to the poor writing. I'd recommend it, but by god, this site really needs to help keep things in perspective."
"dierregi","3","5","12","5 November 2012"," Several levels of implausibility and not a single likable character
","Loopers are professional killers who in the year 2044 eliminate assorted people – presumably other criminals - sent from the future. Because the future is a place where they invented time travel, but made it illegal. Also, the future is a place where it is almost impossible to dispose of a body – although when we see it done, it does not seem such a big deal Anyway, given this bizarre premises we are also explained that loopers are so called because after an indeterminate number of years in the profession, they must close the loop by killing their older self, shipped back from 30 years in the future.<br/><br/>At this stage, whatever effort one made to suspend disbelief comes crashing down. Since they already know that in 30 years they will be executed (by themselves), why these loopers do not try to eliminate the mob king who is systematically ordering their executions? Why do they accept passively to be shipped back to the past with a sack over their head? If this is a serious logical flaw (and there are many others, pointed out by several reviewers), worse is to come, in the shape of a TK obnoxious child, who derails completely the script into an additional dimension of implausibility.<br/><br/>So far we were dealing with ruthless criminals who have no problem shooting, torturing and burning bodies, but suddenly women and children are off-limits. This ""honour among thieves"" is a well-beloved cliché in mainstream movies, but it is an absurd illusion. In real life, cold-blooded killers kill anybody - women and children included - because they are unsympathetic to all human beings, not just to other adult males. Selective lack of empathy is absurd – and so is this movie. Finally, we have the delusional notion that ""love can cure anything"". Unfortunately, there are no reported cases of paranoid-schizophrenic cured by mummy's love....<br/><br/>One cannot expect much logic in a movie about time travel, but even low expectations are too high for this mess. The only partial saving grace is Joseph Gordon-Levitt who plays convincingly a despicable character."
"Snowgoat","2","5","12","11 October 2012"," Attempt at cerebral sci-fi let down by endless plot holes and a feather-headed lack of logic
","First the good Looper is clearly aiming high, and Rian Johnson handles things with an admirably straight-faced and serious tone that, for the most part, assures you he's more interested in creating a lasting work of art than mere box-office fluff. The film takes a few risks (such as offering a sympathetic child-killing antagonist/protagonist), and the actors take the whole thing seriously – with some decent performances from Joseph Gordon-Levitt and particularly Jeff Daniels.<br/><br/>The problem is (and it's a big one!) the film is so riddled with plot holes and logical inconsistencies that suspension of disbelief becomes far too much to ask. The problems here are so numerous that they fall into two main categories: Firstly, the gaping plot holes in the premise of the Loopers, their function, and the relationship between the mobsters of 2044 (the film's ""present day"") and the crime syndicates of the future. Second, and more importantly, the model of time travel presented in Looper is entirely nonsensical – even by its own parameters. <br/><br/>Obviously time travel stories will always through up interesting paradoxes and questions – which is precisely why they are so popular. However, for a time travel story (or any story with a fantastical element) to work effectively, the writer has to establish a logically framework from which the story can be told. Any sci-fi fan will tell you there are effectively two major approaches to handling time travel in fiction. The first assumes that time travel operates on a causal loop, single continuum system (what happened always happened) – films that successfully utilise this approach include the excellent 12 Monkeys and vastly underrated Timecrimes. The other approach is that time travel to the past creates new and independent time lines, or alternate realities. Both approaches offer their own interesting questions and situations, but when you come across films that mix the two (which most do!) it smacks of lazy writing and a lack of logical understanding. Looper fails to establish or abide by any set of rules, offering a model of time travel that seemingly changes to suit whatever the story requires at a given point. I'm the kind of viewer who can accept any situation in a setup, no matter how wild, but when a story fails to follow its own rules the whole thing collapses for me – and this was my problem with Looper.<br/><br/>Films with shaky time-travel mechanics can still succeed, so long as time-travel isn't actually the real focus of the story (Terminator, Back to the Future), but Looper is firmly focused on being a time-travel story, and so it ultimately lets itself down.<br/><br/>Aside from the logic and plot points, there are other aspects of Looper which I was disappointed by. The vision of the future presented seems inconsistent – and in some cases poorly realised. Clearly some effort has gone into the detail of certain aspects of the future presented (the idiosyncratic weapons, drugs, hover bikes), but since the rest of what is on show is attempted in a fairly half-baked manner (like a straight- to-DVD version of Children of Men) these things tend to draw unnecessary attention to themselves, and stand out as fairly impractical additions. The film also relied on exposition voice over for large parts of the setup – which is a classic sign of lazy writing, and I always thought was practically outlawed by movie critics (who bizarrely all seem to love this film)!<br/><br/>On a positive note, I thought JGL's Bruce Willisisms were great – but what the hell was up with those eyebrows they gave him?! It's not like Bruce is famed for his obviously died black eyebrows! The critics have been hailing Looper as ""intelligent"" sci-fi, which I think is fairly ironic. If you want to see a really smart time-travel picture watch Sourcecode, 12 Monkeys or Timecrimes."
"atishnramdonee","2","4","9","14 July 2019"," Not worth the hype. Just another messy jumble of already seen motifs.
","This movie is about time travel, happening in two dystopian societies (one further in the future), where the main character who's actually played by two actors, are the same person but from different times in time.<br/><br/>So there is nothing really novel about the theme: we have seen time travel or time dilation in different movies recently, but this one does not even reach the ankle of the brilliant 'Predestination'.<br/><br/>In this sense, despite the recurrence of Time Travel as a motif in movies, the scaffolding of any movie REMAINS the plot, which feels REALLY weak in this movie.<br/><br/>There is a certain lassitude with the way the movie moves forward, and the important elements do not really cohere well. Especially with a climax which feels alien to at least three-quarter of the movie.<br/><br/>I was obviously not impressed by this movie, but I might have been expecting too much out of it, especially from its good IMDB rating, which is ironic to heavy, listless deroulement of this movie.<br/><br/>You will know what is going to happen in this movie, and this is how so predictable it is. In addition, there are gaping holes everywhere: Why even bother adding Beatrix; why even go to China; why even classify the rainmaker as undefinable when he IS not; why is the mob stupid at one time, and then super powerful, and then super weak - not just plot blunders, but enerving sinkholes.<br/><br/>Similarly, the acting was meh. Bruce Willis played himself in Die Hard. Levitt aided with some cosmetics looked funny, and both did not feel one with their characters.<br/><br/>Did the Director force Levitt to look like someone from Viper Planet. It felt as awkward as seeing Kidman playing Virginia Woolf. It's not about the appearance, it's about how much you can enter the skin of a character. Meryl Streep in 'Mamma Mia' and 'The Devil Wears Prada', are examples of how much metamorphosis actually relies on acting abilities.<br/><br/>Talking of change: it did not feel like there was a huge change in between how the world was in the movie's Present Time, in contrast to the Future. I mean, what is the difference in between how we lived in 1980s compared to how we do in 2010s - this is your answer.<br/><br/>I will cut short, but the only good thing I found in this movie was the score, especially, 'Powerful Love' by Chuck and Mac - A GEM!"
"secondtake","7","4","9","15 February 2014"," Fabulous and fantastic and flawed deep down, but enjoyable!
","Looper (2012)<br/><br/>A futurist romp with time travel, double and triple identities, and hot rod punk culture where everything is more like a beat up 1980 than a real 2044. The whole scene, though, and the plot, is fun, dramatic, compelling.<br/><br/>And confusing, for sure. I think it does mostly makes rational sense (there are some things that will never make sense with time travel, so don't think too hard) and it will help a viewer to know that the whole movie is set in 2044 (as far as I could tell—not including brief flashbacks for backstory).<br/><br/>You'll wonder about whether Bruce Willis really looks like an older Joseph Gordon-Levitt (even with a prosthetic nose). This matters quite a bit—in fact the movie needs a level of credibility all around. The weakest point, I suppose, thinking back on how it feels a day later, is that it was all fun and wild and dramatic and if you left it out there just for the thrill and the mind-bending, you'd be happy. But the rules of reality and time travel were really so loose, almost gratuitous, you had to take each huge twist as just the liberty of the director/writer Rian Johnson. <br/><br/>And this left me a little disengaged. I mean, I was fully watching trying to keep up with it, so there was that kind of engagement. But in terms of the characters and their real dilemmas of how to stay alive (or not), I was forced to just go with the flow. The story was ""told"" to me.<br/><br/>It's worth saying that there are echoes of Terminator here—the idea of going back in time to change the future, and even the idea of finding a future leader as a child. This movie is less futuristic—more on that in a sec—and more romanticized. Where Terminator pushed the idea of the robot to an unlikely level that we could at least envision, this movie tips into telekinesis at key moments, and it's a huge stretch—pure fantasy fiction. Not my personal thing.<br/><br/>As for the way the future is depicted? ""Looper"" might not seem low budget with such an ambitious plot and famous cast. But it cut every corner possible to make us work very hard to believe this hyper future was really just sustained by a bunch of old American cars and trucks with tubes attached to their fuel tanks. That's the best they could do? Terminator went into a very high tech militarized future, which was fair enough, but what about ""Minority Report"" or ""Blade Runner"" or ""Brazil"" as a whole range of options that actually felt like the future?<br/><br/>Maybe these things don't matter as much to you. And maybe you don't mind a plot with lots of logical holes. Either way, go for this one. It's actually ""great"" on many levels. I really liked it!"
"nico-153","1","4","9","8 September 2013"," Easily one of the worst films I've ever seen.
","I was looking forward to this film. It looked like an interesting story. A cast with Bruce Willis, Jeff Daniels and some other good actors. A high rating here on IMDb. Very, very soon I lost interest. And because I kept watching I became irritated. Very irritated.<br/><br/>What can I say? Stories about time travel always have paradoxes. But it seems that whoever wrote Looper did not even try to work with these paradoxes; completely ignored them, maybe did not even realize the paradoxes in the story. Then on a lower level, the script is unbalanced. Jumps from one scene to the next, from one character to the next. Characters that are very shallow.<br/><br/>The director sometimes seemed to be a wannabe David Lynch. Some shots and scenes are typically in the Lynch style but when they work in a strange way in the Lynch films, they do not work for impersonators. Also in the direction and the cut there is a large amount of style over content. Typically for modern directors there is that awful ""shaky cam"", which luckily was not used in this film. But there was quite some dark filming where you can't see what is going on at all. Also a lot of unnecessary ""scenery"" shots. Fashionable but useless and irritating. Also for some weird reason there were many shots in the dark where a bit of light was changed by a filter or something into a blue line. Why? Form over content, a pretentious attempt to create ""art"" I assume.<br/><br/>Judging by the IMDb rating there are many people gullible enough to fall for this nonsense. Or are the ratings manipulated?"
"Tomas_T","7","4","9","8 June 2013"," Entertaining time travel scifi
","Director R.Johnson brings another good addition to the sci-fi scene with Looper. Rather coincidentally the film is released in almost yearly continuum with other solid sci-fi films such as Inception (2010) and Source Code (2011). It is good times for the sci-fi film fans.<br/><br/>I was somewhat concerned initially with Looper's cliché-ish time travel plot as most of these films tend to implode on their own absurdity. Adding to my negative expectation was the fact that the one of the main actors is no other than Bruce Willis whose last sci-fi undertaking Surrogates (2009) left much to desire.<br/><br/>Thankfully my negative preconceptions were quickly dissolved as Looper kicks up the gear right from the start and wastes no time with lengthy introductions. In no time the viewer is plunged into the dystopic future where criminals send their victims back in time to be executed and thus leaving no evidence behind. The story follows one of these futuristic executioners Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) whose execution routine is disrupted when his older himself (Bruce Willis) from the future appears in front of him to be executed.<br/><br/>The story can be a bit hard to grasp initially and requires some processing, but after the initial confusion dissipates the film becomes thought invoking and rewarding.<br/><br/>To me the director did a great job keeping the film together and quite easily approachable despite its complexity. It also helps that the film is well balanced between action, suspense and intriguing story elements to maintain interest factor high through the film.<br/><br/>As much as I liked Looper and its intelligent sci-fi scheme, it cannot be overlooked that the film has quite a profound change around half way into the film which might act as a deal breaker for some. Where the first part can be considered relatively easy going and light in mood despite the occasional violence, the second part is quite the opposite. The seriousness level is tuned up considerably in latter part with B.Willis struggling with his conscience about terminating children to save his wife and the appearance of a raging prophet child is also quite heavy to digest. Personally I appreciated the change of tone as it brought more depth to the film, but can understand that it is not everybody's cup of tea. <br/><br/>Lastly as the script is based on Time Travel there are bound to be lots of plot holes, but if one can tolerate/ignore them, Looper offers a very entertaining couple hours."

","When Im reading reviews of films on IMDb, I consider anything above 7.0 as ""Probably worth a watch"". Im giving this one a 6, since it's almost, but not quite, worth a watch.<br/><br/>Im gonna take a chance here and without marking it as a spoiler tell you that this film has some time-travel in it of some sort. You will see this about 3 minutes into the film, so I hope reading it here wont ruin the movie for anyone...<br/><br/>The concept of this film that so mane speak so highly about, is a kind of chasing the tail of fate, in time-travel-loops. it's a play with one of the many paradoxes encountered when playing with time-traveling. This movie handles the chosen paradox in much the same way ""Butterfly effect"" did. sure, they changed the character, the setting, the way of traveling back in time, but in the end, Looper handles the same paradox, the same ""cause-and-effect"" mindset, that is served to you by the Butterfly effect. I'll agree that this film does it somewhat better than Butterfly effect did, but people have been calling this original, new and revolutionary? not by a long shot! And, as is always the case when you play around with time-travel in a movie, there are a few contradictions, that at least to me, was quite annoying. I'll admit that given that this is a time-travel story, there are quite a few contradictions, and avoiding them would involve either making it way to complex for a popular market, or taking away that would-be heart-breaking end. the latter, in my opinion, would have served it well. The end of this flick is, and I mean it when I say it, very typical Hollywood, and not in any way hard to predict.(unless the whole time-travel paradox has you confused out of your mind the whole time, which tends to happen) at least the acting was decent. action is not half-bad either. not entirely mindless, but not particularly smart either."

","Here how I rate looper (from lowest 0 to highest 10)<br/><br/>From acting: 8<br/><br/>From writing and directing: 5<br/><br/>From story logic: 2 (I don't want to give 1 because it will be too low)
Total : (8+5+2)/3 = 5<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Joe and Old Joe are very well played. Both BW and JGL are very good actor. The dialog and the acting are believable. Two thumbs for them.<br/><br/>Writing and directing done by the same person. And it was a good directing and also good writing. The dialogs are strong, the acting is strong, but the character development is not very good. We watch no major development either in BW or JGL. And think about it, how can younger version seems to have different character with older version? Maybe 30 years of difference will change people character. Maybe.<br/><br/>The major fallback was in the story logic. The story line is okay but how to get there is confusing.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about story logic. In this story, nobody explains the logic of the time travel. If somebody send back to the past what will happen to his experience<br/><br/>Let me put this way<br/><br/>Every killing should be private right? The organization in the future send future body to be executed in the past. The executioner just shoots the body, kills him/her, then burn the body, claim the silver/gold along the way. Job done. Right?<br/><br/>Now let me ask you a question. How can people at the same time with the executioner can tell whether or not the executioner has kills his target? How can Abe (Jeff Daniels) knows when Seth (Paul Dano) unable to close his own loop? Close loop is a term define in this movie as an action done by crime bosses who eventually need to end a looper's contract, and also eliminate any traces of their working relationship, so they send his older version back to be killed by his younger self, referred to as ""closing the loop"", which each looper must do himself. They're paid in gold for this, to live the rest of their lives in comfort.<br/><br/>The question still remain, how can Abe, that was sent back in time to manage the loopers, can quickly knows whether a looper has able to kills his target? It doesn't make sense. The movie never explains this at all
Let me put again another case which is also unexplained.
Let say person A is a looper that execute people, his timeline is T1, up to ""present day"" in the story. The older self, in the future experienced his timeline as T1+T1' (the original T1 is come from person A up to the ""present day"" in the story, then another T1' is come from person A from ""present day"" up to ""future day"" in the story). Let say, crime boss sends back the person A from ""future day"" to ""present day"" to be executed by his younger self.<br/><br/>The ""present day"" A only experience T1 in his life time, and in the other hand, the older A ""already"" experience T1 and also additional T1'.<br/><br/>If older A still have complete arm, and then suddenly A cut his arm in front of older A, logically it will not affect older A. Older A originally never experienced arm cut off, right? He is sent back through time with complete arm and just witness that his younger self cut his own arm. But the thing is, inside this story, once A doing something, it will immediately appear on older A. it doesn't make sense since older A is already there without experiencing what A is about to experience. If the writer wants to convince the audience that this is how the ""story world"" works, then the writer need to lay down foundation first.<br/><br/>The logic is never explained. Of course, it will be difficult to explain since time machine is a complex concept and story with such a complex concept must have strong fundamental theory in it. I mean the writer need to lay out the ""physics"" of the ""story world"" first so we can take anything even as absurd as human can fly. The writer need to lay out some fundamental first before the audience can be happy to accept it.<br/><br/>Since the logic was never explained that is why the writer can kills the ""present day"" A so that the ""future day"" A will be vanished in the thin air"

","*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS ""Looper"" is one of those movies that promises much because it seems to be based on interesting ideas , yet the ending result is terribly poor. Why this movie received positive reviews is beyond me The plot of this movie just isn't as good as it seemed on paper . If you think for a second it all falls apart . This story was written by someone who does not comprehend even the basics of time travel problems and paradoxes. There is a certain suspension of disbelief in any time travel movie. You can forgive one or two plot holes and odd paradoxes in films about time travel but there are just far too many here and they are all far too obvious. However, they DO establish certain rules about time travel during the film. When a movie breaks it's own set of rules it's just BAD WRITING.<br/><br/> The whole premise of a ""Looper"" was never satisfactorily explained. I don't buy that in the future it's impossible to get rid off a body in the future because of the tracking . Seriously , there ALWAYS was and will be way to deal with that problem , especially for the mob. * It's never explained HOW mob is able to time travel. Did they invented time vehicle or stole it ? * Mob has got a time travel machine and uses it ONLY to get rid off the bodies ?! Why not use it to take over the world ?! * Why does the mo needs the loopers ? Couldn't they simply send somebody back 10,000 years, or to the middle of the ocean ? * Why send ALIVE person through time ? Kill that somebody in the future , then send his dead body in the past. Done. No risk of failure. * Furthermore why not send a paper with somebody's name to the past and have an assassin to kill that person in the past ? * Why did they always get THE SAME looper to close THEIR OWN loop? The had at least few loopers to choose from* Why even have more than one looper ? * Why the mafia boss who owns the city lives in some underground basement ? * Why are the telekinetic powers of most people so weak, but the power of the Rainmaker so strong ? * Why is everyone using civil war era firearms prone to jamming, when there are plenty of high tech weapons around in both eras ? * Why won't the Rainmaker simply use telekinesis to kill the loopers ? * How come a guy who kills for a living suddenly has a cry baby heart and goes out to protect people ? * The ending doesn't make sense . Young Joe kills himself, which erases old Joe from the time line. So all the criminals he killed and the loopers are okay now? How is the kid STILL wounded ? Joe couldn't have lived to meet the woman in China and eventually travel back in time, which means he couldn't have ever caused his past self to meet the Rainmaker. The Rainmaker would have grown up and taken over the world in the same way he did before, and Bruce Willis's wife would still be dead.<br/><br/>This movie is insulting to the audience. At one point Bruce Willis screams ""It doesn't matter ! "" as if trying to make a pathetic excuse for all the plot holes and inconsistencies.<br/><br/>Putting aside that ""Looper"" is illogical movie and you have to turn off your brain to watch it , it's just a dull movie. The future world was incredibly poorly realised. The directing and editing were utterly terrible. Most of the time it looked like the director was trying to be stylish, instead of actually making a good film. The pacing is horribly disjointed. The film moves very slowly .""Looper"" has all the pretense of being an edge of the seat sci-fi thriller, but then proceeds to bore you to death, and continually tries to pull on heart strings without having earned the right. Neither old Joe or young Joe are particularly likable. You have no REAL reason to care about anybody . The movie lacks interesting dialogue and there is virtually no action. When it happens it's SO UNINSPIRED without a small bit of excitement.<br/><br/>""Looper"" borrows elements from many movies : ""2009 Lost memories"" , ""Terminator"" , ""12 monkeys"" , ""Matrix"" , ""The One"" and few others. I wouldn't mind it if the movie was able to make something interesting of them , but unfortunately this is not the case here.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't have anything interesting to offer in terms of visual style or music. The acting is OK . Joseph Gordon Levitt (""500 days of summer""), Bruce Willis (""Die hard"") , Emily Blunt (""Adjustment bureau"") and Jeff Daniels (""Speed"") aren't bad , but their acting is simply bland and forgettable like the movie itself. The problem is also that all the characters are barely written and impossible to care about. The change of heart by young Joe is simply unconvincing.<br/><br/>""Looper"" is stupid and dull movie. Avoid it. One of the biggest disappointments of 2012. I give it 1/10."

","The many reviews praising Looper as ""intelligent"" misled me to expect one of those very rare things in Hollywood: a consistent, coherent time-travel film. But in fact this movie makes little more sense than Back to the Future. While I can forgive time-travel nonsense in frivolous films like Back to the Future, it is excusable in a film like Looper with pretensions of seriousness. The basic premise, about looping and ""closing your loop"", is quite clever and got my hopes up. But the plot soon descends into stupidity -- the explanation of memories given by Bruce Willis's character is especially dumb.<br/><br/>Film-makers should be forced to read some philosophy of time travel (e.g. the excellent work of David Lewis), and to demonstrate they have understood it, before they are let near a time travel story.<br/><br/>For a consistent time travel film (starring Bruce Willis), I recommend 12 Monkeys -- so much better than this loopy rubbish."

While there are killers, enforcers, workers, drivers, and all sorts of people on the streets, they are all male (and mostly white); women can be either a) exotic dancers/hookers with no hearts of gold or b) drug-addicted mommies. Otherwise, it's a world of, by, and for men.<br/><br/>One man is a professional killer who kills people (who have done we know not what and may or may not deserve death) from the future who are sent back in a one-way time machine, controlled only by organized crime and used only for that one purpose. (Which is like having a laptop and using it only as a paperweight, but whatever. It's your laptop; do with it what you will.) Eventually, and for reasons not explained, the criminal organization decides to retire the hit men by sending their old versions back and having the hit men kill their old selves, and then they can retire, knowing they'll be dead in 30 years at their own hand.<br/><br/>Quickly, questions popped up:<br/><br/>1) Why retire your good, trained workers at their prime? 2) Why not kill them immediately? Or when they start getting sloppy? Why let a disgruntled downsizing victim run around for 30 years, angry at you? 3) Why have them kill themselves--won't any killer do? Doesn't killing yourself just up the revenge factor? Have them killed, and send a note- -doesn't that make more sense? <br/><br/>and so on. The plot makes no sense at all, really, but I turned off my brain and went along for the ride, which was pleasant and diverting enough, paced well, with action interspersed with character moments. <br/><br/>Eventually the hero encounters the mother of a little boy who is destined to become another crime kingpin and he has Magical Powers, which he is forced to use to defend himself because his mother is stupid as dirt and, in a dangerous world where attack by killer hobos is possible at any time, she loads her shotgun with rock salt rather than shot. So the kid has to be violent to compensate for her idiocy. (Some mother!) But we're supposed to like her, and she's the madonna to counterbalance other females who function only as whores, blahblahblah.<br/><br/>I was never bored, though my BS meter was steadily going off in the back of my mind with ""hey but what about..."": logical problems with the set- up and plot. At the end, I find I liked none of these characters, not even the little kid (actually, most particularly the little kid), nor the inept mother with the rock salt in her gun, nor the old looper whose mission is logically impossible if you think about it for two minutes nor the young looper who isn't at all admirable either, after selling out his only friend for cash. So the big dramatic ending had no emotional effect on me. Either these two would die or those two, or maybe all of them, and since I cared for none of them, any ending would have sufficed for me. The traditional redeeming sacrifice left me stone cold.<br/><br/>The scene with the disappearing body parts was cool in a kind of sick way. And I was entertained for awhile.

Secondly, why send them back alive, why not shoot them first then send them back in time? Also, when they send the looper back in time to be killed, why on earth would you send them back to be killed by themselves in the past? That is just asking for trouble - send them back to be killed by someone else.<br/><br/>And when the young version of the main character carves a message for his future self in his arm, his future self only sees it at that exact moment - surely he would have had it carved in his arm for 30 years.<br/><br/>When he shoots himself at the end, his future self vanishes.

It also indisputably is the year of Joseph Gordon - Levitt. With 3 great movies this year and with good performances in every single one of them, Levitt's consistency can be considered ""one to look forward to"". <br/><br/>To answer the first question, I began to grow to like the movie with time. Director Rian Johnson treads smartly with his tactical approach in cinematography. The grainy filming of the future draws an ambiance to the entire movie that the future is dark, corrupted and a broken place where life as we know it, simply is more sephia-hue than colorful. One too many movies have been shot and digitally mastered as such that it did not feel original. However the concepts behind the screen play is quite original (please note I mentioned quite original and ""not"" original) that they dismiss each other off. <br/><br/>Now did I like it? Yes I did. The slightest indication of innovation needs recognition since it's the efforts of such that someday may bring forth another Spielberg or Scorsese. LOOPER isn't a Bruce Willis movie that one may anticipate. Bruce Willis is a great pick for the cast considering the monetary aspect. It is tough not to appreciate his work. Gordon-Levitt is the star but I found it hard to believe since the hardest work done on him is his facial prosthetics whilst the screenplay barely scratches the surface of the characters growth. He comes with a gun and goes with a gun and in between he is just an unhappy soul simply said. One character to look out is the child star Pierce Agnon. He does justice to his role. He is sweet and sinister that does not make it hard to believe the future of his own character. If there was no Pierce Agnon I am not sure I would have liked it at all. <br/><br/>So is LOOPER original? Maybe! Is it a great Sci-fi Movie? No it isn't (I would hardly pass it as sci-fi). It is watchable and it's good but not great. The concept of time travel has not been explored much in Hollywood and it may be considered an untapped source for entertainment. However the originality takes a spear to heart and drops hard since Rian Johnson take one too many shortcuts. Is it the lack of experience or the shallow script? It's a combination of both it seems. The director pays attention to all the touch points of a great movie. He sets the tone, he is good with filming, sound editing is decent, visuals are acceptable and realistic, and however each of the touch points is whiplashed upon and not driven deep enough. There is lack of premise for each concept. The entire concept of LOOPER is to travel back in time to stop the Rain Maker. The damage the rainmaker does isn't elaborated enough. He kills people smartly. So does every villain in every movie? So do you think it's original?<br/><br/>Loopers are hired assassins from the year 2044. Joe (Gordon-Levitt) is one of these assassins that stands in a field looking at his antique pocket time piece (in 2044) waiting for his employer to send his assignment through time from 2074 so he can shoot him. Apparently bodies are tagged in 2074 so they cannot be killed without drawing attention of the law. So they are sent back 30 years in time to be shot at and disposed off. These Loopers from time to time find themselves shooting their future selves (There you go a bit of Christopher Nolan for you right there!). Suddenly Joe (Gordon) finds his older self (Willis) at his own gun point and thus LOOPER unfolds.<br/><br/>I have just one last question. If you had the ability to send someone through time to be killed and if you need to pay an assassin to do it, why not save the money and send them back in time to when the dinosaurs ruled the earth? Too easy? #sigh#<br/><br/>TITLE: LOOPER DIRECTED BY: RIAN JOHNSON STARRING: BRUCE WILLIS, Joseph GORDON-LEVITT, PIERCE GAGNON AND EMILY BLUNT. RATED: R RATING: 05/10 RUNTIME: 119 MINUTES"
"paul_haakonsen","5","3","6","15 December 2012"," Great movie, except for one big flaw...
","I had high hopes and expectations for this movie, because everyone kept saying how nice it is, and given the fairly good rating it has gotten here on IMDb. So it with was a certain level of anticipation that I sat down to watch ""Looper"".<br/><br/>I will say that the storyline is indeed original and interesting. There are some really nice touches to the movie and the story does progress quite nicely. Well, at least right up until the super telekinetic child was introduced and you saw his powers. Then the movie just totally fell to the floor for me and took a turn for the worse. At this point I was ready to turn off the movie, because it became a joke onto itself. However, I did manage to sit through it to the very end.<br/><br/>What impressed me about ""Looper"" was the concept behind the plot and storyline. It was a really nice twist on time travel, and the story was actually really nicely executed. And also the performances of both Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt was quite good. And I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised to see Jeff Daniels in a role such as the one he had in ""Looper"", it was really out of his usual league, but he did a great job with his role.<br/><br/>Also the way that had altered Joseph Gordon-Levitt's face was impressive, though I didn't really see much resemblance between his face and the face of Bruce Willis. But still, it was a nice touch to the movie, and it did take a little while getting used to seeing Joseph Gordon-Levitt that way.<br/><br/>The reason for my mediocre rating of the movie is pure and simple; because of the telekinetic child. That totally blew the movie to pieces for me and left me laughing at what the movie turned into. The movie could have been so much more had director, Rian Johnson, not opted for that approach on the storyline.<br/><br/>""Looper"" is still worth watching though, because of the interesting storyline and because of the great performances to be seen in the movie."
"christophe92300","5","3","6","21 November 2012"," Mixed feelings
","Looper had a good potential story wise. The script seemed interesting, but ultimately the movie is disappointing, riddled with incoherences, the most shocking one being the end of the movie itself.<br/><br/>The first half is too speedy and kind of muddled, therefore pretty hard to follow and understand all the the whys and wherefores. On the other hand, the second part is weirdly slow and the film loses all its intensity, especially once Young Joe meets Sara.<br/><br/>The direction is below average, the lighting being pretty bad with a lot of halos and a few very dark scenes. JGL is barely recognizable with all the makeup and Rian Johnson certainly didn't need to be that drastic to make them look alike."
"fvault_dweller","5","5","13","13 October 2012"," Nothing special
","Looper is a soft SF based on time travel, set in the near future and featuring many of the premises and light-motives common to this genre. Which would not be bad in itself, if the script had more common sense and unpredictable twists. As it is, Looper does not stand out from any point of view, except the utter neglect of any logic regarding time travel (and lack of any argument which would justify such a treatment).<br/><br/>You can expect to see a lot of action, which looks pretty conventional (no laser guns here). You may also appreciate a few of the future-world shots, suggesting a polarized society and building on a few pure-American elements. However, most of the movie takes place at a constant pace, with no big surprises. Bruce Willis makes a not-so-vivid appearance, so don't count on him to light things up. In his defense, it can be said that the script did not offer him a truly leading role, to begin with.<br/><br/>All in all, a shallow SF with very few memorable features. Since I was a bit confused by the time setting, I'll specify the the film's ""present"" is in 2044, so the ""future"" is in 2074. A bit confusing, because the ""present"" is also 30 years away from our present. Could have gone 10 years more or less, to make it more straightforward."

","This movie is very well executed, it has a few side stories on the background of the main plot and I love the way they portray Bruce Willis as a fading shadow for the main character.<br/><br/>In just a few words, without spoiling the action, this movie focuses on alternative facts and makes the acting lean towards the emotional factor, even though this should be more of an action genre movie.<br/><br/>I even found one possible flaw regarding the way they describe time travel - you can't travel backwards in time if the device (that you traveled with) doesn't exist in that time, but somehow they managed to mask this flaw just by avoiding the whole subject. Also what I rely love about this movie was the reaction to the environmental CGI special effects. <br/><br/>I rarely give a movie 10 out of 10 but trust me, if you love twisted facts mixed with drama and a bit of action, this is the right kind of movie for you to watch."
"dvc5159","8","6","17","28 September 2012"," Time and Crime doesn't pay either way
","What would you do if one day you had a heart-to-heart talk with yourself, which is decades older than you? What if you were a hit-man and you were ordered to take out yourself? Such questions and much more are posed in Rian Johnson's ""Looper"", an excellent addition to the science- fiction genre. No wait, it isn't just science-fiction, it's also an action thriller and a crime drama (complete with noir-like narration) with a healthy dollop of romance. This movie knocked my socks off.<br/><br/>In the future, time-travel is illegal, and yet somehow some criminals managed to get their hands on the technology, and send targets back in time to be assassinated by hit men called Loopers. These Loopers, such as Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) live rich when the economic structure of the rest of society is crumbling around them. However, a thing called 'closing the loop' happens when the Loopers kill older versions of themselves sent back from the future - effectively eliminating all trace of the Loopers back to the organization which hired them. Trouble befalls Joe when he lets his guard down enough to let his older self (Bruce Willis) escape. How a young Kansas farm lady (Emily Blunt) and her son fit into this plot I will not reveal. One might be thinking ""A- ha! I know where this is going"" in many scenes, but Johnson is smarter than that. He has a trick up every sleeve, turning a potential cliché over its head. Such an intense ride. Such superb writing by Johnson who also directs the film with flair, and kinetics when duty calls him to. This being his first mainstream film, who knows what he'll come up with next.<br/><br/>Looper delivers. An ingenious, intelligent, daring screenplay which brings a fresh and thought-provoking twist to the time-travel genre while also inverting it. It has brutal violence in between the genuinely thrilling, adrenaline pumping action sequences - adding raw edge to the film. It is also a strong morality play - it blurs the line between hero-isms and villainous acts. The younger Joe, the hero of the film played by Gordon-Levitt in a smart-aleck performance, is a thug that kills people for money and luxury. The older version of the character as portrayed by Willis is a bruised, tortured, intense soul underneath all that toughness, a wounded, broken man who is determined to set things right his way - however morally skewered it is. Not forgetting a vulnerable and fragile performance by Blunt who provides a strong emotional and (non-cliché) romantic core to the younger Joe, and a mischievous, mysterious yet witty act from little Pierce Gagnon, who maintains the right balance of emotions for the role. Not forgetting Jeff Daniels as a businessman-like supervisor for the Loopers - charismatic at times, brutal at others.<br/><br/>Some very good cinematography by Steve Yedlin really shows nice, wide angles and refreshingly crisp action sequences in their glory - and also showcases the sleek production design, a futuristic Kansas metropolis not unlike the city of Blade Runner, only with more impoverished people. The special effects are good for what the budget is for the film but I strongly appreciate its subtlety for not choking on unnecessary CGI. It actually enhances the intensity of the film. Editing is crisp and paces the film nicely, without leaving too much or too little. Nathan Johnson's score is very good, actually, some old-school action orchestra work among the subtler parts can be heard here, with perfect timing, and it is a fine addition to the movie.<br/><br/>""Looper"" is extremely entertaining and yet one hell of a film. Very intense and thrilling, very exciting, very thought provoking, substantially emotional and stylish and ultimately just damn great. We might see a cult of fans hoarding this movie soon. Just when you think there's hardly any more original sci-fi flicks, out comes this wallop of a film - surprisingly one of 2012's very best.<br/><br/>Overall: 90%<br/><br/>Eat your heart out, ""Inception""."

"poj-man","3","3","7","22 October 2013"," More Clever Stupidity
","There are plenty of reviews on the IMDb website that document the ridiculousness of the time travel paradoxes as explored in Looper. This review will not dwell on those inconsistencies. Instead, there are a couple of scenes that really point out how cleverly stupid this film is.<br/><br/>At the end of Looper Bruce Willis has been captured. They know he is dangerous. So what do they do? Put a bag over his head. This works very conveniently to effect Bruce's escape...sort of. Bruce body slams people, whirls his arm backward and snatches a henchman's gun and shoots him dead with one shot. If Bruce had been bound he could not have escaped in this manner. That would have been smart for someone handling a dangerous criminal to do. It is very convenient as always that henchmen are completely stupid.<br/><br/>Now...how does he know exactly where to grab to wrest the gun free to shoot the henchman? Did he have X-Ray vision in the back of his head? Because I sure know that I could not have pulled that move off. Then again, I am not Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>So...immediately the requisite group of more henchman show up to kill Bruce. What does Bruce do? He grabs the exceptionally conveniently placed super machine guns that just happen to be laying in the room and he mercilessly mows everyone down because Bruce is the only person with the super machine guns with magazines that never empty.<br/><br/>After killing everyone Bruce goes to kill the 5 year old Rainmaker. And how...pray tell...does Bruce go about doing this? He has traveled from the future and fought through hell to get to this point slaughtering people along the way. He knows the Rainmaker has ""magic powers."" After all this bloody hell Bruce shows up with...what is essentially...a pea shooter! He just slaughtered 50 people with super machine guns (and also hand grenade bombs) and he is going to kill the magic powered one and he shows up with essentially a 6 chamber handgun (that, in Hollywood fashion, can shoot as many shots as possible).<br/><br/>It is so clever it is stupid. Bruce has done all this and he knows the kid is bad news so he shows up and starts shooting from 50 yards away. No attempt to ambush the little kid with magic powers! No attempt to get close to the target before shooting! Nope! This is just more really conveniently illogical writing and film making.<br/><br/>So...the Rainmaker kid starts his Exorcist possession routine of making everything float. Now...somehow...while his Mother and Bruce magically float in the air as well as blades of grass...the Rainmaker creates a dust storm to knock down the vehicle at the road running beside the field they are in. Yet...despite the appearance of the tornadic storm...there is NO DUST ANYWHERE! The dust magically disappears and the camera views of everyone and everything are clear as a bell. How bleeping convenient! <br/><br/>So...Bruce is shooting...and he is wearing a blood soaked shirt which shows the battle he has been through some mega miles away from the farm. Bruce is in such a hurry to kill the Rainmaker he not only traded all his high tech weaponry for a pea shooter...he didn't bother to get a change of shirt! I don't know about you but when I am wearing a shirt soaked in blood and I have a minimum one hour long drive ahead of me...I'll find a shirt somewhere! <br/><br/>So...Bruce grazes the cheek of the Rainmaker which causes the Exorcist effect. Now, the bullet went across the cheek and conveniently opens a cut. During the whole next scene...the cut never bleeds. Oh, Rainmaker has blood caked on and in the vision scene Rainmaker has hopped a railroad car and is nursing a bleeding cheek...but the kids cheek never bleeds at all. Just a minor continuity error.<br/><br/>The people who made Looper thought they were so clever constructing this silliness. This film is filled with these cleverness constructs from start to finish. Their cleverness is their downfall. They were so clever they couldn't see the stupidity they were making."
"PhilipVier","1","3","7","9 September 2013"," Surprisingly awful
","When I first heard of Looper it sounded very promising. It had Bruce Willis, the story seemed interesting, and the critics liked it. After watching it I can honestly say I have never been so disappointed with a film. I was expecting something good based on the cast and the IMDb ratings. But what I got was one of the worst films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>After watching this for a couple of minutes I became annoyed by three things. The first thing was that the directing and editing were utterly terrible. Most of the time it looked like the director was trying to be stylish, instead of actually making a good film. Then I was shocked to find out Paul Dano was in it. I've got nothing against Dano as a person, but I absolutely hate him as an actor. He has little to no acting ability and zero charisma. The third thing was that the story was chaotic and vague. But soon even more things started to annoy me.<br/><br/>As the film progressed it became much worse. It soon became clear that the acting varied from mediocre to over the top nonsense. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is extremely bland and does nothing to create a relatable character. Bruce Willis tries to make something out of it, but fails. They could have just hired a random bald man instead of him. Jeff Daniels is decent, but horribly miscast, I mean he's not a convincing mob boss. But last and most certainly least is Emily Blunt. Some people say she's a good actress, but in this film her acting is beyond terrible. Her first line, when she confronts Levitt in the field is like something you would hear in a Steven Seagal film. The only good thing about the acting was that Paul Dano had a small part and died quickly.<br/><br/>Another problem is that there are a ton of plot holes and inconsistencies. I mean the criminals in the future are able to kidnap a man from his home, kill his wife, burn the house down, supposedly get away with it, but they can't get rid of bodies. Also, why are the telekinetic powers of most people so weak, but the power of the Rainmaker so strong? It doesn't make sense. There are also some paradoxes with the time travel, but they didn't bother me so much.<br/><br/>After less than an hour, I was just waiting for this to end. It had nothing in it that I liked and nearly everything about it was terrible. The directing is some of the worst I have ever seen. And overall the film is just forgettable, which is probably a good thing. Near the end it was like watching a poor man's Terminator. I had never expected Bruce Willis to be in one of the worst films I have ever seen, but Looper is really terrible and deserves absolutely no credit."
"cleary-joshua","9","3","7","27 August 2013"," One of the most watchable and enjoyable blockbusters I've seen recently...
","The second time travel related movie in two days (see 'Primer'), and I have to be honest, I preferred this one a fair bit more. Yes, it's a lot longer and has a bigger budget, but these weren't the things that made me prefer it. They contributed, but honestly I thought the story was better and that it managed a similar amount of cleverness with much less confusion. It's really well crafted, and one of the most watchable and enjoyable blockbusters I've seen recently.<br/><br/>'Looper' tells the story of Joe, who works as a hit-man in the year 2044, killing off people who are sent back from 2074 in order to remove them cleanly from the future. The first 40 minutes of the film are mostly exposition, and we don't get to the main event (the arrival of Bruce Willis) for a while, but it's still really interesting as we learn how our world is different to theirs. We see lots of poverty, new drugs, the arrival of telekinesis, and it's clear that the film is trying to be both close a reality in some parts, and distant in others. There are no flying cars or anything as extreme as that. The arrival of Bruce Willis is done with an incredibly clever segment, where we see the process through which he first lives those 30 years between Young Joe and Old Joe. It's essentially a display of everything that separates the two characters, as it has happened for one, but is still to come for the other.<br/><br/>Questions are raised that we don't usually get in a time travel film. Does Old Joe know exactly what Young Joe is about to do, because things could change instantly? I really enjoyed the sending of messages from young versions to old through the skin, and thought it worked well as a grizzly method of communication. The rest of the film is very watchable, if slightly slower than the action packed first hour. If I have one problem with the film, it's that it's too long when Joe is staying with Sara, and their eventual night of romance feels very gratuitous.<br/><br/>The climax of the film is very exciting, and lots of great action scenes happen along the way. Bruce Willis does prove that he can still do what he used to do best, and delivers his best performance in years. It's really fun, very smart, and the decision that Joe makes in the final minutes makes for a very satisfying ending."

Surely it is confusing jumping from time to time like traveling from country to country and back.<br/><br/>So, nice cast, nice directing, funny surprise moments that little cheers up the movie, good plot and hard to direct Im sure. Something still was missing. Ending was little weird and it wasn't really following logic but it didn't matter much.<br/><br/>Little too long and character development was unstable, actually there really wasn't much.<br/><br/>Still great movie if you like the genre.

"Rob_Taylor","6","3","7","17 November 2012"," Well, it was full of nonsense, but I enjoyed it.
","I'll get on to the nonsense in a moment but first, why did I enjoy it? Mainly because it dealt with themes such as self-sacrifice, personal growth, betrayal, greed and desperation rather well. The main character is inherently unlikeable, but you hope he gets by in the end, nonetheless. In short, take away the scifi elements and it makes a reasonable character drama.<br/><br/>But it has its flaws.<br/><br/>First off it attempts to be a clever scifi movie in the vein of Inception. I applaud the effort. In fact, I wish more movie-makers would try and be clever with their films. I'm seriously tired of mindless pap like Transformers masquerading as 'good scifi'. So any attempt at being intelligent is to be congratulated.<br/><br/>However, they fell at the first hurdle. They chose time-travel. With time travel either you believe there is a single timeline, in which case paradox's cannot exist, or you believe in multiple time lines, in which they can. In the former, things done in the past affect the future and this is what appears to go on in Looper. People send messages to their future selves by scarring their own skin and so on. Unfortunately, Looper starts off assuming the second type. Young Joe, in order to let Old Joe escape, has to also kill Old Joe in the original timeline. This means that when he grows into Old Joe, he can come back, causing a new timeline and escape. However, this also means that, since he is on another timeline, that particular Young Joe isn't him anymore. And, at the end of the movie, it is pretty critical that they are actually one and the same. Phew! So they weren't really sure which they wanted to go with and it does make you say....hang on a minute! That said, the movie is reasonably entertaining. I enjoyed it, despite the lack of a sensible plot. I mean, who is really expected to believe that it's easier to send someone back through time than it is to dispose of them in the future? It's never given more than a moment's explanation and yet, it is the foundation for the whole movie's setup. Its very premise. They could have at least come up with a more solid reasoning behind this, in my opinion.<br/><br/>There was a nice side-plot about Old Joe forgetting his wife if Young Joe fell another woman. However, this seems to have been forgotten about towards the end, which is a shame.<br/><br/>All in all, it is a reasonable watch. As always with time-travel movies, though, it becomes messy and here, it wasn't treated terribly well. Even so, I recommend it. You'll see the end coming from about half-way through the film, but it is still surprisingly satisfying anyway.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Time-travel, bah humbug! Good characters and drama, try to ignore the premise and ill-thought out science."
"quickquirk","5","3","7","22 October 2012"," What the hell just happened....?
","I must remember to try to disengage myself from the hype surrounding well-reviewed movies.<br/><br/>I'd heard about the high reviews for Looper, which excited me - especially after a dry spell in the theatres. I regret to say I was disappointed.<br/><br/>Those who go on about how inventive, creative and innovative this movie is forget something. Similar (in fact, very similar) themes were explored in the wonderful Terminator movies, and a myriad other movies. This was simply presented differently - with the introduction of the term Looper to make the premise fresh and interesting. I do admit it's not a run-of-the-mill movie; but really - it's all been done before, to quote the Barenaked Ladies.<br/><br/>In trying to be surprising, slick and smart, the movie favours a fractured way of telling the story, which is simply disorienting, and frankly, quite self-indulgent. The constant VO (voiceover) doesn't help either. It's hard to get absorbed by the movie when one can almost feel Rian Johnson thinking: ""Ha! This'll confound them!"" - and then tossing in some bizarre bits. In other words, it's annoying; and not subtle.<br/><br/>Even the stellar performance of Bruce Willis, and a noteworthy one by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, failed to save this loopy mess. Armed with some vague notion of time travel, the loss of morals, of the struggle between desire and morality, and time conundrums, the film tries to appear more important than it really is - and worse, misleads the audience completely by failing to warn them what they were really in for. <br/><br/>This is because in actual fact, the influence of The Omen and The Sixth Sense (think creepy, mature kid with extraordinary abilities) far superseded that exerted by other time-travel movies. The kid part was simply dodgy and derivative, and came right out of nowhere to leave the audience with raised eyebrows and mental images of Children of the Corn and some M.Night Shyamalan thrown in (not a good thing). Blunt was serviceable, but even her earnest performance failed to help the film rise above its own self-induced mess.<br/><br/>In other words, best avoided."
"BharatSamra","6","3","7","21 October 2012"," Looper, or Blooper?
","What did I want from Looper? Rian Johnson's science fiction film throws you right into the loop, so why not do the same?<br/><br/>Picture a tennis match between Roger Federer and a P.E. teacher. That could be the finest method of description for this cycle of exchange in quality. We were served with a highly original premise that set us up for a thrilling two hours, only for the return to be anything but. The binary opposition in this picture that is foremost conspicuous, regards no thematic presence, yet is the conflict of quality and enjoyment you attain from it. Some moments in Looper are highly respectable; we are witnesses to great acting, a unique premise and sensationally explained narrative complexities. When dealing with time travel in film, the likelihood of having your audience disperse from the theatre with more questions to ask than they had before they arrived is not uncommon. Looper phenomenally clarifies the enquiries you may have gathered throughout the feature, though it fails in many other respects. <br/><br/>If maintaining its form as a time travel film was not intricate enough, the writer decides to evolve the concept of telekinesis within the already crowded plot. Though we are lead to believe this incorporation exists as no more than a device to show us of the 2044 time period, we eventually discover its fundamental contribution to the climax. This is disappointing. You begin to suspect the projectionist of switching reels with a different film, as you feel two separate stories are being told, and all you paid to see was Joseph Gordon-Levitt's interaction with Bruce Willis (his older self), which you get briefly, and is the prominence of pleasure one gains from the film. Another disappointing element to Looper would be its unnecessary inclusion of comedy and romance. I have no issue with these genres, though I must when their involvement in a narrative has about as much place as Looper will in my DVD collection. It will not be there! If one is to integrate these aspects into an abundant plot, at least do so with some class or dignity. The humour was so forced, you almost felt as if you had to laugh to prevent the screening from feeling awkward; the editor seemingly permits moments of silence for us to commence in robotic laughter, though I am confident in saying it failed to work. Meanwhile, Sara (Emily Blunt) engages in an inevitable yet needless instance of intimacy with Joe (Gordon-Levitt), which is not again revisited and you feel no desire for their peculiar relationship to progress, if initiate at all. While minor components of the two hours, these, along with the evolution of telekinetic powers cause a dynamic post-summer blockbuster, where dynamic is not a positive, and renovates Looper into our final product and perhaps more appropriate title: Blooper.<br/><br/>So, what did I want from Looper? The theatrical trailers and copious varied marketing insinuated a simple narrative, as simple as time travel can be. By this, I mean the underlying premise of our protagonist Joe and the complications that arise with his future self. While this occurred at times during the 118 minutes, the enjoyment levels were indeed elevated amongst the otherwise unsatisfactory sequences, that the studios' marketing departments did a capital job of concealing. Taken as a whole, Looper certainly does not fulfil the expectations, principally due its attempt to show and tell too much, like the kid whose plentiful discussion on their generic item overshadows the next child on the list with their time machine, whom gets cut short because of their disappointing predecessor."

","There are two aspects of Looper that cause it to be stifling: It tries too hard to be stylish and too hard to be deep. The production values are there, with the actors well cast - though, when it comes down to it Bruce Willis is cast as a character that is essentially himself in every single Die Hard, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is cast as (and takes on the attempts at acting like) a younger Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>Here is where an interesting facet comes into play: The most basic -simplified, if you will- premise is that one person meets themselves in the future. With the help of some keen makeup and prosthetic, Gordon-Levitt was able to be given the jaw, cheekbones, and forehead of Bruce Willis. In addition, speaking in a raspy and sort of brooding tone, the film is able to pull off a decent narration. However, it just tries too hard to be ""cool""; too hard to be ""noir."" The director, Rian Johnson, attempts to be the next Christopher Nolan by mimicking the deep provocations of Inception but fails due to the fact that the presentation is terrible. One moment he throws a concept at the audience and before one can really figure out any profundities or even specific relations to a plot, the scene following is an elementary action scene or something that is easy to conceive, partially due to similarities with action films hitherto. Perhaps with another viewing, aside from gawking at visuals, the viewer would be able to construe of something that is probably not there and, the undeniably corny plot ""twists"" thrown in make this film more than just a waste of money but also a waste of time. Inception was deep with the only real downside being that of the latter portion of it being drawn out - Looper tries with all of its might to be Inception, but can be evaluated from its ending which is, in the larger scope of cinema, a cop out."

Joe is one of the looper who discovers that mob wants to close the loop by sending back his own future. Directed by Rian Johnson ( Brick) , Looper is one of the difficult and challenging movie to make considering the complex story and genre of the film but hats off to Rian for directing it with aplomb. The movie begins with narration in the background by Joe (Joseph Gordon Lewitt) and runs at a snail-pace until the appearance of Bruce Willis(Old Joe). This point onwards , film gathers steam and gives an interesting plot with twists and turns. Interaction between Willis and Lewitt is the highlight of the film with both of them trying to kill each other. However , the film looses the steam and becomes bit tiring that you wish you could speed up the motion little bit. Thank god ... the climax has been wonderfully shot and gives you what-will-happen-next feeling. Screenplay is good not great .. editing should have been more crispy .. dialogues are punching .. art direction is OK where as Cinematography is eye- catching. Performances by Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon Levitt is brilliant. Levitt is getting better with each film.. I loved his make-up playing character of cool-lost-in-the-world Joe with honest and sincerity. Willis was awesome as usual. I wish he could have more screen space.

","Fast paced, incredibly entertaining, but at times contrived, Looper doesn't make the greatest execution of its interesting concept, but does enough to make it a more than enjoyable film. All the actors in the film both feel and look brilliantly casted, with Bruce Willis surprisingly taking the cake for the best of them. Joseph Gordon Levitt also provides a rather good performance as well as Emily Blunt. The film's script does at times seem to go all over the place, and though the film tonally feels the same, by the time you're over with the film, you can't help but wonder how you got there from where you started. The film is actually quite visually impressive for a futuristic sci-fi film, with its remarkably small budget, it makes use of it quite well. The film itself is very fascinating, knowing almost expertly how and when to slow down, and how to tell the messy story it knows it may be proceeding with. In the end, Looper has its fair share of flaws, but it provides for an interesting take on time travel that we haven't seen before- even if it doesn't execute them as much as you may hope. It's performances are great, and it is ferociously entertaining, and will certainly be a memorable experience to all who have a chance to watch it.

","Lamest movie I have had the dis-pleasure to see in awhile. First of all, I thought the plot might have some merit... But the delivery was horrible. The time machine was a piece of 1950's scrap metal from a broken-down foundry. It just made no sense. Why would someone go back in time and work for a henchman in the future? Couldn't you find the henchman's mother and kill her before she was born? Why would criminals be the only ones using the time machine. I blocked this horrible movie from my mind, so I don't remember much anymore. What a waste of time. It made no sense from a time paradox point of view. But I guess all USA made movies have to be stupid these days to compete with all the other stupid, insipid movies that are made in Hollywood. No one can come up with an original idea, so we get Godzilla part X, etc. And when they do it's some piece of garbage like this...

I am a Bruce Willis fan but he is old and a has been as an action hero. His ""Die Hard"" legacy is legendary but outdated. He no longer a shoot and ask later hero. In fact this can be confirmed by his recent ""Expendables 2"" roll where he admitted on screen that he was an ancient artifact.<br/><br/>Joe Levitt is overpaid and somewhat out of place in this movie. He gives a mediocre performance that could have easily been duplicated and improved by a more talented actor. In fact the only bright acting spot in this movie are the performances by Piper Perabo and her son Pierce Gagnon. Gagnon's performance and acting talent reminds me of a young Haley Osment who first became famous in the 1994 movie ""Forrest Gump"" The movie's story is encouraging but we soon find that it falls well short of it's potential. It seems that many key plot points are borrowed from the 1984 ""Terminator"" and 1993 ""Nowhere To Run"" movies. Some special effects and plot twists are introduced but they ultimately cannot save this production doomed from the beginning.<br/><br/>My advise is to steer clear of this movie. There are certainly better Bruce Willis movies to see. Joe Levitt has some talent and may one day become a powerful actor. But this is not his breakthrough movie to remember him for."

","I think I will be in the minority when I say that I really did not enjoy this film.<br/><br/>Set in the near future the plot centres around Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) a hired killer called a 'Looper'. 30 years further into the future time travel has been invented and the only use for it (due to it being quickly hidden away) is for the Mafia to send people back in time to be dispatched, because it is incredibly difficult to kill someone in the future due to 'tracking'. That's it, that's your explanation for the setup of the whole film.<br/><br/>This is all set out in the opening sequence of the movie and from then on the director's appreciation of science and any dealings with time travel or the associated paradoxes is laughable.<br/><br/>In the reviews I write I try to give my impression and avoid spoiling the viewing experience by explaining every detail of the film and I'm not going to set out why this film fails on so many points because a lot of people seem to like it. I really want to but this will turn into an essay and life is far too short.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is good throughout as the older Joe, he essential plays to his strengths, says little and kicks arse. Emily Blunt is a tenuous love interest and neither has much impact or credibility in her role, which as the film develops you learn is pivotal to events in the future. Gordon-Levitt is just about bearable, but his performance is not up to the standards of either The Dark Knight Rises or Inception.<br/><br/>One aspect of the film that intrigued me revolved around the make-up used to make Levitt look like Willis, it took me a while to realise that is was actually Levitt we were looking at.<br/><br/>I found this quite distracting as not only did Levitt look a bit odd, the likeness between him and Willis wasn't perfect (look at the ears!). This didn't help with transporting you into the story that, even with the ridiculous premise, could have entertained as an action flick.<br/><br/>This failed for me on several levels, the science, the plot, the strange retro styling that was trying to ape Blade Runner, the really silly ending that just disappoints and numerous other things that would just be spoilers. At just under 2 hours long this was an unpleasant and thoroughly lacklustre viewing experience, which came as quite a surprise due the hype surrounding the movie.<br/><br/>I didn't like it, but you probably will."

"bob the moo","Null","2","4","6 January 2013"," Has its moments but mostly it is ideas without cohesion, flow or spark
","Looper was compared (by some, but not many) to The Matrix and Inception in terms of it being a smart film supposedly based on ideas and, to a point I suppose it is. The plot sees hit men recruited in the near future to kill and dispose of people the mob want out of the way; the twist being that these hit men exist many years before the hits need doing and the mob are sending the victims back to be killed and disposed of because in their future getting rid of bodies is apparently very difficult. These hit men are very well paid but, at some point they will do a final contract – their futures selves – at which point they are well paid off and allowed to life out the rest of their lives until the point where they become that person who is sent back to be killed. When Joe is sent back to be killed by himself though, he has other plans, sparking a race to change the future and the present.<br/><br/>It sounds like it could have been a smart film but unfortunately the delivery from concept to filming is lacking. In terms of the ideas it is important not to think too hard about them or else the wheels will immediately fall off – even the idea that mob would have a time machine but not be using it for many other better ideas is one, but there are many others. The story unfolds with messy coincidence and a real lack of cohesion with many ideas and tones banging up against each other in a way that doesn't work – the film never seems to settle into a rhythm or flow and it is quite hard to watch as it is so uneven. I was surprised by how little spark there was to it as well – the filming style seems to be deliberately slow and moody, but the material doesn't support this approach, meaning that the unintended consequence is that the story seems lethargic and quite dull. It still has its moments but mostly it bored me.<br/><br/>The characters and actors don't help. I understand why they wanted Gordon-Levitt to look as much like Willis as possible, but, as impressive as the transformation is, it is endlessly distracting – and considering how much more disbelief I was being asked to suspend by the rest of the film, I don't think it would have been a massive stretch to accept him as he is. The transformation into Willis also hurts Gordon-Levitt's performance as it is so much impersonation that he loses the character; it is excellent in terms of impersonation of mannerisms, tone and the like but there is no character here. Willis doesn't present one either and is so-so. Blunt is more interesting and at least has more to do than Perabo, although the latter will be more memorable to some viewers.<br/><br/>Looper has some good ideas in here but they are presented without much cohesion, flow or spark. The tone of the film is all over the place and it never really got me engaged as it should have done and the manner of the ending suggests they had that as their first idea and sort of pieced it backwards from there. It is a very average film at best."
"dusksky","9","2","4","3 January 2013"," Takes an old idea and moves in an unexpected direction with it.
","Time travel. It has fascinated people for years. What if we were able to control the future through the past. Lots of movies, books, TV shows, etc. have been made about it. And here's the thing. <br/><br/>It doesn't exist.<br/><br/>And because it doesn't exist, we don't actually fully understand how it works. We all have our theories, but nobody could actually tell you the exact outcome of going back in time and killing baby Hitler. This is important, because I've heard a lot of people saying that their are plot holes because ""Time travel doesn't work that way."" Sure it doesn't. We have no idea how time travel works. And so, movies like this are made, presenting ideas in an artistic format. The characters themselves fully acknowledge that they, people who are living in a time when time travel exists, don't fully understand it. <br/><br/>Any movie that dares to tackle time travel will run into a few plot holes. The real sign of how good a movie is is how much the plot holes detract from the viewing experience. In this case.... I'd say none.<br/><br/>Now that I've tackled a problem, to the review:<br/><br/>A futuristic assassin (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Joe, who kills people sent back in time from when time travel exists one day encounters his future self. As one of his targets. His future self (Bruce Willis) manages to escape and the man hunt begins. What's more, in the future, a powerful person called ""the Rainmaker"" is in total control and actually killed future Joe's wife. Because of this, future Joe sets off to kill the Rainmaker, who is still only a child at this point. Younger Joe gets a hold of one of the possible addresses and stakes out a farm house, occupied by a tough young woman, Sara (Emily Blunt), and her son, Cid (Pierce Gagnon), one of the potential Rainmakers. <br/><br/>Obviously, this film takes on some of the Terminator films' vibes. But even though parts of the plot seem familiar, (killing someone who in the future will become evil, future and past meeting, etc.) the movie takes a very different route. Instead of being predictable, the characters and set-up create a maze of possible plot-lines, follows one, and leaves the audience to guess at different outcomes.<br/><br/>The absolute best part of this film is the characters. The effort put into writing them, making them all plausible and sympathetic, is wonderful. All of the main characters are fleshed out and feel very real. They follow arcs and grow and change. The acting, which of course is what brings the characters to life, is flawless, even from the young Pierce Gagnon. Child actors can be tricky, but he manages to play a character who is innocent, yet dangerous (a difficult part for anyone) with full believability and intensity. Emily Blunt gives a particularly interesting performance, playing both a tough, strong care-giver and a frightened and alone person. And Bruce Willis (an old favourite) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (younger, but with a similarly impressive career both in front and behind him) play off each other as the same person with two very different mind-sets in a truly delightful way.<br/><br/>I've heard some complaints that the movie isn't the one the trailers showed. I, for one, liked this. Trailers have a bit of a blind spot of giving away everything. They tell the whole story within a few moments and make seeing the movie boring. If all the plot twists are in the trailer, then why bother seeing the film? Trailers are there to entice you. And Looper's trailer did.<br/><br/>This film is original, interesting, and dynamic. But don't take my word for it."

Spoiler: they even have to kill their own selves, but the thirty years older version of themselves. And there's where they lost me. Why do they let a looper kill his thirty years older version? That's very stupid. That's asking for trouble. The best way to deal with this, is to let an other looper kill an other looper.<br/><br/>The whole deal about this looper thing is because in the future they don't kill people. So they send people to the past and let the killing be done by these loopers. So why did they kill this Asian girlfriend of Willis? Why didn't they kill Willis as well? This movie has flaws. When you are thinking this movie is about the loopers, we get introduced to this rainmaker and his younger version. What happens to this boy in the future, remains a riddle at the end. The ending is very disappointing. It ends in an anticlimax. There is this silence and the screen gets black. Although it is original, it is not an ending of an action movie.

A complex sci-fi movie should not allow it's viewer to drift off, have time to leave the cinema, get some more popcorn, come back in and miss absolutely nothing. <br/><br/>Moreover, the length of the film is ridiculous. Two-hour movies should be reserved for powerful, intriguing and information-packed features, and Looper is none of the above. The movie goes on for far too long about nothing in particular and when it finally comes to an end, the two main characters become completely futile.<br/><br/>Pierce Gagnon who plays Cid, the child 'rainmaker,' is the only good thing to come out of the movie in that he is a fine young actor and deals with some difficult scenes surprisingly well.<br/><br/>With some pointless characters (the dim-witted Kid Blue), a couple of dreadfully time-consuming and uninteresting monologues between Joe (Gordon-Levitt) and Sara (Emily Blunt) and the fact that it'd be so much easier for the crime lords to kill their victims in the future then send them back to the past (avoiding any hassles with an escape and even eliminating the need for a Looper) or sending the victim back to the Middle Ages (seeing as though they have this time travel thing operating so efficiently), Looper makes the list of 'the worst movies I've had the privilege of watching in cinemas.'<br/><br/>But don't let that stop you from going to see it and making up your own mind about a film that should have remained in Johnson's mind as a messed up and illogical dream he once had."

We get the point. Also, some big warlord is going to make everyone's life miserable. We get that point too. The future belongs to gangsters. We all know that by now.<br/><br/>Also, it is clear that silver and gold are the best monies you can have, something that is not viable even today, but cherished among those who anxiously await Armageddon and want to secure their safe place away from it with precious metals. This movie should make all the precious metal freaks of today very happy. In the future, you're going to need ingots---lots of heavy, hard to transport ingots.<br/><br/>Also, everyone gets to have a weapon and blast others whenever needed, which in this movie is most of the time. This should please the Second Amendment gun worshipers who think that society should be heading that way now.<br/><br/>The movie was stereotypical of what one expects from anything starring Bruce Willis, who is usually close to unconquerable. It's a good visual show for those who like people living in ruins among a lot of hanging cables."
"mircea-lungu","4","2","4","15 October 2012"," Wow: Bruce Willis shooting kids and defenseless women?
","*** SPOILER ALERT *** *** BUT PROBABLY READING THE SPOILER IS WORTH IT !!! ***<br/><br/>This is not a science-fiction movie as there is not too much science in it. This is a fantasy movie which brushes superficially over time-travel, includes toddlers with super-powers, and has Bruce Willis shooting defenseless kids. I am not kidding! Bruce fu#$ing Willis shooting little kids! And running through the fields with his shotgun intent to kill a young mother with her child! (And this movie is supposed to be watchable by 15 year olds.)<br/><br/>The premise of the movie is weak: the loopers that have to terminate themselves is unconvincing. There is too much gratuitous violence. The antagonist is a cute little boy with anger management problems. The secondary anti-hero, the head of a terrible mafia gang, looks so soft and chubby you have to keep reminding yourself that he is not Santa. But the most painful realization at the end of the movie is that there is no story: Joe, the main character is a selfish criminal that does nothing to redeem himself but two things: 1. in a momentary impulse tries to give half of his silver to his girlfriend (although the relationship is not too well outlined), and 2) his final gesture in which he decides that he wants to sacrifice his life to save the life of a child who, by this sacrifice, might not become a real bad mafia guy, development which we are not sure that will have been avoided by this self-sacrifice, just as we are not sure how bad he will become in the future as the report comes from old Joe, who happens to be a criminal too, so the fact that he dislikes another criminal does not mean that the other one is worse.... So after all it might look like the story is the one of the character that starts being selfish and ends up being a generous sacrificing being. Only that the sacrifice seems more like the impulse of a second, a knee jerk reaction. There was no transition, there was no ""growth"" of the character from one state to the other."

","I am not a fan of the movies based on the concept of time travel. A main reason is that the idea of time travel in itself is based on a logical flaw. This movie starts with scenes where the main character is in a cornfield, and shoots a guy that pops out of nowhere. And it is explained that this is people from the future, that is sent back in time to get shot.<br/><br/>I began to wonder if I would see a story that would explain this as logical. Why would it be so difficult to kill a person in the future? If people could in the future invent a time machine, wouldn't it also be probable that they could invent a machine that could, for example, instantly vaporize people (and kill people that way)? I experienced the movie as just creating more and more logical flaws, ending with a so massive logical flaw, that -i thought to myself: the writer must have just given up."

","'LOOPER' was directed by Rian Johnson and stars Joseph Gordon- Levitt, Bruce Willis and Emily Blunt. ​In a future society, time- travel exists, but it's only available to those with the means to pay for it on the black market. When the mob wants to eliminate someone, it sends the target into the past, where a hit man known as a looper lies in wait to finish the job. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is one such hired gun, and he does his job well -- until the day his bosses decide to ""close the loop"" and send Joe's future self (Bruce Willis) back in time to be killed.<br/><br/>This movie is not bad. It's not good. It etches more towards good than bad but that doesn't make it good. It's not average. It's not above or below average. I don't know what to label this movie as. Some ideas and concepts presented are intriguing and, given some time to develop, could make an interesting TV series or something of the like. Levitt was fantastic at mimicking Bruce Willis and I commend him for that. Willis was also great and the pair both provided a very interesting and unique performance of the same character. If this movie had been given maybe another 2 weeks in the writing room, I think it would've worked much better. I don't dislike it and I don't like it. I give it a six because it leans more towards the good but that doesn't make it good. That sounds very confusing but it does kind of make sense.<br/><br/>The movie does hold some very interesting concepts which could be explored more with prequels, a sequel or a TV series. But they just had too many new ideas that they had to cram into the run time. This bloats the movie for me by about 30 minutes. They cram in a stupid amount of exposition at the beginning and that really should have been cut entirely, and then sprinkle it throughout the film instead of a tiny 30 minute gap. I think I like the ending but I am unsure of it. More time on the script would have benefited the movie much more I am sure.<br/><br/>As previously stated, Levitt and Willis are both excellent in their joint role as Joe. Emily Blunt was awesome as Sara and shows real, genuine desperation and an urge to care for her child. That kid was creepy as hell but was excellent nonetheless. <br/><br/>It is well shot, lit and edited. No complaints as far as standard scenes go. I do, however, have some complaints surrounding the way action was handled in this movie. Granted it isn't an action movie and thus I don't expect perfection but if you choose to include it, make it watchable. <br/><br/>This movie is hard to recommend. I think I will say you should watch it once, ponder on the interesting questions raised and then never see it again. I see very little(if any) rewatch value and seeing it more than once would probably make my head bleed. That's my recommendation for this film. I'll rate it 6 Creepy A$$ Looking Kids out of 10."

Anyway Looper sounds like a female lead film, now that I think about it, come on you know it does and it would be a comedy. But maybe someday someone make a film of what i'm talking about, where chicks loop their tounges. The actual film is about a Looper(men who are hired by future Mafia to kill men with a bag over their head)who gets the one thing all Looper's dread the Loop cut. Where the Looper is sent their future self to kill. But once he meets his future self(played by Bruce Willis) he's told by Bruce Willis Looper that he's here to kill the rainmaker(the new crime boss from the future cutting off all Looper's.) He meets a woman named by Emily Blunt and from there things start to escalate. When I first saw the trailer in 2012 I thought looked good but I never saw it. Thank goodness because the pacing was kind of actually no not kind of but really freaking awful in the first 30 minutes. But once it starts booming and the plot starts running it's course it becomes a fun and eventful film. Another thing that was hard to get into was character, not that it lacked character development but the only that I could get into was Emily Blunt's character Sarah and her son SID(the future Rainmaker). Especially SID I really wanted to know more about him and maybe about his father. He forms a friendship with the Looper Joe and believes he's there to protect him and his mother. The camera shots in this film are great. When it gets to exciting sequences it can get slow but then start booming in a fast-paced motion which I really enjoyed when it was on. I think that Looper is a great piece of original material taking an old concept such as time-travel and making it something very dramatic again. I'm going to give Looper a four out of five."

The actors look bored most of the time, and there is some miscasting. Bruce Willis seems to have been cast as a lure for the paying public, whilst Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a dreary and unlikely action hero.<br/><br/>The story is puzzling, leaving more questions than answers, plus the premise is weak, which left me bemused and head scratching at the end.<br/><br/>As for entertainment, well its an OK film. The action, (though sparse) will keep you watching, but at the end you will wonder why you bothered."
"brent_or","7","0","0","10 August 2014"," Inconsistent Core Story
","First of all, this is a well-made film in nearly every way. Acting, cinematography, dialog, visual effects, sets and locations. And the directing is good on a scene-by-scene basis, with some very nice moments of theme reinforcement. The basic story is also interesting. And of course, there is the gimmick of Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing a young version of Bruce Willis' character, which is really well done all around.<br/><br/>However, and some other reviewers have noted it, the story here takes a turn about midway through and the film as a whole winds up feeling inconsistently focused. In some cases, change-ups and uncertainties are good. In this case, it all feels more like it is unfinished, and could have used some more revisions.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS BELOW***<br/><br/>Specifically, the whole idea of ""The Rainmaker"" needed to have been worked into the screenplay earlier and in a more substantial fashion. As is, it feels to me like a peripheral story element that gets suddenly upgraded to being the primary focus, but there isn't enough of a full-circle effect for what happens in the later parts of the film to feel consistent with what has already happened in the early parts of the film.<br/><br/>All of that being said, though, I do not think that Looper is a bad film, and it certainly has enough going for it to merit a positive rating from me. My gripes here are not the same as those I have with Star Trek Into Darkness, for example. Looper is a bit unfocused as a whole, but more as a matter of editing and foreshadowing. It's still a well-written film, beat-for-beat. The fact that it moves slowly at times is not a flaw--that's just the type of film that this is. And there are some truly powerful moments here and there, brought to life by great technical filmmaking and a top-notch cast. Rian Johnson may not have hit perfection here, but he definitely has my attention as an up-and-coming director."
"pdmcphillips","9","6","20","27 September 2012"," Looper - A Successfully Executed Exploration of Time-Travel
","'Looper' stands out as one of the most well executed time-travel films to come out of Hollywood. Not only does it successfully execute a rounded narrative , but the characters and their motivations are clear and unwavering.<br/><br/>Joe is a professional hit-man, who murders people for money - from the future, he is called a Looper. Circa 2070, time travel is outlawed and only used by powerful members of the mob. Thus, they send anyone they want killed back to 2040, thus erasing them from existence in their present. He is shocked when he himself is sent back, (Bruce Willis) and this older version escapes assassination. While on the surface, it seems like a cat-and-mouse type of film, the intricacies in character development and plot make this film much more than that.<br/><br/>Writer/director Rian Johnson certainly succeeds in dictating the laws of time travel in his universe. Any fans of 'Primer' will certainly enjoy this film, and 'Primer' creator/star Shane Carruth actually consulted on the time travel elements on this film.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt is convincing as not only a Bruce Willis look-alike, but he nails the facial nuances and vocal cadences. While the make-up is a little distracting at times, it's not ridiculous, and in fact is in the vain of the Back to the Future prosthetics, which for their time, were quite effective in making the actors look 30 years older. <br/><br/>Bruce Willis gives one of the most intriguing and convincing performances of his career and Emily Blunt is a flawless and well-placed character. Jeff Daniels plays a small but crucial role and portrays the menacing employer very well.<br/><br/>A special mention should go out to Pierce Gagnon, who plays a six-year-old crucial to the plot. Without giving too much away, his performance and timing is impressive for such a young lad.<br/><br/>This is a film you need to concentrate in. You'll probably even be asking yourself in your head 'isn't he (that character) but younger?' 'How can that happen if that happened?'. And this is the complex beauty of the time travel narrative. My advice would be to just let it wash over you. Enjoy the ride."
"neil-476","9","4","12","4 October 2012"," Breathtaking - literally
","It is the near future. Time travel has not yet been invented, but it will in a few years. Joe knows this because organised crime in the future no longer murders people because of difficulties disposing of the bodies: instead, it sends them back in time for people like Joe to kill and dispose of. Joe makes a good living doing this until, one day, the victim sent back is himself, and future Joe escapes. Present-day Joe is driven to find and kill future Joe (and thereby put his own life back on track) and future Joe is driven to find future crime boss The Rainmaker to prevent a future tragedy.<br/><br/>I love science fiction, I'm a sucker for well constructed time travel stories, I like violent crime thrillers, and I very much like Bruce Willis (future Joe) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (present-day Joe). So this movie ticked a lot of my boxes before it started. And it continued to tick them all the way through: it is an intelligent science fiction action thriller with good performances all round - Willis is probably as good here as he ever has been, and Levitt does well in capturing Willis' speech patterns, aided by prosthetics, and hampered by deeply distracting eyebrows. Emily Blunt - not a favourite - is very good, and Pierce Gagnon gives an astonishing performance for a child his age. I suspect that not all of the plot stands up under close examination, but it definitely works well enough for me.<br/><br/>And, a rarity, there is a moment in it which literally (and I do mean ""literally"") took my breath away - I was so emotionally and intellectually shocked by it that I gasped and then could not breathe for moments. I'm sure not everyone will have that reaction, but I did, and that moment stayed with me as I left the cinema.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for those with a leaning towards science fiction and crime thrillers."

The excuse of a story meanders and is muddled in a bad way. We get to watch a dozen close-up shot-gun blastings of people as if one is not enough. The future is poorly imagined - probably due to a slim budget, or perhaps Bruce Willis has somehow deflated the movie's budget for everything else. He's in about 40 min of the runtime - less than half. Way too much time is spent in corn fields and expository dialog. You have the director casting Jeff Daniels, that's right Jeff Daniels, as the mob-boss. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's makeup in an attempt to look like Bruce Willis is distractingly poor. There is actually scenes of shooting (at) children. What a complete steaming turd this movie is. The Time Machine is a concept rip-off of Twelve Monkeys done half-a$$ed. This is low-concept, and I was duped once again by a high average IMDb review. Deserves a 3/10. Not even worth a library check-out.

""Looper"" is one of those prized treasures that deserve to be talked about and doted on.<br/><br/>Time travel is invented and declared illegal in the near future.

","Looper is a movie without a loophole-corny i know but its true!!! The script is solid, acting is par extraordinaire. Joseph-Gordon Levitt is definitely the soul of this movie. All the actors made the characters breathe an essence which is integral to the script and the director captured it the best way possible. <br/><br/>Every emotion however subtle was emoted beautifully. Mr.Levitts portrayal of being the angry young man with intensity and vulnerability is commendable. Miss Blunt and her pseudo son made a charming couple. The angst,the over protectiveness and her loneliness was depicted with such conviction that any mother will feel her pain. Then there is always the guarantee of what will happen when Bruce Willis has two guns and he's not a happy man.<br/><br/>Looper is one of those movies where the edge of your seat is your permanent residence till it ends. It is delightful to see how the story unravels and finishes with an exquisite bang at the end. A must watch."
"JohnRayPeterson","7","3","8","30 November 2012"," You'll like it if you're prepared to think more than usual
","As with any time travel based work in cinema, you must engage in suspension of disbelief; those who can't won't be selecting this movie to start with. If that's not enough, you even have to actually work your brain with this one to keep up with the plot. The film has a romance component and as you may have read from the official outline, it also has hit men and organized crime. What a soup mix I thought; but since I'm a Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Jeff Daniels fan and also like Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt as well as other members of the cast, I gave it a shot. There's action, but that won't come as a surprise. I was thankful for the pricey Coke and popcorn to keep me interested during a few scenes. After a few minutes at the beginning of the movie, another element is introduced but not much will be spent on it till the end of the movie; that element is telekinesis. Okay, by now you must be having doubts if you'll be watching this movie to the end; I had the same doubts, ten bucks worth. Turns out the time travel, the telekinesis and the romance sub-plot do work out in the end. In fact, it is because of a brilliant, and I'm not using the term lightly, ending that I walked away, quite pleased having seen the whole movie. I was a bit annoyed by the nose prosthetic they put on Gordon-Levitt to make is transformation to Willis' character more believable; if you're making a movie with time travel and telekinesis, I don't think you'll have a problem with viewers believing they were the same person. Maybe I'm too picky about nose jobs.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt does not have an accent in this one and doesn't have a single funny line; she's also blond. I like her despite all that. Piper Perabo has aged wonderfully well; keep this in mind. I would have rated this movie higher, like most viewers have so far, but unless a flick with time travel and telekinesis is spectacular, I can't bring myself to give marks like Inception or the original Matrix. I still recommend it; all the actors deliver the best performances you could expect."

","Having seen a lot of sci-fi movies (big fan of the genre), I went to this movie expecting a decent action thriller at the very least. I was pleasantly surprised - what i got was a movie with an original and very intelligent script, good performances, some great action, and a thought-provoking ending.<br/><br/>Looper is set some years in the future when time travel and telekinesis are common, with the former being outlawed, and the latter being viewed as more of a party trick. The mob (yes the future has a Mob!) use time travel as a very ingenious way of getting rid of people. They send the victim back to a pre-specified time, blind-folded with silver bars strapped to his back. When the victim appears, there's a ""looper"" waiting to kill him off and take the silver as payment. At some point in time, the looper is made to kill off his ""older self"" thus closing the loop. Sounds complicated? The whole concept of time travel is complicated - yet the movie manages to explain everything very clearly with no loose ends and not a single plot hole.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a looper Joe, going through his life stashing away a bit of his silver bar payment, doing drugs, and in general, just waiting for when he has to close his loop. When it does happen however, he hesitates, and his older self (played by an older, grayer Bruce Willis) makes an escape. Joe has already seen what happens when a loop is not closed - a friend of his is killed off horribly for the same mistake.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie focuses on both the Joes fighting to stay alive and also trying to find the younger self of the Rainmaker, a feared crime lord of the future who ordered the assassination of older Joe. The logic is that if the Rainmaker's younger self is eliminated, he is removed in the future as well. Of course, killing a child is always difficult, and this dilemma is what provides the movie with its emotional core.<br/><br/>The child playing the younger self of the Rainmaker is a talent to watch out for, switching between cuteness and menace in a heartbeat. Jeff Daniels plays the crime lord sent back from the future to ensure discipline among the loopers, while Emily Blunt excels as the single mom trying to raise a telekinetic child on the right path.<br/><br/>The movie of course belongs to Gordon-Levitt and Willis, both fine accomplished actors who deliver all that is expected and more. Credit is also due to the script - simple, elegant, yet intelligent to make the audience focus."
"MirkoSerra","5","3","8","8 October 2012"," Funny but with holes
","Good movie for entertaining, but too many story-holes for it to be taken ""seriously"" (as seriously as a movie can be taken).<br/><br/>There's some action, but really not that much. I wouldn't call it an action movie.<br/><br/>There even aren't enough good characters; so the protagonist is both the good guy (present) and the bad guy (future) of the movie.<br/><br/>Also, the detail of putting the telekinetic thing onto the story (10% of the people? Really?), which added nothing really (does the rainmaker need to be a super telekinetic guy? Couldn't be just an ordinary guy?).<br/><br/>On the thing of the time travel, logic tells us two things can happened: either you can change the future or you cant. Given that you can change it, story might loop until a non-paradoxical time-line is created. This seems to happened in the movie when the protagonist kills his older self and story loops, and he's put in the same situation again. Then, on the ending, when he suicides, all of the movie shouldn't have happened (his older self not traveling and he is not in that position again, so he doesn't suicide... so, paradox). But rather than that, movie ends there as if this was a logical ending (also, shooting his older self would have let the rainmaker be alive and with his mother, and also wouldn't have led to a paradox...)."

"benjaminweber","5","3","9","21 July 2018"," Weirdly inconsistent time travel laws
","First of all, there was some attempt to make an original time travel film here. Secondly, it was well-acted by everyone in the cast, including the child actors. Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were great choices for the hardened, older and brash, younger versions of the same man. It is well scored, and well directed. Sadly, this cannot save a film that has a hastily written plot just to make a time travel film.<br/><br/>The central premise of the film, that in the future time travel is used to send people back in time to be assassinated because it is impossible to dispose of bodies, is immediately flawed when you realise they could just send the dead body back in time and directly into a furnace, cutting out the middleman. This is particularly of note when we see gangsters actually kill a civilian in the future, indicating they're more than happy to do the deed just to keep their operations silent and that they more than likely kill just as many in the future as they send back. So again, why bother with time travel, especially seeing as the film emphasises that time travel is especially illegal?!<br/><br/>The actual mechanisms of time travel seem to be as confused as the reasons for it as well. It spends a lot of time setting up that when someone travels into the past, changes to the past only catch up with them once they pass the point when the change physically occurs. There is one scene making this gruesomely clear, in which a young looper is dismembered as his older self falls apart on the street outside. This is later reinforced with Bruce Willis' memories. This raises another fundamental question with the plot: why did the Rainmaker rise to power on account of his rough upbringing before Bruce Willis travelled back in time to cause his rough upbringing? In Willis' future, he shot his older self as a young man and never went near the farm, meaning the Rainmaker would not exist, at least not as a hardened criminal. He would have no one to stop upon travelling to the past, and would not have even had his loop closed since the Rainmaker was the one closing the loops. As a side note on the same topic, why did he vanish when Gordon-Levitt shot himself? As established earlier, he should have simply turned into a corpse!<br/><br/>These weren't the only two issues I had with the plot, but they were the two that really crippled it for me. The earlier throwaway line about telekinesis seemed like forced foreshadowing in hindsight, but at least didn't create plot holes. There were other issues, but I've already written too much! 5/10"
"dalibor-572-994641","1","3","9","3 January 2013"," Extremely poor writing!
","The biggest con: The whole point of time travel is you can not coexist in the same space and time with yourself. Meaning you can not coexist in same universe, but you can in parallel universe! Mind you that would mean you are not the same person, so inflicting any pain, shooting or any other type of mutilation it would not change a thing to the person coming from the future, it would only mean you dying in that universe where you always existed.<br/><br/>Urg!<br/><br/>The pros:<br/><br/>Loved Emily Blunt!"
"januaryman-1","9","3","9","7 October 2012"," Well done! A new classic.
","I saw Loopers with the expectation that it would be mediocre. It was anything but. Time travel movies are notoriously paradoxical, but Rian Johnson's screenplay was masterfully written and executed the intricate plot nearly without flaw. I say nearly because I am still genuinely puzzled by a couple of points. The confusion may clear up though with more contemplation and viewings. (I plan on seeing this movie at least a dozen times.) And that the movie is novel and fresh enough to require thought beyond the closing credits is a good thing. See with some who you like talking with; you'll love discussing this movie. The cast is superb with standout work from Blunt, Gordon-Levitt, and Willis. And Daniels carries villainy far while Dano's portrayal will make your skin crawl. While on the subject of darker character traits, even Willis and Gordon-Levitt do things that will draw no sympathy from the audience. This complexity adds to the allure of the moview. Loopers is well worth your time."
"ishaan_gurung","5","3","9","7 October 2012"," Not a professional.
","I would be lying if I claimed to be a professional in the field of film reviews but this flick in particular gave me the green light. Here, I don't mention the positives of the flick since they have been rinsed and repeated throughout the world wide web. Nonetheless, below are some quick plot points that really bothered me in the movie Looper:<br/><br/>1. Joe 'drops' the ball. <br/><br/>In the beginning, Joe's monologue tells us that mobs or people cannot murder others because of some 'tracking' that takes place. I assume this pinpoints who the killer is? (Isn't explained but not a huge problem).<br/><br/>Fast forward to old Joe 30 years later and the mob kills someone. Joe's Asian wife. Even though old Joe takes care of the mob members, it can be surmised that they weren't the whole mob and were clearly henchmen. So was the mob leader caught? Where did they dump the body if it really was tracked? The list is ongoing.<br/><br/>2. Blue's Clueless.<br/><br/>Kid Blue had a lot of potential. Really. He reminded me of a loose cannon, a ticking time-bomb waiting to explode. You as an audience hopes that his recklessness and failures early on pays off later in the film where his anger moulds him into a fitting villain. You are not meant to like him. <br/><br/>However, you give up hope for this ""Kid Blue"" when he finally seems to have caged the lion (old Joe) but gets a fork put on his back-side and turned around flat on his face (not literally). So the audience's hope gets shunted and a question pops up: 'Why is he even there?' The answer is: because he is. He is just there for the hell of it. I certainly don't want to question the dual-wielding old Joe's marksmanship but why mow down everyone in the mob and let Kid Blue off with a mere scratch? Again, I have the answer (you might know it too). He is just there for the hell of it. To merely aid Joe in the next scene with the hover bike where Kid Blue gets to redeem his acts of mishap? Nope, to die. And he isn't the only useless antagonist of the film, Abe is another anomaly. It is mentioned that he's from the future. So what? That doesn't instantly give him bad ass points (it would have been interesting to see his back story in some fashion). We see him smash Kid Blue's hands with a tiny hammer. The sympathy you feel for Kid Blue clearly overshadows Abe's unnecessary, bully-ish and violent actions.<br/><br/>3. We are all dumb.<br/><br/>A director/writer's job in a film with a complex idea is to make us feel smarter and to give us a high after figuring out the complexities such as time paradoxes and such. But what we are served is a predictable and loathsome ending akin to 'this was all a dream'. Let me explain. The film builds up this mystery of what lil' Rainmaker's fate really is...<br/><br/>4. Heat vision? I-look-at-people-and-they-explode-vision.<br/><br/>Like most of the film, the concept of an innocent child being able to dismember any thing around him through absolute rage is appealing. But the method gets a thumbs down. The extreme close up shots of the lil' Rainmaker's googly eyed face while undergoing RAGE MODE simply couldn't be taken seriously (I personally would have had him cover his face). <br/><br/>Right after the scene where lil' Rainmaker decides involuntarily to pop the baddie's bubble, Joe makes a dash for him to end his life. And we support him 100% So he catches up to the child fairly easily, and sees him crouched and bloody faced and...decides not to kill him. That is not enough. Now, I'm not saying he should have killed the child, then you would truly be confused in terms of the protagonist/antagonist of the film. But this scene needed a flashback or a sudden realisation of Joe's earlier life that was foreshadowed; justifies as to why he cannot pull the trigger. It never was. So you're left scratching your head as to why his sudden vow for blood shifts into sympathetic confusion.<br/><br/>Again, this violent act confuses you as to who the villain really is. <br/><br/>The list really is ongoing."

","'Looper (2012)' is surprisingly dark and properly grisly at times, especially during its first act. It navigates its complex, non-pandering sci-fi premise with poise and aplomb, but does take quite a turn around its mid-point while also including quite a few odd character choices that see our protagonist betray himself in more ways than one. Still, it's an entertainingly pulpy and simultaneously intelligent affair, blending its grandiose themes with its gritty presentation almost impeccably. It knows exactly what it is while also conveying its deeper messages, though they can be diluted at times through strange conceits and annoying - if interesting - characters introduced fairly late into the flick. The flick is always trying to do something unique and equally impressive even when it falls a little short of doing so. 7/10"
"keegansantiago","10","2","5","2 March 2017"," One of the best Sci-Fi thrillers I have seen in a while!
","If you have seen the trailers and were a bit skeptical about the movie like me, you are probably still considering this movie. Then I realized how wrong I was when I decided to watch it after 5 years of considering it. This is one of the best Sci-fi thrillers I have ever seen! It is not much of a cliché, the acting is great, and it is an overall interesting and intelligent movie and really does leave you thinking after you watch it. One of the great things about this movie is that it is like Terminator or Robocop and what is so great about that is that it doesn't need a cyborg or lots of cool, intense sequences to make it a classic. Another great perk for this factor about the movie is that if you are not a fan of Sci-Fi films is that you will still enjoy it because of the film's amazing plot and character development. The biggest thing of all that made me want to rate this movie a 10 is because it is a movie like Pulp Fiction, where you can watch it as many times as you want and not know what comes next. I really hope you give this movie a chance because it is a bit underrated and not rally praised as much as it should be."

","I wanted to stop watching ""Looper"" about a half-hour in. I stuck it out for another half hour, then went and surfed the net, listening with half an ear while my wife continued to watch. (She didn't like it either.) <br/><br/>I could say many negative things about ""Looper""--the premise was clunky and absurd; the pace lethargic; the plot unfocused--but what made me stop watching was that I simply did not care what happened. Both young Joe and old Joe were brutal assassins which hardly made them sympathetic characters. The stakes didn't seem important--they had to stop the villainous Rainmaker from wiping out the crime lords of the future and killing off the assassins. Making the future safe for crime isn't exactly an inspiring goal. Granted, old Joe wanted to save his wife as well, but she had hardly screen time so I didn't really care about her either.<br/><br/>In summary: Didn't hate the villain, didn't love the hero, didn't care about the outcome."
"Mustang92","4","2","5","24 October 2013"," Very Contrived!
","As others have pointed out in reviews here, this movie is very, very contrived.<br/><br/>The biggest bullsh*t contrivance? Young Joe turns the gun on himself, to end the loop, save Sarah and perhaps change the future. HOWEVER, killing himself was NOT motivated. On the contrary, he's fighting for his life the entire film (after his older self outwits his younger self upon time traveling back). He repeatedly tries to kill his older self, and wants to ""get right"" with Abe. He's fighting the entire time to live and not be killed. Yet, now, at the end of the film, just after battling one of Abe's last men to stay alive and not be killed, he's NOW going to turn the gun on himself...???? What????<br/><br/>All he would have to do is just kill his older self who's 20 feet in front of him about to shoot Sarah. Kill his older self, and he SAVES Sarah and Cid. And then he can go on with his life, for the rest of his life. Simple, yeah? Any reasonable person would have made this choice.<br/><br/>Yet young Joe doesn't, but in fact does something unmotivated in killing himself. Makes NO sense, and destroys the movie. This last action of his is only there, I'll bet, to provide an unexpected twist. But unexpected twists must work, or the film fails.<br/><br/>Of course, the film was already problematic with other contrivances and story logic. But... this denouement really puts a wonderfully stupid cap on a movie that had much potential. Brilliant writing there, Mr. Johnson."
"illbebackreviews","8","2","5","13 February 2013"," Looper has a lot of Blade Runner and Terminator feel to it but delivers a very good and a sort of unique movie
","Looper has being a highly anticipated movie by most people but I myself had no real intention of seeing it. Now that I have, I have a few points that I need to make out The story is about a Looper called Joe, played by Joseph Gordon Levitt whose job is to kill wanted criminals who are sent 30 years into the past in order to dispose of bodies easily. However, one day he meets his older self who he must kill whilst he ends up on a farm in Kansas that may change everything The main reason I refused to watch this movie when it first came out was due to the fact that I'm a huge fan of the first two Terminator movies and I hate any movie that attempts to resemble it. I also really like Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and this plot seemed to have too much of those two in it. When I heard friends at school going on about how good it got, I was both jealous and eager to see this.<br/><br/>There is much to like about this movie. For instance, the acting is great especially Levitt and Bruce Willis who absolutely resemble young and old Joe. The kid who played Cid was actually great for his age and did a fantastic job of making the movie feel dark. The story is good but there are some issues with it, mainly towards the end. The characters aren't all that great but the characters we focus on are very good, such as the Mum, Cid and Joe. The movie does feel intense at times but it could've been done better at certain aspects.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 8 because I did not expect it'll be rated like that from me. The movie's conclusion, in my opinion, is a huge let down after such an intriguing build-up and character development with a lot of emotional scenes. The conclusion had very little action for a big action movie and so, it felt really disappointing. The scene where Old Joe just cleans up all the Loopers that were sent to target young Joe was pretty disappointing, resulting in very little intensity towards the end.<br/><br/>That being said, despite having resemblances towards Terminator and Blade Runner, Looper certainly develops its own story line as the film goes by and provides us with emotional flashbacks and connections towards our characters. Despite a disappointing conclusion, Looper is a well acted, good plot movie with interesting characters that is sure to be a fun time for most people."

","In this latest film by Rian Johnson (The Brothers Bloom, Breaking Bad); the premise is old but execution, superb. Looper is very entertaining for a time travel science-fiction thriller<br/><br/>Now that I have gotten sensationalistic thoughts out of the way, there is no doubt that it is a tad cluttered (or misleading) for something sold as ""sci-fi time travel"". But hey if Looper is messed up, then 2046 must be f**king depraved.<br/><br/>Considering the number of films in this genre (Source Code, Frequency) tend to lure viewers in with the promise of paradoxical intrigue only to finally climax in a cesspool of logical absurdities (and thereby, obliterating any fun or entertainment I could have possibly gleaned from the entire viewing experience) I'd say Looper concluded with a nice touch.<br/><br/>Eight out of ten either cop-out of the premise in their final acts, or bend the rules of time travel so far out of shape that narrative collapses under the weight of a rigid past-present-future time line.<br/><br/>At least, Looper was entertaining enough to finish in one sitting without cussing.

","LOOPER did fairly well in the box office in October 2012 and now that it is available on Instant Video and in DVD the popularity grows. Written and directed by Rian Johnson it is another take on the concept of time travel (a topic that never seems to miss with audiences) and while the film is entertaining, it is very bloody and gory and the only salvation is the fact that the cast contains some of filmdom's more popular actors.<br/><br/>The story is best summarized by the lead character in the film, Joe played with skill (despite phony makeup trying to make him resemble Bruce Willis – his looper self) by Joseph Gordon- Levitt: 'I work as a specialized assassin, in an outfit called the Loopers. When my organization from the future wants someone to die, they zap them back to me and I eliminate the target from the future. The only rule is: never let your target escape... even if your target is you.' Or, stated another way, in 2074, when the mob wants to get rid of someone, the target is sent 30 years into the past, where a hired gun awaits. Someone like Joe, who one day learns the mob wants to 'close the loop' by transporting back Joe's future self (Bruce Willis). So the film opens in the year 2044, and Joe is a looper, friends with Seth (Paul Dano in a very brief appearance) and lovers with Suzie (Piper Perabo) and working for head looper Abe (Jeff Daniels). Joe discovers his next assignment is himself (Bruce Willis, Joe from the future). He also encounters Sara (Emily Blunt) who knows the strange coincidences that are about to happen (!) and mothers a child Cid (Pierce Gagnon) who has particularly useful end-of-the - world powers etc etc.<br/><br/>It is a clever idea and if time travel and assassinations fascinate you, then this is a well-made move in that genre. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"kdnor2011","8","2","5","2 January 2013"," An entertaining, smart sci-fi that isn't for everyone
","(A few Spoilers Ahead) Over the past few years we have been getting some really smart science fiction movies. 2008 we got Wall-e, yes that counts, 2009 we got District 9, 2010 we got Inception, and 2011 we got Source Code. Looper made my head hurt when I saw it, and I wasn't sure if that was because I was too dumb for the movie, or too smart. I will say now that Looper is a very entertaining, smart science fiction movie that will not appeal to everyone.<br/><br/>Here's the thing, this movie says one sentence that gives it a pass. It says that time travel is unpredictable basically, and if you can't accept that, or missed it by accident, then you will say this is one of the most plot hole filled movies ever made. Literally without that one line the entire movie is one big plot hole. Also the second act really slows down, we get a pretty generic and boring relationship between Josepsh Gordon Levitt and this farmgirl he meets. And one last big problem, some stuff happens by the most major coincidences ever. Oh, JGL just happened to land on the farm where the kid that Bruce Willis is trying kill is.<br/><br/>The film has many twists and turns that honestly it isn't just a film you can just sit down and turn your brain off. The acting is really good, some people are mixed on if JGL looks like a younger version of Bruce Willis, personally I was able to buy it. But the biggest surprise was the little kid who gave one of the best child performances I've ever seen. There an interesting conflict going on here, and it has some cool ideas, some are pulled off better than others though. The special effects, while minimal, are very well done. And it is fun, it never gets too confusing, and has enough action and banter to keep people interested.<br/><br/>If you can't accept that one line, and I know some people can't, than this is one of the most plot hole filled movie you will ever see. If you can accept that, then Looper is a fun, smart science fiction movie with some interesting ideas, great acting, and fun action."

","Well, after having watched The Looper, I was quite amazed. Simliar to the Matrix, this movie catches up slowly, it quite took some time until I got behind the story, and began to understand. Sadly some logical flaws made me stumble as well, a very annoying fact. Of course it is not easy to setup a scene where your future ego interacts with his younger pedant. But as this was a key part, it took away the brilliance which was inherent in the Looper. A little more accuracy would have made this movie a 10 for me.

But One day it all goes wrong where his own Loop or his own older self is to be eliminated by him and the older Joe(Bruce Willis) escapes from him and is on a mission to eliminate the Rainmaker who is responsible for the killings of the Loops. So Now Joe must kill his older self in order to get his life back and get back to being a Looper.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon Levitt is in the lead role in this movie and does so brilliantly well yet again as Joe, and he is really a talented actors suited for these kind of serious roles. He Reminds me of a young Robert De Niro in this movie and sometimes his voice was also identical to De Niro, well he has the capability of becoming as good as De Niro in the future. The Movie is revolving around his character and he does an extremely good job in keeping the audience glued to his character. Bruce Willis too did a very good job as the old Joe, and although i think that the change from Gordon Levitt to Willis was a bit illogical, Willis did a very convincing job nevertheless. Emily Blunt also did a good job in portraying Sara and the acting trio have shined in this movie, and the rest of the crew also did a good job in their respective roles.<br/><br/>The Director-Writer Rian Johnson has done a tremendous job in making this movie considering that he also wrote the script for the movie, and the way the movie is set up from the beginning and shown throughout is absolutely brilliant and he explained his story brilliantly and also picked and directed a brilliant acting crew who all did their respective job very well, and also handled his visual crew well as the visual effects in the movie was absolutely top-class. The Story which i think is an original story written by him is absolutely brilliant and unique and time travel was shown so brilliantly and the effects of it too in the story and considering that its his own idea, Johnson did a mind- blowing job with the script and concept of this movie.<br/><br/>The Visual Effects of this movie right from the beginning and some of the scenes shown are absolutely mind-blowing stuff and the visual effects crew has done a marvelous job starting from the fighting scenes to the slow-motion one's and considering that its all futuristic stuff, this movie deserves some awards for its visual effects. The Cinematography in this movie too is top-class as the place's and area's shown starting from Kansas to Shanghai and that too in the future are absolutely so realistic and mind-blowing stuff and full credits to the cinematographer Steve Yedlin for his contributions to the film. <br/><br/>Finally, I really think that everyone should go for it being or not being a sci-fi movie fan, this is probably the best sci-fi movie after Inception and really deserves a watch and it also ensures full on entertainment and also will keep you mesmerized from the beginning and keep you thinking right till the ending scene.<br/><br/>My Rating: 9/10"

","A very good execution of a flawed concept. (The director did this before with ""Brick"". It was very interesting but kind of confusing.)<br/><br/>There was a lot about it that I liked. But it raised a lot of questions at the same time.<br/><br/>(Did everyone else see the ode-to the Twilight Zone with the kid with similar powers that wished adults into the corn field?)<br/><br/>I'm going to jump over the platitudes to the acting and film making. (Wasn't the little kid great, too?) Even though Levitt was really a bad guy, I was interested 'cause he was interesting.<br/><br/>The over-riding problem I has was that killing your older self was a very bad idea. And, really, it wasn't clear why they did it. When it failed once wouldn't the mafia rethink the process? We got a good reason why so many were being killed later on with the Rainmaker character, but even then, it was strange for a barbaric bad guy to go through all that trouble. We cut to the future with all hell breaking loose and I'm led to believe that the mafia, at the same time, goes through all that trouble to dispose of bodies.<br/><br/>And another specific example. We're told that the mafia sends the bodies back in time to be disposed of because it's difficult to fully dispose of a body. Right? Okay, so the mafia shows up to kidnap Bruce Willis and accidentally shoot his wife. Do they take the body with them? Apparently not as it's not with them as they leave. They burned it up in the fire? That wasn't enough?<br/><br/>Another side thing. The klutz bad guys captures Willis and brings him back to Jeff Daniels. Just before that we see the cops raiding the bar. But there is nothing with the cops after we enter the bar and have that long shoot out. <br/><br/>But again, those were bones that stuck in my throat but the meal itself was actually very good. <br/><br/>(Now you might mark ""Was This Helpful?"" What does that mean? Are you reading this before you decide to go to this movie? You'd think that IMDb could come up with more engaging choices.)"

The simple fact is time travel into the past, science tells us is impossible! So why are people bemoaning, this and that aspect of the films plot lines; it cannot and will not ever make sense thats why time travel into the past is a paradox in itself. IT CANT HAPPEN! I wonder how many reviewers who have criticised this film love Terminator?. Terminator is great entertainment, but is equally silly in its story line; time travel into the past is impossible, full stop! Given this, just enjoy the film for what it is.... a well made, well acted, enjoyable romp with genuine moments of excitement and action. The film's premise itself is nonsense, it can't happen.... so just enjoy it!!"

Some movies are good to wait for when they are released on DVD. However, Looper is the kind of movie that is best scene in the theater and then it would be a nice addition to a DVD library.

"PipAndSqueak","4","4","14","6 October 2012"," Unbelievable
","Gratuitous violence. Yawnfest mid way. Silly plot - actually, a plot that could have been interesting if people had spent more time developing it instead of rushing to film. Poor casting, or rather wrong casting....probably more to do with generating box office profits because of the appearance of the BIG NAME - who doesn't in fact make an appearance until well into the film. Admittedly, the whole enterprise seems to improve once the BIG NAME makes an appearance suggesting a lot of effort being made to keep BIG NAME on board. The plot is completely predictable and it is unnecessary to watch to the end. Any child can work it out. Grim to watch. No payoffs - what's the point??? I suspect the whole thing is a little bit of an in joke to the insiders on this. Epic fail, in my view."
"ThePadraigMoista","7","4","14","30 September 2012"," Highly overrated, but a fun time.
","Looper is writer-director Rian Johnson's highly rated third film. It stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis and Emily Blunt. I'm going to start right off the bat here and I say it is overrated. Completely overrated. However, I still do think the film is good. I mean, I'd probably watch it again, but it doesn't deserve the rating it gets. The acting wasn't even that good from everyone, it dragged on a bit and there was tons of stupid and unrealistic crap. Also, the whole film is not memorable. <br/><br/>When you make a film that is mind-bending a lot of people tend to pretend that they like it, even if they didn't understand it, and a lot of people tend to not like it because they didn't understand it. I don't think that is the case here, as this film isn't really mind-bending. It's just action attempting to be logical, and it does so, but I think it thinks that it is smarter than it is and so it tries to bring too much logic to action. The film couldn't decide whether it was action or logical. Because all action is mindless. <br/><br/>I did like the film however, I mean, it was enjoyable, as all action films attain to be. And, as I said, in that aspect it succeeds. But it tires too hard to be more than action and that was the wrong choice. It is highly overrated and a bit predictable with a load of stupid crap thrown in. But then again, the stupid crap comes with action and that's what this is. The acting wasn't too great if I'm honest. But you could tell that they were having fun, along with Rian Johnson, and along with me.<br/><br/>A solid 7/10."
"Fields201","7","4","14","29 September 2012"," Bruce Willis Is The Terminator
","I didn't have high expectations for Looper. I hated the title, for one. The trailer didn't impress me either. But I really like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis and didn't know Jeff Daniels was in it too (and he was fantastic in this even though he wasn't in it much)and considering my mom was let down today because the rest of the family bailed out on going to the Titanic museum, why not take her to a movie? The movie centers on Joe (Levitt) who is a Looper who works for a crime organization where hit men brings their victims to a time machine, send them back in time, and then he would shoot them, incinerate the bodies so there are no traces of them, and then they are wiped clean of anyone ever finding out. That's a pretty cool concept. If one happens to get away, their in big trouble. Well his future self (Willis) gets away and Joe is being hunted down by Daniels and his men.<br/><br/>The sequence of events are fascinating. Apparently Willis has a backstory involving his dead wife and feels that if he finds the Rainmaker (who is creating loop holes) and kills him, he can save his wife from dying. So he has to go around and kill these kids that are linked to a number that supposedly means they were born on the same day and in the same hospital. Joe is trying to stop him, or himself, or whatever, and it becomes a pretty deep, involving film.<br/><br/>It is a little weird. I'm not a big future movie fanatic as very seldom am I ever won over by futuristic films (see In Time). The stuff involving this kid with super powers was very weird, and some romance scene out of nowhere was pretty weird too.<br/><br/>Despite that, the action was good and I enjoyed watching Gordon and Willis play off each other. I don't regret seeing this film but don't find myself rushing to buy it on DVD or Blu-Ray. If you like these actors, see it. It wasn't a boring movie, that's for sure."
"cattjones","9","6","25","28 September 2012"," Looper is a Winner
","I think that I am going to start out by saying that it is very difficult to surprise me at a film. They are usually very predictable. I have to say that this film got me (which I love). Director/Writer Rian Johnson did a very good job explaining what a Looper was right from the beginning. Just when I was asking myself ""what if"" questions in my head, they were being answered right there before me. If you go to this film expecting a lot of futuristic special effects, there aren't many, but the storyline did not suffer because of it. Although this film pretty much centers around regret and redemption, there are splashes of sacrifice and lost love. As expected there was a lot of retro-vision (my made up word), but they were very well placed. The transformation of Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) into his older self (Bruce Willis) was expertly demonstrated. I think that the casting of these two look-alike actors was brilliant. Abe (Jeff Daniels) was the futuristic mob boss and the controlling force behind the loopers. As seen in the trailer, Joe fails to eliminate his older self and the cat and mouse game begins. Abe is relentless in his pursuit of both versions of Joe. Sara (Emily Blunt) is a single mom just trying to survive and raise her son in a very hostile world. I would be remiss if I did not mention Cid (Pierce Gagnon). You find yourself really falling for this kid, even though there are many things transpiring with him. You really don't know the significance of Beatrix (Tracie Thoms), who is a waitress in a local diner, until the end of the film. This mind-bending science fiction film has the viewer wondering about all the possibilities that could have developed in the film. I think that I would put this film in the mystery category as well. Just when you think that you have it all figured out, you don't. Although at times this film did have a terminator feel to it, I was blown away by the end of the film. There were a lot of times that I said to myself, ""I didn't see that coming"". Even without stunning special effects, this film is definitely worth the price of a ticket. You will not regret it. I recommend that you close the loop and go and see this film. I give it a glaring green light."
"DICK STEEL","10","3","10","13 October 2012"," A Nutshell Review: Looper
","In Rian Johnson's vision of the future, time travel becomes a reality, but got immediately outlawed for all the damage it can cause, some of which we'd already know from many science fiction films. But that doesn't stop the mob from harnessing the technology to do its dirty work, especially when it needs to get rid of people without a trace. So those on the mob's hit list got shackled and sent back in time to the year 2014, where their looper employee gets to execute people from the future, and dispose of them. The bounty's some slabs of silver that come with their target, so that makes it quite a lucrative career, with Abe (Jeff Daniels) being the man from the future sent back to look after this hit squad operation.<br/><br/>But here's the catch. Should this contractual agreement need to be closed, the future self of the looper gets sent back, and executed. And before you'd think that's a loophole for trouble, it's actually brilliant, because it provides an insurance policy that doesn't exist in any other scenario, and the movie actually takes time to address this suspicion of a paradox. In fact, Johnson takes the time to work any space time continuum paradox to be in the story's favour, which allows one to watch the film at first go without getting all flustered about this inherent aspect of any time travel film, with a very nice touch put in about half hour into the story, where rules get set up, and the parameters drawn in which his universe is set to operate in.<br/><br/>This paradox involves someone from the future coming back, and that you'd recognize him/her for the first time as your future self. But for this moment in time to happen in the present, we're really dealing with two separate timelines which now converge. And the film presents all these timelines in a single narrative, nicely edited to allow its Chinese production partners some story telling time that dwells on Bruce Willis' Old Joe in future Shanghai, expanded for Old Joe to have a richer back story since Joe himself has a decent one for the present time, before both Joes converge. For the non-Chinese cut of the film, many of these aspects got unfortunately edited for pacing reasons, so I suppose picking up the DVD/Blu later is quite the no brainer.<br/><br/>When the Joes converge, it's really when the narrative shifts gear, with a lot more action since the story now goes off like when the cue ball opens a billiards game. Joe and Old Joe sit down to evaluate their options and to exchange none-too-pleasant pleasantries, with Joe needing to fulfill his end of the contract, but Old Joe adamant in not letting him so, at least not until he gets his revenge on the Rainmaker, which is a Terminator-ish plot line to get rid of an influential messiah like character who's now a child in the present time. To complicate matters, there are three possibles. <br/><br/>And while these are action based, it's the subtly treated character arcs on both Joes that made Looper more than just your average science fiction flick, ad gives it soul. There's no clear right or wrong here, only shades of grey, where Old Joe has to find it within himself to turn executioner for the greater good, and young Joe has to turn protector, since he's buckled himself with Emily Blunt's Sara, and her young kid Cid (Pierce Gagnon) to prevent his future self from eventually coming for them. And the best conflict presented, is if should Old Joe succeed in his mission, it's likely the future will change and he would forget about his deceased wife (Qing Xu), since the circumstances of their meeting will inevitably be changed. And this memory is something he fights so hard to want to keep alive.<br/><br/>It is these internal conflicts and battling with demons that make Looper the top notch entertainer, where ultimately any sacrifice to change the world, should begin with the steps one will take on one's end. The final third will definitely blow your mind as Johnson had kept a number of aces up his sleeve, to deliver sucker punch after sucker punch where it mattered for the final act. Visual effects wasn't out of this world nor never seen before, but were gelled excellently for the purpose of adding to the narrative, rather than for the sake of. Production values are solid, especially when used to present different timelines, or areas within the futuristic landscapes.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis still showed he's kind of kick-ass, and still had it within him to play action hero who ploughs through anyone who dare stand in his way, including his younger self. But the scene stealer is of course Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who through the help of prosthetics to make him facially resemble Willis in his younger days, really nailed it with the nuances and mannerisms that screams Bruce Willis. Emily Blunt was rather rote here, while Paul Dano had a small supporting role primarily used to explain Looper's parameters. Noah Segan's Kid Blue becomes one of the main villains in the film hell bent on proving himself to Abe, whose values are in contrast to the principles held by Joe. And lastly, Pierce Gagnon as the kid who could fit right in to any horror film that deals with demonic possession.<br/><br/>Don't miss out on what could possibly be the best science fiction film this year!"
"goldwriting","6","3","10","3 October 2012"," Let's agree to disagree (with myself)
","First thing, if you haven't seen Brick, stop reading this and go watch it. If you have seen Brick, stop reading this and go watch it again. Great, now that you're back, you're welcome and let's continue.<br/><br/>Looper is the third film from writer/director Rian Johnson, who blasted onto the indie filmmaking scene with the aforementioned Brick, creating an instant stir and a huge level of expectation for future projects. He followed it up with The Brothers Bloom, a quirky and more humorously emotional film than his debut. Four years later, we finally get the next volume in Johnson's catalog, and many of us have been waiting with baited breath.<br/><br/>Looper is a sci-fi time travel tale about an assassin in the not-too- distant future who kills people sent back to him from the slightly-more- distant future. This cold-blooded killer, Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is known as a Looper, and he knows one day the person sent back to die will be himself, thereby closing the loop. Yet when faced with the older version of Joe (Bruce Willis), the present-day version fails to get the job done and begins a harrowing chase to settle the score and figure out why the future version of him wants to live so badly.<br/><br/>The description is above is fully accurate, but it leaves out a huge plot point in the story because it's a spoiler. So if you don't want to know any more about the film, stop here and come back when you've seen it for yourself.<br/><br/>OK, now that you've been warned (SPOILERS AHEAD, second and last warning) here's the rest. Willis comes back hunting for a mythical mobster from the future called The Rainmaker, who in his time period is closing all the loops en masse. He is also partially responsible for killing Willis' future wife, something Willis is determined to fix in the past by finding and killing The Rainmaker as a child.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with Looper overall is both plot descriptions are true, but they could be entire movies on their own. Tied together into one script the balance between the two is shaky. For the first half of the movie it is nearly all about Levitt versus Willis in a game of cat and mouse, all while trying to avoid the present-day mafia who are trying to kill them both. Yet somewhere around the halfway mark, the movie slows down considerably while we dive into the deep end of the pool with the Rainmaker storyline, with added performances from Emily Blunt and Pierce Gagnon on a random stretch of farmland.<br/><br/>Script issues aside, there is always going to be a debate on the topic of time travel and how it plays out in the film. In this realm, Johnson tosses the logic and technology of it out the window with pleasant abandon, even having Willis yell out in a critical scene, ""It doesn't matter!"" For me it was a nice touch and should be heeded by future filmmakers who dare to use time travel as a plot device. Don't get bogged down in the details of how it works (because in the end, it doesn't).<br/><br/>The performances are also worth mentioning here with a special nod to the makeup department. Levitt underwent a truly amazing and subtle transformation into a younger version of Willis, and it definitely had an effect on not only how he played the character, but how the audience reacts to him. Levitt is reaching a level of star status that will soon overcome his on-screen characters because we will all know exactly who he is (currently known as the Tom Cruise effect), but with the slight manipulation of Levitt's face, it was almost hard to remember it was actually him on screen. He delivered the same quality and intensity we have become accustomed to, and that helps buoy the film during the slower portions. Also, Pierce Gagnon is incredibly intense for such a young kid. Keep an eye on him if they ever do another sequel to the Children of the Corn franchise. He'd be a shoe-in.<br/><br/>In an overall look back, there is a moral question that pervades the film and strains to link the two stories, but both weren't necessary to answer it and a strong choice as to what the film was really about would have simplified it and delivered a much stronger final product."
"kgprophet","6","3","10","1 October 2012"," Smart Script makes most of Time Travel Twist
","....Many minor spoilers throughout...<br/><br/>This seems to be one of those screenplays that was given time to explore the possibilities and push the extremes. I suppose going to these extremes is required to find any daylight out of the well worn clichés with Science Fiction, but does it really need to sacrifice young kids? Sure, there is shock value. Does it aid the story? It does in a way the Terminator movies do. A lot of ""fixing"" to make this click on all cylinders includes an obligatory Bruce Willis in Die Hard mode mowing down countless bad guys with nary a scratch. Then there's Emily Blunt, who must make out with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, just because that's why. But who knew walking into a crime time travel thriller (see Time Cop), they would find ""The Omen"". The child Pierce Gagnon has an intense look in his eyes that can really make you believe he has a harsh future ahead of him. He is well directed by Rian Johnson, and pulls off a good deal of dialogue that you actually enjoy listening to. One such scene is between Levitt (you know, 3rd Rock from the Sun) and the always likable Jeff Daniels. When each character settles in, it is a joy to watch them try and outwit each other. There are nice moments like that throughout the film. But there are also clunky moments, mostly scenes where things are pushed to the degree that you lose touch with the core of the film. There is the strange course of events that go on with Emily Blunt and her child that make their characters less believable, but by that time you're in the 3rd act anyway, and this film has no intentions on sequel-baiting.<br/><br/>""Looper"" will probably earn itself into my collection, with some slight hesitation, such as the clearly unfinished or just plain low budget effects. Especially the flying motorcycle, there are a couple shots that should have been left out of the final cut. But there you go, trying to push the Sci-Fi and the action to it's own detriment. Was the flying motorcycle essential to the story? No. Levitt seems to have gotten a little too comfortable with the generic leading man role. He plays it a little too tough and gruff. Thankfully, he is allowed a few moments of humanity. But not for Bruce Willis, the older version of Levitt. He has the thankless task of hunting down sweet little kids, not matter how sorry he is.<br/><br/>You should check out this original and well acted film, and forgive it's excesses."
"Jeremy_Urquhart","9","5","21","28 September 2012"," Definitely Recommended
","I feel somewhat overwhelmed when thinking back on this movie in order to share my thoughts on it, given I only got done watching it a couple of hours ago, and it's one of those films that really sticks in your head after you've walked out of the theater. <br/><br/>What I can say for sure, however, is that you should definitely give this film a watch. Also, I recommend you go into the movie knowing as little as possible about the plot. There are a number of twists and turns throughout the film, some small, and some pretty huge, and I have seen reviews that have given away some of these twists without adequate spoiler warnings, so tread very carefully when seeking reviews for this film. In fact, maybe just don't look at any reviews at all; the less you know the more you'll enjoy the film, and the more you'll be engaged by it. All you need to know going into the film is that it's very good.<br/><br/>There's nary a dull moment in it's nearly two hour long running time- the pacing's perfect, and its fairly complex narrative is perfectly and naturally described through its use of voice-overs and exposition(that doesn't specifically feel like forced, direct exposition). It's definitely the boldest American film I've seen all year, as this year has been plagued with flashy, admittedly entertaining franchise films and over-produced block-busters that are fun to watch but not usually particularly memorable. Looper is not one such film.<br/><br/>It's original, engaging, and goes places the vast majority of American films almost never dare to go. Definitely go watch this. <br/><br/>I'd give it 8.5/10."
"cinematic_randomness","8","5","21","27 September 2012"," And exciting, unique, mind bending and clever modern science fiction thriller.
","Okay so this is the hard part; explaining the mind bending plot for this film. Yet it's a plot that's actually quite easy to follow; strange right? <br/><br/>It's the year 2044. Time travel has not yet been invented but in thirty years time not only has it been invented but also its use outlawed. Except for sophisticated crime syndicates who secretly use the time travel to dispose of undesirables, by sending them back in time to 2044 for execution by specializes assassins called loopers. Now the phrase 'closing the loop' means when the older self of a looper is sent back to be killed but their present day self or younger self. There is an up and down side this, the looper receives a hefty pay day but must live with the knowledge that he only has thirty years left to live. This is what happens a highly regarded young looper named Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt); but he fails to kill his older self (Bruce Willis), which violates the one rule loopers are expected to obey, never let your target escape, even if that target is you. Now Joe is on the run from his criminal colleagues led by Jeff Daniels, older Joe wishes to change his future by eliminating a young boy who will one day become a powerful enemy. Younger Joe finds himself on a corn farm where a young woman named Sara (Emily Blunt) and her son Cid (Pierce Gagnon) live; Sara allows Joe to take refuge so he can decide his next move. I could go on and on believe me, but I think that's more than enough and I really must stop before I pull out the little hair I have left on my head.<br/><br/>Well first I'll say that this is a time travel movie done well. I was unable to find any real plot holes, I'm sure there are some but I was just to busy doing mental somersaults over the film's concept which is mind bending to say the least. Many have said this already and I do agree that its Terminator meets Inception, that's probably the best way to describe the film to someone in once short sentence if you're pressed for time. It's a very clever film that's extremely well written, it's really something very unique. And much more violent than I was originally expecting and it's really bloody. It adds to the film's tone which I sensed an overall bleakness about it. <br/><br/>The three main characters are very strong, especially older Joe who I found to be very interesting. You could say he's the villain but from his point of view the acts he commits are cases of justified evil. Our characters face some pretty unusual moral dilemmas. <br/><br/>Sating the obvious, Joseph Gordon-Levitt looks strangely different as a result of some impressive make-up work to I suppose make him resemble Bruce Willis, which he doesn't but you still believe they're the same person. Now is it me or is Emily Blunt almost too sexy? That part when she's out on her front porch pretending to smoke a cigarette; for me that was borderline torture, what an image!<br/><br/>Looper was fantastic, a truly exciting and unique modern science fiction thriller. This time travel stuff really does fry your brain. I loved that we were given a moment of classic Bruce Willis style action, it didn't really fit well with the film, it's actually a tad degrading but it was so much fun to watch. It's an excellent film.<br/><br/>For more reviews visit my blog: cinematicrandomness.blogspot.com.au"

","This is billed as Action/Crime/Sci-fi. I can accept the first two; the third is incorrect. This story is pure fantasy set to a time in the near future, 2044, where society is inhabited by loopers – hired killers sent back from 2074 to eliminate those sent back to the past – the period in which the story plays out.<br/><br/>If you can accept the idiocy of that premise, then by all means see it. If not, then I'd give this one a wide miss – despite the presence of Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the main roles of Old Joe and Joe, respectively. As I watched, I wondered again what some do for money.<br/><br/>The plot is filled with many of the usual violent scenes so prevalent in other crime dramas. Nothing new there. Much of the action is stylized, particularly the killing ground for each execution when s/he arrives, trussed up and ready to be killed. Special effects are okay, but nothing extraordinary. Editing is adequate for a fast-paced action movie. The acting is formulaic, all you'd expect from this genre.<br/><br/>The movie will, of course, appeal to those viewers who want to see something new, even though time travel stuff has been done too many times already in literature and movies. All that time travel provides is an opportunity to apply new twists to a stupid idea and sell it to viewers who don't bother about absurd paradoxes and impossible plots. Well, I guess for some, it's entertainment.<br/><br/>Last week, however, I saw Gamer (2009) which I also thought was a dumb story. After Loopers, though, I must say Gamer at least was, indeed, sci-fi and hence a better movie – although the sound track was way too loud.<br/><br/>I'll give Loopers four out of ten.

In the future, they have very high tech security and stuff, the police force per se are able to keep a very tight lid on criminals that kill and the like, or in other words it's nearly impossible to kill someone and not get caught. Well, somewhere along the timeline, the human race developed a time machine and criminals have confiscated one or two of them secretly.<br/><br/>These criminals send other unsuspecting criminals back in time to kill specific people that they currently want dead. The criminals from the future hire the loopers then the loopers are given a time and a place to be with a weapon to kill the guys that the criminals from the future want dead. They send these guys back and the loopers kill them. That's the basic synopsis of the story line but they very briefly make it aware to the audience while they are painting this synopsis of the storyline that some of the people have very weak telekinetic abilities. <br/><br/>Anyways, rumors of a ""main boss person"" start to spread as these criminals (loopers) are busy killing the people or targets they are assigned to kill. There is no mention at all that this boss person has some extremely powerful telekinetic overload powers from hell. This boss person is just mentioned as the one main boss criminal guy that apparently came out of nowhere but everyone in the movie understands who it is and what his purpose is but this is never explained well at all to the audience.<br/><br/>Anyways, this powerful boss they keep hearing rumors regarding is the actual person who is hiring and sending the loopers from the future back to do his (the evil boss guy's) dirty work. To add injury to insult this evil boss dude ends up having the loopers kill themselves at some point in the past thusly they came up with the clever title for the movie because they end up closing the loop leaving no trace back to this evil mysterious boss guy who originally hired the criminals to kill people in the past. <br/><br/>As enough rumors fly some of the loopers start realizing what is happening that they themselves are being led to become their own or each other's murderers. So a couple of the loopers who figure it all out before dying in the past take it upon themselves to go kill this main boss guy while he's just a kid when they're in the past.<br/><br/>While they search for him they find him and his mom but don't know it's him at first. After like 2-3 days they realize the mom's kid is the criminal boss dude from the future. So they try to kill the kid but then out of nowhere the kid starts using his unknown until that very moment, his overbearingly, ridiculously powerful telekinetic powers of beyond a superheroes wettest dreams abilities and pretty much decimated everything within like 20 miles. <br/><br/>The End. <br/><br/>And that's how the movie ends... kind of extremely retarded in my opinion. I should remind you the movie is not focused on any of the people's very weak telekinetic powers at all but you do occasionally see people doing things with their telekinetic crap but there is no mention of what, where, or why they have these random abilities either.<br/><br/>So the ending is extremely stupid because the viewer is far more concerned about the whole looper concept and the storyline behind it rather than this random telekinesis crap. If they are planning on using something that big as a movie ending than there needs to be way more information on its purpose and point in the storyline and nothing was ever explained about their telekinetic powers, to begin with. Extremely huge fail for an ending."
"brando647","8","2","6","5 March 2013"," An Incredibly Solid Action Film & Creative Bit of Sci-Fi
","I am an instant fan of new, creative science fiction when it comes along. We don't get it often but we've gotten a nice resurgence in recent years with Duncan Jones (MOON, SOURCE CODE) and Neill Blomkamp (DISTRICT 9). I haven't been lucky enough to catch any of writer/director Rian Johnson's previous movies but there was a lot of positive hype surrounding LOOPER. The trailers hadn't grabbed me and the premise, while interesting, seemed like it could go in a generic direction. But the widespread positive word-of-mouth dragged me in and I'm so glad it did. LOOPER is the latest in well-directed, thought-provoking science fiction. It's set in the year 2044 where most of civilized society is in shambles. Poverty and violence are commonplace, so it's no surprise that many people turn to crime. There is one segment of the criminal world worth notice: the loopers. Loopers are hired guns overseen by a minor mob boss from the future, a future where time travel was invented and instantly outlawed. Some of the larger criminal organizations use it to send their victims to a time where their body can be disposed of without issue. The loopers kill the target, dispose of the body, and collect the rewarduntil their loop is closed. Thirty years in the future, the retired loopers are sent back in time for elimination to remove any trace of their involvement. When Joe, a young looper, is put in the position to close his loop and fails, he becomes a target unless he can track down his older self and kill him.<br/><br/>I admit it sounds really confusing to have to try and explain it to someone. This really is one of those movies you just need to watch. Keep in mind, this is a movie about time travel and you can expect paradoxes or plot holes or whatever. It's going to happen, as it does with all of them (yes, even the classic BACK TO THE FUTURE). Just accept it. The time travel element is handled incredibly well and nitpicking is going to do nothing but ruin the experience for you. Even the elder Joe (Bruce Willis) is given a scene in which he basically says it outright: don't worry about the mechanics of it all. That's not where the story lies. The story is about young Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the elder Joe (Willis), and the strong woman they encounter on a rural Kansas farm with a little son who is more important to the future than she could ever imagine. That's what I liked most about the story. I walked in expecting a cat-and- mouse chase movie where Joseph Gordon-Levitt spends the entire time chasing down his future self and saving himself from the mob heavies on his trail. Instead, the movie quickly shifts gears when Bruce Willis arrives in the past and discover that his intention isn't just to avoid his own assassination but to change the course events in the future. It becomes so much more than a chase movie and I give it a lot of respect for that alone.<br/><br/>I also love that the majority of the effects in this movie were done practically. You wouldn't necessarily know it from looking at it. There was a lot added digitally into the background to improve on the cityscapes and all that, but a lot of the gunfights, TK (telekinetic) effects, and even the hovering motorbikes were all done practically. I love any movie that prefers practical over digital because it feels that much more real. Then there are the makeup effects. Gordon-Levitt was made up to look more like a thirty-year younger version of Bruce Willis and it really works. It's a little off-putting at first to see him with bright blue eyes, but it's crazy how much he was able to emulate Willis's nature and mannerisms. It's an easy sell to accept him as the same person minus thirty additional years of experience and suffering. Emily Blunt is in the movie as Sara, the strong independent mother of a special child. She does a commendable job in the movie, considering the only thing I've seen her in previously was THE FIVE-YEAR ENGAGEMENT and didn't give her much to work with. As an added bonus, we get Jeff Daniels as mob boss Abe. All of this comes together to create one of the most unique, exciting movies of the year. LOOPER is one that I hope everyone will check out at some point. It's great science fiction without the burden of exhausting tech details or geek culture. It's just an incredibly solid action film."
"Big_River","5","2","6","10 January 2013"," Average Movie
","It looks awesome in the trailer, doesn't it? Well, I'm afraid to say that it wasn't that awesome, unfortunately.<br/><br/>""Looper"", in a nutshell, is an adult version of ""Back to the Future"". Except in this movie, there's no Marty McFly and no great quotes that particularly stand out. Instead, we have the not so lovable, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who spends most of the movie trying to imitate Bruce Willis's facial expressions in order to make us, the audience, believe that he's the younger version of Bruce Willis. It wasn't convincing.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis wasn't that great, either. This movie is far from his best! If you're expecting to see a character like John McClane, you're going to be disappointed. In fact, the character he plays in this movie is nothing short of complete scumbag. You'll see why when you watch it. <br/><br/>Overall, it isn't a bad movie. The action is quite good and there's plenty of twists which keep it interesting. The script isn't exactly the best written script of all-time and the plot, at times, can be quite confusing. You're likely to encounter a lot of moments that will make you go ""huh?"".<br/><br/>Five out of ten."

","This film tries so hard to take itself seriously, to beat you over the head with its pleading ""please believe me, Im great and Im deep"", yet fails to deliver on either of those promises. Unbelievable that Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt and JGL all signed up to do this movie, then all put in such lackluster performances and all into such a poorly conceived and executed film. Just terrible. <br/><br/>As a fan of all 3 main stars of this movie, I just have to wonder how it could have all gone so wrong. I can only surmise that both as a director and a writer, Rian Johnson is pretty terrible at his craft. A look at his resume also reveals hes generally pretty inexperienced. How he was able to get someone to pay for this garbage and get three top notch actors to sign on is one for the books. <br/><br/>Please, producers, film studios etc., please stop the madness. Do not let this guy anywhere near a movie set ever again, except maybe as a gaffer or the like."
"nesfilmreviews","9","2","6","26 December 2012"," Prepare yourself for an adventure
","It's not every day you see a irresistible trailer and it surpasses your lofty expectations. A highly ambitious undertaking by director Rian Johnson who masterfully executes and delivers on all fronts. In the year 2044, the US economy collapses giving way to widespread organized crime. In 2074, time travel is invented but immediately prohibited. Because of advanced tracking systems in place, disposing of murder victims isn't possible, which in turn creates a ""new"" market and profession. Hence ""Looper."" Tilted camera angles, upside-down shots, super slow-motion; Johnson toys with experimental cinematography with formidable results. A fantastic time travel sci-fi thriller that is firmly character based, and not just solely relying on special effects or time travel. Rian's directing art house style is evident but it's also blended with some mainstream elements not seen much in previous films such as ""'Brick"". What flaws this film may possess can be easily absolved because the overall experience is extraordinary."

One is that two main clues (TK & looper/time travel) are NOT mixed at all; we can say most people understand time travel as well TK, but ""looper"" had too many holes, anyone is familiar with time travel can find so many conflicting; The second problem is even bigger - the leading role conflicts - if he will sell his best friend for his silver (more accurately， his 30 years life), how can he shoot himself to save the boy, who even he did not know several days ago? The whole story break down: It has several other roles - in fact it has too many characters, too much story, cannot what the directory what to express, and the whole story break into pieces.

"thesar-2","4","2","6","24 December 2012"," Next Week on Looper
","What horrible timing this movie had. Sure, even though it came out months before the Sandy Hook school shooting, it's still arriving on home video just weeks following the massacre.<br/><br/>Looper should have a warning, or at least, a tribute, if they keep with the December 31st release date. Spoiler: (and there might be a few more minor ones – fair warning,) there are scenes where a man hunts down to slaughter very young children. They even show a scene of a very young boy getting shot.<br/><br/>Sure, this was made months, perhaps a year, before the Connecticut shooting, but I believe it should be shelved for a bit longer.<br/><br/>I digress. My opinion of this 15-subplot film was that I was puzzled it wasn't actually another network 1-season failure on TV. It was amazing that they seemingly fit one Sci-Fi Action/Adventure Drama season of 24 episodes into 2 hours. Since they can do that, that gives me hope for a 24 movie, finally.<br/><br/>The movie was all over the place, since they, like I said, fit 2 dozen episodes into 2 hours. It starts off with one bland and clichéd future and speaks worse of another future. The plot holes are wide and before you get a chance to get hung up on those, it shifts to another movie. And another. And another.<br/><br/>Oh, and before you think: Well, at least we have our hero to attach onto throughout the multiples of ideas presented, think again. There's barely a character to latch onto. Everyone is an asshole and the only difference between the characters are levels of asshole'ness.<br/><br/>Let's see if I can come up with even a basic premise for this random movie: Young Joe shoots and kills future mob trash sent back in time because for some dumb reason, it's apparently harder to bury a body in the future than it is to travel through time.<br/><br/>Eventually every ""Looper"" must kill themselves, pending they lived long enough to see time travel invented. So, Joe knows he must kill old Joe, and despite what the misleading trailers of the film told us, he has no problem with this. He's just a bad shot, and old Joe gets away.<br/><br/>There. I gave you the first of about 14 more story lines to discover. That's the gist of what you'll really need to know. Well, that, and the blah (only in this performance, that I've seen) Joseph Gordon-Levitt either had a digitally re-mastered face to look like old Joe (Bruce Willis) or he's just damn good at squinting for weeks of shooting.<br/><br/>As mentioned, this might have worked as a one-two season Sci-Fi show on TV, and it might have been more interesting that way. We might have had more fleshed out characters that we would be more invested in. Perhaps, I wouldn't have thought they were all assholes, or actually believe them when they finally do the right thing.<br/><br/>Still, despite all I said, it kept my interest barely enough to complete the loop of the movie. It might be hard for those lost loved ones recently or still in shock of what happened on the East Coast, but other than that, it's a harmless, albeit below-average, flick."
"Rick_Terminal","7","2","6","14 October 2012"," Not as original as it claims (and not as smart as it thinks it is)
","As my summary suggests, this film thinks it is smarter than it is. There are obvious parallels with every time travel film out there. I could probably reference every blockbuster film from Timecop to Sixth Sense and draw up similarities. This film is nothing new (so stop believing the hype).<br/><br/>Like anything 'Hollywood' of *course* the plot is complete rubbish - so to flame this movie based on that, you'd have to state that you expect it to have scientific grounding - which is madness. Just sit down, and watch it for entertainment value alone.<br/><br/>But there is the problem. The ending (which I won't spoil) was inevitable. The 'laws of cliché' had already written how everything was due to end. There are no 'movie moments' that I personally took from this film, and at the end of a two hour buttock flattening I could only sum up in one word: ""Meh"".<br/><br/>Considering the work that clearly went in to the movie, I genuinely feel guilty about that! 6.7/10"

"achyutaghosh","9","2","6","13 October 2012"," Brilliant scifi crime thriller
","Disclaimer first- i am a sucker for time travel movies. Ever since Arnold Schwarzenegger's T101 strode on the screen from the distant future in 1984's The Terminator, the fascinating possibilities and impossibilities arising out of this technology has fueled billions of dollars worth sci-fi imagination. Part sci-fi and part gangster flick, Rian Johnson's Looper is easily the best original, non remake time- travel movie in decades- there i have said it.<br/><br/>Mostly set in Kansas with a bit of China and Europe thrown in, Looper takes place in two time streams- 2044 and 2074. Time travel has been discovered by 2074 but declared illegal- only the mob has access to it and they use it rather creatively to settle scores. It is very difficult to kill someone in 2074 due to body tagging etc so the mob effectively uses time travel to send their enemies 30 years in the past to be blasted to bits by the Loopers, a group of assassins working in the past for the future crime-lords. Complex? And after a certain point, the 2074 version of a Looper is sent to the 2044 version of himself to be executed. Thus closing the loop and retiring the assassin. More complex? Fear not, that is about it- if the effectiveness of any scifi movie is measured by its ability to take up a seemingly ludicrous idea and get the audience involved without questioning its logic, then Looper is well and truly a blast, just like the blunderbuss used by the Loopers.<br/><br/>Joe Simmons, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt is working as a looper dispatching enemies of his - leads the high life, has a stripper girlfriend and looking forward to his retirement in Paris. One fine day, he is faced with his own future self, played by the now ubiquitous Bruce Willis, as his target- he hesitates and sparks a chain of events that will determine his future existence in this world, along with ramifications for the crime syndicates in the future. Gordon Levitt has played the side character in numerous hits and he still may not have the charisma to carry a film on his own yet, but in Looper he takes on a far more challenging role- sheds his boyish charm to take up an action hero role. The amount of makeup they have put on him to make him look like a younger Bruce Willis makes him almost unrecognizable from his usual self. Speaking of Willis- no one, i repeat, no one in the industry still shoots off a gun with more malevolent joy than Bruce. He is super as a tortured assassin from the future, pining away for his murdered wife, willing to kill children to right his wrongs, and he still looks bad-ass enough to take down 20 man single-handedly, like 25 years ago in Die Hard. Emily Blunt as the mother of a child to whom there is more than meets the eye, and Jeff Daniels as the 2044 gang leader put in excellent performances too.<br/><br/>Director Rian Johnson deserves tons of accolades- he has made a stylish action movie, with creativity, originality and energy, and at the same time it is thought provoking, affecting. This movie is not about overpowering effects, though the ones that are there are pretty awesome- it is more about people, and he gets us to care for each of them, whether the telekinetic child Cid, or the unstable killer in Kid Blue. There are scenes of gruesome violence that appear poetically along with sequences that intentionally slow down the narrative for the audience to absorb the essence. There are shades of classics such as Terminator and Bladerunner along with Ron Howard's gangster epic, Road to Perdition, but all put together, Looper is one brilliant scifi crime drama thriller that is a must watch for scifi fans- 9/10"

","OK, Time travel films have holes in their plot. Did not see too many people complaining about the Terminator films (well, at least not 1 and 2!) Obviously time paradoxes cannot be logically thought through, that's why its called a paradox. But stop thinking paradox, think good film making. Who delved deeply into the logical inconsistencies of a fish speaking in Finding Nemo? Or the fantasy of ""UP"". What do you want really? You want to be entertained. Like a circus its not meant to be completely believable. I want a good plot, good acting, good script and good photography. Tell me what misses out in this film? I saw it again today, twice in one week. First time I have ever done this. Sit back and be enthralled."

","A looper is a killer for hire. 30 years in the future, time travel will be possible. Future mobsters, to get rid of someone will ship him to the past where a looper waits, shoots the person and disposes of the body.<br/><br/>One such looper is Joe. He's young but acts as if he's old and very experienced. He practices French, steals money from his bosses, is addicted to a drug called hope and has a relationship with a prostitute. Suddenly a new bad mobster in the future known as ""the rainmaker"" decides to ""close all the loops."" That's when a looper from the future is sent to the present to be killed by their younger self. This is happening to all his colleagues. And eventually to Joe as well, but Joe fails to kill his future self and now there are two Joes out there. And that's when things get interesting. First in mostly fast-forward we learn what happens to Joe in the future. He follows his boss's advice and goes to China where he meets a woman who makes him very happy. Suddenly loopers show up, kill the woman, and send him to the past to be killed.<br/><br/>Then we go back to the story of the two Joes. Future Joe has some information on the rainmaker and figures he can put and end to the closing of the loops by killing the rainmaker as a toddler. Young Joe is not interested in that project. He wants to get rid of old Joe.<br/><br/>Old Joe has the addresses of three possible rainmaker children and has to eliminate them all. Young Joe knows one of the addresses and waits there. It's a farm were the mom is very overprotective of the boy. Joe and the mom will get closer and he will learn to like them both. What will he do when old Joe shows up? Looper works with a familiar idea in a very original way. Rather than avoid the time travel paradox and its circularity it jumps right into it and makes it the main theme of the movie. On a first glance, the logic seems to work just fine. The key moment is when the lives of both Joes intersect and separate. The movie is also quite funny- there is a lot of physical humor. The action is good even remarkable as when the rainmaker gets angry and starts controlling the environment with his mind. That's because in 30 years from now there are mutants with telekinesis out there. The scenes surrounding the rainmaker in particular are exciting. Unfortunately we know his identity before the movie gets there. That aspect could have been handled better. It should really have been told from the perspective of old Joe and his tracking down of the the three kids. Another problem with this movie is that it tries to inject an emotional tone into the movie that is not suited and doesn't even belong there. For the most part of the movie, it doesn't try to present young Joe as likable or as ethical or as the good guy. On the contrary it's old Joe who is far more likable. But by the end we're supposed to feel more for young Joe. On the other hand, a little bit of romance between the farm lady and Joe is handled very well.<br/><br/>Looper is a fresh, original, and exciting movie. At 2 hours it's at least 15 minutes too long. It does have a lot to tell but at times it should have focused on other things. It could easily have been a 10 with some better editing."
"dario_malic","8","2","6","10 October 2012"," To be, or not to be, that is the question
","""Looper"" is a new action Sci-Fi getting overwhelmingly positive reviews and comments and even named movie of the year by some, which is pretty unusual for a movie of that genre. Written and directed by Rian Johnson, it tells of a world where time-travel was invented and immediately prohibited but is still used by criminal organisations. When they need to get rid of someone they send him 30 years in the past when an assassin kills him. Those assassins are called loopers and we follow the story of one of them, a guy called Joe. Joe is the youngest looper but he does his job without mistake. That is, until he has to kill his older self. You see, in the future they started hunting old loopers and sending them back to their younger selves with a big payment. That is called ""closing the loop"" and essentially means early retirement. So Joe finds himself closing his loop but things go amiss and older Joe escapes. The criminal organization led by a man from the future named Abe immediately starts searching for Joe, Joe searches for his older self, and older Joe searches for the Rainmaker, a mysterious figure who rules by iron fist in the future and gave away an order to kill all loopers, but is just a little child in 2042.<br/><br/>The movie is deemed as very original and is applauded for it, and while parts of the script have a refreshing originality, the concept of time-travel and the ideas of facing your older/younger self and changing the future by intervening in the past are nothing new. Some of them (and some other as well) are explored in last year's another critical favourite, ""Source Code"" (be sure to see it if you haven't already) which came to my mind while watching ""Looper"". Both are uncommonly complex and smart Sci-Fi movies and they share some themes, but they have a crucial difference. While ""Source Code"" is a Sci-Fi only because of its unusual idea of inserting thoughts and personality of one person into the body of another (who is by the way in past, so time-travel plays a role here too), ""Looper"" is a true genre movie. Johnson creates a believable futuristic world enriched with small details like hovering bikes, telekinesis and (inevitably) a new drug consumed as eye-drops and makes us want to see more of it. It's really a shame we don't but the movie aims for much more and there has to be room for everything.<br/><br/>The main concern of ""Looper"" are moral and philosophical issues. It asks questions like: ""Can killing innocents be justified by what could happen in the future?"", ""What are we willing/allowed to do to save ourselves?"", ""Is our future predetermined?"", ""Can we change it?"", ""What is our life worth?"", and many more. And it's a great achievement that it succeeds in making those questions relevant while simultaneously offering a great dose of action, somewhat clichéd love story and a whole lot of time-travel issues. Those issues are being discussed in detail all over the Internet but, while entertaining and interesting as a conversation theme, shouldn't be put in the foreground because they easily let you forget about all aforementioned great things in this movie.<br/><br/>The movie has a very well written screenplay and benefits from an inspired direction, which wouldn't be enough had it not a great cast too. Bruce Willis, and especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a great job portraying the same character. Gordon-Levitt wears prosthetics which help him look like young Willis (although he looks kind of awkward occasionally) but most of the job is done by him. The facial expressions, gestures and tone of voice are first-rate and young actor once again shows his huge range. There are some less captivating performances like those of Emily Blunt and Paul Dano, but there are also memorable, although short, appearances by, always great, Jeff Daniels and Garret Dillahunt, which give the movie even more appeal. Talking about appeal, Steve Yedlin's cinematography is fantastic. The movie is full of beautiful wide shots and striking close-ups and really demands seeing in a movie theater for full effect. An important contribution to the overall atmosphere is one of the best Sci-Fi soundtracks in years, done by Nathan Johnson, Rian's cousin and frequent collaborator (and partner in folk duo ""The Preserves"", but that's some other story). It makes a great job emphasizing all the emotional moments and injects additional suspense in the action sequences.<br/><br/>So I've written a lot and said only a small part of what's on my mind. That's the sign I should stop or else I'll never finish. ""Looper"" is above all else food for thought, and as that it deserves all the attention it got. Add to that its genre basis and you'll realize what we have here is a very likely future cult movie to be talked about for the years to come. Don't know about you, but I will definitely loop back to the beginning of it the first chance I get.<br/><br/>More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/"

When my organization from the future wants someone to die, they zap them back to me and I eliminate the target from the future. The only rule is: never let your target escape... even if your target is you."" With Joe focused on finishing the task at hand, older Joe follows a path of destruction as he sets on seeking the ""Rainmaker"", a future figure involved in closing all the Loopers. The concept is blended between a general mix of future scenes and future flashbacks if you like, painting a picture of Old Joe's life from crime to love. Destined to make his future current, Old Joe is hell bent on changing any off direction of his younger self, even if it means the introduction of Sarah (Emily Blunt), who finds herself caught up in a convenient piece to a time traveling puzzle.<br/><br/>Looper begins at great pace, offering a classic ingredient of Science fiction, a genre we have recently come to forget. It is obvious to see the comparison of movies such as The Matrix, but it should take pride with enhancing its own premise. Of course, time travel has been done before but not like this. Looper took this concept and kept in focus, without managing to run away with it, keeping any possible exaggeration in tact.<br/><br/>The on screen chemistry between Willis and Levitt is delightful as it is when they both sit across from each other for the first time you realise the hype surrounding Joseph's Die-hard resemblance. However, the interactions between Joe and Sarah shined nicely as it took aim in slowing down the movie, focusing on what is a potential romance that intervenes in what feels like an appropriate time.<br/><br/>The movie offers a thriller of intelligence, creating some what a less confusing direction towards what many people believe time travel to be quite mindless; Example, Inception, Donnie Darko, both fantastic films in their own way, although it still takes me some time to get to grips of the apparent aim of those movies. Inception was known for it's mind boggling asset, leaving Nolan to let the viewer decide. So on that note, Let's just say you can enjoy Looper without any long-term debates.<br/><br/>Is it what the critics say; 2012's Matrix? No, I believe Inception was 2010's Matrix, and you can't have a film every year relating to the same film can we? Director Rian Johnson made this movie his own, like nobody else, just like when Nolan got a hold of Inception. Not many Directors/Writers succeed in creating a time travel concept following the success of previous creations, however Rian has put together something original, with a not-so original cast, and made what could be my film of the year thus far.<br/><br/>Overall; Not only do the performances from Levitt and Willis make this enjoyable, the all round dark and twisted concept rates this as one of the best sci-fi thrillers of the last 10 years! It rocked! <br/><br/>Did you enjoy this review? visit my blog where you will find a plethora of reviews based on the latest movies. Google; Gerry's reviews for those curious"
"JABstract","9","2","6","9 October 2012"," Great Movie (But don't take it too seriously)
","I watched this movie with high expectations. I didn't get the action movie I anticipated from the previews, but I was pleasantly surprised just the same. <br/><br/>The plot was new and interesting and the acting was superb all around. I really enjoyed that this wasn't a good guy/bad guy flick. The leading characters all had mixed pasts, presents, and/or futures and the lines between right and wrong were blurred. I found the manner in which changes to the past affected the future, from a mental perspective more than physical, to be an interesting take on possible effects of time travel.<br/><br/>Other reviews I read have indicated that some were disappointed with so called illogical time travel scenarios. To be honest, I find that a tad silly as time travel a) doesn't exist (yet) and b) can lead to paradoxical events which can't possibly have a logical outcome.<br/><br/>In the film many subjects are intentionally brushed aside or ignored, such as discussions regarding time travel logistics and detailed information about why exactly the future poses certain limitations. I actually found this intentional and vocalized avoidance helpful. It told me things were the way they were for a reason and I should trust the movie and focus on the plot points being driven without getting caught up in the technicalities.<br/><br/>That said, the secret to getting the most out of this movie is to not take it too seriously. Just remember this is science 'fiction' and not science. Enjoy the ride."

","""Looper"" is one of the many films to include time travel in its premise, but it adds a very unique twist that is worth a recommendation. The film is set in the future where time travel has been invented but quickly outlawed. The mob uses this a way to completely kill off anyone they want to by using loopers: hit-man in the past who wait for a target to pop up out of thin air and then kill them. The time travel material is very well thought up. They have just about all of the questions covered. Plus it is also nice to see a movie set in the not so distant future that doesn't depict that everyone will be driving flying cars or have robots all over the place. The main story is about what would happen if the person you had to kill was your future self. It is a very neat concept, and for most of the movie it works.<br/><br/>Great idea, great acting, and the over all plot was pretty darn good, but I just can't give this movie my full blessing of being great. I guess it just leaves you wanting more closure at the end of the movie. Grant it, not all movies need to end with everything resolved or explained, but I really think they could have done a little better with this one due to how well the rest of the movie was put together. Bruce Willis, although not the main star in this film, really does a great job staying true to what he does best, delivering in the action side of the movie. He was a great casting for this movie, which possible could have something to do with the fact this is not his first movie traveling back in time to meet his former self (The Kid, 2000). . ""Looper"" has to be celebrated for its originality. But towards the later half of the film, it starts to slow down almost too much. The always beautiful Emily Blunt does well with her role, but there's only so much she can do. I have to say that I was quite surprised how the film ended up being. The ending will certainly raise questions with just how good the movie was, which is sad because there really are a lot of great things about it. Being a Bruce Willis fan, it was nice to see him in the macho action hero role, but I felt like there wasn't enough of it. Joseph Gordan-Levitt, who's been a rising star as of late, really gives another great performance in his first big leading role. The film makers really did a great job making him look like Bruce Willis, which really helped make everything flow well. With an open and mind and not to big of expectations I would absolutely recommend seeing this film, but if you don't catch it in the theaters your not missing too much.<br/><br/>Check out more of our reviews at www.clutchandmikemovies.blogspot.com"
"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","8","2","6","6 October 2012"," Technical perfection
","A mixture of great ideas from the past combined with amazing camera work and acting gives us quite a nice ride, but only if we watch the movie as a big picture. The minute we start to dissect it, and analyze the pieces, it falls apart. That is Loopers greatest fail. So here we go:<br/><br/>1) The story. There is nothing what-so-ever original about this movie. The idea of time traveling is, and always was an interesting subject. Many great movies were based on the subject (The terminator, Timecop, Dejavu etc.) Using the idea is nothing bad, but using the same plot is. I was almost convinced this movie could get a lawsuit for plagiarism. The ending is the only thing saving it from a potential lawsuit. And mind that the ending is superb and the only original aspect of the film! There is also a problem with understanding how the main plot actually begins because the more you think about it, the more incomprehensible it becomes (this is not a smart movie like Inception). Maybe for someone who hasn't seen specific movies (or a lot of movies) before this one, would be amazed with it, but I am not. As I said, the ending saves the movie, it is original and unexpected. So basically, using already existing elements, combining them and making an original ending is how the story functions.<br/><br/>2) The actors. Willis and Levitt are a good. Blunt was a surprise with the accent and performance, leaving her, so far, known roles. She gave by far the best performance in the movie. Her lost and afraid character was beautifully portrayed. Her sexuality was dripping from the screen. I would like to see her in more roles like this. Willis was supposed to give an action element to the movie, and he did - in one scene. He is the only one that actually understood his character's essence in total and acted just as he should have (prooving he is still Hollywood's biggest stars and one of the biggest actors today). But, a John McClane style is not to be expected here. An unorthodox role for Willis, but very nicely done. Levitt is good, but not as good as he can be (just remember The dark knight rises or 3rd rock from the sun). His character was supposed to be more freaked out, violent, ruthless. Was he a believable younger version of Willis? Not really. All in all, really good acting.<br/><br/>3) Everything else. There is absolutely nothing I can say or find that is wrong on the technical side of the film (and I tried). The camera is Oscar worthy, the shots were ingenious, and angles breathtaking. The director did an amazing job watching how to reveal specific elements to the audience never fully telling us everything but actually telling us more than he should have (a masterpiece in directing). The music that breaks nerves, and understands every scene in it's core. A fusion that is just unbelievable.<br/><br/>Is this movie good? Yes. Could it have been better? I don't believe so. It's dark, difficult at times, disturbing. Don't expect a classic Willis knock-out. Don't believe the trailer and make no assumptions. In order to fully enjoy the film forget everything you have seen before and try not to spot the elements from other movies. If you succeed in that it will be a hell of a ride. Personally, I didn't like it much, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. Be ready for everything that you didn't expect. 8/10"

"thefilmdiscussion","9","4","17","1 October 2012"," ""Looper"" is the best time travel movie of all time
","Wow. After picking your jaw up off the ground, you'll have plenty of thinking and discussing to do when you see the best serious time travel movie ever made: Rian Johnson's ""Looper"". ""Looper"" sets the bar high early on with a breakneck pace and infectiously energetic atmosphere that pervades the entire film, as Jospeph Gordon-Levitt's character, Joe, violently kills a body that randomly appears in front of him in a desolate cornfield. Huh? Turns out it's his job. In the future, time travel exists, of course. But so dangerous is it that it is outlawed, meaning of course that only the bad guys use it. They set up an ingenious system where men are sent back 30 years in time to be killed and disposed of, a method so clean because the person doesn't even technically exist when they appear in the past to be blasted away and burned. The targets come with a hefty vest full of silver bricks, the pay-day for the killers, who are known as Loopers. Confused yet? Joe lives a cushy life, staying expensively drugged-up and sexed-up when he's not working, but a mistake by a fellow Looper throws a wrench in everything. The other Looper (Paul Dano) let his target go. Why? Because it was his future self, a pre-determined end for every Looper known as ""closing the loop"", so there are no messy ends. The bodies on these jobs are loaded with gold bricks, a step-up for killing yourself. Dano's Looper tells Joe that his future self warned of a man known as the Rainmaker who was closing loops with reckless abandon. With this new knowledge, Joe is faced with killing himself, and in a bizarre series of events that would take more than a book to explain, ends up in a race against time to stop his older self (Bruce Willis) from doing some very bad things. What's ingenious about the script is its ability to make us root for both versions of Joe, and yet pray that they are both stopped as well. The subtle make-up job for JGL is Oscar quality stuff, as are the special effects. The world that Johnson has created is simply stunning, and feels so realistic that we are immediately pulled into the mind-boggling loop of time travel without looking back. The actors are solid, and the action is fantastic. I have never seen a more flawlessly scripted movie about the paradoxes of time travel. This film is as clean and precise as a Looper's kill, and as exciting, original and ingeniously action-packed as anything else you'll see this year.<br/><br/>-Thomas Bond, TheFilmDiscussion"
"aharmas","10","4","17","30 September 2012"," Imagination is NOT dead!!!
","The premise for this movie was exciting from the previews, but it gives away almost nothing of what goes on in this very exciting and original Science Fiction piece. Gordon Lewitt, who seems to be in just about every other film this year, most of them being quite good, is back, playing a very interesting role. This one combines physical action and great acting.<br/><br/>Lewitt is a looper, a hired killer who is set to eliminate targets as they are sent back from the future. In order to ""retire"", he must retire a very special target. The film picks up when this special target escapes him, setting off a series of dangerous events. For the rest of the film, Lewitt chases Willis. Soon the tables turn, and another target pops in the radar.<br/><br/>This target, beautifully played by Pierce Gagnon is bound to send shivers down the audience's collective spine, and this is where the film really shines. As an ensemble, Lewitt, Blunt, Gagnon, and Willis do the kind of work rarely seen in a Science Fiction film. The last third of the film is where the movie hits some amazing highs: the story has quite a few unexpected turns, there are some jaw dropping special effects, and all culminates in a very emotional ending.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what the budget for this film is, but creativity abounds, and there is a bit of a retro touch accentuating the ""cool"" feel of the piece. Gilliam would be more than pleased. This is a film that works because it doesn't pressure into liking it. It earns our awe and respect."

"CinematicInceptions","8","1","2","20 December 2017"," Above Average Sci-fi.
","This wasn't an especially smart or interesting or cool or scientific sci-fi movie, but I enjoyed it decently and liked how it stayed true to itself. Rian Johnson tried to make a good movie here, but he acknowledges that it isn't a superlative movie. I like that he didn't feel the need to make it appeal to audiences too much. There were things that I didn't like about it as I was watching it, but that I think made the movie better. I found that none of the characters were that likeable, but that wasn't such a bad thing because it allowed the dilemma of the plot to take precedence instead of telling us which character to side with. I also was glad that there was not that much money spent on production design and the like in an effort to make the movie look too futuristic. All the trucks in the movie were obviously just the same as the ones on the road today, which I thought was good because there are so many futuristic movies that spend so much time and effort on making futuristic stuff that really doesn't contribute to the story. <br/><br/>The premise of the movie is really good both in terms of the style of time travel and the complications that it precipitates. I personally doubt that time travel will ever be possible, but I think that if it were to exist in the world it would indeed be outlawed and that the way it was used here would be a fairly believable way that people would try to use it. It was also interesting how the old Joe was able to have shades of memories that resulted from the stuff happening in Joe's present.<br/><br/>Looking at it after the fact, I'm realizing that it is a very plot-driven movie, which I would normally expect to be a mark of a bad movie but that is not the case. The plot and its conclusion really give substance to the theme and characters in the movie. Throughout the movie, Joe is realizing that he is in way over his head and that his actions have a much larger impact now than they have to this point. At the end of the movie, he finally realizes that the situation he is in is bigger than just him and decides to ""take one for the team"" so to speak. <br/><br/>There are certainly imperfections to it. You can poke holes in the time travel rules and such. There are points where it drags and a few things that annoyed me about it. But on the whole I find it to be pretty good. It definitely makes me more interested in seeing what a Rian Johnson Star Wars movie will turn out tomorrow. It probably won't top your lists, but I would definitely recommend watching it if you're at all a fan of sci-fi or time travel. Overall Rating: 7.7/10."
"huggibear","7","1","2","22 May 2017"," Time Travel anyone? Imagination is wonderful!
","Great movie! It took me about a week to watch this, piece by piece and I finally got through it. I liked the concept because if we could time travel, we might alter the manners in which we conduct our personal affairs. I wonder what a peak into the future would look like because I rarely understand what I'm doing to control and manage it very well. I don't even know if I'm giving myself a fighting chance here in the unknown world that has gone crazy. But I digress, let's get back to the time travel thing and the movie. Yes, he time travels. Yes, he has encounters with his future self. Yes, he realizes that paths can be altered. And yes, he makes a better decision based on this knowing. Now isn't that an imagination? A resounding YES!! If my mind could time travel, I would return to a period when I was a baby and cause my own death instead of having to deal with this kind of place, these kinds of people who are heartless and those who have cause some to become heartless and be in a 'world with who knows what kinds of messes have been made here and figure out why is it my responsibility' to fix this place, correcting things and trying to get things to go more my way? How I can relate to this kind of imagination when time travel might be so much more necessary as an imagination, not merely for the self expansion and creativity and the material things, but more about family morals/values and how we rear our children today. I don't know how this is altering because I don't know exactly what we did to mess it up and cause all kinds of emotional instabilities. It is an emotional journey, I get that. Some of us suppress emotions and some of us express emotions. Some of us don't want any part of the emotions. Where does that put me in the middle of all this mess? I actually like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but I l like him more in his less serious roles. He's a great actor, don't get me wrong, but I prefer him in more emotionally touching movies. Dream on time travelers! It is YOUR journey! See how you can envision your future self right now! Go ahead! Enjoy this movie, I did."
"masonmorgan-92917","8","1","2","2 May 2017"," Brilliantly entertaining and original
","Rian Johnson's Looper is one of the most stylish, smart and entertaining sci-fi films of recent memory. An interesting dynamic between Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon- Levitt also work in part to make the film darkly comic at times, while never forgetting the rather serious tone and high stakes. <br/><br/>The cinematography is simply spectacular. Long one-take shots right in the action add gripping layers of tension, as well as look pretty damn good. Technically, the film is razor-sharp, with excellent use of colours, brilliant camera work and a realistically gritty dystopian setting, giving the film a Children of Men kind of feel. The action is electrifying and spaced perfectly, giving time to develop story and characters between explosive spurts of endlessly satisfying action. <br/><br/>The story is very original and thought-provoking, but also provides my only issue with the film. The inclusion of telekinesis just felt like a gimmick to explain the film's rather quick ending. Looper's plot hinges on a cheap and unexplained gimmick that makes the film's otherwise heartfelt ending feel rushed and somewhat fixed. <br/><br/>Overall, Looper is one of the most electrifying, entertaining and clever sci-fi films of the 2010s. The story was well written and easy to follow, despite the prominence of time travel. The result is a truly impressive and riveting experience, even if the ending is, sadly, about as satisfying as Levitt's make-up job"

","Saw this movie for the first time over the weekend. I came to IMDb to see what other people thought, and was surprised to see the 7.4 average user rating -- this movie is not that good! Movie bounces around between subplots, and never sufficiently resolves any of them. The primary subplot is about a mob hit-man, rubbing out people sent back in time by the Future Mob - in other words, a crime/mob movie with a time-travel twist; but the movie takes a detour with the subplot about the hit-man becoming emotionally involved with a woman and her telekinetic kid. Also mixed in there is a 3rd subplot about the future version of the hit-man (Bruce Willis) trying to hold on to his memories from the future, as every thing the present hit-man does becomes part of his current memory (overwriting his old memories). I thought the 3rd subplot was the most interesting, and had the most potential to mindf*ck the audience... but after a scene with Bruce Willis sleeping in a gutter, trying desperately to remember how he met his wife... the subplot is completely forgotten, you never see it again.<br/><br/>All in all, a very disappointing movie for me. Bruce Willis is in a much similar, but vastly superior, time-travel movie called ""Twelve Monkeys"", go see that instead."

What I thought was the most enjoyable part of the movie was the fact the movie has established its own universe. When I originally saw trailers for this movie I assumed it was happening in 2012, when in fact it takes place in 2044. This allowed them to go past the the ""norm"" and do whatever they wanted. The movie was beautifully shot and the cast was fantastic. Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in my opinion were amazing on screen together. The main problems I had with this movies came from some of the logic of time travel. I felt that there were some plot wholes that occurred within the time traveling parts and logic of the movie. However seeing as how most movie involving time travel tend to get plot hole filled and confusing it is best just to leave it alone and not worry about it. (SPOILER AHEAD) Only other bothering part was how Emily Blunt's character decided to out of no where make love to Joseph Gordon Levitt's character. It felt forced and unnecessary. (END SPOILER) Overall I thought this movie was great and it is a movie worth watching."
"maplelaneeli","7","1","2","4 February 2017"," Great concept makes up for flaws
","Looper is a 2012 science fiction thriller, written and directed by Rian Johnson. This film revolves around the idea of contract killers using time travel. In the year 2044, criminals called ""loopers"" are paid to kill people sent to them by the mafia through time travel. Despite time travel being highly illegal in the year 2074, sending victims back 30 years to be killed and disposed of is the most efficient way to kill without leaving a trace. Even with significant plot issues, the film was well scripted and presented, making it overall a reasonably entertaining movie rather than the disaster it could have been.<br/><br/>One of the main characters Joe, portrayed by both Joseph Gordon- Levitt (present day Joe) and Bruce Willis (future Joe) is one of these loopers. Eventually, the day dreaded by every looper comes around. Joe is tasked with killing his future self. However, when present Joe fails to ""close the loop"" and future Joe escapes, the movie takes off.<br/><br/>The whole idea of time traveling killings, is quite unique and intriguing. Unfortunately, the plot left a lot to be desired. As one could expect in any futuristic sci-fi movie, there were several plot holes. For example, little effort was put into explaining how time travel worked. When it came up during a conversation between old and young Joe, it was quickly shot down as future Joe yelled ""It doesn't matter!"" There were also questions as to why the victims were not killed before being sent back in time. It would seem to be much more efficient and prevent any risk of escape (cough, cough). Another questionable situation is why the looper must be the one to kill himself. Again, an unnecessary risk this so called smart and superior mafia is taking, as any looper will be hesitant to kill his future self.<br/><br/>One more criticism that must be addressed is how the focus completely changes in the middle of the movie. To begin, the film centers on old Joe trying to escape young Joe. Without conclusion to that conflict, a child who supposedly grows into an evil, supernatural leader, spontaneously becomes the new objective for both young and old Joe. The writers failed to properly transition into this new story, leaving the audience in disarray.<br/><br/>Despite these gaping issues, the rest film was put together well. The other main actors Emily Blunt, Jeff Daniels, Noah Segan, and especially the young Pierce Gagnon, all seemed very comfortable and in- touch with their characters. Emily Blunt as Sara looked very natural playing the ""tough girl"" and speaking in an American accent. Pierce Gagnon who played the 10 year old Cid, also exceeded expectations with stellar lines and physique, acting well above his actual age. <br/><br/>Again, anybody can find flaws with a movie based on time traveling contract killers, but the originality, acting, and even some well-done special effects boost this movie above the mediocrity hump. Overall, a movie you'd enjoy watching once, but wouldn't order on Blu- ray."

","This is a fun movie, with good acting, an intriguing plot, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's a complex story, involving a few different ideas, but it's easy to follow if you're paying even a basic amount of attention. There is action, but that's not the main purpose of the movie, so don't be disappointed when it's not non-stop shooting. It's thought provoking, it makes you think about the details and ""reality"" of time travel, genetics, and future societies. It realistically portrays what that would really feel like yourself. They covered a lot of the more in-depth and personal aspects to time travel. In many ways it's an exploration of the expression ""If I could give advice to my younger self..."" in the sense that we see just how much difference time can affect a person. Our older selves are different people than our younger selves in many ways. <br/><br/>This is a movie involving time travel. Time travel is not real. The people who seem to be giving negative reviews on this movie need to remember that. Therefore, there isn't really a ""right"" way to portray it. It's impossible to do this sort of movie, involving these sci-fi aspects, without at least some minor plot holes. You have to suspend disbelief a little bit.<br/><br/>And any plot holes or odd plot twists are only on the sci-fi details, not on the overall storyline, where it counts. If you were to make a totally realistic and accurate portrayal of time travel or other sci-fi phenomenons with absolutely no plot holes, it wouldn't be a good story: because those things don't exist. <br/><br/>So just relax, and enjoy a thought-provoking and fun sci-fi movie."

It has one of the worst use of time travel I've ever had the displeasure to see.<br/><br/>The basis of the story is so weak it's a wonder it was produced.<br/><br/>_ Time travel exists (okay, go on ...).<br/><br/>_ It's forbidden (rightly so, probably by international treaty).<br/><br/>_ But ""cheap"" enough that mobs can use it. After all it takes only what looks like a bit of junk amassed in a roughly 3 meters wide empty ball. (What are the power requirements ? More or less than a fridge ? What about a microwave ? Is it ""green"" ? This makes absolutely no sense.)<br/><br/>_ It seems you cannot kill in the future (development please ? This is pretty shaky as it is.)<br/><br/>_ Mobs are instead using an incredibly convoluted way of getting rid of people (Because ? They are law-abiding citizen ?)<br/><br/>_ The movie shows that the machine allows travel through space as well (as it should be actually, given that Earth moves through space at roughly 30Km/s) but dropping bodies in the emptiness of said space does not seem to cross the mind of these mob geniuses. Volcano, bottom of the sea, the kernel of the Earth, into the Sun ... seem to be out of question also.<br/><br/>_ Time travel being illegal if a ""looper"" still lives when time travel is invented he must be sent back to be killed (Why ? It is clear ""loopers"" are not time travelers. They are ""only"" assassins garbage nobody should give a damn for. They don't break any time-line until they are sent back to be killed. Is there a rationale behind this ? LSD much ?)<br/><br/>Also, the characters have a really ""weird"" behavior, especially in the way they relate to each other. It feels a lot like if they were all raised somewhere in Asia (Japan or Korea, not China). The most obvious ones being the ""boss"" of the ""loopers"" and the ""kid"" man that wants praises from him. If you watched a lot of movies from these countries you probably understand exactly what I mean.<br/><br/>Writers unable to keep a coherent line through their story should avoid working in science fiction (if at all). I'll be certain to remember ""Rian Johnson"" in order to avoid such ordeals in the future. And I just saw that he was doing the next Star Wars. Good : it hardly can go worse than ""Awakens"" (for a Star Wars movie I mean, not for a ""zap zap"" ""boom boom"" ""emo cry"" pop-corn selling show.)<br/><br/>You have been warned."

","I hate reading reviews of time travel movies where pseudo- intellectuals think that they are all of a sudden quantum physicists because they've found a paradoxical plot hole. It's one of the reasons why I've never tried to review any of the Back to the Future movies. There are such problems in Looper, and Willis himself tries to brush them off by telling us not to think about it. However obvious these logic problems are it still makes you think more than the average action fare, which I why I am giving it higher score.<br/><br/>In a future that is so heavily surveilled the only way to kill someone is to send them back into the past and have them taken out by a hit- man. A hit-man who will eventually take out his own future self one day, thus closing the ""loop"". Joseph Gordon-Levitt (an actor I am not really keen on at all) is one of such hit men. When faced with his old self (Bruce Willis, actually making an effort for a change) he is outwitted and vows to hunt down the old man before his mob bosses lose faith in him.<br/><br/>But there's a twist. The dark future is ruled by robots and old Willis is here to take out Sarah Connor, or something like it. This secondary plot line doesn't completely fit with the premise but director Rian Johnson just about makes it work as long as you don't have any ridiculous expectations. The atmosphere and cinematography are very nice and the Louisiana locations make for a refreshing change from New York or California. There's not much else to bring you back to it though, but I appreciate the film for what it is and for the quieter approach to the material which would otherwise be a loudmouth disaster in lesser hands.<br/><br/>Only hardcore Caddyshack fans will understand my review title."
"oOoBarracuda","6","1","2","20 January 2016"," Looper
","About midway through these genre months, I find myself itching for a little bit of more of a variety with the movies I'm watching. Luckily, Looper was just different enough for me to avoid the mid- month genre fatigue. Director Rian Johnson brings together veteran actor Bruce Willis and emerging star Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a team, of sorts in this time travel drama. An interesting look at a future that utilizes time travel, Looper is riddled with sharp dialogue and gritty, dark photography sure to capture the audience's attention.<br/><br/>In the future of 2074, time travel is possible and utilized, but forbidden to all, unless you are a Looper. Loopers are hit men who are paid to kill criminals sent to them 30 years in the past. A Looper named Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), is desperately searching for something of worth in his otherwise miserable drug-fueled life. Just roaming through his life, Joe kills and stashes away his reward hoping for a respite to France in the future. One day, Joe gets the job of his life, literally, when his future self (Bruce Willis) is sent to him. The only way to close a loop in this universe is for the 2074 self to be killed by the 2044 self in the past. Joe hesitates, and his future self escapes, determined to kill the boy in the past who will grow to be the man responsible for his wife's death. Realizing he has committed a grave mistake, Joe chases his future self, eventually getting a step ahead of him. Landing on a farm that Joe believes his future self is coming to in search of the boy, Joe finds a single mother and her son on the farm and soon learns there is more to her son than meets the eye. Deciding, selflessly, to protect them, Joe comes face-to-face with his future self, and must make a crucial decision.<br/><br/>Dark cinematography was used throughout the film, and it lent itself well to the dark feelings experienced by the Loopers who were simply killing until they killed themselves. The darkness also lends itself well to the extreme isolation that affects everyone in this universe. An unexpected standout in the film was the little boy, Cid played by Pierce Gagnon. A wonderful performance with deep emotions, the child actor shines. Great performances by Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt aided by rich dialogue go a long way toward the staying power of this film.<br/><br/>Looper is a fun, yet serious film for the sci-fi genre. Complete with action, but not over the top, it was a good submission for the time travel sub-genre. I would recommend this film to sci-fi fans, as well as fans of the two lead actors. We especially see Gordon- Levitt branch out beautifully from the characters he typically portrays. Hopefully, also, we see more of the standout Pierce Gagnon."
"vuntimas","3","1","2","1 January 2016"," Rian Johnson got lost in his own story
","The movie Looper amazes the viewer with it's unique plot. The main characteristic being time travel. During the entire movie the characters would avoid explaining the chosen time-line and how it works. However, out of the most common theories Rian Johnson chose the most unseen one - you can change the future. Despite all the paradoxes and missing ""logical"" explanations, which basic time travel theories present while discussing how it would affect the time-line what should interest the viewer is not the mechanic but how it affects the story. Therefore, you should ignore discussing how much sense it makes as it is sci-fi but do pay attention on what role the given conditions play in the story. <br/><br/>Rian Johnson did not manage to cope with his own written ones. He began the story presenting the basic time travel idea - tricked the viewer and then surprised him with the paradoxical - changing your existing future by affecting the present. He continues this idea throughout the entire movies up until the very most important act. The climax. Here he slips, gets tangled in the limitless possibilities of his plot and ties lose ends with the most basic, boring outcome, which negates the entire idea of the movie: main character refers to loops and kills himself to stop them. However, the main idea, the most unique plot is the idea of you looping again and again and changing your future each time, which the protagonist could have done! Live, survive, save your life go back once again and make it so this time you can make everything right. It is not a loop it is a continuous line that just happens to go through the same paths you took up until you decided to chose a different one.<br/><br/>All in all, Rian Johnson tried to prove Hollywood he can present something new. However, he miserably failed when he ran into the paradoxes of his own plot and had to come back to the clichés to find an ending to his peace, which destroyed the entire beauty of the movie."
"taylorkingston","7","1","2","23 June 2015"," An interesting and slightly confusing movie...
","I thought this movie was pretty good. It's interesting, with a very intriguing concept. At some points it can get slightly confusing, but still nowhere as confusing as Inception. That is just way too much confusing-ness for one movie. <br/><br/>This movie is based in 2074 and twenty years or so earlier, where everything is different. When the mob wants to get rid of someone, the target is sent to the past, where a hired gunman waits and then takes them out. Joe discovers that when the mob wants to ""close a loop"" they send the future self back to the past for execution. Joe finds himself seeing his future self in front of him, but is unable to kill him. Which throws everything out of whack.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 7 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Great."

","Looper is a movie that certainly divides opinion. Its take on time travel and assassination is certainly flawed and has loopholes.<br/><br/>However its certainly an entertaining story and its nice to see a film where Bruce Willis makes an effort, he certainly must have liked the script.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Joe a drug addicted assassin who kills and disposes bodies of victims sent 30 years back in time by a crime syndicate which runs time travel machines. One day these loopers will have to kill their older selves. Its called closing the loop.<br/><br/>However it emerges that in the future a person called The Rainmaker has unrivalled telekinetic powers and is sending loopers back in time to be killed.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is an older version of Joe. He through the love of a woman cleaned himself up and found inner peace. However as he is taken to be sent back in time, his wife is killed and he vows to kill the child that will grow up to be The Rainmaker.<br/><br/>Younger Joe needs to kill older Joe before the mob in his present kills both of them. He meanwhile seeks refuge in a farmhouse where he discovers a boy with telekinetic powers.<br/><br/>Hence we have a chain of events that would go off and affect both Joes. Maybe somehow, younger Joe can close a loop.<br/><br/>Its a novel update and presentation of sci fi tropes that we have seen before in films like Terminator. The sci fi is not foolproof as the director would like it to be but the film is appealing and entertaining enough with a nice blend of action and thrills.<br/><br/>The kid playing the young Rainmaker was outstanding."

","from logic burps and flat-out absurdity, but I did like this one more than most. Bruce Willis really sells the concept, as he does in the much different, and better, time-travel film ""12 Monkeys"". He doesn't resemble Gordon-Levitt very much, but the latter does a nice job mimicking Willis's by-now-familiar mannerisms so we don't notice their physical dissimilarities.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt's performance stands out to me. The scene on the porch where she's smoking a make-believe cigarette (presaging a later post-coital scene) is a nice touch. Jeff Daniels is the least menacing crime boss I can recall, but he somehow pulls it off.<br/><br/>Really fine cast, and a plot that doesn't have as many holes as most of the genre."
"xaniver","6","1","2","5 October 2014"," Flawed but not without merit
","Looper, made note-worthy thanks to the incredible prosthetics applied to Joseph Gordon-Levitt turning him into a young Bruce Willis. That alone was enough to pique my curiosity. <br/><br/>I expected a Total Recall romp with lots of action, improbable gun fights, heroic martial arts displays, a fair amount of running away from the bad guys and playing with futuristic gadgets. Looper was all of that and then some. There was actually substance to this story and the film felt a lot more like a drama than an action movie. The trailer is a little misleading. Without being too spoilery, suffice it to say, that all those cool action shots aren't really what the movie is about. At it's core, Looper is about a guy examining his choices in life, how those choices affected others and how far he'd be willing to go for others. Pretty intense and dramatic stuff.<br/><br/>As the credits rolled, my friends and I looked at each other and said ""That was good."" As in, far better than we expected because honestly we expected flashy sci-fi action and got a more introspective story, which was pleasantly surprising.<br/><br/>Fast forward an hour to when the initial post movie stars in our eyes had faded to bear glimmers and we started analysing the story. So the analytical phase began and the more we examined the movie the worse Looper became.<br/><br/>*Warning: There be spoilers ahead*<br/><br/>1) The whole premise is deeply flawed. Apparently, people are sent back in time because disposing of a body is hard in the future – Um, why? But they never elaborate and we just have to accept that this is the way the world works.<br/><br/>2) Loopers are sent the future versions of themselves to kill and 'close the loop' along with a payout in gold and early retirement. This is where things go wrong, so why send the Loopers their future selves to kill? Wouldn't it be cheaper and easier to send the offending Looper to another Looper for regular offing? Again, this is never explained and we just have to believe it's the way the world works.<br/><br/>3) Having closed the loop, the Looper in question is free to enjoy his gold for 30 years before being sent back to the past for offing in some sort of weird continuing cycle that honestly defies the laws of physics. Physics and quantum theory of time travel aside, why on earth would you give this Looper a bunch of gold and 30 years to live when you could just off said Looper in the present and save all future woes? This system makes NO sense. None. I've tried looking at it from every angle and it just isn't practical or economical. It's not good business.<br/><br/>4) In a completely random and almost completely unrelated subplot turned mainplot, by 2074 people will have evolved a special telekinetic gene. Why? How? No one knows but it's convenient for making little boys into super creepy antagonists. I don't even know why this TK-gene thing was shoved into this story that would've been way more awesome as an existential examination of what happens when a Looper is accidentally sent their future selves to kill because if you know you're going to have to off your future self one day, what's the big deal? You go in knowing this is going to happen. Again, the trailer is misleading because it implies that future-self meeting present-self is all a surprise when it very definitely isn't.<br/><br/>So, at first glance Looper is a great movie – fun and intriguing, creepy and dramatic, action packed and occasionally comical but don't think too hard about the story because as soon as you look a little too closely, the whole thing starts to fall apart. Looper could've been brilliant but it just wasn't. Instead of dishing up thought-provoking science fiction, it dishes up mediocre action with a dash of anorexic romance that just disappoints if you're looking for anything more than two hours of brain numbing entertainment."

The plot is fresh and original, the acting is pretty good, Joseph Gordon Levitt looks a hell of a lot like an actual young Bruce Willis, and the movie goes from there, with JGL trying to chase his ""future self"" through the present.

From that point in the movie --a little under halfway-- the plot shifts, and is all about Blunt's son.

"moviesrme10","6","1","2","24 June 2013"," Puts characters in right place, and looks good. Still not a big success story
","This film was really an interesting film to watch. And I mean it. When it was released back in September 2012, I had no such interest in watching it. For me the film just looked lame. I know you should never judge a book by its cover; I was just totally uninterested in this film. For starters it had that gangster's vibe going for it. And I just don't like gangster movies, for one and the fact that it involved killing people randomly, which I like, but this film kind of (for me) seemed to go over the edge and get a little too extreme. When I watched it, it had a very realistic and dark thing about it. What got me threw it all was the mesmerizing performances, by lead Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and supporters, Noah Segan and Emily Blunt. Okay so the issues with this film include Bruce Willis, length, and ending. Bruce Willis. The man behind Die Hard. I don't know what to say, the guy has lost it. He just can't act anymore, why he does it most likely now is to put food on the table. Whenever he's on screen he just doesn't seem to be n it, he doesn't have the same momentum he used to have. The dude unlike Sylvester Stallone just can't do it anymore. He's given up trying. His scenes were very poorly acted. The length of this film is way too long. I can think of a couple of scenes that should have been cut, or shortened more. It's just way too unbearable. This film could have made for a decent Hour and a half film, but instead the people behind it added un- necessary additions to the film such as the half naked women in the bed scene, and the ""kid blue"" getting his knuckles cracked scene. Those were lengthy additions that made little difference to the story. The ending to this film was also a bit of a disappointment for me. It ended with Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character killing himself so that the crazy future him, Bruce Willis wouldn't kill the kid. It was a very poor ending. The kid should have just been killed and Levitt's character ending it by killing the future him. The kid was freaking nuts, and would end up being a ruthless killer. The kid killed people, he was already a lost cause, and Emily Blunt's character man was she a freaking air head. She should have killed the son. Heck with it, I would have, he was nuts. Well now to the good things. It includes the acting, special effects, and character development. The acting as I already explained was very good. Memorable you could say. Joseph Gordon-Levitt nails another role in the head. He is most likely one of the best actors of today. Every film I see him in is more un- forgettable then the last! He is excellent in his role, and adds depth to his character. And a few supporting cast members as I've already stated were excellent as well. The special effects, while minimal, are excellent and sharpened to the tip. The character development is by far the best thing. All of the character's back stories are told neatly and well. All of the character's had an emotional back story, and you felt something for each one, good and bad. You felt their issues and problems, big and small. Every character was proved to be realistic and had something about them that at least one person could relate to. All in All, Looper might not be a big success, but it puts its characters in the right place and just seems realistic, and emotional. C+"
"p-jonsson","6","1","2","24 March 2013"," Proves that time-travel movies are difficult to make
","I am normally fairly hesitant concerning time-travel movies because it is next to impossible to get them right. They more or less always become very unrealistic and full of paradoxes. I would almost go as far as to say that producers making serious (non-comedy) time travel movies are the ones that are scientifically too stupid to realise that it is just going to be a mess, or they do not really care about the issues hoping that the audience also will not care.<br/><br/>This movie is really proof of this. It is full of paradoxes and annoying ""but if this happened now then that couldn't have happened then and vice versa"". Maybe some people can force themselves overlooking these things but I have some difficulty doing so. I fully agree with the statement that one of the characters in the movie was making: """"This time travel crap, just fries your brain like an egg"".<br/><br/>Anyway, trying to pierce through the cloud of time-travel issues and enjoy the movie, it is not a bad movie. Given that it really had no chance of succeeding in the science area, or have a plot which didn't defy all logic (time travel you know) it does indeed make a valiant try to entertain. It is not one of Bruce Willies standard all-out action-filled roller-coasters. That is not to say that there is no action but there is also plenty of time for trying to actually tell the story in the movie. The movie is actually quite dark and melancholic. The future seems to be fairly dirty, run down and ridden with criminal organisations.<br/><br/>As if time-travel itself wasn't bad enough the story also involves 10% of the population having developed psychic powers. Most of them good for nothing except cheap show tricks like levitating small objects. Most of themexcept our future crime lord which of course is found to have super-psychic powers. Also, of course, the kid had to behave like a spoiled brat with anger problems which was somewhat annoying.<br/><br/>The ending, which I will not divulge here of course, was not very surprising and left quite a few open questions. On the whole I would say that the movie was entertaining but it is far from going on my top ten list."

","I like science-fiction and in particular plots involving time-travel but with this film was too much put off by the for me, over-complicated plot and unlike-ability of the lead character in all his incarnations.<br/><br/>That main character, played largely by Joseph Gordon-Leavitt is a futuristic assassin who waits at an appointed place and time in the past to ruthlessly shoot down in cold blood, bound and blindfolded mob victims conveniently sent back in time to be dispatched by time-travel controlling gangsters.This routine of ritual murder was played out too many times for me to be effective and actually ended up being offensive. Moreover, Leavitt's character gives you no other reason to care for or even like him, living a hedonistic drugs and girls-fuelled life-style. Just when you think he's about to show a degree of loyalty to a hunted-down friend and colleague, he obligingly turns him in under hardly the strongest of intimidation by admittedly still imposing gang master Jeff Daniels.<br/><br/>Things get further complicated when he encounters his future-self, played by Bruce Willis, out on a back-in-time mission to take out the infant who has later grown up to be the murderer of his wife. Said child is cooped up in a rambling wooden house Deepintheheartofnowhere,being brought up in between violent mood-swings by his tomboy, gun-toting young mom. The story lines converge around a surprising twist at the end, but not before a lot of hootin' and-a-shootin' takes place.<br/><br/>I tried really hard to keep up with the plot but kept getting skewered by awkwardly-placed events of little apparent relevance or merit, particularly a gratuitous out-of-nowhere sex scene between Leavitt and Blunt, the possible incestuous overtones of which don't bear thinking about.<br/><br/>Like I said earlier, none of the characters evoked any sympathy or even interest in me and I found the violence brutal and over-bearing, deadening my faculties long before the end. It's set up of course for old-hand Willis to steal the show, tooled up like it was the 80's again, but I'm not sure there was much of a show here to steal in the first place."

Couldn't they have used future Joe that looked like present Joe? Or the same actor with aging makeup? I do not like movies where you have to figure out everything. No wait, Its not that I'm lazy.

","Once the future was projected in movies as a colorful and peaceful environment, where most of the human challenges will come from encounters with other civilizations and the confrontation with humanity's own thirst in discovering the Universe and breaking all its frontiers. Then dark political fiction interfered, as movies like '1984′ and 'Brazil' brought up to screen the social nightmares of a world dominated by totalitarianism. Nowadays almost all movies that deal with the future seem to be dark dystopias that describe the planet after some kind of atomic, biological or ecological apocalypse, or in the best case populated by a society that resembles some kind of Orwellian nightmare. Director Rian Johnson's 'Looper' is no exception, as the world of 2044 or 2074 in the film is dominated by violence, human life has lower price than ever, and the technology progress did not bring to mankind any happiness (neither cleaner streets). Time travel was invented but quickly forbidden, as organized crime took over, and as with any forbidden substance or weapon it is the mafia that controls the illegal trade.<br/><br/>'Loopers' are paid killers whose mission is to execute in cold blood in the year 2044 the victims targeted by the mob of 2074 to die. The trick and the trigger of the story is that 30 years later it may be decided that the looper is the one to die, and then if the sentence is not put in action a loop is created. Loopers are not allowed to feel any mercy, not even to their own self in the future. The smart script of this film, one of the smartest that I have seen lately avoids with the twist of a sentence the hard questions asked when the two instances of the same paid killer (Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) meet in one of the scenes that is hard to forget for anybody who saw the film. 'Too complicated, let us not enter the details'. And if details are left apart, this story works perfectly, and the ending makes a lot of sense in a story which could easily get too complicated and too hard to follow.<br/><br/>It's hard to tell from this film that writer and director Rian Johnson is almost a newcomer in the world of Hollywood. Not only the pace of the film is perfectly tuned accelerating and slowing as the story demands, and the cinematography choices he made seem efficient and the story and dialogs create the atmosphere of distrust that lets the viewer ask all the time what is meant by the sequence he watches and what comes next, without explaining things too early or too late – there is also something in the realistic style he picks that makes the story credible and the characters resonate with viewers despite the unusual situations they are facing. Bruce Willis proves again that he is much more than an action hero actor (although the fans of Die Hard will find here a few scenes that will remind them their beloved character), Joseph Gordon-Levitt approaches the role with a self-confidence and a palette of nuances that makes me believe that we may have in him another megastar of tomorrow, while Emily Blunt confirms the good vibrations I felt watching her in 'The Adjustment Bureau'. 'Looper' is a more than satisfying action thriller, it's one of the best written, acted and directed films I have seen in the last year."

","""Looper"" cashes in some aspects that are really well executed: Gordon Levitt is touched with a very nuanced make up to make him look like a young Willis. Somehow the portrayal of a ""asphalt jungle"" future has the condiments of other dystopian films, but fails to explain and deploy the background of it and has only the immediate effect. And the action moments are curiously lacking in intensity, in correlating with the characters.<br/><br/>Though it does play by the rules it pronounces; ""Looper"" seems to avoid answering or even clearing the webs that form around plot holes. Time travel is a bitch to treat, and the decision to let go of some key questions seems like less of artistic merit and more of development comfort. Why did Sara know that Joe was a Looper? Why did young Joe convince himself on killing Old Joe while he could simply take the gold that was already packed and safeguard his future by sparing himself? It feels more like we do not care for the questions, than need to know the answers."
"Blooner","7","1","2","21 January 2013"," A reasonable and stylized movie, although ultimately somewhat forgettable
","Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com - 'Looper' is a sci-fi action thriller starring Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The plot revolves around the concept of illegal time-travel. The movie is set in the year 2044, where time-travel hasn't been invented yet. But 30 years later, it will have been. It will be immediately made illegal, but the mob of the future still use it for one simple goal; body-disposal. When they need someone gone in the future, they simply send him back, and a 'Looper' in the movie's current time will kill and dispose of the body. Very 'clean'. This plot device is intriguing, but in the end it is rather detached from the ultimate direction of the film.<br/><br/>If you have seen the trailer for 'Looper' I must warn you. There is a strange disconnect between the trailer and the actual movie. This had me somewhat confused for a reasonable portion of the movie, as it really wasn't heading in the direction I was anticipating beforehand. This is in no way a fault of the script or director, simply an unfortunate outcome of my preconceived notions of the film.<br/><br/>The actual movie had somewhat less action and suspense than I anticipated, opting instead for a more slow and deliberate pace. The whole time- travelling angle of the plot was also less involved than I originally gleaned from the trailer, with it being used pretty much exclusively to set the stage for the story. I felt this was slightly off kilter with the premise of the movie. The slower parts of the movie can actually feel somewhat dull at times, rather than suspenseful, which is what I think the director was going for.<br/><br/>There are some very fun aspects of the film though. Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing a younger version of Bruce Willis' character adds a few laughs and plenty of impressive make-up effects. The world in which this story is set is very well thought out and crafted with its own impressive style. This radiates throughout the movie, which truly has its own unique identity. This is brought to life with some impressive acting. Bruce Willis is as great as always, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt really stands his own in the lead role, bringing some impressive Bruce Willis impressions and mannerisms to the table. Emily Blunt also impresses with her depiction of the character 'Sara'. The actor that impressed me most however was the little kid who played 'Cid'. I'd wager he is about 6 years old and he gave one hell of a performance in the rather large role he plays in the film. It was really impressive irrespective of his age, but even more so because of it.<br/><br/>'Looper' is the latest in a line of what I call 'Bruce Willis' Sci-Fi adventures'. Examples of previous installments of this are 'The Fifth Element' and 'Surrogates'. It seems Bruce ventures into another sci-fi project every few years, each one with the same basic result; A reasonable movie which is ultimately somewhat forgettable. 'Looper' is no exception, but at least brings a truly unique style to the genre. - Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com"
"Gin-ster","6","1","2","15 January 2013"," Preposterous and off-putting yet strangely moving
","In reviewing this film I am trying to view it from two different angles; that of a ""mainstream"" film goer and that of a sci fi fan. I fit the description of the latter. For mainstream viewers this movie will no doubt be an absolute dud. The characters are off-putting - the main protagonist (in his young and old incarnations) is a cold-blooded murderer, a point that is repeatedly demonstrated. The rationale for transporting people back in time to execute them is ridiculous - it is obviously just a plot contrivance to allow for the situations in which the ""old"" and ""young"" versions face each other. And of course, the time travel issues injects a further element of total absurdity. As a ""mainstream"" movie, then, I'd give this a 5.<br/><br/>However, as a science fiction movie I'd rate it somewhat more highly - maybe a 7. From the start, I had to suspend disbelief regarding the rationale behind the ""looper"" methodology, but like others here I kept asking, ""If the crime syndicate can get away with that much illegal activity, why can't they just kill people in their own time period?"" Accepting this plot point was hard work. I also had to put aside the repugnant nature of the main characters. Having consciously pushed these and other problems aside, I found the movie to be engaging and even affecting. Some reviewers have commented on the attempt to make Gordon-Levitt look like Willis, and I don't have a problem with that, other than that the novelty of it was a distraction to an extent (yet it ""worked."") The acting was perfect, the envisioning of the future was impressive in that the designers didn't work overtime to create an all-new look, which in a way made sense. (Like people today, those in the 2040s had a fad of wearing clothing from past decades). The ""future"" also included some ""retro"" touches - payment in silver bars - reminiscent of Battlestar Galactica in which there is space travel yet telephones have cords. The ""retro"" touches were a distraction but still, added to appreciation of the film. A couple of other positives: SPOILER - the film turned into so much more than it appeared to be about. I wondered why the telekinesis issue was taken so casually but when it reappeared it did so with a vengeance (calling to mind Carrie, of course, as well as a character in the TV series 4400). Above all, like the ""unsung"" Back to the Future Part II, with its ever-shifting realities, it was like a very bad dream. The nightmarish quality that permeated it was, I believe, one aspect that made it so effective.<br/><br/>Speaking of other related movies or scenes, MAJOR SPOILER HERE: I was surprised by the ending, even though I instantly thought of ""The Butterfly Effect"" in which the hero kills himself to stop a series of disastrous events from occurring. Which underscores the fact that this is a very un-Hollywoodish movie - the main protagonists die, and the choice Gordon-Levitt's character makes at the end SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER saves the mother and son but in so doing, imperils the rest of the world as the child is clearly a malevolent force - the future is in for big trouble. I would give the movie extra high marks for not wrapping everything up neatly, Hollywood style. All in all it is extremely flawed, yet I did find it strangely moving."
"complications123","5","1","2","7 January 2013"," Not as Clever as You Think
","I had remembered seeing previews for this and was pretty excited when it hit video last week. I wanted to like this film as I generally enjoy time travel flicks (even with all their inadequacies) and thought the whole contract killing idea was a neat framework. Sadly, it fell far below my expectations as an original take on time travel. Furthermore it didn't even deliver much in the way of excitement, suspense, or any outstanding performances. Somehow, Looper also managed to be devoid of any sort of style, preferring to lean on character development as it's main source of entertainment.<br/><br/>The premise is extremely interesting, but Joe turns out to be a pretty prototypical hit-man. Far too much time is spent on explaining who he is and what he does, and yet we end up knowing nothing about it except that he gets high and frequents prostitutes. His older self is just as bland; we know he was married. Both Joe and Old Joe aren't really given any real humanity and it made it hard for me to really care what happened because there was absolutely no connection made between the audience and our main character(s). Bruce Willis didn't even really need to be in this film as Old Joe didn't represent an emotional being at all.<br/><br/>When the film really gets going, with the TK boy, it still fails to impress. Little actual tension is created I didn't much care about the sort of stilted, clinically precise version of this young child that was presented. The mother was the only character able to generate any sympathy and only so far as I understand how protective a single parent feels over a child that age.<br/><br/>The big plot twist was the most disappointing aspect of the movie to me. While I know a lot of people out there are praising how well the time travel mechanic was handled and how it actually ""makes sense"" in this film, it's really nothing new to anyone who's even had a passing interest in time travel and read up on the many user-friendly, math free theoretical plausibility and possibilities of time travel. What Looper does in order to have the film ""make sense"" on a superficial level is introduce a closed loop. An interesting facet proposed about time travel is that if it is possible, then time isn't really changed; if someone traveled back in time then that's actually what happened back then.<br/><br/>For instance if I traveled back to 1981 and had coffee with your 20 year old self, then now you would see a picture of me and remember having coffee with me 32 years ago just as I look now. It always happened that way. Where this gets tricky is when you have a ""closed loop,"" as it's called in time travel parlance. (No real relation to the ""closing your loop"" term used in the film, although perhaps a bit of foreshadowing.) A closed loop is when an event in the past causes an event in the future that goes back in time and causes the initial event in the past. Sure, it's a clever little device to throw into a film, but it makes no more sense than any other time travel paradox. To put the concept in simpler terms, imagine that I have a book of all of Shakespeare's work. I have this because he wrote it hundreds of years ago. But lets say I go back in time, before he wrote anything, and took this book with me. Now let's say I give him this volume and tell him to do what he wants with it, and I return to my present time. What we have here is all of Shakespeare's work that has no origin. I only have it because he wrote it, and he only wrote it because I had it to give him, he had it because I gave it to him. It's cyclical, and because of the laws of conservation of matter and energy, it is impossible for this to exist without a point of origin. If my dad gives me a knife in 2010, I go back in time and give it to him in 1990 for him to give me in 2010, then the knife is never actually created.<br/><br/>The fact is that it's impossible to try and be sensible about time travel. By virtue of being impossible (as we know of) it is also incomprehensible and incompatible with our view of time. Therefore I think the best a film can aspire to is to be entertaining. Looper tries too hard to be a time travel movie for the thinking man, but it falls on the same problems as other movies of the type and fails to genuinely entertain in the process."
"piratecannon","7","1","2","3 January 2013"," It Doesn't Exactly Rewrite History
","Looper is a movie that's been on my radar for quite some time. It's about mafia-types who are involved in time travel for the sake of eliminating unwanted ""garbage,"" and it features both the formidable Bruce Willis and Nightwing himself, Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Because I don't have quite as much free time as I used to, I had to skip this one in theaters. When it finally trickled down the DVD/Blu-ray format earlier this week, however, I was all over it.<br/><br/>This is the perfect example of a movie that quietly made its way into cinemas without having an overabundance of pomp and circumstance paving the way. I'd taken a fleeting interest in it upon reading about the movie's story line, but it wasn't until a multitude of friends took to Facebook in order to sing its unparalleled praises that I genuinely took interest. And, I have to say, though solidly crafted it is, I found the movie to be a bit of a letdown. Let me explain why.<br/><br/>With any time travel flick, one expects there to be plenty of mind- bending timelines that crisscross with one another (heck, they may even congeal into something indecipherable in the final moments, but the goal is to keep the audience playing the ""prediction"" game throughout). While Looper does this, I found it far too easy to foresee how things would play out (this was in stark contrast to 12 Monkeys, Willis' other time travel movie). To delve into the specifics of this would put me at risk of including spoilers in my review, so suffice it to say that, though well written, there was nothing Earth-shattering about our protagonists' concluding revelation. Another point of contention—and one that has been widely discussed, I believe—was the decision to drown JGL in make-up so as to make him resemble a young Willis. At times, it works, but more often than not I found it nearly impossible to not envision the actor with his true face. Would it have been better to simply allow JGL to be, well, himself, and to sparingly use CGI to fill in the awkward transition moments during his character's life? I don't know. Still, I can't ignore the fact that the make-up was more of a distraction than a boon.<br/><br/>Actually, I think Looper's greatest strength is its focus on the development of telekinesis as a part of the human genome in the not too distant future. Some of the film's best moments come as a result of this plot point, and I wish a little more focus on this would have been the order of the day.<br/><br/>Please don't misunderstand me. Looper is far better than the vast majority of drivel that Hollywood allows to make it past the stages of early drafting, and it makes for perfectly good viewing for anyone who enjoys sci-fi. Just don't expect it to rewrite history."

","Despite the childish name, this isn't a kid's movie. It's a violent action packed sci-fi film which will test your patience. I don't want to say too much about the plot else it could really ruin the film for you, as it's all about the surprises. The basic idea is that our lead is involved in killing people sent from the future to the past to remove trace of them! As you expect, this system breaks down along the way and we have a chat on our hands.<br/><br/>Surprises galore as said and some fine acting for a sci-fi movie keep our attention. Taking in the elements of time travel you will find plenty of loopholes (no pun intended) but suspend your disbelief. It does lag at points but will retain your interest.<br/><br/>Some will have a problem that it is derivative but that is being churlish. You'll find it has influences and parallels from too many to be deemed a copy: Inception, Blade Runner, Carrie, Terminator, Jumper, Donnie Darko and even Back to the Future amongst others. Possibly the truth may also be coincidence in some parts.<br/><br/>Overall, a fair movie. The director has had the confidence to make a movie that is testing and interesting. It will definitely raise some interesting ethical questions for viewers to ponder in that sense is worth a watch. Got the makings of a cult viewing movie I think."
"carlhuitong","8","1","2","26 December 2012"," Can be better
","Looper is one of thought- provoking movies in recent years. Although it has some defects in the story plot, it is overall entitled to a slick piece of good sci-fi film. ( not a masterpiece ) The story to some extent is hard to fathom the whole backgrounds and implications. It irks me to try to understand why this happens, how this comes from. The whole premise of the film is not satisfactorily explained. For example, the background of 2074 society and gangs which send ""loopers"" to 2044 to deposit dead bodies make me confessed. Meanwhile, the 'Rainmaker', as well as his mother, are not fully explained and how do they relate to the time traveling. And the ""Bruce Willis style"", like the Die Hard and the Expendables is not necessarily extended so long. ""Looper"" is not an action, but a sci-fi. The most fatal part is time-traveling paradox. Present Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Future Joe (Bruce Willis) are messed up. Their relationship in general is very hard to fathom and lacks in verisimilitude.<br/><br/>As many reviewers said, Looper is a stunningly original sci-fi masterpiece. I agree to certain extent. Even if there are some defects, Looper is still vastly superior to any of the higher profile action released in recent years. Present Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) adds bonuses to the film through his vivid performances, along with typical Bruce Willis's action style."

","Taking the tried & tested formula of time-traveling in sci-fi films, Looper creates an original beauty of a film that is as satisfying as its smart plot. It's one of those rare sci-fi thrillers that tells its story in an effective way, presenting itself as an intelligent yet not confusing piece of cinema, wildly entertains as well as amuses the viewers and finally signs off without leaving any trace(s) behind.

We both were a bit confused (him more so since he had to go to the restroom in the middle of it) at how things were going on during much of it but thought it was redeemed by how things ended. I mean, it was a while what that young mother with her pre-teen kid had to do with the plot that was on my mind much of the time. And I'll probably have to watch this again to really understand. But still, I did enjoy it by the time it ended. And Emily Blunt does another fine performance as that mother. So on that note, Looper gets a recommendation with some reservations."
"lasttimeisaw","6","1","2","21 October 2012"," a smart idea, but not well executed!
","Rian Johnson's third feature, the second one stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the leading role, after his career debut detective-noir BRICK (2005, 6/10), however his second film THE BROTHERS BLOOM (2008, 6/10) has lost its traction with both the audience and the critics, in spite of a scale-up budget and cast.<br/><br/>I saw this film in the local multiplex, and my expectation had been drastically kindled thanks to its great reviews in its domestic reign (especially after a season mainly consists of summer leftovers and studio's substandard cranked-outs), although I'm no big fan of Rian's past work, and consider him as the next Christopher Nolan might spoil him through excessive enthusiasm (also, to juxtapose this time-travel vehicle with the monolithically staggering INCEPTION, 2010, 9/10 is not such a grounded idea at all).<br/><br/>The milieu of a dystopian future with a darker and more desolate vantage view is not a novel gambit it the Sci-Fi genre, the film also is wanting the budget to exhibit its ambitious future world, basically the film hinges on a quite groundbreaking caveat, the requisite existence of ""the loopers"", which is a somewhat moot point (it's rather difficult to be convinced the future criminals will make such a big fuss to illegally dispose the dead bodies with the omnipotent time machine, which triggers another more pertinent point, why not kill first, transfer later?), so all of these unsolved questions have kind of deglamorized the film per se. <br/><br/>But honestly speaking, if one can drop the feeble premise, the film is potently entertaining, especially in the latter part, when all the Sci-Fi stunts turns into a supernatural thriller. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has slowly but firmly established his own fan base and although almost ruined by the ridiculous make-up (I don't buy the resemblance of him and Bruce Willis no matter what 30 years could alter a person), all he needs is a meaty role to send him into the upper stratum as like Christian Bale or Joaquin Phoenix. Emily Blunt gives an impressively gritty performance with her southern American accent (for me it's rather disparate from her usual comfort zone, but I am no American, so I don't have the say whether it is accurate or not), a hard-bitten motherhood is always a rite-of-passage for young actresses when they (infinitely) reach 30. Paul Dano is technically wasted in the film, so are Rian's old buddies Jeff Daniels, Noah Segan is too goofy to be taken seriously. An unexpected discovery is the young boy Pierce Gagnon, a big bravo for him to nail the most demanding work in the film."

But if you do that then they wouldn't have existed in the future you came from in the first place.<br/><br/>Too many things that are not theoretically possible.Like if you die in the past, your future self would never exist which basically makes the whole movie a huge plot hole which is always going to be the case involving time travel movies.

"parallel_projection","8","4","18","29 September 2012"," An enthralling film, yet could've been better-developed
","Let me start by saying that this is probably the best science-fiction film of the year. Somehow, Rian Johnson was able to turn time travel into a relatively unique, fresh concept that was at times very dark. In fact, this entire film is very dark, yet it handles it well--you are not consistently being hit over the head with it, although it is definitely always there. This film absolutely takes you on a journey, and I was highly entertained the entire time, and found myself wondering what was going to happen, and how it was going to end. <br/><br/>This film also makes you care for the characters, which I feel many movies and films today skip over. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a great job as the present-day looper Joe, trying desperately to close his own loop before the mob catches up with him, and Bruce Willis is fantastic as Gordon-Levitt's future-self trying to avenge the death of his wife by murdering the potential past-selves of a mass-murdering vigilante (it gets a little complicated, but by no means is it not followable). All the while, Joe comes to know Sara, portrayed by Emily Blunt in a fierce and standout performance, and her son, who are both hiding dark secrets. All of the actors, from Jeff Daniels to Paul Dano, actually do very good jobs, and as I said the characters are really well thought-out.<br/><br/>However, this film is absolutely not without it's flaws. I was actually expecting something quite different when I walked into the theater--it was definitely more supernatural than I thought it would be, which sort of detracted from the otherwise-believable world, but ends up being a central plot-point. Also, there are plenty of loopholes and paradoxes that could've been explained better or fixed within the confines of the script. Lastly, many people are saying that this film has three acts, but I'd almost say it only has two, at least based on the setting. For me, the two halves have completely different feels to them, possibly because of the contrasting settings, which doesn't necessarily detract from the film, but makes it somewhat incoherent. <br/><br/>(Half of it is essentially set in a rundown, futuristic city, and I liked the fact that, although it was not beaming with future technology, there were hints here-and-there where you could tell it was in the future. The other half is set in a farmhouse that's old even for today's standards. It's quite a contrast, although I felt as if Johnson was saying something about how modern society is slowly taking over traditional values.) <br/><br/>That being said, the script is still great, and there are actually some genuinely funny moments of dry humor, snide remarks, and comical situations. I'm not sure if all of these were intended to be taken as comical, but the majority of the theater was laughing at some points throughout the film. Overall, though, it is definitely quite dark and dramatic, but don't come expecting an action movie. There is action, for sure, but this is more of a character's film, and I'd say that despite the fact that it could've been better-developed, it definitely didn't disappoint."
"rachelhudec","6","2","7","19 July 2019"," What could've been
","The story has so much potential and it kills me how the director came up short. I felt like this film was an unfinished puzzle with too many missing pieces. The acting was superb, the makeup on Joseph blew my mind, and there were some parts that were very entertaining. However, there's too many things that aren't shown or explained in depth. The director leaves too much for the audience to decipher which I don't care for. For instance, How does Sara get killed during the timeline Young Joe grows old when they never even met? Maybe she was killed by someone else and that led to Cid becoming the Rainmaker but that was never explained or shown. Just adding a small detail like that to the plot would have made this narrative easier to comprehend and it would've made more sense. It also would've been cool to meet the terrifying Rainmaker in the future but we don't get to see that either. Overall, despite the many plot holes/paradoxes, the ending delivers a very important message; people have the power to keep the same rotten mistakes from happening. History doesn't have to repeat itself and the harmful cycle of violence doesn't have to continue."

"George-seabrook1","10","2","7","9 April 2013"," It's not perfect, but by God is it good.
","Director Rian Johnson has a habit of being brave with this film. Not just because he delivers a fair amount of gore, blood and at least one scene early on, so distressing that it had me in bits. Or because there are very few, if any characters that are either fully good or bad; Johnson is like a cat with a ball of string when he's playing with ideas of morality. No the bravest thing Johnson does in this film by far is setting up his world and his (rather brilliant) concept and just over ten minutes it seems after Old Joe (Bruce Willis) arrives from the future, the story decides to take an unexpected, and for many, unwelcome left turn into a very different genre. what was set up to be a chase movie between Young Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Old Joe is thrown nearly completely out of the window, when any Hollywood science-fiction film of recent years would not only turn it into a possibly exciting but unlikely (as) satisfying series of chases and captures between ""hero"" and ""villain"" but also would have done so with considerably less blood or tension. These examples of bravery are actions that in my opinion work to Johnson's great advantage, distinguishing his film from everything else, and allowing it to be mentioned in the same breath as say, Blade Runner, The Terminator and Inception. None of those films are bad, all are very exciting, and crucially, find ample time to have not only compelling stories and characters, but to toy with ideas of Philosophy; Blade Runner with what it means to be human, Inception with ideas of loss and death, while The Terminator, if not quite as intellectually compelling, remains a hell of a lot of fun. And that's the biggest asset Looper has really; it's that standing in front of all of the themes and ""directorial bravery"" is an absolute belter of a thriller. The action is often low-key, and comparatively small, but the bigger set-pieces are completely thrilling, whilst the script is absolutely excellent; crafting a world all on its own and creating the concept of time travel in this universe is dealt with in early narration from Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and excellent production design. It is completely lived-in and scarily, feels like it could be a reality in the next 30 years. Finally, the performances are all-round brilliant. Gordon-Levitt always delivers, and here he is served well by a character quite different from anything he's done before (it's also worth noting that the make-up to give him that ""Willis feel"" is very convincing, as long as you get over the fact quickly enough). Emily Blunt has an equally different role to her standard fare here, and does even better than Gordon-Levitt for my money. All the while, Bruce Willis returns in a film that helps remind us exactly why he's cool and a great actor, just like the original Die Hard and Pulp Fiction did; it's a shame then that shortly after this, Die Hard 5 was released. Clearly I enjoyed Looper very much, and personally, the shift in tone that most people have criticised it for, I applaud it for. Just don't question the logic of its time travel; it fries your brain like an egg after all."

","No plot spoilers as such but some points discussed from the film.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure if this would be a good film or not. It turned out to be one the better films I have seen in the past year. Putting aside the complexities of time travel, I thought the story line was actually a pretty good one. Albeit very similar to Terminator. As another reviewer pointed out, I'm sure that time travel could have been used for a better purpose. <br/><br/>A fundamental flaw in the story line, from my perspective, was that the mafia could have just killed the intended target and sent them back in the machine to be disposed of in the past thus eradicating any margin for error but alas that would have meant that we had no storyline so I'll let it slide. Can anyone counter that argument, I may have missed why they couldn't do that?<br/><br/>Took me a while to get used to Gordon-Levitt's make up but then realized it was so he looked like a younger Willis. Fair enough. I'm not his biggest fan so making him look, unlike himself made this character more likable for me.<br/><br/>Think that Willis played a good role. The shot of him right after killing the past gang members, with blood on all over his face seemed to be in homage to his Die Hard days. He was pretty kick ass to be honest even after decades of drug abuse. Drugs of the future have no side effects it would seem.<br/><br/>I wish I had seen it in the cinema. I believe it to definitely be cinema worthy. I've rated this a 9 and I don't do that lightly."

","I saw Looper touted as 'This generation's The Matrix' and thought that as unlikely as this was, I would give it a shot. Unfortunately, it did not even come close to living up to the expectations that it's own marketing campaign generated. Nothing about this film excited me. The whole premise of time travelling 'Loopers' is deeply flawed, and you are better off taking Daniels' character's advice and not thinking about it. <br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt adequately portrays a drug addled killer with zero personality and Willis barely gets enough screen time to convince us that Joe's life is worth saving (and still doesn't). There are barely any characters worth noting in this movie beyond the main characters, and even less likable ones.<br/><br/>The vision of the future portrayed in this movie is both depressing and lazy. We know it's the future because that Toyota Yaris has some cables glued to it. Maybe there were budget constraints?<br/><br/>Where the beginning of the film is reasonably fast paced and feels like the beginning of an action flick, it loses it's pace when the focus shifts to Blunt and her child and I found my interest really start to wane at this point. It feels to me like the makers of this movie thought that it is a lot more cerebral than it actually is (you can't ask us to dismiss intelligent interpretations of the plot in the opening scene and yet expect us to be entertained solely by it's flawed premise later on). I feel like Rian Johnson tried to do something unique with this film, but I don't think he necessarily judged it perfectly and in my opinion a few more action scenes may have livened things up enough to keep my attention.<br/><br/>I genuinely can't understand the level of praise for this movie, it was mildly entertaining in places but I couldn't recommend it as a great Sci-Fi Action Thriller.<br/><br/>5/10"

","I came out of this movie expecting to find glowing reviews from pretty much everyone, but was disappointed to see the many critical reviews here. That's fine; it's a free (in many countries) internet after all, but I just wanted to add my 2 cents into the mix because I absolutely loved this movie.<br/><br/>I had a very vague idea as to what to expect from this movie. All I knew was: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Prosthetics, Bruce Willis, Time Travel, Guns. I normally don't care for action films, but I really respect Joseph Gordon-Levitt and would be sold on watching any movie he might be doing. <br/><br/>What I did not expect was the depth of the message of the film and the vivid way it would be portrayed. Many of the reviews I glazed over remarked at how dumb the time-travel aspect was, how implausible such and such sci-fi aspect of the plot was, how ridiculous Joseph Gordon- Levitt's transformation into Bruce Willis was, or that Joseph's prosthetics were stoopid, etc, etc, etc. Yes, some of these reviews make valid points, but they are, at least to me, really secondary, or even tertiary to how this sci-fi medium was used to tell a story that is immensely relevant to our human experience. Yes, I would go that far as to call it that relevant.<br/><br/>We've all noticed our generation's blatant celebration of hedonism. The Jersey Shore phenomenon (I don't know the exact number, but everyone knows that show has a gajillion loyal followers)is a brilliant example of that. Appreciation for self-gratification at the expense of others is nothing new for humanity, but in the past, it was kept under wraps as if it were something we knew we should be ashamed of. It's all out in the open now, and Looper does a phenomenal job of getting the viewer to ask him or herself, ""WTF am I doing with my life?"" <br/><br/>If we've bought in to the idea that drugs, party, money, power bring any sort of lasting fulfillment, this film accurately depicts the outcome of living a life according to that creed albeit in a futuristic setting. In the end, Young Joe ends up with nothing. <br/><br/><ul><li>His stored silver - gone in a matter of moments. It bought him nothing that he could keep. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>He ""killed (his) best friend for silver"" and he never gets to see how horrific his friend's death truly was, but it's a death he's largely responsible for. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>His drugs leaves him weak and feeble especially once he no longer has access to them.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The man that gave him ""something that was (his) own"" wants him taken out in the most violent way possible despite Young Joe's ready willingness to correct the situation. We also see that theme played out in Blue's irrational devotion to and quest for approval from that same man who also despises him, seeing him as a tool with no true value in and of himself. Why do we invest in things that do not care for us? As we see, the outcome is only heartache and even death - a wasted lifetime chasing after things that harm and have no lasting value.</li></ul><br/><br/>We also see that Joe only emulated what he saw around him, having been abandoned by his mother - a ""junkie"" - and basically trafficked into a miserable life when his mother sold him to, what was it, a pan- handling gang? This is where we see that violence and misery occur in cycles,passed on from parent to child, parent to child, parent to child. <br/><br/>I found Young Joe's action at the end to be amazingly powerful because it was at that moment he realized that he needed to break that cycle, and offer Cid the chance to receive and be nurtured by something that he had never experienced during his lifetime - unconditional love. Cid did not choose the way he was born, but his mother's love will have the ultimate influence in what he eventually decides to do with his dangerous power. We don't see the outcome of this decision, but we're left hopeful that Cid will use what he has for good instead of evil. <br/><br/>I could say so much more about this film. It's tremendously packed with commentary on human existence in general - from our treatment of the poor to government corruption to the ethics of time travel were it possible. It's amazing that they were able to do all that in just 118 minutes. Overall, I would say, well done Rian Johnson!"

Trippy Philip K.Dickian sci-fi mind-f*#ck of a flick with the always appealing Gordon- Levitt as a combo bounty hunter/assassin of the future whose own fate seems locked in when his older self is sent back for his crimes to be terminated and the good ol' clock ticking before his cohorts get wise to off him themselves. With wit and a soupçon of restraint filmmaker Rian Johnson manages to tap into the time/space continuum with nary a shrug as to the backdrop of the proceedings at hand - a mix of gangster/code-of-the-old-West gunslinger flicks and the sub genre of time traveling sci-fi that is truly entertaining with a splendid cast including Willis as the world-weary shoot-first, ask-questions later archetype he can do in his sleep; Bljunt getting in touch with her inner Linda Hamilton; and a scruffy Daniiels as a future tapper running the whole bag of tricks. The only fatal flaw is attempting to make-up Gordon-Levitt to resemble Willis (it doesn't work; he looks like an automatronic plastique) not unlike Willis' crappy SURROGATES) and using his tough guy latter day Bogart whispery delivery. Otherwise a shot in the arm for identity in a grim future sci-fi action yarn that has a few surprises up its sleeve."

","The thoughts that are in your head after watching this movie, well, they are all over the place. Looper was excellent. A well paced Science Fiction action thriller, but it keeps your mind right where it wants to throughout the whole movie. Looper, if you haven't already read, is about a criminal organization that travels in time to get rid of their targets, these criminals who are told to execute the job, are called Loopers. But one day, Joe, one of the youngest Loopers, is approached by his best friend, who failed to ""close the loop"" meaning killing the target, because the target, was himself, thirty years from now. Joe hides him. And realizes that he cannot help him. Then Joe is asked to close his own loop, and he lets his older self (Bruce Willis) get away. And spirals onto an adventure that challenges Joe's moral and selfish and emotional decisions throughout. Looper challenges revenge, regret, happiness, love, betrayal, and don't think that because Bruce Willis is in it it's all about the guns and violence. Looper does an excellent job, of pacing action and plot, and a climax that will leave you breathless."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","13","1 October 2012"," Best sci-fi for a long, long time; best time-loop sci-fi ever
","I'm not going to waste time and space (no pun intended) to list all the sci-fi movies based on the time travel paradox over the last few decades. ""Looper"" best them all, with clever adherence to simplicity and consistency.<br/><br/>The basic premise is lucidly explained from the outset with a clear, concise VO by the protagonist Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) a ""looper"" (to be explained later) living in Kansas City 2044, when time travel has NOT yet been invented. His job, however, depends entirely on what happens 30 year later, when time travel has been invented. Digest this first.<br/><br/>A looper's job is sourced from a powerful gangster group from 30 years in the future. A looper is a gangland executioner cum body-disposal garbage man for this boss from 30 years in the future. The gangsters send back the victim who is shot by the looper the instant they appear, materializing out of nowhere. The execution ground is usually some deserted wilderness near KC. After collecting the pay in the form of silver bars strapped to the back of the victim, the looper disposes of the body, IN 2044. You can see how neat this is for the gangsters 30 years in the future – an absolutely water-tight murder with no possible trace of evidence whatsoever as the disposal usually takes the form to complete incineration.<br/><br/>Now this is how this movie is so clever. Don't underestimate the significance of the two-step operation: killing and body-disposal. The gangsters-30-year-in-future may well have done the killing themselves before sending the body back to 2044 for disposal. It would be slightly less satisfactory but almost as effective in wiping out murder evidence. The key is that the time travel is always ONE-WAY-TRAFFIC, of a DEAD BODY for all intent and purposes. The time-travel paradox of seeing yourself is therefore clever avoided. And even if you take the killing into consideration, it is almost flawless, because killing someone from 30 years in the future will not affect anything in the present.<br/><br/>Almost flawless. Now we come to something call ""closing the loop"". The loopers continue to live on and will one day reach 30-years-in-the-future. This, the gangster are well aware of. While you may ask ""what's the problem"", the gangsters consider that situation an unnecessary risk. A looper, just like the other enemies of the gangsters, is abducted and sent back to be executed, BY HIMSELF. Because the victims are hooded, the looper does not know that he is killing the version of himself from 30 years in the future, until after the execution and he finds that the pay (strapped to the back of the victim, remember?) is much more lucrative than from a regular job, allowing him to live out the remaining 30 years of life in comfort and luxury.<br/><br/>Here's the catch. The ultimate objective is body disposal. Whether the killing is done in the future or done in 2044 matters little – so long as in the latter case the killing is instantaneous upon the materializing of the victim. But..when things do not go according to plan, all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>100% SPOILER from here on – be warned!!! Joe's future self (let's call him old-Joe, played by Bruce Willis) comes back, unlike in normal cases, neither hooded nor fettered, knocked Joe cold and is on the loose. What happens (in the future, from the POV of the audience who is naturally routed with Joe) is that during old-Joe's time, a mysterious character with supernatural power called Rainmaker comes into power and proceeds to close all loops, with old-Joes beloved wife becoming collateral damage. Old-Joe breaks free from the gangsters, sends himself back, intending to track down Rainmaker (as a kid) and kills him to save his wife. Joe just wants status quo and sets out to find and protect Rainmaker, intending to kill old-Joe when he shows up to claim his prey.<br/><br/>Rainmaker is a 10-year-old kid living with single mother Sara (Emily Blunt). The second half of the movie plays out in a desolate farm house surrounded by eerie corn field in the middle of nowhere in Kansas where Joe and Sara prepare for old-Joe's arrival, a climatic finale that one critic aptly described as ""intellectually satisfying and emotionally powerful"". This has to be seen to be fully appreciated. <br/><br/>All three leads are superb. Willis is finding a new cinematic life, as fully demonstrated by ""Moonrise kingdom"" and this movie. Blunt is as versatile an actress as you can find, portraying anything from a Victorian royalty (a as matter of fact, the very person herself) to an earthy tornado country farmer. Her excellent portrayal of an imperfect but ultimately devoting mother reminds me of Toni Collette in ""The sixth sense"" (incidentally, another Bruce Willis movie). But top mark goes to Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who absolutely shines behind (and despite) the strange face prosthetics that is supposed to make him more believable as Bruce Willis at thirty years younger."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","4","20","29 September 2012"," More than a cool sci-fi concept; 'Looper' commits to a real story
","The rules of time travel in fiction can make your head spin. As a writer, you have to be so meticulous in your vision that all the rules of your universe don't collapse upon each other and bring your entire concept crumbling to the ground. Or, like Rian Johnson does in ""Looper,"" you can be so confident in your story and tell it in such compelling fashion that it doesn't matter if the concept is bulletproof or not.<br/><br/>""Looper"" envisions a future in which time travel has not been invented, but in 30 years it will be, only it's used exclusively by the mob to erase any trace of a hit. Young, impressionable guys in need of work like Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) have been recruited as Loopers to do this dirty work, but even the Loopers must be kept silent in the future, and so they're sent back in time to be killed by their younger selves, which is called ""closing your loop."" You earn a ton of gold and your freedom for closing your loop, but eventually you'll be sent back in time to be killed by your younger self, hence the loop analogy.<br/><br/>Joe keeps his life pretty straight for a Looper. He's stashed part of his earnings so that when he closes his loop he can head to France. At night he goes to the club, drops some eye-drop drug and rendezvouses with a high-end prostitute (Piper Perabo).<br/><br/>Suddenly, a lot of the guys are closing their loops, and Joe's confidence is a bit shaken. When he does ultimately see his older self arrive from the future (Bruce Willis), he flinches and lets him get away. He must quickly rectify the situation, or else he'll be killed in order to erase the problem altogether.<br/><br/>Time travel, however, is just the tip of the sci-fi iceberg as far as the future world Johnson has built in this film. Genre fans will find themselves highly stimulated by what they see, but at the same time, Johnson elects to slightly upgrade our world instead of give it some futuristic makeover.<br/><br/>But more than all that, looking beyond just the vivid context, ""Looper"" runs on strong characters and an organic sense of urgency. It doesn't get lost in sci-fi dialogue explaining how things work or become so driven by its concept that it detracts from creating believable people.<br/><br/>The scene in which both Joes confront each other in a diner captures what Johnson does so well, wrapping what would otherwise be heavy-handed sci-fi exposition into a scene with incredible tension. Although Old Joe gives us a lot of important information, the dominant feeling in the scene has more to do with wondering what it would be like to see yourself either older or younger (depending) staring back at you and knowing that you either need to kill yourself or yourself wants to kill you.<br/><br/>In that scene, Old Joe makes clear that he has a specific objective while back in time, so young Joe has to figure out how to stop him with his boss (Jeff Daniels) already on his tail. From there, ""Looper"" doesn't let up, and not from an action perspective, but in terms of a compelling narrative. Sci fi doesn't get any better when the characters and the story capture as much of your attention as the shiny environment they're placed, especially when you don't even realize it.<br/><br/>What's so unique about the way ""Looper"" uses the time travel device is in two portrayals of the same character. Both versions of Joe feel like completely different people, almost to the point where you have trouble believing they're the same guy, but it just goes to show how much of a difference life experience (years upon years) can make in a person's beliefs and motivations.<br/><br/>With proper material, Gordon-Levitt and Willis excel in their roles. JGL nails Willis' speech patterns, but more impressively he gets at the essence of the veteran's famed talent: bringing a sense of vulnerability to a hardened exterior — the sensitive tough guy. Willis too, thanks to the way his character is written, performs better here than in most of his recent films.<br/><br/>The outstanding Emily Blunt also deserves credit for her performance, though to explain her would spoil too much of the story's novelty. Gone is the elegant, hilarious Blunt we've mostly seen to this point; Sara is a bold, resilient and headstrong woman who also happens to be extremely lonely, which adds needed complexity. <br/><br/>The only weaker point of the script that can't be contributed to either nitpicking the details of the sci-fi framework or how people get conveniently gun-shy, is how Joe completely changes as a person over the course of just a couple short days. At first jaded and completely self- interested, he develops incredible empathy for someone enduring the chaotic life trauma of being both wanted dead and needing to kill your older self.<br/><br/>Even though the film's pacing is terrific and Johnson makes the most of every scene, something's missing in the second half that prevents us from staying on the same page with Joe beat for beat. Perhaps, however, it's not what the film doesn't provide, but rather that we're too overstimulated by all the excitement going on to follow along with the film at the more personal, emotional level — until the end, that is.<br/><br/>So much of the original science fiction we get today relies so heavily on its gimmick, but ""Looper"" feels like an action crime thriller that instead uses time travel as a device to add complexity. Johnson has crafted a story in which humans would respond to things as humans do, and he uses the sci-fi elements to enhance this, not drive it. It's why ""Looper"" will be looked at as a sci-fi gem for a long time to come.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com"

","Looper is a lot of fun with a lot of interesting plot twists but is on the gory side.<br/><br/>This narrated film needs it (narration) to fill you in at different places in the context of that given place in the film and that is the extent of the narration.<br/><br/>The film is written so as to be understandable but not simple minded. The character's in this film are well written and acted out and seem real enough. The director has chosen to tell the story in an effective way so as to generate some suspense and keep you guessing till the end which I of course won't get into.<br/><br/>What I thought remarkable about this film is the idea that it would work at all and making it work and watching the story unfold is quite an experience and worth the price paid for admission.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but think of the work of author Stephen King as the story played out on screen. It seem so effective in its totality that I thought it possibly an adaptation of one of his (Kings) works.<br/><br/>It is gritty without being to gritty and gives you a break from the carnage enough to make this film very viewable."

In the futuristic world, contract killers use time travel to get rid of the bad guys, and every person they kill has a bag over his face so the elimination can be done quickly and without guilt. As Joseph Gordon-Levitt goes about his work, one victim arrives at the elimination site without a bag on his face, and he looks extremely familiar. It turns out it's the older version of Joe, played by Bruce Willis!<br/><br/>If that blows your mind, you'll love this movie. I saw it in the theaters and was extremely riveted. It's quick, smart, mysterious, and dramatic. With a bit of makeup and quite a bit of studying Bruce's mannerisms and facial expressions, Joe is a perfect replica. Their scenes together are very well-acted and tense. You'll also get to see Emily Blunt trying out a very different role in a Southern accent, and Paul Dano and Jeff Daniels in supporting roles. You might want to put the kids to bed on this one, but it's a very good movie and I recommend you give it a shot-no pun intended.<br/><br/>Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

Strapped to the back of the marks are silver plates which are used as currency.<br/><br/>The twist is that every so often a mobster decides to ""close the loop"". This means they send the assassin's future self back to 2044 to be disposed of by their past self. They can not know it is them because every mark is hooded and one of the stipulations is that you do not remove this hood. Only when they remove the jacket and find gold plates instead of silver do they know that some time in the future their loop has been ""closed"".<br/><br/>I really can not believe this movie is getting such terrible reviews from some. After seeing it, this movie immediately made it into my top ten. It kept me engaged and on the edge of my seat the entire time. It was a fresh idea, with a lot of fresh new faces in the Hollywood scene (aside from Bruce Willis, who to me took a back seat in this movie).<br/><br/>Joseph-Gordon Levitt to me played his role amazingly with top notch acting and a true believability. What was nice to me was to see Paul Dano getting a much larger role where he truly gets to allow his acting skills to shine (I'm hoping this role launches him into stronger ones in the future). Emily Blunt did very well in her portrayal of ""The Rain Maker's"" mother.<br/><br/>Some people say that a lot of the scenes were left without being tied up, but to me I believe that every part which had you questioning what was going on was very neatly tied up in an ending which even I could not guess was going to happen.<br/><br/>Speaking of which: SUPERB ending. It absolutely blew me away and I actually had to rewind it three times to watch again. It simply did not register with me that this was actually how it ended, but in a good way. I spent a lot of the film trying to guess how it would end, but how it really ended just hit me from left field. It was excellent.<br/><br/>I think people are giving this movie bad reviews because the cast are not multi-million dollar actors.

I usually put a few in for authenticity but too many fantastic scenes keep coming back to me.<br/><br/>The violence was sometimes a bit shocking right from the opening scene but it wasn't gratuitous. If you shot someone in real life, I'm sure the person wouldn't daintily fall to the ground with glitter pouring out of the bullet hole so no complaints from me there.<br/><br/>There were times when the script became more serious then slapstick then comedic then violent and this occasionally jarred a bit but I decided I ultimately liked this because some films get stale part way through because it's the same thing over and over but with ""Looper"", I never got bored and each scene offered something different. Sometimes we have funny moments in life and sometimes we get serious so this is more true to real life than films that stay deadly serious all the way through to attain the ""serious film"" tag.<br/><br/>I don't often give films 10/10 (think I've done it once, not sure) but this deserves it.

I have to applaud the two leads, Levitt and Bruce Willis for doing an amazing job at playing the same guy. I do feel like the make-up and prosthetic for Levitt were almost too heavy and unneeded.

Joesph Gordon Levitt and Bruce Willis are pretty good in there roles has the same person, despite the heavy makeup put on Levitt, he really had you believing that he was a young Bruce Willis. Jeff Daniels is great has a crime boss. Emily Blunt is also good."

","Shanghai, 2074 - 55 year old Joseph Simmons (Bruce Willis) is sent back 30 years through time travel to be assassinated at the wish of a criminal fraternity which doesn't want the inconvenience of a body in a future when murder is hard to hide. Kansas, 2044 - 25 year old Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt with a nose made to look like that of Wilis) is the eponymous looper whose job is to kill those sent to him for execution, even if it is his older self (a process known as 'closing the loop'). London, 2012 - I enter the cinema excited to see a movie which has received such tremendous reviews but aware that the plotting is going to hurt my head. <br/><br/>Writer and director Rian Johnson has given us a wonderfully inventive narrative, but the trouble with time travel movies is that you struggle to understand all the rules and reconcile all the contradictions and then you realise that, try as you might, it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense.<br/><br/>But suspend belief and enjoy the ride for this is an exciting and well-plotted story that grabs you from the beginning and never stops shaking you up. As well as the two leads (good to see Willis still credible as the hard man after so long and encouraging to see Gordon-Levitt's growing success), there are some good support roles, notably Jeff Daniels playing against type as a vicious criminal overlord and the ever-watchable Emily Blunt eschewing her cut-glass English accent for a passable Kansas one. <br/><br/>And then there is that cute kid ((Pierce Gagnon) who may not be quite as innocent as he looks. A particularly enjoyable scene is when Old Joe meets Young Joe in a diner which reminded me a little of when Robert de Niro and Al Pacino meet in a similar setting in ""Heat""."

","Neglect the quality of the technical part of this film making, I think the ideas, philosophy behind this film is very profound. Especially when the writer explains the idea of causal and effect theory through a Sci-Fi film. In the film, there is no bad guys, and 'right or wrong'. there is only the cause of becoming bad and the effect it results in. It is not Cid's fault for becoming the future 'rain man', but what old Joe did to Cid is also not wrong in his point of view. Old Joe teleport himself to the past to kill Cid in order to prevent him from becoming the 'rain man' and lead to his wife's death. But he did not realise that his action is the cause of Cid to become 'rain man' and therefore indirectly results in his wife's death in future. A 'Loop' of fate is created. The young Joe realised this at the end and sacrifice his life to save Cid and himself from their fate. The 'Loop' of fate is broken. I think the writer gives the name 'rain man' is trying to show two characters of the future Cid: a heart that desired to bring hope and changes to the future (like the Spring rain gives life to plant), and a cold heart wished to clean all the 'dirt' in the world (like the cold Autumn rain)."

","I loved this, the story started with a punch, and kept me enthralled led till the very end.

The action scenes are amazingly executed for a man his age. <br/><br/>Blunt, well, beautiful, and what an actress, she is completely convincing, and likable to boot. The little boy, well, what an actor, he was perfect, if told what his role would involve prior to seeing this, I'd not have believed someone so young could have been so convincing in this role.<br/><br/>If your thinking its another time travel story, it isn't really, it's got a twist on the whole thing, and I'd even maybe go as far to say the time travel is fairly minor in the scheme of things. <br/><br/>It's a long film, luckily we saw it in gold class, so it was comfortable, In a standard cinema seat, I might have gotten a bit fidgety as it is long, but I didn't notice the length at all, it was gripping the whole way. <br/><br/>It does rate high on gory violence, nothing to bad, but definitely not kids film. <br/><br/>Go see this, it's well worth the money.

The two leads were perfect - Joseph Gordon-Levit was fantastic, and I cant wait to see him again soon and Bruce Willis was on his usual top class. I especially loved the directing, the editing also - for example, the opening scene was fantastic, the lack of music was especially memorable. Also, I loved the montage of Old Joe's life near the beginning. The Future design was especially enjoyable too. The design of the city was spot on and the retro 'blunderbusses' guns looked great too. As for the time travel, it was simple enough to get your head around, but not so easy that you didn't have to think about it, which I think is necessary in a Sci-Fi.

"IllusionOfLife","10","2","9","4 October 2012"," The Best Time Travel Film I've Seen in Years
","Looper, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, and Emily Blunt is set in the year 2044 where time travel has not yet been invented, but 30 years from then it will be. In that future, crime syndicates have gained widespread power, but due to advances in technology, murder and disposal of bodies has become increasingly difficult. The solution they have found to this problem is hiring hit men in the past called Loopers to execute and dispose of the people the mob wants gone; sending them back in time, bound and gagged, to meet with the business end of a Looper's blunderbuss. The story follows Joe, a Looper who is leading an extravagant, but self-destructive life off the considerable paycheck he gets for his particular line of work. However, that all changes when one day the person who is sent to be killed happens to be himself, 30 years from now.<br/><br/>Let me just cut right to the chase, Looper is incredible. It's the kind of truly unique, smart, entertaining, well told, and exciting film that reaffirms why we love the movies in the first place. I had been hearing some really high praise for this film so I went in with high expectations yet I was still completely blown away. The film understands its themes, its settings, and its characters, and uses all of these elements to their fullest effect. It never cheats by betraying its own integrity, and because of that is able to craft the best time travel story I've seen in years. Time travel is always a tricky thing to tackle. The very nature of it comes prepackaged with messy paradoxes and inconsistencies, but writer/director Rian Johnson establishes very clearly his rules for time travel in a way that doesn't get bogged down in endless exposition. It trusts is audience to be smart enough to fill in the details and sets up only as much of the mechanics as are necessary for the story. Because of that, though this is the kind of movie that certain types of people will hate (mostly stupid kids on the internet pretending to be smart) because they'll focus on trying to pick out any logic flaws with the plot and utterly miss the point of the narrative. However, despite being based around a plot device as inherently messy and illogical as time travel it establishes its rules firmly and never deviates. If you dig deep enough you're sure to find holes in the plot, but the narrative is absolutely rock solid, and that's what really matters.<br/><br/>Every element of this film helps to sell the story. The future in Looper feels like a real place and each scene is full of little details that, while never highlighted, help ground the film and paint a more vivid picture of this world. The film also boasts a slew of excellent performances. Gordon-Levitt and Willis are the obvious standouts, brilliantly playing the same person separated by 30 years of life experience. It's somewhat incredible how they have managed to capture the duality of that relationship; the reality that while you may be the same person in the literal sense, age and experience fundamentally changes who you are. It's an interesting theme and the film handles it masterfully, illustrating how time can change a person's goals, their priorities, and the things they are willing to sacrifice. I do kind of wish, though, that they hadn't given Joseph Gordon-Levitt the Bruce Willis makeup, because at times it can be slightly distracting, and the performances are honestly good enough to sell that these two characters are the same person without the need for makeup. It's a small complaint, but it's about the most I can find fault with in this film. The performances from the secondary characters also shine quite a bit in their own right. Every character feels real and textured, and it all contributes to the reality of this world.<br/><br/>The film also impressed me by not taking the obvious route concepts like this tend to take; instead it charts its own unique territory, creating a truly memorable experience. In some alternate universe there's probably a version of this movie that does exactly what you'd expect a film like this to do, and it's probably a solid and entertaining film. However, by taking the story in a direction that is different and unexpected Looper is so much more effective. There were several times during the film where I marveled at the quality of the story telling, taking seemingly throwaway details and later using them to lead to genuinely smart and surprising developments. Nothing in the film is wasted. Expectations are turned on their heads, and just about every time you think you've figured out where the film is going it will either go a different direction or get there in a way that is surprising. Despite this, it still remains absolutely true to itself and every single twist or development has the feeling of unexpected inevitability that is so crucial yet so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Looper is a fantastic film. It masterfully combines action, suspense, genuinely smart twists, and is all grounded by a compelling setting and a strong element of human emotion. It has jumped to the top of my favorite films of the year list, and is arguably one of the best time travel stories I've ever seen. I highly recommend this one. It is an absolute breath of fresh air and the kind of film that makes you fall in love with the movies all over again."

It establishes the world the characters live in and like a lot of sci-fi movies, it's a bit of a sh*t-hole. I was expecting it to be a little more slick and fancy. The middle is a little better though and introduces a couple of good characters. And the third act is actually good. The overall pacing is kinda slow and I ended up getting tired because of that.

"YohjiArmstrong","Null","1","3","7 May 2015"," Loop the Loop
","LOOPER is such a refreshingly good American film that it's almost possible to forget that it's essentially a B-movie. The plot is based on the idea that time travel will be invented in the future but will be criminalised, so that the only people to use it are the Mafia, who send their victims back in time to be killed in the past by specialised hit- men called Loopers. Once you accept that absurdity - and the presence of telekinetic powers - the film creates a simple but clever plot, in which one of these hit-men finds himself asked to kill his future, older self. He fails and soon finds the mafia after him, whilst his older self tries to hunt down the man who will kill his (their) wife in the future. The future is well imagined in low key ways - unusually for a SF flick, half the film is set in rural areas - and intelligent. What really sets it apart though is the cleverness of writer- director Rian Johnson, who elevates what ought to be a generic B- picture through a masterful use of music, writing, editing and image."

I can honestly say I had no idea where things were going with this movie, and I like the ultimate direction it took. I can see why people are impressed by Rian Johnson; the man's got vision and the makings of a great filmmaker. A little too much lens flare, although not to J.J. Abrams levels of excess. Nice eye candy here too, with the pretty ladies; the foxy Piper Perabo and ball-busting hayseed Emily Blunt. And even though the eyebrows are ridiculous, Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a great job of mimicking Willis' mannerisms. Not to mention anchoring the whole movie.<br/><br/>7/10"
"LloydBayer","7","1","3","30 May 2014"," Even with its centrally themed time paradox, Looper is an original and enjoyable science fiction film that relies on logic to dictate the narrative.
","If you thought Inception went overboard (pun unintended) with the whole dream within a dream within a dream, don't read any further. But like Inception and Memento before it, Looper is an intricately woven yarn that is very much a thinking man's movie; at least for the most part. Luckily, unlike the aforementioned films, writer-director Rian Johnson doesn't let it get to a point where we smell our own cerebral cortex cooking. Just when you raise a hand to scratch your head, the other hand snaps a finger in triumphant euphoria, as if solving a puzzle only moments before abandoning it.<br/><br/>The setup has Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing Joe, a mafia assassin in the year 2044. His narration tells us that although time travel is yet to be invented, it exists thirty years in the future. However, its use is condemned by the government but adopted by criminal organizations as a means of ""closing the loop"". This means ending an employee's tenure by sending him to the present, where a younger ""Looper"" waits in an abandoned field with just a loaded shotgun. Loopers are paid handsomely, typically silver bars for each kill. When a Looper receives gold bars it is a cause for immediate celebration, but also means they have thirty years to live as they have just killed their future self thus closing the loop in the future. On one such contract, Joe is faced with killing his future self (Bruce Willis) but hesitates to pull the trigger. This much is known from pre-release trailers. What follows is a diabolical fight for survival where both Joes, though each unrelenting, must find and eliminate ""The Rainmaker"", a person destined to become an ironfisted criminal mastermind responsible for closing all the loops.<br/><br/>This is a science-fiction movie that relies heavily on logic, but not necessarily the kind found in The Matrix. It's as simple as basic computer programming, where the outcome of an action depends on a pre-determined set of rules. IF you do this, THEN that will happen; as a paradox, the premise in this film is very similar to the 'Butterfly Effect'— a metaphysical theory where cause and effect play a fundamental role in a nonlinear state of progression. Simply put, Johnson's forte is in telling a story where the end justifies the means. Given the centrally themed time paradox, it becomes all the more profound that however obscure the future may seem, it is the present that determines the outcome of that future. This grain of thought powers the final act where both Joes, each with opposing agendas, work towards preventing a cataclysmic chain of events. As such, a vital plot development is omitted from the trailers, owing to which, some viewers may find that the film begins and ends without cohesion. Without spoiling much I can say that a sub-plot involving genetic mutation takes center stage towards the end.<br/><br/>Although I have referred to other movies of similar ilk, I am happy to report that Looper is conceptually original — all the more so when every other recent movie is a sequel or a remake or a remake of a remake. Add to this a solid performance from Gordon-Levitt who has appeared in more interesting films this year than Tom Cruise. As a younger Bruce Willis, it might take a while to get used to his facial prosthetics, but I am willing to wager that Gordon-Levitt watched quite a few of the former's movies to get the swagger right, complete with Willis' iconic smirk and grunt. Willis himself is back in form with a much needed departure from some half-made films he has chosen to merely appear in over the last couple of years. Together they form a great team and amusingly play the same person. A special mention goes to Emily Blunt, who although has more screen time than necessary, makes a refreshing change as a straight-talking, shotgun-wielding Southerner with very little trace of her native British accent. Her character brings in a questionable romantic element, but is also linked to a vital plot development. Finally, kudos to Johnson for a good attempt at skillfully presenting a sci-fi film that also has a film noir look and feel despite its futuristic setting. There are moments when you wish Johnson's script could have used Christopher Nolan's finesse, but that would be asking for too much. À la dual-wielding guns ablaze, Bruce Willis also gets his clichéd moments, but let's just say we would rather see Willis with a gun than a magic wand.<br/><br/>This is a recommended movie. You can either watch it now or risk watching it later — by this I mean your future self could be annoyed with your present self for not watching it sooner."

That's why it's called SF.<br/><br/>The setting and scenery was alternately. It looked brilliant with a Blade Runner-like feeling and sometimes it looked awful like the cars with those pasted solar-cells and a pipe (I think they found it in a cheap Radioshack store) to the fuel tank. The Star Wars-like flying motorcycles were beautifully designed.<br/><br/>Willis performed like an average actor and once again I felt like they used him to give this movie a particular standing. Gordon-Levitt pleasantly surprised me and fitted perfectly in his role from the beginning.

","Enjoyable SF effort from emerging auteur Rian Johnson, writer and director of the excellent 'Brick' and the very good (but not excellent) 'Brothers Bloom', 'Looper' is a challenging time-travel yarn, which finds Joseph Gordon-Levitt trying to unpick the tangled plot strands that run through what is a stylish future thriller. The make-up work to alter JGL and make him more Willis-like is remarkably good, and there's a functional matter-of-factness about the technology of the future that makes it easy to accept, a believable near(ish)-future, and the whole thing looks wonderful thanks to DP Steve Yedlin. But 'Looper' is not without issues. Being told more than once not to think about the implications of time travel felt patronising, even when it is the very excellent Jeff Daniels doing the telling - and Mr. J. could have done a lot worse than take a leaf out of the book of the superlative 'Primer' (find it, watch it) and Shane Carruth in that regard. It all goes a bit 'Witness' in the third act, but there is sufficient chemistry between Emily Blunt and JGL that the tension is maintained, and the climax is impactful and highly satisfying. What higher recommendation can there be for Mr. Johnson's abilities than the fact that he has delivered three episodes of the seminal 'Breaking Bad'? We should be awaiting his next project with bated breath."

","I saw this in the theater. My expectations were high after seeing the trailer and reading the early reviews. I was sadly highly disappointed. The trailer covers the first ""half"" of the movie. That section of the movie is great. It sets up the world and a very interesting plot. The second ""half"" flips the bird to the first part so it can drag you away kicking and screaming into a completely different movie. The rules of time travel are ignored and the plot setup in the first half is ignored. It goes from being a movie about fighting who you might become in the future to a movie about whether its OK to go back in time to kill Hitler when he was a baby. Even the transition to the second half is silly with a scene straight out of Benny Hill.<br/><br/>Oddly enough a lot of the people that have given this movie positive reviews have acknowledged that its seriously flawed. The standard excuse those people give for their positive reviews seems to be ""Well if we want Hollywood to keep taking chances on high concept sci-fi movies then we need to support movies like Looper.""

","The Short: A twisting science fiction thriller with brains, brawn, and originality that doesn't disappoint in the slightest.<br/><br/>Looper. Where to begin? Rian Johnson has directed an incredibly quality science fiction film that is truly original. It starkly goes against the grain, focusing on strong characters and an unique premise to drive forward one of the more intense and perplexing sic-fi action films since 2009's incredible genre bender District 9. <br/><br/>The first great element of Looper are the characters. Both main characters, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis, are complex character studies and are anything but the cut and dry sci-fi heroes (or anti-heroes) we have seen lately from other films (such as the recent Dredd). The true surprise here is kid actor Pierce Gagnon, who no doubt has a bright and versatile acting career ahead of him. Emily Blunt plays a great character as well, both strong willed and independent. The chemistry of all these actors is very strong on screen, and it truly makes for one completely unexpected but incredibly well presented casts that is serious, funny, intriguing, and scary all at the same time. <br/><br/>The true, and albeit unexpected, success is the incredible plot. It is told with finesse, executed and told in a manner that is both complex but comprehendible - it puts the latest box-office success films to shame. The time traveling premise is and old story telling feature, but Looper uses the time travel premise very differently and to a great effect - it's both perplexing and entertaining to see where the movie is going to go next. It is no doubt complex, but the way the story is told and presented is ingenious and leaves no one behind.<br/><br/>And with all the amazing premise and creativity of Looper, it would be easy to simply let all of the artistic value be a side thought. But Looper goes against the grain even in this area. While being tremendously entertaining, Looper is never short of being artistic - it is directed with attention paid in all departments. <br/><br/>With all of the brilliance this film offers, it must stumble somewhere, right? Aside from a mildly cheesy part and a minimalist backdrop (both subjective opinions), Looper is darn near perfect. The only nagging flaw that Looper has is some decidedly understated scenes that, in comparison to the rest of the film, feel low budget. But in context of the plot the cheesiness is explained thoroughly and makes sense, and the intended display of a darker, but much more approachable and realistic future (and a scary one) for a wider range of audiences, Looper delivers. <br/><br/>And everything else in-between is just as good. The action is strikingly violent and explosive, but none the less realistic and important to the main character of Joe and his metamorphosis throughout Looper. There is one rather strong scene of innuendo, but again it's used artistically - it's a huge character turning point for Joe and a massive stray away from his current life - one that he so desperately is conflicted to live.<br/><br/>In the end, Looper is a redemption story. One of sacrifice, death, life, and choice. It's anything but the cut and dry we have come to know and accept in film lately, and Looper is a refreshing science fiction action that has smarts and character to boot. The only nagging flaw are just a handful of low budget scenes that needed more umph. <br/><br/>Despite that single gripe, Looper is without a doubt the best science fiction film since District 9 and most likely the best time traveling movie ever made. <br/><br/>Strong Recommendation - 4/5"
"Spondonman","8","1","3","1 April 2013"," Time Will Tell
","I enjoyed this film a lot; you have to open your mind and travel back in time to when you were young and your mind was always open. The film needs the observer to take a loop, sorry, leap of faith because it does take some liberties with realities. It's full of exuberance, panache and loopholes but the plot contrivances don't bear up too well against post-analysis.<br/><br/>Baddies from 2074 dispose of their enemies by sending them back through time to be shot dead and incinerated in 2044. It would be too easy to send them straight into the furnace. The main character is momentarily nonplussed when his future self (Old Brucie) is sent back for slaughter leading to (both their) getaways from the 2044 baddies. The emphasis shifts slightly from time travel to telekinesis – obviously embracing 12 Monkeys, Source Code and even Children Of The Corn. It's a bloody two-dimensional chase, with even a motive for the ultimately pointless murder of two innocent children sympathetically portrayed and glossed over. The cgi cartoonery department were overused here too, what with suspended objects monetary or animate floating around – but Inception did it better. Also if a baddie from the future was chopped up in 2044 his 2074 self wouldn't be seen to fall apart dramatically limb by limb surely? By the end no matter how tender hearted the story has got you don't feel that interested in any of the characters, even to speculating how they obviously thought time could be changed just for themselves and no one else. Didn't any of them see Joan Collins in the original Star Trek for the logic to be explained simply? And on.<br/><br/>Engrossing, always interesting, well made and a current-time passer, thoughtful only don't think about it too much. And no, I don't want the 2 hours back."
"mkham6","7","1","3","1 April 2013"," Enjoyable character study even if premise is dubious
","Seriously disagree with the many reviews trashing this movie. Yes, the basic premise is idiotic- sending people back in time to be killed, but watching the relationship between Gordon-Levitt and his older self Bruce Willis is loads of fun, Gordon Levitt is becoming the go-to young actor for action flicks (""Shutup, kid"")- he plays the young Bruce stupid: even after there is no reason to kill his older self, he keeps trying as though it's a point of honor. Yes, the paradoxes of time travel are unresolvable- EVERY movie has huge holes- don't let it bother you. It is so entertaining I saw it again 2 days later (very rare)- it helps to understand the convoluted plot- watching one target's fingers and limbs disappear as his younger self is butchered in the past is viscerally chilling, but I missed it the first time.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is solid, sexy, and very credible; and Jeff Daniels has a meaty role as mob kingpin manager of the past."
"mistabobdobolina","7","1","3","19 March 2013"," A strong, but flawed, SF actioner.
","There are a few of the persistent criticisms of Looper that genuinely stick.<br/><br/>The biggest of them is that the plot device of the 'looper' is arm-wavy in the extreme, and doesn't stand up to close scrutiny; a lot of whether you can like or not like the film will depend on whether it falls for you at that hurdle or not. It's basically never entirely clear why it's so difficult to dispose of future bodies that time-travel is a preferable alternative (along with a host of other things, like ""why send them back alive?"" and ""how is it that only the mob has this technology?"" and ""why have 'loopers' close their own loops?""), so you have to either decide to suspend disbelief for that or not.<br/><br/>It has also been pointed out that (this is a SPOILER) having Old Joe kill a toddler on his Terminator-esque mission to assassinate an evil criminal mastermind called the Rainmaker (whose men accidentally murder his future wife in the course of trying to 'close his loop') is rather cheap upping of the ante; I think it is valid, if horrific -- and the horrific nature of it underscores that Old Joe (Bruce Willis) is *not* on a heroic mission -- but that it could have been handled better and less manipulatively.<br/><br/>Lastly, it's been pointed out that the women in Looper suffer from Frank Miller Syndrome: they're almost all some variant of prostitute or junkie (current or former) with weird issues around motherhood. That isn't good and it gets distracting once one notices it.<br/><br/>The other common gripes about the movie look to me like cases of viewer inattention than flaws in the film itself. The time travel mechanics are straightforward and make perfect sense, the filmmakers make a good decision in having the characters *not* spend the whole movie explaining time travel to one another (much less the politics and socioeconomics of the setting -- no thank you, two-hour features are not a good venue for that). The action is appropriate and for the most part refreshingly restrained, and the one scene that isn't restrained is illustrating a specific point (about the relative back-woodness of Young Joe's Kansas mob operation that's been repeated throughout).<br/><br/>Some people complain about suspending disbelief for telekinesis, but it's no more or less science-fantasy territory at this point than time travel is; others complain that there were ""two movies,"" one about time travel and one about TK, but that is false (TK is the Chekov's gun of the setting, mentioned earlier on and primed to go off by the third act, and is a good shorthand for the expansion of human potential). The cinematography is stunning, the performances (barring a few false notes from Emily Blunt) are excellent -- especially Gordon-Leavitt's Young Bruce Willis homage, which manages not to be an impersonation -- the story is involving, and on the whole I recommend it."

"Al_The_Strange","8","1","3","7 January 2013"," ""The path is a circle, round and round.""
","It seems like I've seen the trailer for this film all year in 2012. The preview in itself presented a unique concept, in which a hired gun shoots people who are time-warped into the past. Then he winds up having to hunt and shoot his future self. What a twist! All that in itself seemed like a good premise for an action-packed sci-fi thriller with maybe some food for thought. Seeing the film in its entirety, I got to admit that the previews didn't do this film justice. Sure, there is action, thrills, and style, but the man-vs-himself plot didn't really take the center stage like I thought it would. If anything, the film felt like it was cut into two distinct halves: the first is pretty much everything I expected (lots of gangsters in a futuristic city with occasional bursts of violence), but the second half ventures into some fairly unpredictable territory.<br/><br/>The story is brimming with intriguing ideas and implications. I'm still not sure if the time-traveling mechanics are 100% foolproof; it's definitely not hard sci-fi (and it won't be as deep as something like Primer). However, the film lays out its concepts and rules coherently, and shows them in interesting ways. What really makes it work will be its characters, who show a fair amount of development, and plenty of emotional resonance. The film goes on to show a whole world of people struggling to hold onto things precious to them. The ""loop"" of the movie is not so much about time travel, as it is endless circles of violence, vengeance, and hate that other people inflict on one another (and maybe even themselves). As such, the film's final solution is quite brilliant.<br/><br/>The film looks slick and stylish. Photography and editing are pretty decent. Acting is great: Joseph Gordon-Levitt is quite earnest in his role, and does a tremendous job of showing enough nuance to match up with Bruce Willis, who is still as badass as ever. Writing is decent. This production has its fair share of good-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects, but it's most noteworthy for depicting a future that's not overly fantastic, but truly does look plausible. Music is quite intense.<br/><br/>Chances are good that most casual audiences will enjoy this flick, but fans of sci-fi, action, and crime films should definitely check this out.<br/><br/>Recommended! 4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Good)"
"paudie","7","1","3","2 January 2013"," Entertaining Time travel thriller
","If you don't think about the science too much (as Bruce Willis recommends during the movie) you will probably enjoy Looper as much as I did.<br/><br/>It is set in the near future. Further into the future again Time Travel has been invented and is used by criminals there to send people they want to ""dispose of"" back in time to be summarily executed by ""Loopers"". Our ""hero"" is Joe, a Looper played by Joseph Gordon Levitt. They are well paid for this work but know that is highly likely that they themselves, if they live long enough will be tracked down by their former employers and sent back in time to be killed by their younger selves before they know who their latest victim is, hence closing the ""loop"".<br/><br/>Suffice it to say, Joseph Gordon Levitt changes into Bruce Willis as the years go by and is sent back in time. I'm not giving much away by revealing that this particular loop closure doesn't go as planned. Both versions of Joe go on the run from the criminals that wanted him dead. Along the way they cross paths with single mother, Sara and her rather peculiar son, Cid. They have an interesting part to play in the plot also.<br/><br/>The movie is a satisfying mix of action, sci-fi and even a bit of romance."

"eshwarmail","7","1","3","28 December 2012"," Manages to stay afloat even after treading on prohibited territory abandoning the most desirable path.
","I have strong mixed feelings about this movie. Lets have a quick look at what those mixed reactions are<br/><br/>Whats Good? Great fusion of genres - mutations, time travel, generic sci-fi and superhero. Popular casting of actors who the audience love to see. Screenplay that holds your attention for most of the runtime. Interesting concept bringing back memories of the Terminator. A terrific performance by Pierce Gagnon as an emotionally volatile kid with a powerful ability. Most of all, it has some powerful moments that touch your heart.<br/><br/>Whats Bad? Introduction with a flat storyline that doesn't raise a pulse until the young kid shows up who is the heart and soul of the movie. The gimmick to make Levitt look like Bruce Willis was a farce beyond repair. And Bruce Willis looked so out of place with both his mannerisms and lines until he was given a gun and allowed to go bombastic. It suffers the same fate as most other time travel based stories do - impossible flawed conclusion. Future self meeting the current man can lead to very interesting conversation, this moment was ruined with just more bang bang.<br/><br/>Concept: In the future when bodies are impossible to dispose off, criminal gangs make use of the already invented time travel technology to send people back 30 years who they want to get rid off. A 'Looper' waits for the person to arrive, kills them and dispose off the body. A Looper gets well paid but there is a catch. At some point a future self of the Looper will be sent back who is to be killed the same way as any other but comes with a big payday and a retirement. Letting a kill get away is a death warrant. <br/><br/>Story: Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a Looper. When his future self (Bruce Willis) comes back, a moment's hesitation allows older Joe to get the best of him. After a few tussles, tracking down etc., older Joe tells the story about a man calling himself The Rainmaker who spells deadly terror in the future taking down all the criminal syndicates and closing down all the loops. He has narrowed down on the Rainmaker's identity who will now be just a kid (Pierce Gagnon) son of Sara (Emily Blunt) and wants to take him down.<br/><br/>Movies involving time travel should have some basic elements right for them to work since the concept by itself is flawed anyway. Either the plot has to be extremely complex to take the viewer's mind of the general logics that surrounds it, or overcome it with downright entertainment. Looper falls short on both directions. Levitt's makeup to look like Bruce Willis makes him incapable of conveying the right expressions. No great innovation or awe in the special effects department either. Bruce Willis first few dialogues with Levitt are laughable and can be mistaken for The Expendables. But with some smart screenplay, charismatic Emily Blunt and a performance by Pierce Gagnon that could blow you away. <br/><br/>Manages to stay afloat even after treading on prohibited territory abandoning the most desirable path."
"dgefroh","6","1","3","20 November 2012"," Looper throws YOU for a loop
","This original screenplay has some elements that are truly unique and inventive, the concept while done before in other movies is really borderline brilliant. That said you may be wondering why all the negative reviews and why I'm only giving it a 6 out of 10 rating. The problem with this one, and in my opinion a fairly big problem is that the theme or plot is difficult to surround. The characters try and set up the premise of the story but it never truly comes clear to the viewer. You'll spend the entire movie trying to figure how, what, and why things happen as they do. I like movies where you are required to think and make assumptions involving characters and plot lines, but this movie just flat out leaves too many blank spots in the story and character development. While the action is good, the acting competent, and there is enough good to sustain your interest right to the bitter end, the flaws are just to big to make this attempt anymore than an average movie with what could of been an exceptional and original idea."

Very little happens apart from Both Joes killing people, the time travel is utter nonsense, to make the film work older Joe has to come back twice, and get this instead of being killed the first time so that he gets the money and goes to china, he escapes the first time, then ten minutes later for no reason the scene is repeated and this time he get killed, then we go back to young joe out to get and kill old joe. then halfway through we go into another plot the shooting stops for a while and the film tries to get deep and serious. full or pretension and utterly boring."

","-SPOILERS!- I got chance to see this movie before it's release here at Finland, and I after having to suffer Taken 2 on the same week, Looper was highly enjoyable.<br/><br/>Now I am not saying that Looper wouldn't be good if you have still bad taste in your mouth from last movie you saw on theater, but so far as I have seen Avengers, In time, Cabin in the woods, and other fictive movies of 2012, some of them more or less disappointing, some of them actually good, Looper clearly takes the lead as best fictive movie of 2012.<br/><br/>Looper is smart science fiction movie, a good example of what should be more. Looper doesn't go overboard like Inseption, it doesn't try to be more than it is. It uses theme of time traveling well, making it really interesting, leaving many possibilities open, some questions behind. It is smart, however, if you start to think few things in the movie with logic, some of the scifi stuff may feel like huge cliché, but I think after seeing movies like Transformers and In time, those clichés are minor.<br/><br/>Looper also has nice old noir gangster feel to it, that mixes nicely with the scifi parts of it. At times, I bet that there are stories behind characters, maybe caused by a lot further messing with time that haven't been explained, especially at the very end of the movie.<br/><br/>As for actors, we have good old Bruce Willis with his known gritty look on his face, with well chosen Joseph Gordon-levitt who actually looks like, acts like and feels like lot younger versio of Bruce Willis. Hell, at times, I bet Jopesh even spent daily hour or two in front of mirror, trying to imitate that gritty look of Bruce Willis, succeeding.<br/><br/>Highly recommend."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>In the year 2074, Joe (Joseph Gordon Levitt) is a contract killer who eliminates targets sent from the future on behalf of the mob. However, one night his associate Seth (Paul Dano), visits him in distress, saying how he's failed to kill a contract, that appears to be an older version of himself sent from the future. Pursued by mob boss Abe (Jeff Daniels) and his gang, Joe must keep his watchful eye on him, until he makes the same mistake and fails to kill his older self (Bruce Willis.) The pair form an uneasy partnership as they evade capture, while looking out for the mysterious 'Rainmaker', who will close all the 'loops' and wipe them all out.<br/><br/>In the 80s, and some of the 90s, Bruce Willis's name could be guaranteed to be splashed across the poster of the latest, big budget action movie, and although he basically played himself in every one of them, his presence and star quality could carry it through. But, now noticeably older and greyer, his name is pushed to the supporting side of the poster, and he's less of a big deal. But then, action films, and indeed films in general, would seem to have changed since then, and now film makers seem to be trying to out do each other with how cerebral they can make their film. With Looper, Rian Johnson is obviously quite influenced by Christopher Nolan, and his style of film making. But, while Inception really pushed the mind beyond it's boundaries, Looper just gets lost in the process.<br/><br/>Johnson sails his project along, clearly thinking it's the most intelligent and sophisticated thing since sliced bread, but although it might appeal to the most pretentious film students and academics, I think the average person will just find it really over complicated and far fetched, if not downright nonsensical. Wisely, Johnson doesn't become self indulgent and drag it out any way over two hours, but even by this time it feels it's dragged on and has become incredibly boring. Performances wise, in the lead roles, Gordon-Levitt and Willis create a fairly decent double act, but it's the supporting cast who let it down. Dano was brilliant as the weak preacher in There Will Be Blood, but turns in a pretty terrible performance here, really whiny and irritating, while as the villain, Daniels still can't shake off being Harry from Dumb and Dumber.<br/><br/>It's clear this will become a cult film, a real love it or hate it case. but I think the two camps will be pretty distinctive on both sides. **"

","Looper is a movie based on the idea of time travel. Time travel is a concept that rises philosophical and logical questions in itself if someone starts to think about it too deeply. However, Looper is no more difficult than any other time travel movies, and it doesn't take too much effort to follow the story, to understand what is happening and why.<br/><br/>In Looper, time travel is invented in year 2074. It becomes outlawed, but it is used by criminal organizations to send people they want to get killed back in time where paid assassins are waiting for them. The assassins are called loopers, because when their contract ends, they themselves are sent back in time as well and get killed the same way, thus closing a loop. The complications begin when Joe, a looper, encounters his older self as one of his targets sent back to him into year 2044. <br/><br/>The movie is visually pleasant with well constructed scenes. It's up to the standards of a modern science fiction movie with all the bells and whistles, for example levitating objects and slow motion sequences of unrealistic scenarios.<br/><br/>Sound effects and the soundtrack are OK, although there is nothing extraordinary. There are no tunes or sounds that will get stuck in your ear for a long time, but it doesn't mean the movie is lacking anything in this respect.<br/><br/>Overall, the scenes are well designed, and there is a certain distinguished tone and mood throughout which fits the plot well. There are a few humorous scenes too, which are about right in their style and quantity. It is still a science fiction action movie.<br/><br/>The cast stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis and Emily Blunt, all of whom are well established actors/actresses. We can't go wrong with Bruce Willis when it comes to action movies, and the others play equally well if not better.<br/><br/>In my personal opinion it is not going to become a classic or cult movie, there is nothing groundbreaking about it. On the other hand it is a very decent workmanship, which is well above average, definitely worth watching for those who like the genre."

"evan_harvey","6","1","3","13 October 2012"," It's okay, but feels half-baked
","Looper isn't a bad film, but not a great film. Rian Johnson (writer/director) lives in the indie realm, and the film reflects that, even though he's suddenly got a lot of cash to spend. It's got an interesting idea, but somehow doesn't gather enough steam. There are heaps of minor plot-holes (as you'd expect with an ambitious sci-fi film). Overall I felt it was a low-budget film that got a whole bunch of funding.<br/><br/>Some parts were ingenious, but others felt cheap. Like using killers who seemed to be more like wild teenagers than killers. I guess that was supposed to show the depravity of the youth of the day, but it lacked gravitas. I can see the appeal of the idea, but it felt faked.<br/><br/>Or that Bruce Willis (**spoilers**) decides to go killing kiddies, but the audience isn't really shown the emotion that drives that decision. Yes, you see the wife get shot, yes there's mention of some future killer, but it's not enough to mention it. You have to show it. And the script doesn't.<br/><br/>The story also doesn't show just how bad the ""Rainmaker's"" reign of terror is. This is important because when the Rainmaker is shown to be a child, the juxtaposition would have been much more dramatic.<br/><br/>And adding the fact that Bruce Willis bringing zero emotion to the role doesn't help much either.<br/><br/>To summarise, I was mildly disappointed. To be fair, it was okay, and nice to see an intelligent sci-fi film (especially after the insult that was the Total Recall remake), but I just didn't find it tight enough narrative or plot-wise. And Joseph Goron-Levitt looked weird and plasticky. 6 out of 10."

They deal with the time-travel associated paradoxes in a satisfactory manner without creating much confusion. And had they just made the whole thing into a sci-fi action flick without aiming for more depth, it might have been a pretty good movie. But, after having put in elements of X-Men and The Terminator, and spending considerable screen time on unnecessary dialogues and passive scenes if you try to go for emotional depth, its bound to be a pretty hollow movie, isn't it? They tried hard, too hard perhaps to make it into a deep/meaningful film, ending up introducing misfitting stereotypical drama in my opinion.<br/><br/>To sum it up it tried to hard to be something that its not thus missing up on all that it might have been. But, if I were you I would go watch it despite these words, for even though it doesn't pack a punch it does have some good cinematography and a very clean ending."

","Looper has got loose ends and loops here and there, but Rian Johnson found a way to make simple a time travel movie without too much time travel back and forth.<br/><br/>Looper was written and directed by Rian Johnson who teamed up with producer Ram Bergman, who produced Johnson's previous two films; it stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis, Levitt was a co-star in the movie Inception which had a story around travelling into the mind of people and Willis himself has had a taste of time travel with his movie 12 Monkeys in 1995. <br/><br/>For me the reason I will advise anyone to see this movie will be the intrigue this movie delivers, from a story arc that curves around selfish ambitions. Johnson's version of the future in 2044 is also something you will like to see, with 10 percent of the world possessing the power of tele-kinetics, all morals gone out the window and an economic meltdown the world was in chaos.<br/><br/>The story curves around two different times 2044 and 2074, in 2074 time travel is invented but illegal. Due to the fact that everyone is tagged in the future it was nearly impossible to commit murder, so the Mob had to find a way to get rid of people that they didn't want.<br/><br/>The mob uses the time travel invention which is illegal to send men they don't want to the past to be killed, the assassins that do the killings are called Loopers.<br/><br/>The job of a looper has a twist, after a while the Mob closes the loop on the looper by sending him a man to kill who happens to be himself 30 years from 2044. Now that is where the movie gets tricky. 2044 has two Joes, Young Joe from 2044 (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Old Joe from 2074 (Bruce Willis) which young Joe failed to kill although he tried.<br/><br/>Although Looper slacks in the area of the story itself, the character Cid is a little too psycho to be believable but the movie is fun to see.<br/><br/>The directing is top notch, the special effects are not so much in the high side and you can boast that you have seen better child actors, but hey! You will enjoy the time spent watching this thriller."
"dfranzen70","7","2","10","1 October 2012"," Super Looper
","It's not fair to simply call Looper a brainy time-travel movie, because it's so much deeper than that. It's like Inception, only much less convoluted; provocative without being overwrought. It's the odd time- travel movie that understands the limitations inherent in the genre and not only doesn't gloss over them, it embraces them and makes them part of the fun. I found it so engrossing that I actually overthought one element of the story, thinking it meant something when it turned out not to. <br/><br/>The year is 2044, and life sucks just about everywhere. Cities are slums. Even cornfields aren't safe from ravaging hobos. It's bleak, like most futures are in the movies. Time travel, we're told, hasn't been invented yet. But by 2074, it will have been. And in 2074, the government is so on top of things that the bleakness of 2044 looks Paradisal by comparison. They outlaw time travel so that only outlaws can time travel. In this case, that would be organized crime. When they want someone to disappear permanently like, they send him back in time to 2044, where an assassin shoots him dead. Much more fun than dumping his body in the Pine Barrens. This erases all trace of the dearly departed. Clean, tidy.<br/><br/>The assassins are called Loopers. They don't know who they're shooting. Their prey arrives on a blanket at a particular time and place, head covered in a bag, hands bound. The Looper shoots, turns the victim over, and claims his pay in silver bars, which are big in 2044. <br/><br/>Loopers have one standing order: don't let your man get away. Shoot to kill. Even if he's you. And that's the crux of this thriller, when Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) finds himself face to face with...well, himself. His 2074 self, Old Joe (Bruce Willis). Yup, that's who the mob's sent back. This is known as closing the loop, and it means your contract's been terminated. Oh, you can live your life as long as you want, but you won't be a cold assassin anymore, which kind of stinks. At any rate, there's more to it than just a loop closure. Old Joe promptly escapes his execution and is a man on a mission. He needs to kill someone in 2044 so that they don't become someone bad in 2074. That's a mission we can all get behind, right?<br/><br/>Young Joe, for lack of a better distinction, has troubles of his own. First, he isn't supposed to be free, what with his victim getting away (the entire city is looking for him). Second, he's a junkie, hooked on some future drug that you drop into your eyeballs. His own men are looking for him, he needs to find Bruce Willis, and what the heck does all of this have to do with the future, anyway? Man, a whole lot, it turns out, a whole lot. <br/><br/>Let me put it this way. At first, you think Old Joe is just on a personal vendetta - which he is. But it's more than that. What he wants to do could make things a heck of a lot better in good ol 2074. But that conflicts with what Young Joe has in mind, which is to finish his job and take off for France (don't ask).<br/><br/>The movie is existential. How did Old Joe get in the position of being sent back by the mob? He IS Joe, after all, and the Joe we know seems to have his head on his shoulders. What happens? Bad stuff, apparently. But back to the existentiality of it all. Let's pose a question - if you had a chance to kill a future terrorist, would you? Is the answer an easy one? What if the baby future terrorist wouldn't become said terrorist if certain branches in his life had led to different conclusions? The old time-travel movies make it much simpler: if you see yourself in the future, that screws things up. If old you kills young you, that means you're dead, too. This movie mashes all of that together and strips out the boring parts. That makes for a really intelligent sci-fi thriller. Tough to find.<br/><br/>Twists abound. I can't even begin to describe one without giving away another. Heck, Young Joe's not even a really sympathetic character. I mean, he's a nice guy, but the man sells out his friend within the first ten minutes of the movie, so he's not super awesome. Plus did I mention he's a cold-blooded killer? He is. And he is constantly faced with the consequences, ever unreeling, of not only his actions but those of Old Joe and countless other characters. Turns upon turns, a Moebius strip of plot lines.<br/><br/>What's really at the center of the movie, the most terrifying aspect, isn't even touched on until the movie's mostly over. You think the blunderbuss that Young Joe has or the Glock that Old Joe procures are bad-ass weapons? There's another one much worse. I'm talking Stephen King worse. Oh yes.<br/><br/>Both Gordon-Levitt and Willis (who do resemble each other here) give commanding, top-notch performances. Earnest without being dull; determined without being infallible. Unheroic, except sometimes. They're strongly supported by Jeff Daniels as Gordon-Levitt's boss, Paul Dano as Young Joe's best friend, and Emily Blunt as the mother of a small, strange child. <br/><br/>Looper is an awe-inspiring movie, the one that continues to resonate well after the curtain's fallen. What does it mean? Well, it's easier to pinpoint the meaning here than in movies like The Tree of Life and other New-Age nonsense, but it's the kind of movie that wisely leaves questions unanswered. And the last scene is a powerful, poignant, delicious ending. It ain't the best movie in the world (there are some unanswered questions that really should have been answered), but it's damn good among its genre."
"bigcalkenobi","10","3","19","30 September 2012"," Looper is one of the most creative pieces of storytelling I've seen in a while because of its very smart and clever concept and character driven core
","Looper begins by introducing us to Joe(Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who is a looper, a man who kills people sent back in time from 30 years in the future. In the future the mob has a hard time killing people so they utilize the outlawed method of time travel to cover their tracks by sending their victims back in time before they exist. Loopers get to live life large as they are paid handsomely and don't have to worry about the interference of the law as they are killing people who do not technically exist. The catch is that loopers will eventually ""close their loop"" by killing older versions of themselves once the mob of the future decides that they are no longer of use to them. Things start to become to get a lot more real for Joe when his friend and fellow looper Seth(Paul Dano) lets his older self get away. Joe tries to cover for Seth by hiding him, but eventually Joe's boss Abe(Jeff Daniels) is able to talk him down and convinces Joe to turn Seth over. Not long after this Joe's older self(Bruce Willis) appears as one of his targets without a hood on which causes Joe to hesitate. Old Joe gets away, but the two eventually reunite in a diner they are both familiar with. In what is possibly one of the strongest scenes in the entire movie, the two confront each other as old Joe tries to convince young Joe to skip town and leave him to work. Eventually the two both lay their cards on the table and a really cool fight ensues. Once the two separate the movie slows down as the movie begins setting up for some truly tough and thought provoking moral dilemmas that will challenge both versions of Joe.<br/><br/>Read the full review: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-hu"

"remyarcher","8","2","11","1 October 2012"," Not entirely original but a smart sci-fi film!
","Time-travel is a messy endeavor and making movies about time traveling usually leaves gaping plot holes. Make no mistake about it, Looper is not entirely original but it is the freshest take on time-traveling in movies since the Spanish thriller 'Timecrimes'. In fact, pay close attention and you'll see the DNA strands of 'The Terminator', NBCs 'Heroes', and yeh...even 'Timecrimes'. But that's not a bad thing. Rian Johnson manages to take his original idea and borrow small elements of those aforementioned works to make his creation that much more compelling.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt is THE go-to young actor of this generation. Not only does the incredible makeup job transform him into a younger Bruce Willis, but JGL's acting BECOMES a Bruce Willis of sorts - all the way down to his smarmy grin :-). JGL's performance alone is worth the price! Bruce Willis is perfect as a well-aged John McClain Everyman.<br/><br/>The mind-numbing problem of time traveling is well addressed in this movie and I thought that the loose ends tied up well enough to keep the most jaded viewer involved<br/><br/>(SLIGHT SPOILER) What I really liked about Looper was the blending of two separate genres into a broader set-piece: Time-travel and superpowers. I won't say anything more about the plot, but any lifelong fan of sci-fi movies will recognize a little bit of the original Terminator (thats a high compliment), and other meta-physical movies.<br/><br/>LOOPER was my 3rd most anticipated movie of 2012. The 1st was 'Prometheus' - which underwhelmed me. The second movie was 'Marvel's The Avengers' which was everything I was hoping for and more. LOOPER definitely delivered as a treat for the eyes and the mind. A thinking person's action film."
"dantesh88","7","2","11","1 October 2012"," Good film but some problems prevent it being a classic (some spoilers)
","First of all I want to make it clear that in my opinion this is a good film and people should see it. However I don't think it is a 5/5 star film ""the new Matrix"" or whatever, there is too much hyperbole surrounding it. <br/><br/>I simply don't think the film is as good as Brick, the previous Johnson/Gordon-Levitt film, and not as good in terms of delivery as Twelve Monkeys.<br/><br/>So the positives are great acting, a good premise, a good opening act, some great shots and the future city/society looks pretty convincing ('vagabonds' everywhere, social decline, rampant crime and violence, a drug fueled elite partying it up in strip clubs whilst millions go hungry outside... hey, this maybe is the present?!). Willis is good in the role, and there are some great one liners peppered throughout the film.<br/><br/>And I also don't think the time travel premise is the problem. Too many reviewers on IMDb are complaining about the time paradoxes and the plot holes - hold on everyone, it is a time travel movie, they will always have some level of paradox in them because time travel is always paradoxical. Anyone who thinks you can make a 'perfect' time travel movie has yet to show how it can be practically done, since every instance of time travel creates an alternative world anyway. Only the Canadian TV show Continuum really deals with this issue by leaving the question about whether the time travel has already happened ambiguous (i.e. has the future world already been created by the act of traveling back in time, in which case the show can become utterly deterministic since it has 'already happened'). Anyway I digress, don't get too bothered about time travel based plat holes, what stops the movie being a classic is a question of how it was delivered, not its sci fi credentials.<br/><br/>For me the movie was not engaging enough for its length. It dragged from the middle onwards because it relocated the action from the gritty, grim dystopian city to a farmhouse which looked like it could have been in a movie from the 1950s. Johnson should have stuck with the tone and pacing of the first half more closely, because then the movie spins off into another film about a boy with powerful psychic abilities and a moral dilemma about whether he will grow up to become the supreme baddie or not. Willis thinks so, Gordon-Levitt believes that we can make our own fate and the child can grow up to be good, but this moral story line is grafted onto the previous one about fighting your future self. That for me was the core of the film, the second act pretty much neglects it in favour of some farmyard based children of the corn/village of the damned action. <br/><br/>And the problem was tone, we went from city to countryside, different mood, colours and pacing and it slowed everything down. Willis' quest to kill the boy before he becomes some major baddie was a bad idea, it was a story too far and it meant that it included a load of stuff about telekinesis which is crucial to the plot but was not integrated into the story in any meaningful way. Then it becomes a story about time travel and telekinesis but without exploring one or the other that well. <br/><br/>My contribution to how to make the film better would have focused on the time travel aspects a bit more. The most gruesome bit in the film is when they track down another escaped target from the future by carving up his younger self, as they do so the future guys body starts to disappear, his fingers, nose, legs and so on. That was gripping body horror stuff which could have been done effectively at the end. Imagine Willis and Gordon-Levitt squaring off against each other, totally outmatched (like Dekkard and the Replicant at the end of Blade Runner) and the younger version has to break his own fingers or shoot his hand off to stop Willis from killing him - it could have taken place in a disused warehouse or similar dystopian trope. Been done before? Maybe, but the tension between the younger and older version and the cat and mouse game between them could have made a much more impressive story."

","I've seen many movies in my life (even though I am still pretty young) but this one, I don't think I'll ever find a word to describe it. It was more than just what it seems like. The beauty in this movie literally took the breath out of me. The actors were fantastic. They delivered an amazing performance. They made all of this, feel so real. I could feel their pain and understand their actions. At one point, Bruce Willis was just being the man who we fell in love with in his action movies which made many people (who have seen him before) laugh. Maybe not out loud, but it sure did put a smile on many faces. One of the thing I also enjoyed, was the wittiness. We have to admit that Rian Johnson is a gifted man for writing a scenario like that one. Everything was perfect. The story flows sweetly even with those jumps in time that might confuse some of us. But since it was written with such a precision, a dazzling imagination and an unparalleled beauty, you will always find a meaning in the end and that sure blows people's mind. What I adored about this film also was that it was of all kind. The action was great, there was a few pretty funny moments, the romance, and I could go on and on. But the one thing that made this movie the best I've ever seen is the final scene. (I will not spoil) I believe that it was one of the best endings ever written. The words Joe said, tell us perfectly how beautiful but dark life can be. And I have to show all my sincere respect for what he did. My heart stopped at those words. I was left speechless."

"migueloliveira-16","7","1","4","29 March 2014"," Looper
","Directed by Rian Johnson and with stars like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis and Emily Blunt the movie Looper is a sci-fi creative movie, that uses the time-traveling as premise to a crime movie. In the year 2074, when the mob wants to get rid of someone they send it back in time where the loopers (hired guns) will be expecting them. It was a very ""creative"" idea the mobsters in the future had (also creative in the perspective of the writer, of course), to send a man back in time, with his hands tied and a hood covering their faces, and in the past a hired gun expecting with what looked like a shotgun to kill and get his reward. Eventually the loop has to be closed and when it's time for Joe (Gordon- Levitt) to kill his self future he hesitates because he was without the usual hood (it would have prevented him seeing it was him).<br/><br/>Old Joe had once a wife, but she was killed by someone named The Rainmaker. Young Joe meets a women, Sara and her son Cid. They slowly grow close, but Cid in the future may be a different and evil person, and events in the past obviously can affect the future...<br/><br/>One of the most thought provoking scenes is when the two Joes are talking to each other in a dinner. Imagine all the possibilities and questions you could ask your older self!<br/><br/>In a movie like this it's easy to fail at some points in the time- traveling, because it's a complex theme that needs to be well thought before filming because otherwise in the end the impossibilities may be a little to much. I think the movie didn't fail at it but you have to assume some things don't need explanation, like the fact that it was impossible to kill someone in the future, or that the loop has to be closed sometime. The film lives up to his rules of time-travel and confronts the many implications of time travel in a way that makes you think what would be like if time traveling really existed."
"Floated2","7","1","4","6 November 2013"," Creative Sci-Fi Film That Falls Short towards the End
","Looper was an entertaining, stylish film and was creative and original. I very much so enjoyed the first part of the movie. It was refreshing, and a breath of fresh air. We see how Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) lives, what he does for a living, him telling us about the future, and the explanation of Looper and loops are brought to us. It was a really interesting premise of how they would kill off future gang members in order to keep their present under control.<br/><br/>The first half was filled with action, sci-fi entertainment, stylish use of loopers, others characters demonstrating the use of loopers as well, and an overall great pace. We then see how the film drastically changes it's genre once we see Joe escape into a cane field (about 50 minutes in). A few scene later, we see a lady (Emily Blunt) outside her house with her shotgun preparing to attack whomever or whatever is hiding in her fields. Her introduction was very solid put then as the film goes on we see her be a major factor in the film. From an action, sci-fi film, the second half settles into a drama with occasional action scenes (provided by older Joe- Bruce Willis wanting to hunt down the ""Rainmaker"" in order for his wife to have lived in his future). I thought this part of the film was well done as we were still interested in what Willis was doing.<br/><br/>I feel that the entire part involving Emily Blunt slightly dragged a little too much. We then get introduced to her child (Cid) whom is a very out going kid that wants to know all of his surroundings. Then we eventually see him interact with Joe and around this scene is where the film starts its fall. Cid's presence was more into the film and it became quite silly. We then learn that he is not actually the child of the mother but adopted and was kept secret by Sara (from a discussing involving Cid and Joe at night around the table) and that he has telekinesis. We also get more clear as it becomes more evident that he is indeed the ""Rainmaker"" which Older Joe is looking for. As this happens, we see Older Joe hunting down kids and killing them thinks are the ""Rainmaker"". He kills off two kids believing at the time they were the ""Rainmaker"" but he quickly notices they were not (they were three possible options so this brightens his eye's as he is the only possible one left). <br/><br/>Fast forward to the last few scenes, Sara and Cid are escaping from their home in danger and we see Older Joe in the open road shooting fire on them inside their vehicle. As Older Joe continues his fire upon the vehicle, Cid gets scared/nervous and has a sudden outrage which he accidentally uses his telekinesis which flips their vehicle in the air crashing causing them both in pain. Then as they get up they both head towards the cane field where Older Joe see them, approaches and starts shooting. As the shots gets fired, Cid is then using his telekinesis powers and molds a large tornado wind which floats Sara and Older Joe into the air. Suddenely Joe (JGL) while driving along the path, hears gunshots, gets out while the vehicle has been flipped by the telekinesis sees them as he sees that Older Joe in in striking force of shooting Sara. I found this entire scene to be somewhat rushed as it was not executed greatly. Last couple scene, we in fact do see Older Joe shoot and kill Sara while Cid has escaped in the cane field. As of course, this did not actually happen, but was a thought or flash in Joe's head what would have occurred. Which does happen in actuality is Joe still being stunned by Older Joe about to aim fire, Joe then takes his shotgun and decides to shoot himself in the chest killing himself which causes Older Joe to suddenly vanish. I really thought this was a poor way to end the film as the protagonist kills himself in order for Sara and Cid to survive. An alternate ending where he survives and does not kill himself I think would have faired better. <br/><br/>Looper was a great film but has its share of flaws. People have compared it to Inception which makes sense although, Inception was executed better and it's story was more interesting as well as more characters to become invested in. Looper stands out because it did not take itself too serious from other mindless action sci-fi films. The R rating really made the film better as it was more mature wise and the violence helped in its parts. Another notable scene in Looper is the diner scene at the local restaurant where we finally see Joe and Older Joe confront each other in which they talk about few things then Older Joe tells him that he is him from the future (this scene makes it more clear for the finale). That entire scene was well thought and entertainingly done. Overall Looper is a well entertaining thought provoking film which makes you guessing and thinking. ==================================================================== ====================================================================<br/><br/>As a rewatch (03/03/17'), Looper is well crafted and thoughtful. The action scenes and script within its writing is clever and also yet confusing. While watching, it is important in having a full understanding of the concept to enjoy the film for the better. With time travel films in general, it is quite completely and this film manages a different technique in which we are not used to seeing, which is why Looper stands out. The finale and final scene could have been done different but we can see why the writers ended as such. Rewatching 08 03 17' for another viewings, rarely do we see sci-fi films as Looper in today's age."

","I saw Looper after much waiting and pondering, along with an eagerness to enjoy the Willis-Levitt combination. Before watching Looper, I was fresh from watching a series of Joseph Gordon-Levitt movies (Inception, Havoc, 500 Days of Summer, The Dark Knight Returns) and was excitedly looking forward to see him in a different avatar. Also the prospects of Bruce Willis playing the older JGL along with the concept of Time Travel were the other aspects that kindled me to watch this movie as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Set in 2044, Joe (Gordon-Levitt) is a 'looper', a paid hit man, addicted to drugs, working for a criminal organization from the future (2074) that sends people to him to be exterminated. Joe happily does his job, and collects his reward when suddenly he sees himself from the future (Willis) sent to him. Joe fails, and that leads to a series of cataclysmic events, a lot of new and important characters being introduced, along with some unexpected twists, followed by a tense and exciting climax which is bound to leave audiences with their jaws dropped.<br/><br/>The performances are astounding and top notch. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has performed exceedingly well as always and looks like 'The Next Big Thing' in Hollywood. He continues to amaze me movie after movie and is slowly climbing upwards in the list of my favorites. Willis gives another power-packed action-filled performance and you would get to see the typical 'Willis-esque' action scenes here. Emily Blunt has a pivotal role and justifies it well. Little Pierce Gagnon does well too as Cid, a major character in the movie. Honesty and hard work is seen in Rian Johnson's direction, and that combined with amazing cinematography makes this movie incredible. The story is quite interesting too. The camera work is impressive, capturing some trippy moments in the movie quite well.<br/><br/>Overall, an exciting and fast-paced movie with an amazing concept, coupled with good performances make this movie a must watch. I give this 8/10."

","We start with an introduction to Loopers, future hit men, hired by the future mob, who travel back in time and wait for their mob cohorts to send some poor tied-up, blindfolded sap back in time directly in front of them. Then the Looper shoots the victim. Seems like a convoluted way of pulling off a murder in a future where time travel exists in the first place, but OK. The movie does make an attempt to justify this (Everyone is subject to 24/7 FUTURE TRACKING, so the body cannot be disposed of or the future cops will be all over it.... or something I guess?).<br/><br/>Sounds like a pretty simple job, but there's a catch! Time travel is illegal, and the mob doesn't want to break time traveling laws,(why the mob cares about this law when they are murdering people, who knows, another example of the characters actions being built around the plot) so at some point the Looper's future self will be sent back in time for the same Looper to murder. The Looper would never know if he was offing himself, this could have been a nifty concept to explore.<br/><br/>Our main character, Joseph Gorden-Levitt (Joe), is one of these Loopers. In addition to Looper-ing he also likes to do future drugs, and bone some stripper. The stripper is never important, nor are the drugs, actually nothing that happens for the first half hour matters. It exists solely to explain what Loopers are.<br/><br/>So Joe kills some people and stashes his silver bars. Then he does some drugs, then talks to the stripper, but she is working, so he does some more drugs and kills some people. Then Joe goes to bone the stripper, but first does some drugs and talks about his silver bars, then the editing is bad and I stopped paying attention for a bit, but when I came back he was doing drugs, then he shot Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>Joe is talking to his Looper buddy. Buddy Looper just got back from a job where he failed to kill his future self. He tells Joe that a mysterious figure known as Rainman is terminating all the Loopers. The mob comes to kill buddy Looper.<br/><br/>Now we see Joe live 30 years of his life (in a montage)as a guy that murders people in the present (again, the only reason Loopers exist is because the FUTURE TRACKING makes disposing of bodies impossible, so this makes no real sense), and is basically an action hero. Joe wakes up as Bruce Willis one day. Then an Asian women flips off Bruce Willis, he marries her, then she gets shot, he is captured by the mob and sent back in time to be killed by young Joe.<br/><br/>We watch Joe try to kill future Joe again, but future Joe gets away. Uh-oh, this is what got buddy Looper killed. Joe needs to track down his future self and finish the job.<br/><br/>Luckily Bruce Willis and Joe meet up at a diner. Bruce Willis makes a well reasoned argument that the Rainman is going to murder Joe's wife and take his money, so the logical thing to do is team up and stop the Rainman. Joe just wants to shoot Bruce Willis, because his character has zero critical thinking ability. Bruce Willis gets away again.<br/><br/>Joe stumbles onto a farm where a girl who is not the stripper lives. She threatens to shoot vagrants who wonder onto her farm, so Joe leaves. Then Joe comes back carrying his gun, vomits in her yard, so she slaps him and takes him inside to rest.<br/><br/>I guess Bruce Willis has a map bearing the location of the 3 children born on the same day as the Rainman, but Joe ripped one of the thirds of the map off.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, the farm woman has a son, who isn't her son, but then he is again. Joe tells her he is from the future.<br/><br/>Joe explains that Bruce Willis is going to murder these 3 kids to stop the Rainman. The farm woman doesn't really trust/like Joe, but lets him stay to protect her son and herself.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis shots a kid.<br/><br/>Farm woman calls Joe one night for some boning.<br/><br/>The mob is looking for both Joe and Bruce Willis. One mob guy goes to farm, autistic kid blows up mob guy with his mind.<br/><br/>Joe gets mad and says he is going to shoot the kid.<br/><br/>He doesn't.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis goes to kill the second kid, gets caught in an ambush by a mob guy. Mob guy takes Bruce Willis to the mob hideout, Bruce Willis murders all of the mob.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis finds kid, is going to kill kid, Joe is sad, decides to kill himself, Bruce Willis disappears.<br/><br/>The End<br/><br/>Notes:<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is supposed to be the bad guy, but you will find yourself rooting for him as he is the only character with a clear motivation.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character has no goals or motivations, he seems to hate his life, yet will not listen to his future self who offers a clear course to benefit them both. He protects the kid who he knows is the Rainman, which makes no sense as knows that Rainman is going to destroy all Loopers and be Evil. Levitt is a self-absorbed person, who for no reason decides to selfishly sacrifice himself at the end because the story calls for it.<br/><br/>The farmer woman only exists so the child Rainman can enter the plot.<br/><br/>The movie never offers any logic for how time travel works. As central to the plot as time travel is, it would be nice if the movie setup a clear logic, but it never does. Time travel can do anything that is convenient for the plot."
"doug_park2001","9","1","4","27 April 2013"," I Thoroughly Enjoyed LOOPER
","Despite seeing the previews, reading several reviews, and basically knowing beforehand what LOOPER's all about, I have to say that it still took me by surprise in many ways. Really fine acting, script, and cinematography bring about an immediate realism, which is especially important in a film set in the future with numerous science fictional/fantastic elements. I'm distractible and often downright dense but still followed the important points of what's going on here. LOOPER is definitely NOT one of those films that just tries to befuddle us with supposedly brilliant BS. It's one that you can watch again and again, always picking up something new in the way of hints, nuances, and details of plot.<br/><br/>There are a few plot holes, which is almost inevitable in a film about time paradoxes, i.e., if time travel ever becomes a reality, will it be possible to go back and change what's already occurred? A few other little imperfections here and there, but it's a film that's good enough to where something is gained even from the blemishes. This is true of anything, I suppose, but if you watch LOOPER expecting it to be good, the various anachronisms and illogicalities shouldn't be too glaring. On the other hand, if you watch it in a really critical frame of mind, on the look-out for defects, said defects may be all too evident.<br/><br/>The near future (2044) setting is well-done: A lot of interesting technology, but nothing too ""out there."" It's also interesting to see how Kansas City might look 30 years from now. LOOPER will obviously resonate with many science fiction aficionados, and even many who generally hate this genre will find themselves making an exception here.<br/><br/>This is one of Bruce Willis's finest performances. Emily Blunt as Sara is outstanding both actress and character-wise. Last but far from least, Pierce Gagnon as 5-year-old Cid is simply hypnotic and virtually steals the show whenever he's in it."
"asda-man","8","1","4","28 March 2013"," Loopy great fun!
","I just had to buy Looper when I heard all the hype surrounding it. I thought I was in luck when a friend lent me his ""friend's"" pirate copy, which is something I've never actually done before and will probably never do again in the future because the quality was what I like to call, ""floppy"". Bad sound, pixelated picture, I couldn't watch such a visual treat like Looper on that kind of quality! So I hunted Ebay and found a dangerously cheap copy, and I'm very glad that I did. Whilst Looper isn't the greatest sci-fi film ever made, like some people keep proclaiming, it certainly is a solid, entertaining and gripping adventure with a very original idea. Now, the first 45 minutes or so did lose me slightly in certain areas with its mind-bending premise of time-travel (which still doesn't entirely make sense), but if you just go with it then you'll probably enjoy it as much as I did.<br/><br/>Now, I don't completely understand how killing your own future self would not effectively kill you, but like I said, just go with it. It's a clever idea and one I haven't seen the likes of. Of course the film is set in the future so we get all the futuristic clichés of hover-bikes and weird tall buildings (we'll have to wait until 2044 arrives, to see just how accurate everything is) but at its core, the world isn't much different to how it is now. We're introduced to our hero, a drug-addicted murderer that some how remains likable throughout. The first hour of Looper acts like a rollicking sci-fi actioner as we're introduced to the idea of loopers and get to see what happens when things get out of hand.<br/><br/>We all know that Bruce Willis comes back as Joseph's future self and silly old Joe lets him go! What I really liked here was that a certain sort of human element was introduced, which proved that Looper has heart as well as brain (almost like a Christopher Nolan film). We see Joseph age up into Bruce and he falls in love with a Chinese woman young enough to be his daughter (but we'll look over that) and I won't spoil the rest of it, but it certainly helps us feel some emotion for Bruce's character as we know what he's been through. There's also a great scene where Joseph and Bruce talk in a diner (reminded me of Heat) and Joseph is quite keen to shoot him. It's suspenseful stuff!<br/><br/>For me, the film hit its stride when Joseph meets Emily Blunt at a nice farmhouse and we hear of Bruce's heart-breaking master plan. The film completely changes pace from rollicking sci-fi action to a more gentle, yet no less thrilling, pace. Now, this will probably upset/anger sci-fi action fans, but it adds a lot of emotion to the film and a strong human element. These parts were gripping, touching and very clever. There were some brilliantly tense scenes as well as some rather wonderful special effects which I won't spoil for you. The finale was compelling and very exciting with a clever and almost inspiring ending.<br/><br/>Looper isn't as good as Inception. In fact, it isn't even a patch on Inception's mind-blowing brilliance, but it is a fun and entertaining ride with a lot of heart and brain. Needless to say that I really enjoyed every minute of it and I'm not into the sci-fi genre. The action was also really well shot, with no annoying shake or constant cutaways which made it all the more intense. The directing was often very impressive. I especially liked the crabbing camera motion! In the end, Looper is really worth seeing and also has good replay value. Don't go expecting Inception though!"
"kerangador","10","1","4","27 March 2013"," I enjoyed it
","I liked it. OK, there were plot holes. But the acting and execution of the film did the magic trick and I didn't really notice them.<br/><br/>There is an art to film making and it speaks of a world where Superman can fly, Luke Skywalker can wave a ""light sabre"" and deflect laser bullets etc.. We don't question that at the time because we accept the craft and skill of the film maker.<br/><br/>He pulls that rabbit out of the hat - and he does it in such a way that we want to believe that he really did do something magical as opposed to discussing the impossibility of the physics behind the act.<br/><br/>That is what separates a good film from a bad one. Its so well crafted that we ignore the inconsistencies and withhold our skepticism."
"born-r","8","1","4","6 January 2013"," Great Sci-Fi Movie with a Intelligent Story
","Great Sci-Fi movie, in a dystopian near future (2044) where in the future of this future criminals are sent to be killed and theirs bodies dispatched in the past (the present one, where the film begins) through a time machine, which is banned in the future and is considered illegal. The executioners are called Loopers, and receive payments in silver bars, attached in the victims bodies.<br/><br/>Everything is well, until the Loopers start having completed their cycles (ie 30 years after, they are sent from the future to be killed, and so the evidences about the crimes are gone), in a increasing frequency...<br/><br/>The film uses almost no special effects, has several action scenes, and the film sets use suburban environments, with the classic future of marginalized people, and vehicles in most scenes that have implementations, but are our current ones with low-cost technologies, with a nice retro look. Some devices in the movie are nice future versions of the ones we have, like glass-like cellphones and holographic computers.<br/><br/>The performances are very good, especially for a boy who appears later in the film (Pierce Gagnon, only 05 years old), and that surprise yourself! The other performances are good, especially of Bruce Willis, but the protagonist, Joseph Gordon-Levitt I didn't found so good, perhaps because he was trying to imitate the way Bruce Willis is acting (of his version of 30 years in the future).<br/><br/>The script is very interesting and has some twists and scenes in the future that explain the past and vice versa, but nothing as complex in Inception or Memento - from the middle of the movie things start to be interesting and the film's ending is very surprising and interesting.<br/><br/>Briefly is a great sci-fi, with a very smart script and solid performances in a credible future. One of the best films of the year 2012 in the genre in my opinion. Rating: 8.5 / 10.0."
"p-stepien","7","1","4","30 December 2012"," Time loops
","In the distant future time travel will have been invented, but its implication were catastrophic in scale. Thus quickly banned by governments they only function underground, especially as part of crime syndicates utilising the invention to commit murders: people are sent back in time to be then disposed off by special killers called loopers. Controlled by Abe (Jeff Daniels), these renegade contract killers have agreed to their profession with the awareness that in an uncertain future they will have to cap off their future selves for the last golden paycheck. When Joe (a disfigured Joseph Gordon-Levitt) fails to kill off Old Joe (Bruce Willis) he becomes marked by Abe's foot soldiers. Meanwhile Old Joe aims to avert the rise of the murderous Rainmaker by killing him as a child, thus saving his beloved wife from death.<br/><br/>The whole premise is pretty far-fetched, while the implications of time travel are best summarised by Abe: ""This time travel crap, just fries your brain like a egg..."" Best not ask, best not try to logically tie yourself around it and furthermore just avoid searching for plot holes, because you will sure as hell not be disappointed. Internal logic of time travel mechanics or narrative are shady at best, while occasionally falling over itself. A simple example: At the start of the movie we are told that victims are sent back in time, because future technology makes it impossible to hide murders. But this does not stop mafia from killing off Old Joe's wife...<br/><br/>Putting those idiosyncrasies away, best stick with the story itself, which... honestly isn't as captivating and innovative as has been claimed. Whereas the movie itself is pretty engrossing, the narrative well strewn, the overall concept fails to juggle the ideas included. When the plot starts becoming somewhat obvious, ""Looper"" lacks enough emotional tension to make it a true classic, and the general lapses make it a vastly inferior movie to ""Brick"", Rian Johnson's breakthrough debut. Action sequences are nicely limited in scale and thus avoid becoming tiresome main events, instead allowing focus on the story (another point for special effects, which compliment the feature without overawing). Internal demons and conflicts with one self take on a whole new meaning, as perspectives of the young and old Joe vary, thus making life priorities diverge. The face-to-face encounter and conflict it causes offered such prolific possiilities to explore, but sadly young and old Joe rarely interact with each other. The potential for contemplative sci-fi was there, but somewhere along the way the possibility of venturing in depth was lost, when the somewhat intriguing, but also distracting, side plot of whether or not killing the child Hitler is justified takes center stage and the concept of self-conflict ends up unrealised. Thus the movie lacks emotional coherency, with dramatic aspects flustering all around and failing to pinpoint the internal turmoil, which is taking place. Some original ideas are floating around, but I personally wasn't in awe, partly due to the awkward focus of attention on Gordon-Lewitt's makeup.<br/><br/>The facial characterisation of Joseph Gordon Lewitt was a extreme put-off, so that he would like more like 'a young Bruce Willis', but the end result was irksome and distracting, making him somewhat disfeatured and severely inhibiting his acting capabilities. At best the whole move was pointless, proving a flustering influence on viewing. Nonetheless ""Looper"" was undeniably a joyous adventure with an overall enticing story."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","4","20 December 2012"," Not perfect, but still surprisingly good
","What we have here is a science fiction film that doesn't try to thrill you with flashy special effects, explosive action scenes and muscled main starts, though it has all of those in some capacity. Rather it relies on a clever premise, charismatic characters and a suspenseful mood to carry the whole story.<br/><br/>And yes, I say clever premise even though the idea of sending one's enemies of the future into the past to be killed by hit men is pretty ludicrous. If you were to think about it logically, you really only needed one guy to run the whole business in the past. One guy would set up a furnace and they would just send all the unwantables into that furnace where they would burn away. But even though the whole looper business could have been handled a whole lot more efficiently, it's still a cool premise that allows for a lot of cool scenes and characters, so I didn't really mind. Besides the very idea of pitting Bruce Willis against his younger counterpart is a reason enough to allow some gaps in logic. The rule of Bruce Willis applies here.<br/><br/>So yes, I really liked this film, but the reason why it didn't get a higher score is that the final half of the film just isn't as strong as the first. The whole film starts as a prelude to a fight between these two characters, whose only difference is their age. You could have had a lot of cool chase and fight scenes with them being able to predict what the other was thinking just because they thought the exact same thing. It could have been a battle between a man and his shadow, each having slightly different strengths - the younger could have had the body and the stamina and the older could have had new tricks and experience - but instead the whole plot gets sidetracked when a minor plot point is suddenly lifted into the center. This new plot is foreshadowed to a certain degree and it does work, but if I'm being honest with myself, I'd have rather watched an epic battle between Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I guess the story that we do get allows for more romance, moral lessons and the usual Hollywood story-telling clichés, which makes the film more appealing to a wider audience than just the fans of intense action, but dammit, I wanted to see an epic battle between Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I still get something to that effect, but it's... just not as good.<br/><br/>But no, even though I rant about it, I don't think that this is a bad film, quite the opposite in fact. The final half of the film isn't what I was expecting to get, but it's still a good story, heart-warming even, while still maintaining that same hardcore dystopian feeling that the film does so well from the very first scene. So I'd recommend this film. It's a film with a lot of heart, intelligence and style, with great actors and an interesting premise. What more do you need?"
"quicksticks","8","1","4","16 December 2012"," Well-moulded time travel flick
","IT has been a while since we've seen a time travel movie, and even longer since we've seen a good one. In the year 2074, when the Mob wants to ""take care"" of somebody, the target is sent 30 years back in the past, where a stylish hired gun, known as a ""looper"", waits to pull the trigger. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a looper making his way through the ropes, is one day hit with a huge surprise when his future self, older Joe (Bruce Willis), is sent back to catch a bullet in the chest. Older Joe escapes and it is now up to Joe to track him down, kill him and make it right with the Mob. You know this much from watching the trailer, and to be honest, this is about a quarter of the plot. The time travel aspect of the movie is also handled really well, where it is explained but kept vague, and actually gets the audience thinking throughout the movie. The future in the year 2044 is portrayed well in the movie. Cars don't fly, but there are bikes that hover along the ground, people ingest drugs through eye drops, they are paid in silver and gold bars: just subtle differences without your average expectations of the future. It starts off sleek and smart with a strong pace, but kind of fades in the middle. However, this really isn't such a bad thing. It gives time for characters to mature, for their backstories to unfold and their relationships to build. If you were looking for big action shoot-outs and trucks exploding, you might be disappointed. The action scenes are good, with a few shoot-outs and a chase here and there, but ultimately, it is the plot, dialogue and stand-out acting (particularly by Gordon-Levitt) that really drives Looper. There is also a strong female character in Sara, played by Emily Blunt, who isn't too hard on the eyes. Without spoiling anything, Looper goes in directions audiences wouldn't expect. It is a futurist movie, and if you want to enjoy it to the fullest, you have to let yourself be taken over by the science fiction aspect. This could have been a simple premise where ""good guy"" has to track down and kill ""bad guy"", but the plot has layers. It has themes of cause and effect and dives deeper than your average popcorn-munching CGI fest."
"silentman01","7","1","4","12 December 2012"," A lot of loopholes (no pun intended), but still pretty entertaining
","""Looper"" is a science fiction film about assassins who kill people sent from the future. It is the middle of the 21st Century and time travel has not been invented yet. It was though twenty years from the film's present and in the process got outlawed. Since then, the only people who accessed the technology was the underworld and they would send the ones to be killed to the past as if they never existed. The assassins who kill these targets of the future are known as ""loopers"". Joe (played by Joseph Gordon Levitt) is a looper and the film centres around his last assignment which is to kill his older self (played by Bruce Willis). As you can imagine, a film with such a plot line would have a lot of holes in it that it couldn't avoid, but the great thing about this film is that it distracts it's audience from that with exemplary camera-work, an Oscar-worthy screenplay, riveting editing and realistic acting (considering the circumstances) to create one of the best films of the year. Directed by Rian Johnson, the film is one of the most innovative pieces of the year and has put it's young Director as one of the film- makers to look out for in the future. Joseph Gordon Levitt seems to grow with every role he gets and is really evolving into an actor who it seems will be around for some time to come and he gives his career's best performance (IMO). He does so by grasping the roots of his character with an exemplary understanding of his motives which results into one of the most measured and realistic performances of the year. His role reminded me a lot of Gosling's driver but even though it was not as powerful, it played with similar character aspects with a more chaotic interpretation as was required. He is well supported by Emily Blunt, Jeff Bridges and Bruce Willis who goes back to his roots that made him popular but with an angle which was far more different than the people he has been known to portray. There is also a great cameo by the criminally overlooked Paul Dano as well. Willis' performance, however, was the surprise of the film even though it was not as unexpected as his turn in Sixth Sense. His walk through familiar territory was done with motives which could easily have been transformed into something cheesy but he managed to do that by balancing his darkness that proved the catalyst for his passion. The other great performance is given by another actor who I should not mention because to do so would spoil it for people who have not seen it. All in all, ""Looper"" is definitely one of the best films of the year and it is a movie which will have you hanging on to your seats till it ends. It does have a lot of holes in it which you are bound to expect from a film which deals with such a unique vision on the time-travel context.The fact that it makes you overlook them with it's quality film-making is a testament to Rian Johnson and the production built around to tell such a complex tale by using the basic fundamentals of story-telling is what made it mind blowing."

","A frustratingly good ride, it could've been an exceptionally good film. So much of this sci-fi, time travel film is excellent. The performances, the styling, the concept are all really very good. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is really showing his diversity of late and does an excellent Brice Willis impersonation. <br/><br/>Emily Blunt is as always, a fantastic screen presence and the film really lifts to new heights once her character enters the story. The fact that it takes so long to get to that part of the story is one of it's main faults. The film's set up is intriguing and stylish and interesting, it just drops the pace and interest a little too much in the 2nd third and throughout the film there is a completely unnecessary sub-plot involving an inept baddie that just highlights what a fantastic film it could've been, had his character and story been reduced or removed all together.<br/><br/>Still a great ride and good film though, it just could've been a classic."

","Wow. Just come away from the cinema and my mind is buzzing with this film. Not so much my brain is 'fried like an egg' but my mind has been taken out for a 10K run and told to do fifty press-ups. This film is an exercise in intelligence, clever script, direction and plot. It was billed at ""this year's Matrix,"" but this is not the case. However, I don't see this as a bad thing as to me the Matrix was all about the SFX, shock and awe; remember the first time you saw it? Or Terminator 2? The SFX blew you away. Here it's the plot, the characters, the writing and the direction which is foremost. More on a par with Inception (another Gordon-Levitt film, notice). The Director Rian Johnson pulled all the strings of a great movie together without resorting to the whole film being obviously CGI - SFX were subtle so the movement of the characters, the realism of the action rang truer. The long shots of the futuristic city were clearly CGI but that was fine, most of the ""real"" action seemed not to be. It was good. Not detracting anything from Johnson (who also wrote the film) but it had Philip K Dick overtones for me, and a bit of Harry Bates.<br/><br/>Jeff Daniels was lovely as ever, Bruce Willis didn't play Bruce Willis so much and I really enjoyed him in this. There was one time I expected him to say Yippee Kay-ay but he didn't. More power to him. He played with a lot of emotion in this and you did root for him. Probably one of the best things I've seen him in. Gordon-Levitt should get props for doing such an amazing impression of Willis - it's like he's channeling him! The prosthesis/make up to make him look more like Willis (or some CGI?) is quite disturbing but effective and incredibly well done. Emily Blunt was feisty, convincing, and jolly good in this rather physical role - really great. But the star of the piece and special mention needs to be made for child-actor (soon to be super star I predict) Pierce Gagnon. Never seen him before but even Dakota Fanning would get a run for her money with this little thespian - and not a precocious, child ""actor"" sign or fakery in sight; you'd have thought he was doing all this for real. He was superb. Worth seeing the film just for him, and I'll never look at a child having a tantrum quite the same again! Wonderfully, Hollywood didn't get a look in at the end - was there a cliff hanger, wasn't there? Who knows. Brilliant. In short an incredible-watching, engrossing and exciting film. Tender, humorous, nerve-wracking, exciting, shocking and clever in equal parts.<br/><br/>To sum up, Bruce Willis not playing Bruce Willis, Gordon-Levitt playing Bruce Willis and a young kid acting the pants of everybody!"

However Joe's world turns upside down when he has to close the loop on himself that is, Old Joe(Bruce Willis). However Joe hesitates & Older Joe escapes. Now, it's up to him to find Old Joe & kill him because, the company that hired him led by Abe(Jeff Daniels) & which consists of Seth(Paul Dano) & Kid Blue(Noah Segan) are hot on both the Joes' trail.

This is the synopsis of the movie.<br/><br/>First off, Looper is a brilliant film, visually. The special effects are outstanding. The story is engaging & has many twists and turns leading to the epic conclusion that this film has. A note on the performances. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is brilliant as Joe. In fact the viewer has a hard time believing that Joe is not a younger Bruce Willis. Gordon-Levitt has delivered such a convincing performance! Bruce Willis is superb as Old Joe. Willis' portrayal is more mature and the character hates himself for all the mistakes that he had committed in the past. Emily Blunt is great as Sara. Pearce Gagnon is mind blowing as Cid. The supporting actors namely, Jeff Daniels, Paul Dano, Noah Segan & Qing Xu are spectacular as Abe, Seth, Kid Blue & Old Joe's wife respectively. All in all, Looper is a must watch for sci-fi fans and pretty much everyone who loves action movies. The film is both time & money well spent."
"Robert_duder","8","1","4","10 October 2012"," Why Looper was amazing...and why it wasn't
","As a HUGE Bruce Willis fan I was ecstatic to see Looper. I hoped this was a return to the sci-fi/action films that Willis excels at and in many ways it was exactly that. I can only say about Looper that at times I was just absolutely blown away by it and then in the same breath I felt disappointed in some aspects. I think a truly smart and savvy time travel flick should hurt your brain. It should inevitably leave paradox's that keep people talking about it for days or months after seeing it and Looper does that for certain. I tried to read a few of the forums on IMDb discussing the ins and outs of the intricacies of the film and it literally is mind numbing so kudos to them on that front. This is the type of film that I could sit down and debate/discuss with someone for hours and hours and have a great time doing it and for that reason I loved it. There were some incredible action sequences and an interesting look at a future world. Here comes the however...I felt certain scenes were inadvertently almost funny. I spotted some of the actors looking like they were preparing to take a punch or for the stunt to begin which is just poor directing and editing. Certainly there were plot holes (Willis carries the same gun after knocking out Levitt that he leaves laying beside Levitt in the scene before), and I think when you start to do the deconstruction of the film scene by scene you would find some glaring issues. However, I'm willing to forgive those inconsistencies because of the grandiose and brilliant idea of the film. Finally, the film represents itself as a simple story about Levitt chasing down Willis to try to rectify the fact that he lets him live. In fact the film is more about saving the future by killing a young boy who will become a dictator and madman.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is in full Bruce Willis mode for Looper. He doesn't start out strong but he finishes it in full form. At first I thought he seemed slow and bored with the role but then when the film climaxes I saw that flash of fire that Willis brings to a role. I never get tired of seeing him mow down bad guys with giants gun. Joseph Gordon-Levitt once again flexes his acting chops and proves why he is Hollywood's future. He carries the film flawlessly and I was a little skeptical about the whole idea of him trying to nail Willis' mannerisms and while he walks a very thin line of overdoing it, he does a pretty solid job. He is well on his way to being a superstar and it shows! I am growing a little weary of Emily Blunt being in everything. I don't particularly see that outstanding actor that some think she is but she is good in her role as the protective mother. I think there are many questions left unanswered about her character and she has good chemistry with Levitt, though I don't think it was great chemistry. She definitely holds her own. I enjoyed the villain role played by Noah Segan, and I kept waiting for his character to have this big revealing point in the story but he never did sadly. Still he was good but sort of underwhelming in the end. Jeff Daniels has a small role as the Looper boss but he is mostly underused. And finally what an incredible role played by young actor Pierce Gagnon who plays the young boy with a disturbed future ahead of him. He was fantastic and just played an incredible role and was so expressive in his emotions and lines. Keep your eyes out for him in future roles for certain.<br/><br/>Writer and director Rian Johnson is a talented film maker. He has a distinctive dark and gritty style that he's brought to TV Show Breaking Bad and also his first film Brick. That style shows distinctly in Looper. I did feel like the ""present"" time they showed was perhaps a little more advanced than what is realistically possible but its sci-fi for a reason and I did enjoy what they did. I think it also would have fascinating to see more of the future-future as we only saw a very very small glimpse through the eyes of Willis. Looper would have been a tough movie to make because I think there is years worth of material here that could be explored. No matter how you shake it, when a film is this intensive and grandiose there has to be some bad with the good. The final word from me is that the film is excellent, a top notch science fiction action flick that I will certainly get something different from every time I watch it and that is the mark of a great film. Be ready to think and be prepared to enjoy the ride. 8.5/10"
"PWNYCNY","9","1","4","7 October 2012"," One of the better movies of the sci-fi genre.
","This is a great sci-fi movie. It's about an assassin, called a looper, who is hired to kill people sent to the past from the future. If this seems confusing, it is, and that's intentional. The problem is: what happens when the victim sent back is the assassin? That means killing yourself, or, as it's put in the movie, ""closing the loop."" Nice euphemism, right? Anyway, this one particular assassin is set to kill his next victim when he notices that the victim is himself, just older. Well, needless to say, but say it I will, mayhem breaks lose, because in the world of the loopers, if you don't do your job, then you have to be eliminated. (Eliminated: that's another euphemism.) You may be wondering: why have loopers? The answer to that question is because this story is set in the not so far distant future, after some kind of major upheaval, leaving humanity wrecked and presenting a perfect opportunity for organized crime to flourish. In the future time travel is discovered, but it's illegal, which means, of course, that only criminals use it. But in the future, when the syndicate eliminates someone, they cannot dispose of the body, hence, they transport the victim to the past for processing. Okay, now that we got that muddled explanation out of the way, here's what happens in the movie: the looper is now searching for his older self because his older self wants to murder a child who, in the future, will be the head of the crime syndicate who gets the older looper-self's wife murdered. That's right: it's a vendetta. Now, the younger looper-self learns that the child, a boy, lives on a farm with a woman who is the sister of the boy's mother. Now, the boy's mother was killed after the boy unleashed telekinetic forces that smashed everything in its path. Oh, before I forget, I need to mention that after the cataclysmic events that messes up the world, about ten percent of the population comes down with a mutation that gives them telekinetic powers which nobody knows how to use. Okay, now back to the looper and the boy. The looper finds the boy and they form an emotional bond. Finally, to bring this synopsis to an end, the older-looper-self arrives at the farm, and is trying to kill the boy, who has just unleashed a humongous telekinetic blast, but instead kills the sister-mother, and so the looper kills himself. The reason why the looper kills himself is because he realizes that by sacrificing his life, he will save the life of the mother and that in turn will change the course of history because instead of the boy growing up bitter and unloved, and becoming the head of the criminal syndicate in the future, he will have a mother to care for him. Thus, the looper becomes a martyr and a hero. This movie is saturated with violence because the story is violent. Bruce Willis is fabulous as the older-looper-self. He carries this movie; it's probably his best role and performance in years. The story itself is intriguing and clever, and the movie does an excellent job of telling a story without an over-reliance on special effects, which are kept to a minimum."
"blueyoke","6","1","4","6 October 2012"," good effort, don't get too hyped up for it though
","Looper is a stylish film with a solid cast and an interesting premise, it was entertaining but doesn't quite work, it delivered exactly what i thought it would so i'm not disappointed. It had some good action sequences however some of the action seemed a little ridiculous and ended up being unintentionly funny. There is some good humour in it though which i like it didn't take itself too seriously like say Inception which definitely worked in it's favour. Looper was visually impressive although that has come to be expected with this type of blockbuster flick in this day and age, it didn't fall short and not just the special effects I thought the costume design and sets and vision of the future world all looked great. In spite of all this it does fall short for me;it was a decent effort at the timetravel subgenre I have certainly seen worse but ultimately it wouldn't make my personal top 100. Looper has been Touted by the professional critics as the best thing since sliced bread, or Inception (the last Sci-Fi blockbuster critics had a raging erection for before having even seen the movie) well i prefer it to inception I was entertained and intrigued but left frustrated. don't expect watertight chronology or the film to add up in any way at all (why on earth would you? Is that even possible?)."
"dohickey37","7","1","4","4 October 2012"," Fun if you don't think about it too hard
","Take the most mundane parts of the Matrix, Timecop, Terminator, and Akira and blend them up to make Looper. The cast is great. The acting is great. The little boy was awesome. The story was only alright and oddly a little predictable, but I can't imagine how people are saying that there are no plot holes. The biggest for me is that if you have the ability to force someone into a machine that can bend time and space, why do you need some putz with a gun on the other side to shoot them? Why not just send them into space, or the center of the earth, or ... basically anywhere besides a field 30 years in the past where someone has to shoot them before they can run away? The machine itself would inherently have the ability to just zap them into nothingness. It's a little like if 70's gangsters would stuff people into an SR-71 Blackbird jet, and fly them at Mach 3 to New Zealand so some sheep farmer could chase them down and hit them on the head with a hammer. The setup was supposed to be that it's impossible to kill someone in the future-future, but then people are getting shot willy-nilly during the main character's later life. So we're supposed to believe that future gangsters have access to time machines, but the only way they can think to use them is to send people back into the past to be shot? That's just too stupid. Sorry. I would still recommend seeing it for the acting, but that's probably not high praise for a sci-fi action thriller."
"tbmforclasstsar","10","3","23","28 September 2012"," an incredibly ambitious, well executed sci-fi thriller that is as smart as it is exciting
","In a time in cinema when sci-fi means battling robots, action films need to be rated PG-13, and heroes and villains are black and white, Looper is one of the most refreshing films you will have the luxury of seeing. Even when the film was bogged down by trailers trying to draw crowds looking for a pure action movie, audiences got a film that doesn't just bring the action, but also has more heart and brain than almost any movie this year. This film is extremely ambitious and reminds us (especially when we saw trailers for Paranormal Activity 4 and a Red Dawn remake before hand) that there are filmmakers out there actually trying to do new/great things.<br/><br/>Looper is written and directed by Rian Johnson, the mind behind the indie films Brick and The Brothers Bloom. Johnson's story follows Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an assassin known as a looper who specializes in the killing of targets sent back from the future, bound and hooded, ready for the killing. As Joe tells us, time travel has not been invented yet in his present 2044, but in 30 years it has. And 30 years from now, a criminal ring sends the targets they need killed back to a time where they can be eliminated and disposed of without any trace. Essentially, it is the perfect crime.<br/><br/>Being a looper has its perks. You are well paid, can live an exciting lifestyle, and have plenty of authority in the world you live. However, there is one major setback: in the future, time does come when the head of this mob decides to ""close your loop."" This means, your future self is sent back for you to kill. Your future self dies, you get a big payday, and you know you have 30 years left to live. If your future self comes back and you fail to close your loop, then you are in trouble. Both you and your future self are hunted down to eliminate any loose ends.<br/><br/>And this is exactly the problem Joe gets himself into. When his future self lands on his killing block, Joe is outsmarted and overpowered by Old Joe (Bruce Willis), and the hunter becomes the hunted. This is played out brilliantly between Gordon-Levitt and Willis, the former of which wore make-up to look like a young Willis. Add to this the fact that Gordon-Levitt executes many of Willis' facial gestures, squints, and laughs, and we really start to buy that this is the same person.<br/><br/>What is so great about Looper is that Johnson writes out a story that is extremely smart within a world that is extremely plausible. What starts as a sci-fi action film slowly turns into a dark drama/western styled film that keeps you guessing from beginning to end.<br/><br/>To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/looper/"
"bkoganbing","8","2","13","2 October 2012"," Speculative enterprise
","When one deals with time travel as the process has not been discovered everything written or filmed about is always speculative. For instance the Jean-Claude Van Damme film Time Cop shows something quite different when we meet our future and past selves as Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis do here in Looper.<br/><br/>Instead of the forces of law and latent fascism getting control of time travel in Time Cop, Looper has organized crime doing it and eliminating problems that Robert DeNiro in Casino remarked are usually swallowed up by the Nevada desert. Levitt is a Looper one who travels ahead to the future, specifically trained as an assassin and then goes back to his present origin and as targets come through a time portal, they get eliminated. Then at some point, the future selves are eliminated and the present selves just go on with normal lives as we define normal.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is Levitt's future self only he doesn't like the idea of elimination. And the big boss Jeff Daniels doesn't like how Levitt screwed up the elimination of Willis. The chase is on.<br/><br/>Another question answered by Laurence Olivier in The Boys From Brazil said that we should not eliminate a cloned Hitler. Here a telekinesis gene has entered our gene pool and someone in the distant future has been harnessing its full potential to battle organized crime. That's an even bigger mission that the Levitt/Willis problem.<br/><br/>Looper is a nice and original take on time travel with an outstanding cast giving some standout performances. Note particularly Emily Blunt as the mother of young Pierce Gagnon who has powers and abilities far beyond those of other mortal beings. And young Gagnon is something to see as well.<br/><br/>Looper is definitely worth the price of admission."
"ferguson-6","7","2","13","29 September 2012"," The Bad Path is a Circle
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Rian Johnson (Brick) delivers a very entertaining, thrilling and clever sci-fi film that features time travel, dark comedy, romance, metaphysics, and enough action to keep just about any viewer engaged ... as long as you enjoy using your brain a bit.<br/><br/>Source Code, the recent film from Duncan Jones, used time travel in very limited segments. Here time travel is 30 years into the future and has been declared illegal. So, of course, only crime syndicates use it. When you think about it, sending your enemies back in time to be killed and disposed of is brilliant. It's very difficult to solve these type of crimes ... though, there is no evidence anyone is trying. The future mob boss known as The Rainmaker hires ""loopers"" from 30 years past to handle the dirty work. When The Rainmaker begins ""closing loops"", he does so by sending the loopers back in time to be killed by their younger selves. Yes, somehow this works.<br/><br/>Well it works until Seth (Paul Dano) chokes up and lets his future self escape. That doesn't go over well with the modern day crime boss (Jeff Daniels) who just can't allow these future guys to be roaming free. Then, just like that, the same thing happens to Joe (Joseph Gordon Levitt). His future self (Bruce Willis) appears, he flubs the kill, and the next thing you know, the Joe and Old Joe are seated in a booth at a remote diner ordering the same breakfast and staring into their own eyes.<br/><br/>Plenty of fun stuff in this one, although, I had a tough time buying a blond Emily Blunt as a Kansas farmer. Her young son Cid, played by Pierce Gagnon, is one of the more interesting characters in the film. He is supposed to the young version of the future Rainmaker, and he possesses some unusual traits ... with Blunt trying to supply sufficient motherly love to prevent him from spinning off track.<br/><br/>Director Johnson has a knack of tossing in some dark humor at just the right time. Some of the romance seemed a bit forced, but the criminal element and the Joe vs Old Joe stuff was really fascinating to keep up with. If you enjoy movies that are somewhat challenging, and you can suspend reality for the time travel elements, it's one that you'll probably find quite entertaining.

","In the not so distant future 2044, ""Looper's"" exist to provide an execution service for a more distant future 2074, where time travel has been invented. Undesirables are sent back in time and Looper's effectively erase them in the future by killing them now.<br/><br/>Bodies cannot be disposed of in 2074 without paperwork, it's much easier to ""outsource"" your killing to a time where life is cheap and the administration overheads are less.<br/><br/>One such Looper is ""Joe"" (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), he drives out to a deserted field for his 11:30am appointment, spreads out a sheet to prevent a mess. Person appears, ""Boom"" with his Blunderbuss, collect silver sent back as payment, dispose of the body and repeat.<br/><br/>R & R constitutes getting high with a hallucinogenic drop administered via eye drops. The world Joe inhabits is not pretty, thumping nightclubs, hobos and lawlessness pervades in the streets, it's a dystopian nightmare with a capital D.<br/><br/>Joes does not have buddies as such, this is not a business where you make friends, the one he does have, creates a pivotal turning point early in the film.<br/><br/>When the criminal bosses in the distant future want to ""close the Loop"", the Looper himself is sent back to be executed by their youthful self. They arrive complete with a gold bar bonus, signifying their time is up, they then have thirty years in which to enjoy their booty before they get sent back to be eliminated.<br/><br/>Joe and the Looper team realise that a lot of Loops are closing and times are changing. If a Looper lets a execution go awry and they have a runner on their hands, this is not a good result for the Looper or runner, a very bad situation indeed.<br/><br/>Tasked with ensuring compliance in 2044 is ""Abe"" (Jeff Daniels), sent back through time to make sure the space time continuum does not get messed up, he rules through fear and ruthless enforcement.<br/><br/>When the older version of ""Joe"" (Bruce Willis) is sent back to be erased, this proves to be a catalyst for a series of events that throws the messy but orderly status quo into chaos.<br/><br/>The story is strong, at times difficult to follow but does unravel slowly to provide a worthwhile and believable world. Time travel in movies is notoriously difficult to pull off, as one character says, ""if you think about it too much, it will just fry your brain"". However, just when you believe that the Director and Screenwriter Rian Johnson has painted himself into a corner, he manages to pull off a satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>There is considerable violence, although not wholly gratuitous. Many actions that would have added to the carnage are shown off screen, the film also flirts with a movie taboo, certainly for Bruce Willis to carry out the actions he undertakes, is a very different path for him to travel.<br/><br/>There are times when you forget that you are effectively rooting for the bad guys, there are no good guys. Whether the Loops are being closed for a higher purpose, which may become apparent by the films conclusion, is open for debate. In fact, this is a film that is made for Internet discussion, theories will abound and may prompt further film visits to this world in the future.<br/><br/>If there is a moral, in a world with none, it perhaps asks how far would you go to have, experience and even remember the life you wanted. Would you kill to protect it and if so, who would you sacrifice.<br/><br/>The acting is of a high standard, Levitt, Daniels and Dano excel. Willis is an older version of the Willis we know, although his scenes with a younger lover do stretch the boundaries of good taste a little. Levitt looks physically different due to the prosthetic he wears, to make him appear similar to a younger Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt adds another solid character to her resume as Sara, sexy, strong and with her young son Pierce Gagnon, scarily good. The film borders on light horror in later scenes and certainly some images and intent may be considered disturbing for some.<br/><br/>Any film that is not a sequel, is largely original and makes you think, is to be treasured. This movie because of it's complexity, does introduce several ""realisation"" segments, that delightful moment where a piece fits into place. Much like ""Sixth Sense"" but taking a much less big bang ""Twister alert"" approach, a film to misunderstand and then slowly comprehend, like ""Memento"" rather than a ""twist"" as such.<br/><br/>Certainly the audience reaction was stunned silence, at this viewers showing at the Multiplex.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>A Sc-Fi treat that blends the best of the genre (Inception) but comes up with something fresh and original with excellent performances and a cracking story that will permeate long after the credits roll.<br/><br/>Not to everyone's taste due to the subject matter but for those that enjoy a good Sci-Fi thriller, mixed with a chase movie with tinges of horror, this is as good as it gets."
"danboy96","10","3","26","27 September 2012"," An in-depth review of Looper
","Looper is the latest work of Rian Johnson. It's always good when the director writes the film as he has a much better idea of how he would want it to be portrayed. Looper is a brilliant piece of film and Johnson really pulled it out of the bag. The idea of the story is very simple but when you begin to put in all the complications we see in the film, it's a different story all together. Let me also say this, the plot and 'idea' of this film e.g. Time Travel sounds quite cheesy, but this film is anything but cheesy. It's fast paced, action-packed and NOT FOR CHILDREN – this film is extremely violent and gory and has content that could disturb and upset children including drug use, alcohol, sexual references and at points, extreme amounts of blood.<br/><br/>The basic idea to the film is this: In 2042, time travel hasn't been invented, but 30 years in the future it will have been. So when somebody needs killing in the future, the mob zap them back 30 years for someone, like Joseph Simmonds, to kill. Strapped to the back of the victim are solid gold or silver bars which are the looper's payment for killing the person and disposing of the body. This film would be pretty cut and dry if it stuck to this but obviously, it's not going to.<br/><br/>To check out the full article go to: http://www.teknue.com/reviews/film- review-looper-2012/999"
"malaysian1789","8","2","15","30 September 2012"," A fine addition to the sci-fi genre
","What would you do if an older version of yourself appeared from the future one day and told you to follow his orders?! Well that's one scenario posed in Looper, a wonderful science fiction film about time- travel and gangsters, starring Bruce Willis, who clearly did not get enough of travelling through time in 12 Monkeys. Trying to summarise the plot into mere words is actually quite a challenge, but here goes:<br/><br/>Our main character Joseph Simmons (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a Looper, that is, somebody who kills people sent to him from the future by a gang, and disposes of the body in his present time, meaning they cannot be traced, as technically, they have not been born yet (kind of like the story in Terminator) . One thing leads to another and soon Joseph finds himself being told to execute himself, i.e an older version of himself from the future (Willis). Willis tries to convince his younger self to follow destiny and do what he says, but will his younger self listen or end up killing his older self? Confusion pretty much sums it up. Add in a few gangsters and mass gun fights, and you end up with a pretty good film.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the film actually presents the time quantum physics plot in a clear manner, and after seeing some intelligent/absurd ideas being depicted (cut a message on yourself, and your older version will see the message on their subsequent body!), the film is ultimately about destiny and regret, would you change your own destiny if you had the chance? Would you kill somebody to make your own future better? A pretty deep film that slightly lost it's way in the second half of the film, when the action switches to a massive farm (featuring Emily Blunt) and loses its pace, but does actually feature the greatest acting performance by a 10 year old I have ever seen. Amazing.<br/><br/>Good, good film that you won't regret watching, or if you do, you can just travel back in time and avoid it. I think.<br/><br/>8/10"

His new film is another collaboration with writer/director Rian Johnson after 2005's ""Brick"". The story seems simple about Joe who is a looper who are people who are sent people from the future to kill because time travel is illegal in the future and it's hard to get rid of a body in the future. But when you are a looper after your future self has reached a certain age they are sent back to be killed which is called let go of your looper.<br/><br/>When Joe's older self is sent back he fails to kill him and is hunted down as well as older Joe. They meet in a dinner to discuss what the plan is where Older Joe says in the future there is a man called the Rainmaker who they can stop in the present time but when they are found they map is split and each go off to marked areas. Young goes to a farm with a mother and son while older goes to the other two locations trying the kill the boy that will become the rainmaker. At the farm is Sara and her son Cid have a secret that was the whole point of Older Joe going back in time.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt tried his best to be a young Bruce Willis by adapting the voice of Bruce, also the makeup distracting at times helped him with his look. Bruce Willis was OK but again it is not his movie, all he was used for was to be 80's action star Bruce and he is very good at doing that. Emily Blunt was at times believable as a southern farm girl but other times she felt iffy to me. The biggest surprise for me was Pierce Gagnon as Cid who played the character especially since he was five when he made the film.<br/><br/>I liked this film very much and Rian Johnson is very creative especially in his directing skills which have developed drastically over the years from his first movie throughout his TV work and much more. The visual effects simple very effective and with a limited budget Johnson made the most of what he had. His casting was also smart but even though JGL looks nothing like Bruce it was the makeup artists that changed my mind on the idea.<br/><br/>MOVIE GRADE: B+ (MVP: Joseph Gordon-Levitt)"

More of ""Wtf, why should I care, okay what then?"". This felt like I had watched two movies - one starting off nicely and the other one ending like the writer didn't care either way if he could finish the movie or not.<br/><br/>So... no. Would not watch this again. This movie left me feeling ripped off, cheated from a good ending and lured in with half-assed plot."
"SnoopyStyle","8","1","5","27 August 2013"," Crazy ideas all jammed together and somehow works
","Rian Johnson (The Brothers Bloom, Brick) is the writer and director of this sci-fi film. Like his other projects, this has original if slightly off-kilter thinking in its story. It is not a regular sci-fi movie. There are some crazy ideas going on here. Time travel is not enough. There is also telekinesis, post collapse apocalypse, mob killings, and pre-planned suicide for hire (yeah figure that one out). Does it all make logical sense? I can't tell. But it sure was fun trying to follow it. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is great as the young Bruce Willis. Emily Blunt is refreshingly new. Also staring is Paul Dano and Piper Perabo."
"bananaguy42","2","1","5","26 May 2013"," Bruce Willis kills some kids
","I watched this movie when it first came out. I was very hopeful for the movie because it involved time travel, Bruce Willis, and Gordon-Levvitt (Blake/Batman from Dark Knight Rises) but this movie was one of the most over-rated titles I've ever seen. A lot of other reviews focus on how the trailers were focused on bodies that were being sent back in time and people were hired to kill them and dispose of their bodies. First of all, this doesn't make much sense. At all. But besides that, the second half of the movie (after Gordon runs into Bruce Willis) they focus entirely on this kid who has the power to pick up stuff with his mind. And he is so good with it, he makes a man explode. Blood splatters across the room and on the kid, who is only about 7 mind you. So while the young bounty hunter (Gordon) is trying to protect the older bounty hunter (Willis) from killing him, Bruce Willis is tracking down a whole lot of kids that look like the kid with the power and killing them. Bruce Willis killing children. That happens for about 40 minutes and nothing else happens but waiting around for Bruce to show up. When he does, they get into a fight, and then the kid escapes. Now, the kid is insane and in the future he's a crime leader. So everything that happened in the movie was redundant. AND THE MOVIE BARELY FOCUSED ON THE FACT IT WAS ABOUT THE LOOPERS, THE PEOPLE THAT KILLED PEOPLE. I wanted to walk out of this movie. I'm glad I didn't though because I would have given it a better rating if I didn't watch the ending. Horrible script, horrible everything."

","The movie had a lot of Buzz coming into the cinema. And I wasn't disappointed when I watched it. Twelve Monkeys remains the best themed time travel movie, but this is a very good Sci-Fi effort that has something original to tell. But you wouldn't expect anything less from the director of Brick. That's why Levitt was on again, but this time with the support of Mr. Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>Great casting choices aside (Emily Blunt and others shouldn't go unnoticed), the movie does live with a great story that it tells. Of course the main performances hold it all together (just because it is Science Fiction does not mean, it has to be out of this world). I kinda got a De Niro vibe while watching Gordon Levitt. But I seem to be in the minority there. Then again, it speaks for a movie, if different people can read different things into it."

","There's a fundamental problem with time-travel that many have fallen victim to - too much physics and you leave the audience cold and befuddled; too many action sequences and emotion goes out the window. The real trick of making a truly great time-travel movie is finding the perfect balance between the two and in my opinion only two films have struck this difficult chord - Back to the Future and Twelve Monkeys (which also starred Bruce Willis). Well, now you can add Looper to that.<br/><br/>Set in Kansas, in 2044, the story centres on Joe Simmons (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) - he's an assassin or 'looper' who's hired by a criminal organisation to kill targets sent back from a future where time-travel has been outlawed. However, during one particular contract, Joe is shocked to see that his latest target is his older self...<br/><br/>One of the most brilliant things about Looper is its awareness of the headaches that too many paradoxes can induce. In a wonderful moment of dialogue, writer/director Rian Johnson basically tells the audience not to worry about the inner machinations of the genre's logic, ""This time- travel crap fries your brain like an egg"", says Jeff Daniels' Mafia man Abe. But importantly, the place of the heart is not forgotten and the film succeeds on an emotional level just as well as it does on a technical one; which is quite a feat when your main character is cold-hearted and selfish killer.<br/><br/>And speaking of Mr. Gordon-Levitt, he delivers his best performance yet, portraying Joe with maturity, depth and nuance. And no, the make- up was not distracting. Best of all, he does not imitate Bruce Willis, but instead plays the kind of young man who would grow up to be the Bruce Willis we all know. Willis gives his best piece of acting in years, trading the action hero smirk for touches of melancholia that pay off dividends. All this is exemplified in a diner- set scene between the two Joes which shows just how good these two actors really are.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt does a completely convincing job as being more than just 'the female character'. Solid support also comes from the reliable Jeff Daniels and Paul Dano, while Noah Segsn is impressive and attention-grabbing as Kid Blue.<br/><br/>The film is also Johnson's best. After seeing (and loving) the John Hughes meets Raymond Chandler-isms of Brick and the mishandled The Brothers Bloom (Gordon-Levitt and Segan were in both), I was interested to see where he'd go next, and frankly, he has outdone himself with Looper. No better is this seen than in a bravura montage which shows how JGL becomes Bruce Willis; it's poignant, violent, dazzling and tender.<br/><br/>While there are flaws - some plot holes and a predictable final twist - as an overall piece, the film's positives massively outweigh its negatives, as far and few between they may be. It's easily one of the best films of the year."
"Troy_Campbell","9","2","17","29 September 2012"," Intelligently exhilarating.
","I enjoy big, silly action flicks as much as the next bloke, but I enjoy big, intelligent action flicks even more. Rian Johnson's third effort behind the camera (after the superb Brick and the disappointing The Brother's Bloom) is a sublime mix of stylised violence, edge-of-seat tension and thought-provoking narrative. There are no easy answers to the questions raised by Johnson's time-travel saga – for example, would you kill a small child if you knew he grew up to be a mass-murderer? – however these challenging themes never stop the film from being utterly exhilarating from start to finish. Whether it's the startling opening scene, the alternate path montage or the heart-in-mouth finale, Looper barely misses a beat thanks to Johnson's brilliant pacing and measured use of various camera techniques, Nathan Johnson's engrossing score and the subtly employed CGI which reaches its zenith during the telekinetic climax. The actors are all on song too; Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt and Jeff Daniels are perfectly cast as a fugitive from the future, a strong-willed mother and a charismatic mob boss respectively, but this is undoubtedly Joseph Gordon-Levitt's show. Playing Willis' younger self, who incidentally is trying to kill his older self (confused yet?), JGL is phenomenal as the arrogant, conflicted protagonist who on the surface is an egotistical prick but over time displays a deeper emotional understanding of how the world works. Epic, compelling, invigorating, thrilling: Looper is this and much, much more."

It's not the masterpiece it's made out to be by no means, it has huge gaping plot holes, so don't go in expecting something original, but that's not a huge criticism, time travel movies always have some sort of problem, so I just go with the movie, like I did with this.<br/><br/>Even though it's not original, it's very intelligent, and once we go thought the second time Joe meets himself, it changes it's path on a whole different route.<br/><br/>When the film changes pace is when older Joe realises his younger self is not doing what he should be doing (it's tricky to explain) and this is where the film takes a little turn on the Terminator path.<br/><br/>Older Joe has to do something unforgivable, in order to change his future, while younger Joe has to decipher a code which could mean something about his future. If you go with it, and just forgive the less plausible parts, it's an amazing movie.<br/><br/>Willis hasn't been this good in a very long time, and Levitt proves again he is one of the best young actors around today. Blunt turns up hallway through the second act, and the film again, turns its narrative structure on its head<br/><br/>Johnson has made a well crafted film. But many have classed this as the new Matrix, that's a load of rubbish, this has nothing at all to do with that movie, here we have a film more in common with Source Code, The Terminator, Twelve Monkeys, and in a little sub- plot involving a child Children of The Corn.<br/><br/>There are some great set pieces, one in particular involving disappearing body parts and addresses appearing on your body, and surprisingly, it's a very violent movie in places.<br/><br/>But the ending is very somber, yet happy, and what Levitt says bought a tear to my eye.<br/><br/>So once again, not the masterpiece many have said, but go with and you will find one of the most different science fiction movies released in a while"

"michaeljonasmurray","10","1","6","13 May 2013"," I don't get all the bad reviews
","The plot is fantastic, they could have gone a million different ways with this film...but I feel they chose the right one.<br/><br/>The make-up department did a decent job making Joe look like a young Bruce Willis, but that's my only complaint about the movie...the make up looked weird enough to defeat the purpose.<br/><br/>The 'looper' story is a cool idea, but the movie ended up being more about the group of people who have telekinetic powers, since the plot revolves around Bruce Willis' character anticipating the closure of his loop in order to avoid it, to stop a man from the future known as the ""Rainmaker"", who turns out to be the best character in the film. I think they set it up well for a sequel that follows up on what the Rainmaker becomes. They chose the perfect kid to play Cid, the boy who grows up to be the Rainmaker, taking control and closing loops to avenge the death of his mother at the hands of loopers. Much like Jeff Daniels' character said to Levitt's character early on...he saw this kid in a horrible situation and could ""picture the bad path"" that this child would take through his life, so he took him in and made him a young looper and changed the bad path that would have unraveled if he hadn't intervened. Levitt's character goes full circle at the end of the movie..picturing his future self killing Cid's mom and the dark, angry path that would lead Cid to use his TK powers to become the Rainmaker...he saw cause and effect right in front of his eyes, and much like what was done for him, he sees the bad path unraveling and decides to change it - by turning his blunderbuss on himself and taking his own life, saving Cid, his mother, and the wife that his future self came back to save. <br/><br/>This movie was about everything becoming a full circle with the loopers, and the way the ending was written, the movie itself comes full circle. I would definitely like to see a sequel that shows the path Cid does take with his extraordinary TK powers. He could be a cool superhero, but he would make an even better villain having the power he has. Hope to see it...meanwhile, you should definitely watch this movie."
"guyau-399-68372","1","1","6","22 December 2012"," Gun movie highlights what's wrong with America?
","I'm a fan of action movies, so I am used to violence on the screen, but, really, how much blood splatter do we need to see? The opening shotgun blast with blood-spurting body propelled backwards across the screen has requisite shock value, and you could say it is justified given the premise of the movie, but do we have to see it time and time again? This is otherwise a well-paced, suspenseful sci-fi movie – not particularly original – but it does its best to cover implausible time-travel tracks that raise more plot problems than they could possibly answer. Ultimately though, it lacks the hallmarks of good sci-fi - an interesting vision of the future or a telling projection of present-day society - and becomes just a gun movie than glorifies violence. OK, I confess, I've been deeply affected by recent events in Sandy Hook, but this movie shows children hunted down and killed, and Bruce Willis armed with twin machine guns, moving room by room through a building and systematically slaughtering all before him. This movie is a role model for the criminally insane, and it revels in unnecessary violence and gun glorification that does nothing to enhance a derivative script that is more violence fiction than science fiction. Wake up Hollywood!"

","Not a bad time travel story concerning executioners known as ""loopers"" who kill people sent back in time by criminals. The film is set in the future where, we are told, time travel has not yet been invented. Criminals in the 'loopers'' future need to 'dispose' of people from that future time by sending them back in time as people are so easily identified in the criminals' time that you can't have anonymous corpses then.<br/><br/>Of course, the executioners are well compensated for their work. Their biggest payday is earned when they execute their future selves! That is know as ""closing the loop"". They then have 30 years in which to live it up before...they get sent back in time to be eliminated (in order to cover the tracks of their future criminal employers). This, of course, brings many time travel paradoxes into play.<br/><br/>Whilst an interesting concept, the biggest drag on this movie is having another genre staple in the mix...telekinesis. Time travel is hard enough to get your head around but the addition of telekinesis strikes me as just naff. The movie could have been improved by tightening it (with the removal of that element). <br/><br/>The characters aren't particularly engaging either and they're not sympathetic for the most part. One looper - Joe - is the subject of the movie. His younger self is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and his older self is played by Bruce Willis (who has a superior time travel movie to his credit...""12 monkeys""...although his performance in that earlier movie wasn't what was good about it either). <br/><br/>Perhaps another detracting element from the film is the logic of time travel...the scenario as I outlined above seems to contradict scientific understanding of the limits of time travel. That understanding was best illustrated in the more brain hurting movie ""Primer"". I've reviewed that movie here and commented on it requiring flowcharts and notes to keep tabs on what is happening. ""Looper"" does pretend to be that complicated (Old Joe mentions the pitfalls of discussing time travel) but isn't. So, aside from seeming to portray an impossible form of time travel, it also seems to become incoherent in other ways too. When Joe has to ""close the loop"" on one occasion, the movie does seem to lapse into ""Groundhog day"" territory (a terrific comedy with some overlapping ideas) but then becomes confusing. I'm guessing that's because of bad story telling rather than any problems with the notion of time travel itself. That scene seems either inooherent or misleading. <br/><br/>Anyway, I did like the ending to this movie...even though I'm not sure it followed its own internal logic of what time travel entails!<br/><br/>Recommendations:<br/><br/>12 monkeys <br/><br/>Primer. You really do need a flowchart and a notepad to keep up! <br/><br/>Groundhog day"
"politically_incorrect204","9","1","6","7 October 2012"," Looper - Brilliantly Original
","Thankfully there are enough intelligent people to outweigh all of the idiots on here. IMDb used to be the place for cinephiles but that's changed over the last few years. Regardless don't all of the idiots stop you from seeing this film. I will forewarn you that it is a bit more challenging to follow and will make you think. So you're simply looking for a good action shoot em up it may not satisfy you. If you're looking for a sci-fi film on par with movies like Blade Runner get in line. Personally I'm a huge film of Rian Johnson. He pulls no punches. His stories are incredibly well written with a high attention to detail. And this movie is his best to date. Joseph Gordon Levitt is his usual brilliant self in here. Bruce Willis does well and finally isn't ""dying hard"". I think one thread said it best if you focus on the time travel you miss the point. <br/><br/>Ultimately this film is about presenting a complicated moral dilemma within an action/sci-fi context. The protagonist has decide to go from selfish to selfless. A change that doesn't happen easily or quickly. And it makes you question how far would you go to preserve your own happiness. Would you kill anyone, even children? It explores people's desire to do absolutely anything to preserve their own life purely out of selfish desire of self preservation. The film definitely challenges the viewer several times as to what is right or wrong and at what point those things intersect or change places. <br/><br/>The moral dilemma aside the sci-fi portions are excellent. I like that the film is anchored and believable as a not too distant future. Aside from time travel everything is rather believable. Watch closely to see that all vehicles have been converted to electric or alternative fuel cars with these big black ugly conversion kits on all the older cars. A brilliant touch of detail and very realistic since if that is the direction all cars go to chances are old vehicles will continue to exist but will need converted. There are also solar panels roughly attached to many vehicles. Aside from that the vaguely dystopian look of the world but not overly futuristic look is made so well and so believably. <br/><br/>Lastly as an action film it's great. Nothing gratuitous. Good characters, good action scenes, believable action, no one leaping buildings, etc. <br/><br/>A lot of people just don't get how brilliant this film is. Thankfully the critics do, hence why they're critics and a majority of the idiots on here are not. Even people in the theater behind us said, ""Really?"" and ""That was lame."" Which is staggering. This is definitely more of a moral dilemma film with a strong sci-fi and action element. If you want pure action go see some crappy Die Hard film."

I just got home from the theater where I watched Looper & I must say that it was just as amazing as I thought it was gonna be. It was very unique & it has some very shocking moments. I have never seen a film quite like this. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did an amazing job portraying the films main character, Joe. (Let me just add that Gordon-Levitt is a very attractive man, even in this movie, where he is barely recognizable.) Although, I will admit that Bruce Willis' acting was a little shotty. (Give him a break, he's getting old.) Over all the movie was outstanding & worth the 10 bucks a ticket & the 7 bucks for a small popcorn. If I don't find an excuse to go see it in the theater again, I will definitely be anxiously awaiting it's blu-ray release."
"toqtaqiya2","8","1","6","4 October 2012"," A thought-provoking and thrilling sci-fi action film with a dose of originality.
","Looper is an exciting science fiction film which doesn't burst with originality but manages to bring something new to the genre anyway. In addition, it's also a crime film so there's no denying that in parts it's very violent. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis, playing the same main character, do an admirable job. It's presented well how a person can change as time passes. Director Rian Johnson wrote a good script so the actors have enough time to develop their characters. Jeff Daniels, in particular, is a standout. His role is relatively minor but he impresses when he explains the high stakes of being a looper. As the film moves along, after an informative but rather dull beginning, the sci-fi elements of the story begin to develop. The action too becomes frequent and entertaining, leading to an impressive ending. The future world of Looper is a mix of the ordinary and the fantastic. Mostly it's ordinary because Johnson tried to present a lived-in and quite possible future. He did an admirable job though it's clear that a sci-fi action film was new territory for him because the film's different elements don't come together as well as they should. Despite this it's a thrilling adventure which will no doubt impress viewers. In conclusion, Looper is another solid effort by Johnson. In my opinion, it's not an instant classic but it's certainly a film worth seeing."
"homerandbart10","9","2","19","30 September 2012"," So refreshingly original!

The camera angles and movements were great too, thank to Rian Johnson the director who also did a GREAT job! I loved the first part of the film, it explained everything really well, and i was pumped to see what was going to happen. <br/><br/>I thought you knew most of the film from the trailer, but i was wrong. The little boy, Cid, was amazing and i loved his character. The scene where he killed Jesse by screaming, is a scene I won't forget in the recent time. Last the ending; I have to admit I did not see it coming when Young Joe shot himself, I was sure he was going to shoot Old Joe, but again i was positively surprised. <br/><br/>At first i didn't get the ending fully, but when i got home did some research i started loving the movie even more. First i thought i was going to give it an 8,5 but as the day went on, i realized just how great it was, and raised it to 9,5. In my opinion this movie is a classic.<br/><br/>I LOVED IT!

"dkp612","9","2","19","29 September 2012"," Surprisingly surprising...
","I'm mostly writing this review because of my husband. He's the type of person that actually likes to read them before he goes to see the movie while I prefer to make up my own mind without any preconceptions or expectations. <br/><br/>If he had known how much gritty violence there was in the Looper, he wouldn't have gone to see it. And there really is quite a lot - from the very beginning you see the main character shoot people he doesn't know for no other reason but the money he gets for it. It's cold and gritty and paints a very bleak picture of the life in the near future. Saying that - I don't think all that violence was gratuitous. I thought it was a very effective tool and I found it more palatable then many less gritty action movies with a higher body count but less realism. <br/><br/>I loved the movie. I thought it was one of the best dystopian movies I've ever seen. It was really more of the psychological thriller with a redemption side story then a straight sci fi. <br/><br/>As I mentioned in my title, it was really surprisingly surprising. Most movies don't offer me anything new these days. They're done 'by the numbers' and you pretty much know within first 20 min how they're going to end. Which is fine too, as long as it's well directed and well acted.<br/><br/>Now Looper is not only well directed and acted, it is also quite original and the twists are imaginative. I don't want to give too many spoilers...<br/><br/>BIG SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>...but the little boy was absolutely brilliant as the potential monster. I loved how the subject of a person's childhood potentially shaping a whole world's future is realised within this movie. <br/><br/>Really, all the cast was so well chosen and the support cast was just as impressive as the stars. The women were such subtly realised archetypes of a seductress, the good woman that redeems the anti-hero and a mother doing everything for her child. All three of them were beautifully 3 dimensional. <br/><br/>Same with the male characters - though not quite as easy to fit into archetypes. <br/><br/>I would definitely see it again - which, to me, is the ultimate test of quality. The only reason I don't give it 10 out of 10 is that I really would've liked a little more world building, but I do see why that might not have been feasible. <br/><br/>You know - this would make an awesome TV series - so much room for development..."

","Too often now, science fiction means a futuristic setting populated by millions of computer-generated pixels, with storytelling taking second fiddle to visuals. Rian Johnson, however, knows how to tell a story, and this shows in every second of his newest flick, Looper, a smart, time-traveling action film that embraces the inherent impossibilities of time travel and uses them to tell a surprisingly compelling tale This film is something else. Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Joe, a hit man for the 2070s mob who kills his victims by ambushing them after they travel backwards thirty years in time to 2044. Of course, this all changes when his future self (Bruce Willis) arrives from the future, looking for the infant version of a future tyrant called the Rainmaker. More than this, I will not reveal, as the way the story and dialogue unfold deserve to be left unspoiled for any potential viewer. A very cool dilemma, though, is explored in the event in the film of ""closing the loop."" If Old Joe came back from the future, doesn't that mean that he's already experienced these events? Never mind. As he says in a restaurant, ""I don't want to talk about time travel. We'd be here for hours drawing diagrams with straws."" And that they would. But somehow, the screenplay almost manages to avoid the idea of time paradoxes altogether, but remains complex enough to allow viewers to figure out the story as it goes along. Very few films can keep you guessing the whole way through, but Looper pulls it off effortlessly. Unfortunately, there's really not too much to say about this film without going into the story, but it is filled with colorful characters, high-octane action, and one of the smartest sci-fi scripts ever written. If you're a fan of smart science fiction, you owe it to yourself to see this film. There's really not much like it."
"zetes","7","1","7","30 September 2012"," Fun, but there wasn't enough thought put into its premise
","The third film from the director of Brick and The Brothers Bloom. This is Johnson's first big Hollywood film, and I had a hope he would make a revolutionary science-fiction picture that would blow every summer blockbuster out of the water. Alas, that's not how it's gone down, but Looper is certainly a fun sci-fi thriller. Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as a mob hit-man known as a Looper, whose job it is to whack victims sent back from 30 years in the future (why this has to be done is hastily and unsatisfactorily explained by JGL in voice-over). Every looper knows that one day he will have to kill the future version of himself, for which deed he will be compensated enough to live comfortably for the rest of his life. When it's JGL's turn, though, his future self, played by Bruce Willis, gets the better of him and escapes, and the mob is after them both. Time travel is one of the hardest science-fiction concepts to deal with, but there are just a handful of great time travel stories. I don't think this is one of them. For as smart as Johnson came off with Brick and The Brothers Bloom, the time travel premise seems like it should be far smarter. But whenever they try to explain the concept, the characters always say something like ""it's cloudy"" or ""it's hazy."" Johnson's superior visual sense isn't much present here, either. It's a well directed film, for sure, but it's nothing amazing. With all of my complaints, I will say, even if I was disappointed, I was entertained. It's a fun picture. I just wish it weren't directed by Rian Johnson. Acting honors go to Emily Blunt and Jeff Daniels. Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis are both fine, though I did think that JGL was a little busy trying to impersonate Willis."

","Rian Johnson...he's extremely talented, and he definitely proves it with Looper, a mixture of sci-fi/1970s brutality. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is brilliant in this film, taking the task of mimicking Bruce Willis in a phenomenal way. The chemistry between the two leads in undeniably rude, comedic, and heart-breaking. But what makes this film profound is the story you think you know (based on the trailers). Let me tell you now, this film is not about a looper trying to kill his future self. There's far more to this film than that. What starts out as an action-packed thriller turns into a humanism story of the questions of right and wrong. Please go watch this film AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! If I was asked to recommend one film from 2012 to watch, it would have to be this one."

","Looper,wow! I'm writing this less than an hour after seeing the film, and the emotions rushing throughout my mind are nothing short of intriguing. This movie will make you want to instantly see it again. To be completely honest, I have to see this movie again, for a number of reasons. The first reason, is that this movie is daring, and I love that about it; it experiments with obscure camera angles and a number of changes in the plot, as well as the progression of the story. Kim Newman, from ""Empire"" described this movie absolutely perfectly. She said, ""Looper isn't perfect, but it pulls off the full Wizard Of Oz: it has a brain, courage and a heart."" The first part is key, ""Looper isn't perfect."" Nothing is perfect and no movie is, they come close, and sometimes too close to call, but still, nothing is perfect. Thats the beauty of film, and the genius of this film. It knows that it cannot be perfect, so it decides to experiment, and push the audiences buttons. For the first few minutes, one cannot help but marvel at the beauty, as well as the scope of it. Each scene is shot perfectly, and in theaters gives the viewer quite the rush. You may think you know what your getting into, but you have no idea, and I refuse to spoil it, it would be unfair to the reader to be robbed of such an experience. Not only is the cinematography spectacular, the acting is some of the best I've seen. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is nothing short of amazing, and the rest of the cast does a pretty damn good job, if I do say so myself. For me, the best part about this film was the emotion. There were scenes that made me shiver, at how horrifying they were, and at how much feeling the actor was radiating. In short, if you haven't scene this film, go see it, I refuse to take no for an answer. If you have, go see it again, I definitely will be."

","Rian Johnson May not have been the best possibly choice for Star Wars, but when it comes to indie movies, he's always been successful.<br/><br/>Looper is a well made movie with lots of homage to other amazing time travel films. I loved this movie a lot and will definitely keep it on my rewatch list"
"pk_nayar","8","1","8","5 October 2012"," A time-travelling, philosophical, intelligent mind-bender of a film
","I entered the cinema not expecting much, which in hindsight was probably a good thing. Looper is in essence a brief study of man's constant dilemma of fate vs. choice. What if I had taken the other path, what would be life be like? Writer/Director Rian Johnson takes this simple yet convoluted premise and adds in some action and a whole lot of science fiction that results in an excellent film.<br/><br/>Time-travel plays a massive part of the film's storyline and this means you just have to not think about the paradoxes, lest it causes your brain to melt. Joseph Gordon-Levitt takes on a different tone as he is not his usual charming self that we are used to seeing in his previous films. Instead, as Joe Simmons, he portrays a ruthless contract-killer known as a Looper; and he does not flinch a muscle when he completes his assignments. In 2074, time travel has been discovered but outlawed and when the mob wants to get rid of someone, the target is sent 30 years into the past to be killed by the aforementioned Loopers. However, when it's time for the Looper to go, they are sent back in time to be killed by their younger versions, in what is called 'closing the loop'.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis plays the older Joe who gets sent back but with a small twist, he escapes the younger Joe. Older Joe then goes on his mission to hunt down the Rainmaker, the man who controls the mob in 2074, only he is just a kid in 2034. What happens next forms the crux of the film that sees it ending with a great riposte to that age-old paradigm of fate vs. choice.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt continues to show why he is hell-bent on being his generation's best actor as he undergoes a total facial change to look like a young-ish Bruce Willis. His portrayal as frayed, fragile yet strong junkie is fantastic. In fact, in the diner scene, he goes toe-to- toe with Willis in the way he speaks down to cadence and slight Jersey accent that Willis naturally has.<br/><br/>Willis meanwhile is solid in every single frame he is in, displaying his emotional range as well as his undoubted action credentials. Jeff Daniels looked like he really enjoyed himself playing Abe, Joe's present day boss who was sent by back by the Rainmaker to keep things on a leash in 2034. Emily Blunt as Sara is sufficient although to be honest that role could have been played by anyone.<br/><br/>The person that almost steals the show is the young Pierce Gagnon who displays a maturity in his acting that is far beyond his age. It is astonishing to think that he was only 5 at the time of filming. As Sid, Sara's son, Pierce shines as boy who is unable to control who he is. I'm not going to give much more, watch the film to know what I mean.<br/><br/>This is without a shadow of a doubt the best Sci-Fi film of 2012 (well at least until I watch Cloud Atlas, which looks pretty good as well). In fact, I would go as far as to rank this in the Top 5 Sci-Fi films of the 21st Century (Inception, Donnie Darko, Looper, District 9 and Moon in that order)<br/><br/>Catch this ahead of any over-hyped drivel (yes I'm looking at you Total Recall etc.) that is showing in cinemas now"

It is true unique because it recalls the ""inception"", you have to focus and keep thinking otherwise you gonna lose track. However, when the result came into the scene, I was more than shocked. It tortured my brain and lashed my soul! It interrogated the things deep inside! I strongly recommend this movie!!! You won't be brainwashed, but rather, inspired!"

It is sharp, nasty, thrilling, brutal & inventive. Rian Johnson does such a great job with cracking dialog, cracking visuals & sharp cuts that it almost kills me to say that when this movie goes out to pasture it just about ""buys the farm"".<br/><br/>""The Departed"" died when Nicholson's character croaked. This film almost dies when it goes into a field of bad dreams. Its pacing completely changes. A head rush becomes a marathon.<br/><br/>The performances are well above par. Joseph Gordon-Levitt can carry a film as he proves here. (His work in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" had surprising gravitas.) Bruce is Bruce. The make-up didn't distract me one bit due to the acting. To say that Jeff Daniels is under-appreciated has become a cliché.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 11/10 for the 1st hour & a 5/10 for its 2nd hour.

"jadepietro","7","1","8","2 October 2012"," In and Out of the Loop
","This film is recommended.<br/><br/>The fundamental things apply as time goes by and by and by in the intriguing futuristic sci-fi fantasy known as Looper. It has strong special effects, a well-constructed script, and a cast of actors who spring into action whenever needed. The film doesn't always stay on course, but it usually piques one's interest with its intelligent screenplay.<br/><br/>The year is 2074, but we almost immediately loop back to the past, circa 2044. That year is the drop-off point of human recycling as the mob uses their hit-men to take out its human garbage, leaving no evidence of any murders in their present day dimension. This is time- travel with an evil twist as we meet one of a group of specialized assassins known as loopers: Joe ( Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) is ready to dispatch another transported victim. The body count of his victims grows as does his reputation and his wages. One slight glitch in the life of any looper: The job has a short shelf life, and every looper will automatically be forced into retirement. There will be a day in their future where the looper will be hired to execute himself, that is, an older prototype of himself. And that day eventually arrives when Joe discovers his designated target is a 30 year older version of himself ( Bruce Willis ). To kill or not to kill? The cat and mouse chase begins.<br/><br/>Director / writer Rian Johnson takes his clever premise and keeps his mind games in motion throughout most of his film until he begins to introduce some sub-plots and characters that become close reminders of other sci-fi predecessors, particularly the plot line to The Terminator mixed with an old Twilight Zone episode starring a young Billy Mumy. Until that point, the film is a fresh and original diversion. At the midway point, it begins to lose some of its energy.<br/><br/>Still, the lead actors have enough chemistry between them to fully engage the movie-going audience with enough action and thought-provoking situations, even if the film, begins to lose interest in their initial relationship taking them on separate paths to solve their dilemmas and adding some unnecessary complications in the process. <br/><br/>It is the actors' relationship that makes Looper more fascinating than it really is. In fact, Gordon-Levitt wears some prosthetic make-up throughout the film to resemble some of Willis' physical traits. The actor also imitates some of his quirks and line delivery to try to make a direct connection to his older character. It's an interesting concept and works most of the time. ( The make-up, however, does not always succeed and, in some scenes, becomes a distraction, with Gordon-Levitt not even resembling the character he is playing. His facial appearance seems overworked and unintentionally disconcerting in a few key scenes, but even then, the make-up, at least, looks real. ) Willis plays on his strength as the sage action hero with very few words to impart, but he handles his guns well. His quieter scenes actually show off his range as one of our more underrated actors.<br/><br/>Both Emily Blunt who plays Sara, a tough survivor type with a temperamental tyke at her side and Jeff Daniels as Abe, a notorious mob boss who enjoys his menace and his power, give ample support and use their acting skills to breathe some depth into their stereotypical roles of good and evil.<br/><br/>So Looper is a relatively entertaining movie that tries to deal with larger issues like changing one's own destiny or the effect of time continuum relationships, but ultimately, Looper seems more comfortable just being a solid action flix, sacrificing its sci-fi origins in exchange for shoot-em-up thrills, leaving the film's more absorbing prospects lost somewhere in time.

","I like movies that put characters in moral dilemmas in which nothing they choose is easy or right, and yet they must choose. Science fiction is uniquely suited to create exactly this kind of moral dilemma -- but most film sci-fi is just mindless adventure. So I'm thrilled when something this brilliant and powerful comes along.<br/><br/>To enjoy this movie, though, you actually have to think, and emotionally invest in the characters. To put it bluntly, this is the kind of movie that dumb people call dumb, because they don't realize (or don't care) how many levels it's working on.<br/><br/>Most movie sci-fi doesn't approach the level of print sci-fi.

"jdennist","7","1","9","30 September 2012"," Extremely uneven; much to recommend, much to shake one's head over
","Since I've already warned about spoilers, I might as well start with this: I didn't care for the ending. Cid has already caused the deaths of two people and seems to be filled with dangerous anger–could he not, still, become the Rainmaker? We've already seen Old Joe kill one child, and he was clearly distraught over doing it–he's not an indiscriminate slaughterer–so the reasoning behind Young Joe's suicide iswhat, exactly? Why not just kill Old Joe and stay with Sara and Cid, keeping an eye on him to make sure he doesn't go bad? The people who were after him are all dead–so why not live a happy life with Sara? The ending really, as far as I'm concerned, can't stand up to scrutiny.<br/><br/>My other gripes with the film were less significant, but still worth noting. Emily Blunt isn't bad, butwho thought casting her as a Kansas housewife was a good idea? Sara isn't a terribly well written character either–her deflated toughness early on is pretty hoary–but the casting of Blunt just seems random.<br/><br/>Rian Johnson's writing here and there gets really heavy-handed, and worse, he makes surprisingly little use of the whole time-travel premise. The RT consensus calls it ""uncommonly smart""compared to what, exactly? There's some cleverness at work here, yes, but UNCOMMONLY smart? I don't see it.<br/><br/>Finally, Paul Dano. Are we supposed to like his character? He's ridiculously annoying, hammy, and all-around tiresome. It's hard to believe he would have been an especially viable hit-man to begin with, but that's irrelevant; what IS relevant is the question of how much sympathy we're meant to feel for him. I felt none, although the scene where is older self is being slowly dismembered while trying to reach his torturers is one of the best in the film.<br/><br/>With all that out of the way, what did I LIKE about the film? Joseph Gordon-Levitt was good, Bruce Willis was good (although his presence just underscores the superiority of 12 Monkeys, a very similar film), Jeff Daniels was fun to seethe hedonistic montage early on was excellent, Joe's 30 years in Shanghai was a compelling bit of montage as well, the action scenes were generally quite well done (including Old Joe's rampage at the gang's HQ), and the scene between the two Joes in the diner was very good indeed–in fact, the film needed more interaction between Gordon-Levitt and Willis, as that could've been the backbone of a great film, and not just one element of a very uneven one."

","'LOOPER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis star in this time travel Sci-Fi action film written and directed by Rian Johnson (who also wrote and directed the critically acclaimed crime films 'BRICK', also starring Gordon-Levitt, and 'THE BROTHERS BLOOM'). The story revolves around a future where the mob uses time travel to dispose of bodies and the hit men assigned to do the disposing are called 'loopers'. Gordon-Levitt stars as one such 'looper' and Willis plays his older self, who's sent back for his younger self to get rid of. The film is a pretty fresh and interesting take on the time travel genre and it's excellently crafted by Johnson.<br/><br/>The film is set in the year 2044 when the world has fallen in to another economic recession and organized crime has escalated. Mutations causing telekinetic abilities have also appeared in about 10% of the population as well and crime lords have learned that thirty years in the future time travel will be developed and immediately outlawed. This doesn't stop crime rings from taking advantage of it though and they use it to get rid of bodies, by sending victims back in time to be killed (due to new tracking technology making it impossible to secretly dispose of a body). The men hired to do the disposing are called 'loopers' and when their contracts are up their future self is sent back in time for them to kill, leaving them a limited future of only thirty years but also a hefty paycheck to spend living it. When one such looper, Joe (Gordon-Levitt), fails to kill his future self (Willis) and lets him escape he finds himself in a world of trouble and on the run from the mob. He desperately tries to track his older self down while the 'Old Joe' has a plan of his own in extending his life and future happiness.<br/><br/>The movie is a lot of fun if you like these types of movies. The directing and visuals are topnotch and the story is unique and clever. If you think about certain plot points for too long though (like every time travel movie) you'll start to see a lot of possible plot holes but they're not important to the enjoyment of the film (if you don't let yourself get caught up in them). Willis and Gordon-Levitt are perfectly cast as older and younger versions of each other and it appears as though there's some great CGI and makeup to make Gordon-Levitt look uncannily like a young Bruce Willis. Emily Blunt also has a nice supporting role as the mother of an especially gifted telekinetic mutant (played eerily by Pierce Gagnon). I also really liked how the film kind of makes the viewer surprisingly shift who their rooting for as who appears to be the good guy and who appears to be somewhat of a bad guy changes unexpectedly. The film is most of all highly entertaining. It's dark and violent and definitely not the most uplifting Sci-Fi film but it's still a lot of fun.

","Has the future started yet? I was wondering that yesterday, when I pulled out my iPhone (4 not 5, i'm not that hip), and watched as a tiny blue orb representing me moved from a bus stop to a theatre, where I'd see a movie with a ticket I had purchased out of thin air with my phone. All of this, accomplished with the touch of my finger. Sure, it's not teleporters and laser guns, but the gap between our present, and the expectations older generations had for it, is rapidly closing. <br/><br/>Which is probably why science fiction keeps coming back to the few ideas that have always seemed beyond our reach, like time travel. For as insane, probably impossible, as its existence might be, we've gone out of our way to make sure that whoever finds it first can just watch a movie or read a book to figure out which rules were right. It might be as simple as Back to the Future, or as paralyzingly complex as Primer. What makes Rian Johnson's take on the concept, Looper, so fascinating, is that it's interested in the motives behind time travel, not the mechanics. <br/><br/>As futuristic assassin Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) lay's out matter-of-factly, time travel is a part of life 30 years from now, even if it won't be invented for another 60. Crime lords of the year 2074 maintain a monopoly on the technology, using it to extradite troublemakers from their time to 2044, to be eliminated by low-level triggermen called loopers. A high-ranking transplant from the future, Abe (Jeff Daniels), organizes the hits, and was responsible for setting an orphaned Joe on a path: be at the right place, at the right time, dispose of the anonymous person who appears there, and be rewarded with money, respect, and any number of immediate pleasures. <br/><br/>The opening act is like a good piece of pulpy short fiction, showing us what would happen if the noir-influenced world of Johnson's first film, Brick, were left to rust. It's all blown-out windows and busted rain gutters, where the sign outside the local looper gin joint, La Belle Aurore, is written in font you'd find on the cover of any James Ellroy novel. It's a world going to hell slowly enough to not cause a panic, just a creeping sense of dread, but the drapes change every few years so that no one notices that the building is burning down. <br/><br/>""Loopers aren't the most forward thinking bunch,"" Joe says of his colleagues, which is as true for him as everyone else (tellingly, the looper weapon of choice, retro blunderbusses, only have a range of 15 feet). As part of his contract, he'll eventually have to kill his future self, sent back in time to the present in order to wipe out any evidence they ever existed. Failing to ""close the loop"" has fatal consequences for both vintages of the Looper, as evidenced by a gut-churning sequence where an older looper on the lam dissolves, bit by bit, as his former self is slowly butchered. Despite his greater awareness of what the world has become, and where it is heading, Joe just uses this knowledge to rationalize his own series of bad, self- interested decisions. If the party's almost over, might as well get yours before the music stops. <br/><br/>When Joe screws up the hit on his future self (Bruce Willis), they both become the target, the difference being that Older Joe comes with a mission: find those responsible for sending him back from 2074, and kill them in the past. And just when you think Looper is going to reach for the throttle, Johnson reins it in, and starts to pull the rug out from under you. There are still a number of gritty and violent shootouts ahead, and plenty more time-bending logistics, but instead of turning up to full boil, Looper settles into a slow burn, and his stylish action flick transforms into a sci-fi-infused character study. <br/><br/>That two key pieces of the ensemble -a steely farm owner (Emily Blunt) and her gifted son (Pierce Gagnon)- aren't introduced until the midpoint shows the deliberate measures Johnson takes to invest us in a story of a man about as literally at war with himself as possible. Willis, as the world-weary Old Joe, at first seems like the embodiment of all the signposts from the future that young Joe has been ignoring, a living warning of what a life of nihilistic complacency can lead to. Yet Johnson constructs his characters with deep histories- not just backstories, but lifetimes of hard choices and tragedy, made apparent through a line of dialogue or just a look. What becomes clear is that the events of the past aren't what's obdurate, it's the people. <br/><br/>With nods to Akira, Twelve Monkeys and even a bit of Superman, Johnson's eclectic tastes are fuelled by just the right amount of the quirk that could overpower many moments of his last film, The Brothers Bloom. And the look recalls another think piece, Tree of Life, only one that backs up the dreamy visuals with some lucid thinking. Well, too a point. The technicals of time travel are mostly elided by Old Joe giving a hand-waving explanation that the exact details are ""cloudy."" <br/><br/>This will irk purists and create as much discussion about the story's mechanics as its themes, but it's so, so much more about the latter than the former. When the powerful finale arrives, and three generations of people are forced to make choices about what they want the future to be, it feels relevant, and urgent. If that's not the hallmark of great science fiction, then what is?"
"Jake_Durr","8","1","11","1 October 2012"," Good but flawed
","So I liked this movie but I don't understand how they didn't see all the flaws in it. A lot of them have been stated by other reviews I have read, although there is one that I haven't come across for some reason in other's reviews that I think is really obvious. So when it flashes back to Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character after he falls from the fire escape for the first time, he shoots his future Bruce Willis self. Then it continues and shows him (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) grow into Bruce Willis. If that happened then the 'Rainmaker' wouldn't be the 'Rainmaker' because it later shows that it was Bruce Willis killing Emily Blunt's character that caused the kid to turn into the 'Rainmaker', but that wouldn't happen. If he had killed his future self originally then how in gods name would the kid turn into the 'Rainmaker' that way. If there was no Bruce Willis returning from the future to kill the kids mom then there would be no 'Rainmaker', and with no 'Rainmaker' there would be no guy closing loops (which is also a part of the movie riddled with flaws) and he wouldn't of gotten sent back in the first place. The whole plot of the movie crumbles and just flies out the window with that discovery. It really makes me mad that this is how things would turn out if they did follow what happens in the movie because I liked the movie, it was a good movie but just that one big flaw ruins it a bit... a lot... but it was still good. Now that you've read this isn't your mind blown and just freakin' on the table across the room? Because if you start thinking about flaws in this movie after seeing it you will, well, do exactly what I said in that last sentence, with the having your mind blown and whatnot."

","Ryan Johnson finally lives up to the tremendously high bar he had set with BRICK. The script is extremely well crafted. The performances were exceptional. Last but not least, the direction was superb. There has not been a film out there is a very long time that has engaged me on a intellectual, visceral and emotional level. A thought provoking piece of cinema that makes bold choices because it is what is required to do the story justice. It has been way too long since a film achieve what films are capable of achieving. I'm sorry if some people feel that this is unfair to say due to some of the films that have come out lately but in recent memory I have consistently left theaters feeling a void. I longed for a film that was genuinely original, well executed and satisfying. I finally had that experience. That is not to say that there are not minor shortcomings in LOOPER.

"Foxbot","9","1","11","30 September 2012"," Great well done Action Sci-fi Flick. Lots of Surprises.
","By the movie trailer, I thought I knew what to expect from Looper. I thought it would be a semi-mindless sci-fi action movie with little character development and a weak plot. Boy was I wrong.<br/><br/>Looper does have action, it is a futuristic sci-fi movie, yet it is also deep. There is a lot of character development and you really thirst for knowledge about the characters past, or future. It is more violent and there is a bit more swearing that I originally would have thought, however the it is the simple ideas and plot developments which are so well depicted and directed throughout the film which amazed me.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt was great and considering the role, of being the young Bruce Willis, he did great. Levitt is the main character, though his older future self, Bruce Willis also holds quite a large role too.<br/><br/>You may have noticed in the trailer that Joseph Gordon-Levitt does not look quite like himself. This is true because they digitally altered his face, eyes and nose to look like Bruce Willis's rugged mug. They really did a great job of doing this and I was honestly quite surprised.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes, I was caught off guard about a lot of things. There are a few twists in the plot, however they are more like surprises that I did not see coming which further advance the story and what you think you may know about the characters.<br/><br/>Over-all Looper was a great sci-fi action movie and it is one of the better movies I have seen all year. I do plan on purchasing this on Blu-ray the day it is available.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","It's best if you go into the cinema without knowing what the story is about because you'll have a pleasant experience.<br/><br/>The story is interesting and while you need to pay attention in the beginning there's not much in the sense of brow furrowing twists. It's not foolproof, not utterly brilliant, by any means but it serves its purpose in keeping you focused till the end.<br/><br/>The acting is very well done by JGL. Willis is pretty much the same in movies these days so I can't rate his acting. Just chalk it up to Bruce Willis being...Bruce Willis. I'm not a fan of Emily Blunt but she was good here and her accent was flawless. Jeff Daniels was so-so. I felt he had an important role to play in the story but he was just relegated to being a goon, and a pointless goon at that.<br/><br/>While there are questions about the plot and the time travel and the idea of a looper in general it's not enough to deter your experience. It's one of the better movies in an awful and disappointing year in terms of cinematic experience."
"johnnymacbest","9","1","12","30 September 2012"," The most original Sci-Fi film I've seen this year.
","While Hollywood has taken a beating in terms of rehashes and remakes; some really good like ""Dredd 3d"" and of course the Nolan Batman films as well as several others worth mentioning, they're are of course a few gems that are original in concept and narrative. ""Looper"" the latest Sci-Fi film from director Riam Johnson is such a refreshing and original concept that I couldn't help but be immersed in it's well-constructed and thrillingly acted atmosphere.<br/><br/>The premise is something I've never seen on paper before and no doubt I was confused as the well-written plot unfolded on screen. Many of the ideas presented in ""Looper"" are very unheard of and I for one was caught up in the film while trying to pick up things as it went along. I'm looking forward to a second and third viewing in order to fully understand and appreciate it's complex plot with many twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>But the best parts of this film is the plot and characters. Oodles of character development, which is very important for a film, is prevalent hear with personal relationships, revelations; everything you want in a film and more. Since this is an action film, the action scenes are well done as well as the special effects, which are thankfully not numerous as seen in other films, but the complement, rather than overwhelm the film which lets the audience concentrate more on the story. Some say that the pacing was a little too slow; I tend to disagree as any film with this richness deserves to be savored at a methodical pace and thankfully ""Looper"" gives me that and more. I'd choose this film over Expendables 2 anything as that film is, pardon the pun ""expendable"".<br/><br/>Acting wise everyone does a good job with the wonderful material they are given with. With high-calibre actors such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt and Jeff Daniels, every scene they are in(especially the diner scene) they chew it up with irony and delivery.<br/><br/>I had a really good time with ""Looper"". A film that is so original that it's complex and confusing(in a good way)plot definitely demands repeat viewings and rewards you for doing so. Challenging and intriguing, ""Looper"" is one of the best Sci-Fi films of the year and also the most well-written and acted. Rian Johnson is one director to watch out for and I can't wait to see what he comes up with next."

","One of my favorite things about Looper is that it shows a fairly interesting gritty future reality and much of the writers' plotting actually makes sense.<br/><br/>If you think about it, it makes a good deal of sense that the Loopers are paid via silver and gold bars. These precious metals hold a good deal of value through time, plus they have the added benefit of being probably a good bit cheaper in the future.<br/><br/>The kid that plays young Cid does an excellent job with a very tricky part and Bruce Willis is of course amazing as usual. Joseph Gordon-Levitt shows some real acting chops, that we always knew he had anyway.<br/><br/>The ending was a bit underwhelming, but is at least a bit feel-good. Fun sci-fi flick for science nerds."
"rollieuk","9","1","15","29 September 2012"," Time travelling film that never loses the plot.
","I'm sure if I'd been paying more attention I would have heard more about Looper before this week but I haven't and I didn't so when I checked out a couple of reviews mid-week it literally was the first I'd heard about Rian Johnson's latest film. With unison all the reviews I read said it was a good film, most saying excellent and one or two saying good but confusing. I normally leave it a week before going to the cinema to watch a new film to give the screens a chance to calm down but with universally strong reviews I made an exception and I'm seriously glad I did.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into the premise of the film too much, you can get that elsewhere, I just want to highlight how tight and well written the film is and definitely not confusing for anyone that enjoys sci-fi. I liked Johnson's first film of note, Brick (also with Joseph Gordon-Levitt), but to pull off such a feat with a time travelling themed movie, is something Johnson deserves the utmost credit for. Time travelling plots can get confusing fast but Looper works, borrowing from Terminator but still with more than enough for the film to stand on its own merit.<br/><br/>I do get a feel of Nolan about Johnson's work but that's not to take anything away from him at all. People who are at the top of their game are bound to have some similarities between them. The balance between thoughtfulness, depth of character, attention to detail and action is almost perfect and the last film I saw that managed this four way brilliance was in my opinion, The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>Willis is Willis, Gordon-Levitt does an excellent job of being Willis, Emily Blunt and Jeff Daniels are also good and a special mention goes to Pierce Gagnon who plays creepy kid so well.<br/><br/>In a year of quite a few highly anticipated, big hitting, action sci-fi movie releases, Looper is the best so far, hands down."
"ZChrisJ1995","9","1","15","29 September 2012"," Best sci-fi film of 2012
","Over the years there have been many 'high-concept' sci-fi films to hit our screens, some brilliant but many mediocre. Looper fits the former category, and will in the years to come sit along the likes of The Matrix and Inception.<br/><br/>Essentially, the film concerns a titular 'looper' named Joe, whose job is to execute people sent back from the future by criminal organisations. One day, Joe witnesses his future self being sent back, who escapes. In order to protect his life from his employers, Joe must hunt down and kill his former self, who has big plans of his own.<br/><br/>Looper has the huge potential to turn into just another shoot-em-up action flick, but luckily the action isn't the primary focus, though when it is present, it is executed well. The film utilises interesting cinematography techniques to give its action scenes a distinct art-house feel, and doesn't go over the top in this sense.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been repeatedly proving himself as a formidable actor who is willing to tackle difficult roles. Though I wasn't entirely convinced by his makeup, he was flawlessly able to manipulate Bruce Willis' voice and mannerisms. The character Joe himself is likable, with his younger self being motivated by money yet not lacking his humanity. Alternatively, Bruce Willis' performance is reminiscent of his previous portrayal in 12 Monkeys, a similar time-travel film, with his Old Joe being a man tormented by the past and desperate to change it in order to affect the future.<br/><br/>It was also interesting seeing Emily Blunt in a role unique to her previous performances, this time as an independent farmer who is haunted by her past treatment of her young son. Here parallels can be drawn between her and Old Joe, both of the individuals being defined and motivated by the past.<br/><br/>As with any decent sci-fi films, there are multiple twists and turns in regards to the plot, and this enhances the audience's experience, with the film actually requiring its audience to think as opposed to sitting back and absorbing the action. The concept of time-travel assassinations is interesting enough, though other plot devices such as telekinesis and themes such as redemption are made present, once again enhancing the experience.<br/><br/>If I had one complaint, it would be the execution of the conclusion, rather than the conclusion of the plot itself, which I thought was excellent. I'm trying to not reveal too much here, but although the final twist or plot device is delivered brilliantly, the film finishes abruptly after.<br/><br/>Through its interesting cinematography techniques and equally thought-provoking concept and plot line, Looper reveals itself as a much welcome addition to the science fiction film genre. Rian Johnson's direction and script, coupled with brilliant performances from the three main leads places the film at the top of this year's sci-fi films, if not the top of this year's films in general.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I had high hopes for looper. Two great leads and from the trailer, a pretty cool (sort of) original plot to work with.<br/><br/>I walked out feeling reasonably satisfied with the movie. Were there plot holes? You bet. Time paradoxes? Many. Wasted opportunity? Definitely. Did it go probably 30 minutes longer than it need to? Oh yeah...<br/><br/>The point is... Taking all of this into consideration. I still enjoyed it. I liked the brutality in which younger Joe and the other loopers just did their job. I liked the plot involving the Rainmaker and even though it's predictable, it's still enjoyable.<br/><br/>I saw this with my brother and he didn't enjoy it so much. He kept on nit picking the paradoxes, how the plot generally did not make sense and how he believed each actor ""phoned in"" their performance. Personally I though they all did an OK job to help the plot move along.<br/><br/>I don't know.. I can't explain why I still enjoyed it. Maybe it was because the last movie I saw was the Expendables 2, and this was like the Shawshank Redemption in comparison. I'd say go and see it to make up your own mind, but don't go expecting a flawless depiction of time travel. Just go in, switch your brain off and enjoy what the movie has to offer."

Turns out unfortunately that Back the future is a bunch of crap though(#sarcasm).<br/><br/>Make no mistake, Looper is a pretty violent film with LOTS of F-bombs so it's not for kids. It is a fascinating film though that is absolutely crazy good. The performances by Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon Levitt are really good, and Rian Johnson is an excellent director/writer.<br/><br/>There's also a lot of cool surprises and plot devices in store that in similar circumstances in other movies might not work, but fortunately it somehow works in Looper!

I highly recommend it."

"andrewroy-04316","7","0","4","25 November 2019"," Original, exciting, and with a very neat ending, Looper blends Johnson's artistic craft with a tense sci-fi thriller
","Looper feels like Rian Johnson's magic trick: if you go hunting for them, you can definitely find flaws, but as you watch it you see exactly the brilliant vision Johnson had for the movie. The premise is phenomenal, blending future dystopia, crime thrills, and time travel in a neat and specific setting. Rather than making time travel ubiquitous or limiting it to just one person, we see how it applies to this specific risky group of crime employees. The vision of the future is very well done but also is presented naturally and not overemphasized. There's some really cool technology, like the nanotech making it hard to kill people, and the cool digital devices and telepathy, but also desolation and poverty. The movie really thrives as we get deeper into the premise, seeing how the life of a looper works and watching the plot of the crime organization unfold. Many moral questions are raised about self-preservation or sacrifice, as well as philosophical implications of time travel and these loops. The performances are great, but the characters feel more like representations of random pawns in this complex game than fully fleshed out humans. The ending is great and brings everything back together - the implications of the loop are clear, the decision of self-sacrifice for the hope that someone can be happy and break a cycle, and the ties that bind people are all laid bare in the climax. This is definitely one that will require deeper thought and could move in its rating, as I absolutely love the premise and direction of the movie, but also see that there may be some flaws in the characters and plot. I'm prone to strongly appreciating a bold, original high concept sci-fi project with great direction, but am not sure if that storytelling and intelligent development of the premise is all there needs to be. Certainly recommend it, and am absolutely stoked for Knives Out later this week."

One of the most interesting things about this story is that you cannot prognosticate what comes next.<br/><br/>The story was really fascinating and I just don't understand why it had to end that way.

So the movie goes on with some pretty interesting storytelling until we meet the goat of this film, Cid. Cid is set up to be this very smart kid who can do a lot of stuff and will probably be the Rainmaker in the future. The first hint about Cid comes after Joe has sex with his mother, when she was playing with a lighter with relative ease revealing to us that she's a TK. The movie and it's concept ia great but it is undermined by Cid and he's one in a million TK powers.

"tabuno","9","0","4","17 January 2019"," One of the Best Time Travel Thriller Dramas
","30 September 2012. Its hard not to find similarities between this movie and Bruce Willis' previous time travel cult classic, 12 Monkeys (1995) or even if one thinks of The Terminator (1984). There's really no fascinating character like Brad Pitt's Jeffery Goines as in 12 Monkey's, so that acting even though its solid isn't so much the focus as the direction by Rian Johnson who presents the audience with both a cerebral, action, family drama fusion genre. The director goes out of his way to use extended shots with scenes that seem to go on for minutes in order to impregnate them with emotional resonance. And the futuristic set design while perhaps a little heavy handed in the beginning and not too original at first, quickly transforms into its own future vision that nicely captures a vibrant yet understated backdrop to the rest of the movie. And then there is the not so quite brashness of a low self-esteemed looper hotshot who seems to had an obsession to prove himself, that isn't quit in sync with the rest of the movie and perhaps the most unnecessarily used and weakest character.<br/><br/>What makes this time travel movie stand out is the intense emotional connections that both the older Joe (played by Bruce Willis) experiences in the future and the younger Joe (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) experiences in this movie and the difficult universal themes that each character must face. This is not a two-dimensional movie and the director seems to go to great lengths to establish a backstory and character with conflicting feelings (even the brash looper hotshot). There are emotional elements of The Butterfly Effect (2004) along with even the haunting emotional twist as in The Time Machine (1960) or The Final Countdown (1980) as well as a more graphic action elements than Time After Time (1979) or Time Cop (1994). In some ways, the ending has the same emotional impact as Idaho Transfer (1973) starring Peter Fonda.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is an elevated layered sci fi movie with a conscience that portrays universal themes that offer no real clear cut answers between personal dreams and personal sacrifice, something each of us must discover our own answers in our own way."

","Riian Johnson's Looper is 2012's most original sci-fi film that boasts strong performances, old-school action, a distinctive style and a compelling story. It's certainly refreshing to find a movie that subverts our expectation, especially in the realm of sci-fi, a genre that can so easily flounder. <br/><br/>The year is 2079, time travel hasn't yet been invented but in the near future it will be, becoming highly illegal and only used by the mob, who send men from the future to be killed in the past by Loopers. In order for the mob to receive no loose ends, Loopers are tasked with eliminating their future selves, without question. This is where we are presented with Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Joe, who fails to kill Bruce Willis, Joe from the future. Time-travel is put to the side to present a character piece between the dualities of this personage. Instead of lamenting on the intricacies on the frustrating concept of time-travel, Riian Johnson offers a brilliant script serving as both a Neo-noir and a classic western narrative, hiding behind the mask of sci-fi. Both Willis and Gordon-Levitt bring fantastic performances, especially on Gordon-Levitt's part, who so uncannily impersonates Willis that the prosthetic nose was ridiculously unnecessary. They are supported by an equally fantastic Emily Blunt, portraying both the strong and vulnerable side of a mother not in control of her son (that kid is going places) and a scene-stealing Jeff Daniels. <br/><br/>Riian Johnson has crafted a wildly creative, utterly original and bold film with Looper, despite a few shortcomings with the time-travel concept, establishing himself as a director to be sought after. Oh, that's right, Star Wars!"

","I still vividly remember watching the beginning of the first Star Wars movie as the introductory words scrolled up the screen. And then, as the underbelly of the spaceship came into view, a chill went up my spine. I was mesmerized by the details as the ship grew bigger and bigger until it's form filled the entire screen. Then the story kicked in and I was hooked forever on the ongoing battle between good and evil and the wonderful cast of characters engaged in the Force.<br/><br/>That was more than 40 years ago and here we are today watching number 8 in the nine-part Star Wars trilogy of trilogies. The characters have aged, just as I have, and there is at least one new generation, just as I have one or two children, and a step-granddaughter. But the story is still the same and the movie still delivers the same wonderful combination of fear and hope that our uncertain future will turn out OK because people will, eventually, gain the courage to use the Force for good instead of evil.<br/><br/>Of course, my generation is dying off now. Carrie Fisher, who never really had any other roles than that of Princess Leia, died shortly after filming for this movie ended - it was her last performance. And Mark Hamill, as Luke Skywalker, has also aged, returning in this and the previous movie, The Force Awakens, as a wise and much more powerful Jedi, but one who isn't all that happy about having to awaken from decades of isolation. His role in Last Jedi is, of course, critical and helps give continuity to the whole enterprise. <br/><br/>But let's face it, neither Hamill nor Fisher qualify as outstanding actors. They were cast in the originals as unknowns and they readily adapted to their newfound roles. They became famous, and probably rich, because of those early movies, but neither of them went on to any other great performances and neither of them ever received any Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>The same fate probably lies for the next generation of Star Wars heroes, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Adam Driver, who all give fine performances as the current heroes and villains. Ridley's role as Rey is a welcome contrast to Princess Leia, showing that gender differences, even in action and science fiction films, is changing in favor of greater equality. All three of these characters were in the last episode, The Force Awakens released in 2015, but since that time, each of them have managed to appear in only one other major film and, like Hamill and Fisher, none of them have yet been nominated for an Oscar. That they are young is, of course, one of the reasons, but the Academy has nominated younger people, and there are plenty of nominees who are around their age and moving up the Hollywood ladder quickly.<br/><br/>So one conclusion is that Star Wars actors just aren't great actors, and there may be some truth to that. But I also think that there is an inherent, and perhaps necessary bias against movies in the science fiction or fantasy genre. This bias arises because of the increased difficulty of 'suspending disbelief'. It is relatively easy to imagine what the world was like in Europe of the 1960s, the setting for All the Money in the World. But it is another several degrees of difficulty to imagine what a world is like 'a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away'. 
And so, several things happen when we watch one of these movies. We pay much more attention to what our senses (primarily sight and sound) are telling us because we need to pay attention to all the details we can in order to build our understanding of this new world. That means, also, I think, that we tend to appreciate simpler story lines and more obvious characters. There isn't room for really complex characters with difficult emotional sequences because we aren't even sure what our own emotional reactions are to worlds that are so new and different.<br/><br/>Star Wars movies succeed, I think, because the concepts are so simple and basic - they truly are about the fight between good and evil at a very basic level. The moral clarity is strikingly obvious and is part of what makes these movies so much fun. The acting, directing, and writing aren't Oscar-level performances, because they don't have to be in order to give us a good time (and sell tickets!).<br/><br/>The writing and directing story on this movie illustrates what I mean. The Star Wars saga was started, 40 years ago, by George Lucas, and he retained a strong interest in the story line through the first trilogy and into the prequel trilogy. So he had a pretty firm idea of what the story line would be over the time and space of nine movies (a trilogy of trilogies). However, as happens to many huge and ambitious projects, he eventually lost control and when the franchise was sold to Disney, they basically granted full creativity rights to each new production team.<br/><br/>With this iteration in the cycle, number eight, they gave full creative control to Rian Johnson, who as writer and director was able to determine the direction of the movie. It is said that he wasn't even required to consult the writer and director of the previous film in order to see what his vision of the story line was supposed to be - he had full control and he took it.<br/><br/>So what is Johnson's history? Well, not much! He has never been nominated for an Oscar and his filmography, as writer and director, points to only one major film, Looper from 2012. He is also noted for Brick and Brothers Bloom, neither of which have I ever heard of. Looper is an interesting movie, but is of the sci-fi genre and received only modest recognition among the sci-fi award circuit. This is not to say that Johnson is a bad writer or director, but it does show that he isn't mainstream, so his creative direction is not going to give this movie an edge in the awards circuit. (He also brought the cinematographer and film editor from Looper to work on this movie.)<br/><br/>In the end, then, these kinds of movies are rewarded for how they please the senses. And this Star Wars was nominated in four categories, all 'below the line'. those categories all had to do with what we see and hear and how those characteristics contribute to our understanding of how the Star Wars world works; how the reality is created. And in that area, the movie has some outstanding credentials.<br/><br/>The Visual Effects team is noted for work on dozens of important science fiction and fantasy movies. Members of the team received Oscar nominations for previous Star Wars Movies as well as the Dark Knight, and they won Visual Effects Oscars for Golden Compass, Babe, and Inception. These people know how to create stunning visual worlds and make convincing representations of how they operate.<br/><br/>The Sound Department includes artists who received Oscar nominations for either Sound Editing or Sound Mixing that include previous Star Wars movies, as well as Wall-E, There Will be Blood, Benjamin Button, Social Network, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Fight Club, King Kong, the Hobbit trilogies, Pirates of the Caribbean series, Never Cry Wolf, Skyfall, and War Horse. They won Oscars in one or both of these categories for The Lord of The Rings movies, Bourne Ultimatum, and the English Patient. In short, this team knows how to create the sounds that help define the alternative universe as real and plausible.<br/><br/>Finally, the soundtrack for a movie goes a long way to helping us define our emotional reaction. Music can help build tension, or it can soothe our soul - it can send us deep into fear, or give us hope. And who did they get to do the original music for this movie, than John Williams, who has provided the soundtracks for most, if not all of the Star Wars movies, including creating the original theme for the music of the first one. Williams is possibly the most awarded artist in the entire film industry with more than fifty nominations for original music spanning a time period of more than 50 years! (His first nomination was for Valley of the Dolls, in 1967.). He has won the Oscar for original music for the first Star Wars movie, as well as Schindler's List, E.T., Jaws, and Fiddler on the Roof. This man knows how to compose movie music.<br/><br/>Despite these four nominations in the important technical art categories, The Last Jedi failed to win a single award. To Star Wars fans, however, I'm not sure that matters a whole lot - I know it doesn't for me. If the primary purpose of a movie is to be a fun experience, then The Last Jedi wins for sure."

It addresses some of the paradoxes of time travel, but ignores others. In the near future, time travel is possible and outlawed. As the old saying goes, ""If time travel is outlawed, then only outlaws will time travel."" Weirdly the outlaws use time travel to dispose of bodies. People are transported to the past where they are shot/killed/ and disposed of by people called Loopers who are well paid in silver.<br/><br/>Something happens to the system as Loopers are rounded up and sent back to be killed by their younger selves.

"grottmannen67","8","0","1","6 February 2018"," Two movies in one - Looper Review
","Looper is a movie about time travel, hitmen, telekinetic powers and a farm...<br/><br/>Anyway<br/><br/>The movie starts out explaining it's concept in a very exciting and really smart way. In the year of 2074, criminals and mobs uses time travel to send back there targets thirty years in time. Hitmen, or so called Loopers, then kills the guy sent back in time and gets paid. 
Our main hero(ish) Joe, played excellently by Joseph Gordon Levitt, is a looper with high hopes of life. A man who studies french and has dreams of one day going to France. 
This all changes when Joe himself get sent back from the future... to get killed by himself...
This is called closing the loop, in which the mob in the future send back the hitman himself so that he can end his own life, in the future. He get's a big fat reward and can go on about his ways. 
I won't spoil anything but, things aren't exactly that easy for Joe. <br/><br/>From a movie perspective this is a great one. The premiss is fantastic and the acting is great, all around the board. The crown is taken by Pierce Gagnon tough, a child actor who really kills it. <br/><br/>The movie starts out with fast paced editing and some great shots of a futuristic society in which we get thrown into. The dialogue is funny, riveting and very smart written by the o-so great Rian Johnsson. <br/><br/>But. The movie lacks in one key element. Pace. 
The pace in the movie completely drops towards the middle of the second act and the movie changes it's story fundamentally. It feels like your'e watching a different movie. Not a bad one, but not a fantastic one either. 
This is kind of a shame, because the first half is so good, and sets off so many exciting ways to move the story forwards. Rian choose to write his story this way and he went for it. <br/><br/>All and all this is a great movie wheigehed down a bit by its second to third act, but still manages to finish quite strong. 
I would recommend this movie to everyone. See it. Just don't have to much expectations over what it's gonna be. Otherwise, you might get kind of disappointed. <br/><br/>TOTAL SCORE:<br/><br/>8**/10 <br/><br/>*= MEANS HOW MUCH POTENTIAL THE MOVIE HAD, HOW HIGH IT COULD HAVE BEEN RATED."

"SimonJack","2","0","2","20 July 2017"," Another mindless time travel film, with more gore
","The first movie about time travel was a 1921 silent film of Mark Twain's 1889 novel, ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court."" But it was H.G. Wells' 1895 novel, ""The Time Machine,"" that brought the idea of time travel to the fore. Interest in time travel movies has ebbed and flowed over the decades since 1921. The BBC's series, ""Dr. Who"" first appeared in 1963 and ran for 26 seasons through 1989. It has since been revived. A series of three American films, ""Back to the Future,"" were blockbusters in 1985, 1989 and 1990. Numerous individual films about time travel have been made over the years. <br/><br/>But, just as the series and serials have had declining interest and reviews, so have the Hollywood folks run out of ideas for different and interesting plots. The most recent bent seems to be a mix of psychological thrillers with time travel. A spread-out series of three films introduced this sub-genre with ""The Terminator"" in 1984, 1991 and 2003. These lack much imagination or plot. It's a simple story of someone from the future going back in time to eliminate someone else. With so little substance in the plot, these are mostly huge chase films filled with violence, killing, destruction and other ""action."" <br/><br/>I give all this prelude to ""Looper,"" because it fits exactly in this mold. It's just a more recent issue of these psycho-sci-fi films with little substance. The writers tried to come up with something different, at the end. But that couldn't save this film. So long as Hollywood has a market for these mindless products, it will probably keep churning them out. And, if all the actors want is huge paychecks, they're probably satisfied. Too bad there are so few films made today in which people can use their acting skills. Or that challenge viewers with good mysteries, clever comedy dialog, or human interest dramas.<br/><br/>As for these fast and furious flicks of nonsense, it doesn't make much difference who the actors are. Just about any kid of 10 years or younger today could act any of these parts. They have daily overdoses of the stuff on their social media electronics and game pods. <br/><br/>Man's interest in flight dates back centuries and eventually led to aviation and air travel. It's anyone's guess who might first have thought about or proposed time travel. But, it will be an endless wait for anyone to be able to invent a machine that can transport a person back in time. When one thinks about it, the prospect is quite absurd. Someone could build a machine the size of a car or van that by it's whirring at supersonic speeds would have the power to pull the entire universe back in time? Or, put another way, to turn the clock back even a split second, let alone a few decades or centuries?<br/><br/>If planet earth lasts long enough, humans may one day travel to Mars or Venus, or to other solar systems. We may one day find ways in science that are unknown today to travel at speeds measured in light- years per year (about six trillion miles) or faster. But there's no direction to go backwards in time. <br/><br/>If you're a cinephile who likes good acting and movies of substance, I recommend that you skip ""Looper."" I was drawn to it by the build-up and Bruce Willis in a lead role. Since it was in the cheap bin at the store, I thought I'd try it. After a couple of duds like this, I've learned to check prospective movie buys more closely. I can wait until I've vetted a film on IMDb and read some of the reviews and outlines before jumping at good deals."

I don't think it would make sense even when watched while on drugs (don't).

","Looper seemed to be a perfect metaphor for cycles and loops in the lives of many characters, and does so in such a way that's only possible in a film with this type of time travel. Character development is unique and makes you suspend some disbelief with the logic, and instead slowly understand who one man is and who he is able to be. The movie is paced brilliantly. The beginning of the movie is the only part where the exposition is told so blatantly, but for a movie this complicated, that's okay. The movie isn't about the future it presents. It's about a man who must close the loop with his future self. Definitely a new favorite."

This feels very original, is packed with fantastic action and complex themes, and challenges the viewer in many ways.

"Screen_Blitz","8","0","1","2 November 2016"," Looper is very intelligent, superbly original, and boasts a thoughtful portrayal on time travel
","Over the past several decades, time travel has proved to be a tough subgenre to tackle to the science-fiction realm. When putting elements of time travel into the mix, some directors to this day struggle to effectively formulate a a compelling narrative heft without turning their plots into unnecessarily convoluted messes through the use of time travel as a backdrop. That is certainly not to say there are some films that achieved this feat in the past like 'Terminator' for example. Rian Johnson on the other hand, offer a smart, thoughtful, and arguably one of the most original portrayals of time travel ever put to the screen; and it all comes together in a shiny execution in this neo-noir sci-fi thriller. The film is set in the distant future of 2044 when time travel has finally been manufactured, but also made illegal to where it can only be performed secretively. Joseph-Gordon Levitt plays Joe, an expert contract killer what people refer to as a ""Looper"" who spends his days executing criminals as they appear face-concealed in a field through the use of time travel by crime syndicates, and disposes of their bodies. Somewhere along the way, Joe comes face-to-face with an old man (played by Bruce Willis) from the future who happens to be an older version of him, and his on his way to pursue a mysterious figure known as the ""Rainmaker"" responsible for the death of his wife in the future. Hiding out an old farmhouse owned by a young woman named Sara (played by Emily Blunt), Joe must protect her telekinetic 5-year old Cid (played by Pierce Gagnon) from being killed by the older Joe who believes he is the future Rainmaker.<br/><br/>This neo-noir science-fiction piece could have easily another one of your average action-packed shoot-em-up a wide plethora of car chases and explosions (which could work if done with plenty of substance), but director Rian Johnson has something more captivating in mind and it all results in a highly indigenous execution of plot following a man vs. man conflict. Time travel plays a central role in the plot as it sprawls on the lead character's journey to confront an elderly version of himself who places him on a blood-stained timeline, and the plot unfolds in a complex and thoroughly unpredictable series of twists and turns as Joseph-Gordon Levitt's Joe fights for answers behind his older self's sinister motives including the explanation behind the telekinetic powers acquired by Emily Blunt's young son which never the plot never quite dives into firmly. But thankfully, the plot offers plenty of tension from the two main leads meeting face-to-face for the first time, to the occasional sudden shootout sequences, to the startling climax leads to a plot revelation, with the inconsistency in the pacing serving as a moderate frustration for some. Lastly, the cast manages to satisfy in the performance department with Joseph-Gordon Levitt and Bruce Willis both delivering a sincere portrayal as their characters clash, though the prosthetic nose used on Levitt to veer a passable resemblance of Willis can be somewhat distracting. Emily Blunt as the likable actress she is, also comes off committed and humane in her role along with Pierce Gagnon as her mysterious son.<br/><br/>Looper is an intelligent, thoughtful science-fiction thriller that breathes life into a superbly original idea with the hands of Rian Johnson working behind the camera. For many sci-fi fans looking for something original, this one doesn't just deliver it packs quite a punch. All in all, it is easily one of the most recent and profound examples of original ideas brought to life."

","10 years ago I would have rated this lower but look at the competition. A lot of people giving bad reviews did not watch it or can't even understand a basic plot. Very simple, if they panned the movie and didn't mention incest, I would exclude their review. Willis shoots the boy and Levitt gets a scar on his face. This for certain means only a few minutes earlier in the movie, Joe had sex with his own mom. I did subtract some points for this being a somewhat sloppy time-travel movie.

","This film did more right than it did wrong. It's not earth-shatteringly mind-blowing like some might say. But if you give the film a low rating because it's not a highly complex science-fiction masterpiece, you're being unfair to it in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you are willing to cut the movie a degree of slack it's ""plot holes"" (not really plot holes, just things that just don't quite make sense, like why wouldn't the mob just send their targets back 200 years so they don't have to worry about loopers?), the script gives you sufficient cause to be invested. It has just enough existential character play to be interesting without being too ambitious and ending up being just unduly confusing and intellectually tiring. The script knows what it can pull off, and attempts only that much, and it's fun.<br/><br/>One element I wasn't crazy about is the plot involving the little kid. In general, I'm not crazy about little kids in adult movies, especially little boys. The kid was alright as far as movie kids go, but I just feel like the Rainmaker origin story could have been handled differently.<br/><br/>I also would have liked to see a little more scene variety. The sort of washed-out color pallets due suit the script, but once the last act decides to take place almost entirely at the farm house, it gets a little too slow. We only catch glimpses of the ""future-future"" world, and whether that was a conscious decision or not, I would have liked to see a more expanded universe.<br/><br/>Overall though, I wish more Hollywood movies were like this.

But in doing so you would no longer exist from the time you left until the time you appear in the future. You would simply be a ""missing person""<br/><br/>But somehow to be able to go ""back"" in time is just pure gibberish nonsense and whimsical silliness, not good science fiction. And then somehow to be able to interact with a flesh and blood version of yourself at an earlier age when you do go back, only adds to ridiculousness of the scenario. You would NEVER EVER be able to interact with yourself in the same world, it would have to be in some alternate universe in which basically you never even existed in to begin with. <br/><br/>The acting was very good in Looper. The script however was all over the place. One minute trying to be intelligent and in the next moment just a pure action film.

The plot in this movie was fantastic it's just so smart and original and it made for a realistic world of the future as its not bloated it feels like a real world that could exist one day. Joseph Gorden Levitt is great here he's surprisingly convincing as a young Bruce Willis who also kills it in this movie. This is a time travel movie and there not always easy to get right as there are countless paradoxes and plot holes but not here the situation is very well realised and logical. The movie is for the most part very well paced which is remarkable considering that we have to get an entire history of Bruce Willis' character thought a series of flashbacks. The kid in this movie gives possible the best performance in the hole movie and maybe even the best one ever given by a child actor.

The setting is well done also.<br/><br/>The 2nd time around,my feelings of the film is the same as my first impression,I still love the film even though some people said it has so many plot holes, Cause really I care only in this film is the characters and how good they've executed the whole film.<br/><br/>If you're a sci-fi film fan you'll love this."

It's intelligent, well directed and well acted. <br/><br/>After having a brief look at the user ratings, it looks like the film divides opinion.

","Looper (2012): Dir: Rian Johnson / Cast: Joseph-Gordon Levitt, Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt, Paul Dano, Jeff Daniels: Strange yet compelling science fiction thriller about mending mistakes. The year is 2044 and Joseph-Gordon Levitt plays some sort of hit-man who, at a given time, arrives in a cane field where he shoots dead the bag head individual who appears from the future. The victims are criminals and the loopers are paid in silver bars. Central plot regards the appearance of Bruce Willis, who is Levitt's older self. The idea here is to gun Willis down and live the next thirty years. Both are on the run when the termination fails. Willis desires to terminate a boy called The Rainmaker who would figure into the future in a tragic way. Willis needs to avenge the death of his wife by killing this individual as a boy. Levitt is out to protect the boy whom he sympathizes with. Emily Blunt plays the boy's caretaker who runs a farm and is not afraid to draw a gun. Paul Dano plays Levitt's best friend, also a looper who fails to gun down his future self. This places a bounty on his head, which informs Levitt exactly how lethal his employers really are. Jeff Daniels also delivers an interesting cynical turn as Abe, the guy who seems to put out these bounties to begin with. Impressive work by director Rian Johnson who doesn't attempt to make sense of the time travel but it is a step forward in budget after making Brick and The Brothers Bloom. Well written and tense writing with great visual appeal that avoids all the miserable loop holes that so many other films of this type fall whole heartedly into. Score: 9 / 10"

","Looper is a sci-fi, time-traveling movie starring Joseph Gordon Levitt and Bruce Willis. For short, this is an awesome movie with superb performances and a very delicate- written script. For an time- traveling movie, it is hard to explain the script and not have flaws among the story; however, Looper accomplishes all of the issues turning it a cleverly- written movie. <br/><br/>Though in some scenes, Looper looks like an action film; however, it's not. Looper actually spends more time explaining the story thoroughly than having bunch of action sequences which can be unnecessary at times. To me, I prefer think more about the story, or even mind-bending, rather than watching a mindless popcorn flick. I'm not saying that Looper is not an action film, it has enough action scenes, but you can see that the director concentrates more on its story, which is a well-made choice. The ending scene is kind of a plot twist and I liked how it ended it. Not gonna spoil it. <br/><br/>The two lead actors are awesome in the movie. Joseph Gordon- Levitt playing a looper who deals with the bodies of criminals sent from the future, and Bruce Willis plays the older Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I love the interaction between the two lead actors and it's actually very interesting of how you dealing with yourself. In some times, Levitt and Willis actually look very alike. There is a kid who wasn't mentioned in the trailer and will appear in the third act. He is very talented and will be a rising star.<br/><br/>Looper is definitely worth watching, if you want to have a great time thinking about the story. With a clever and original story, and great performances, Looper stands out from other time-traveling movies."

"view_and_review","8","0","1","5 February 2015"," One of the Better Time Travel Movies
","Looper is one of the better time travel movies I've seen. I put Back to the Future at the top of that list and maybe Butterfly Effect then 12 Monkeys. Now, there are other movies with time travel in them although it's not the main focus. X-Men: Days of Future Past, Terminator and T2, for instance, are about time travel in a general sense but the movies aren't built upon the premise of time travel.<br/><br/>In the movie Looper time travel is illegal. The mob uses it to do hits. Send the guy back in time to a designated spot, have a guy kill him and dispose of the body. Very clean and no traces. The hit men, or loopers as they're called, get paid handsomely in silver for their hits. If they have to kill their future self, they get paid in gold and live out the rest of their days (up to the point they're sent back) how they like. That is called closing the loop.<br/><br/>I mention that part to bring forth the point that all time travel movies have inherent flaws that can't be avoided and this is no different. Even though the concept of time travel is an interesting one and has been toyed with for ages it opens up conundrums. You will quickly see the conundrum that is created in this movie when the older Joe (Bruce Willis) attempts to change the past. But even with that there is enough going on to get lost into without dwelling on the paradoxes of time travel.<br/><br/>The movie has some nice action and a terrific overall story. I like the casting because they really pulled this movie off. The characters are good enough to draw you in and make you concerned with the outcome. And you know that anything with Bruce Willis will involve a lot of shooting and high body counts. This movie is no different there but you may just like it."

","When you have an all star cast and a great trailer and you still buzz under the radar, it's worrying to some consumers.<br/><br/>I didn't expect Looper to be a massive cluster**** like it was.<br/><br/>The trailer looked interesting, the guns looked cool, the cast had J Gordon Levitt and Bruce Willis, the plot seemed nice, but once you watch this movie, you wonder what the hell just happened.<br/><br/>First things first, nothing went right with this movie except for maybe should'ves.<br/><br/>The movie is painstaking to watch, immature, nonsensical, stupid, lazy, boring, and just feels disconnected. Like, what you're watching has nothing to do with you. Not the kind of movie I want to watch. I want to be dragged into the atmosphere.<br/><br/>The plot is so convoluted that it leaves you out of the LOOP about twenty thousand times.<br/><br/>I'm done with this movie. There is nothing to like about this movie except for when it ends. And when it ends, it feels like somebody threw you in lava, dragged you out, and did everything to make you feel better than ever. Know why? You've just began your life after watching this garbage. Now you realize how better life is. And it might seem like I'm exaggerating, but I'm not kidding. This movie is awful.

","Looper 86<br/><br/>Rian Johnson did a great job of directing, catching every little detail and emotion to make this film great. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, one of my favorite actors is great in this movie, capturing the older Joe, Bruce Willis, and the makeup department did a great job. The story is great and original, from what I've seen, in every aspect. Although there are some plot holes from the time continuum concept, it is the way the story goes so I accept it. The originality of 'Looper' is by far the best aspect of it. It is fresh, new and exhilarating all at the same time. You are back in the spot where you are trying to figure out what is going on and piecing the events together. You have to process what happened and think about all that is going on to figure it out, and I enjoy doing that. Great praise and adoration for 'Looper.'"

","People said it would be a lot more confusing than the trailer made it seem, but I don't agree. I agree that it was a bit confusing at times, but no more than that. It was a bit confusing, at times, with the whole change in main character, thing. First we stick to Joe1,but when he grows old we changer over to see Joe2 in his young days. I tried to continuously say to myself, ""That's the first Joe.""<br/><br/>The make-up they did on Gordon-Levitt was amazing. I could recognize him on the poster right away, the first time I saw it, but after that, it was really easy to forget it was him. He looked completely different, with great Willis characteristics. I LOVE that they did that with make-up instead of using CGI.<br/><br/>It had almost everything! Police, helicopters, explosions, mafia hierarchy of sorts, good vs bad in one and same person. <br/><br/>(Possible spoiler) The boy was almost the best actor in the whole movie. Everything he felt, you felt. He could make all the emotions PERFECTLY! From small curious child who plays innocently with his toys, to dangerous angry TK freak, and back to apologetic, scared child, just loving his mother! <br/><br/>One of the best things was the ending. The ending of the movie came, almost too sudden for me. I was left with the feeling ""No, is it ending now?"" The little boy is still going to kill a lot of people in the future, what about his the main characters' Asian wife? I guess that is how you make a movie with an ending suited for a sequel. But the way they made the ending, amazing! Every single person in the audience sat with the deepest silence as the movie silently ended. We were all breath taken by the beautiful atmosphere, the way they filmed it in slow motion, the music with perfect match, and the story slowly faded out. It was great! <br/><br/>I have never seen anything from Rian Johnson, but I am already a fan! I can see that he has made 2 episodes from Breaking Bad, which is only positive, so I would strongly advise you to keep an eye on Johnson from now on!"

","Time Travel Dramas have one problem when it comes to movies...How to deal with the Logic of Temporal Interference while avoiding Paradox or getting lost in a recursive cause/effect argument.<br/><br/>This is not really a Sci-Fi Time Travel EFX movie: There's No scenes of Time Travel and people flying back and forth thru a temporal Hyperspace. There's No zinging special EFX Time machine with lights and glowing hoops.<br/><br/>Instead, this is a story about a small-minded, cold-hearted Thug who runs into his Older Self. The Time Travel technology is only a means for him to make money killing people. Except now he's supposed to Kill his future self.<br/><br/>What got me was the interplay between the Older Self (Willis) and the Younger self (Gordon Levit). Can the mean-spirited Thug do the only thing that needs to be done? Some reviewers have decried the lack of 'chemistry' between the two. I would counter that there isn't any chemistry, because there can't be any. Joe is NOT a complicated person. He's not a Deep person. He's Not a Likable person.<br/><br/>Joe is a Thug. He's not a Poet. He's Not a Lover. He's not an Intellectual caught in a bad circumstance. Joe is just a street punk killer.<br/><br/>But because of his choice, circumstances will present him with Judgement. Looper is about a fundamental question of Morality & Selfishness that MUST be Answered. And although Joe is just a punk killer...he's STILL a Human Being. And Human Beings who have souls inevitably have to Choose for The Better or for The Worse.<br/><br/>I found The Answer to this Question in the End was very moving.<br/><br/>And the Little Kid?

","Super smart, twisty and mind bending. Looper is probably the kind of movie you need to watch a couple of times to totally get all the brain exploding time travel elements. Unique sci-fi story though and action packed. I don't think I've ever seen gangsters represented quite like this before.<br/><br/>It takes place in 2074, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is 'Joe', a ""Looper"", a hired gun for the (future) mob who send their targets back for him to dispose of. When they decide its time to ""close the loop"" they send back an older version of himself (Bruce Willis) to kill, which puts them both on the run.<br/><br/>Unique idea with an ending that was not at all what I was expecting. There is also a significant story change in the second half with the introduction of Emily Blunt and her gifted son and I have to say that was when I stopped being quite so interested. <br/><br/>It was great to see Bruce Willis actually doing some acting here though, I've seen him in too many roles lately where he all he seems to do is show up.

","Honestly, the ending was what had the most impact for me. The build- up took too long and I felt that half the movie was spent by characters murmuring between each other. It didn't help that my friends were loud, but I couldn't hear the dialogue for quite a lot of the film — and the TV volume was at 100%. But the thing is even when I didn't hear what was said, I still understood what was going on, which goes to show that they had a lot of unnecessary dialogue that just slowed the pace of the movie down.<br/><br/>Another thing that I feel was unnecessary was the blood. The action scenes were pretty good but some were overkill (and unrealistic) with unnecessary blood spraying.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the story and plots were pretty cool. The acting as well was great, Pierce Gagnon gave me the chills. Joseph Gordon- Levitt was great as always, though it was a bit unnerving to see his face altered to look like a younger Bruce Willis. Willis' acting was pretty average, I wasn't very focused on him.<br/><br/>Overall the film was good but could have been much better if they cut a lot of the dialogue and maybe added some more futuristic gadgets and stuff.<br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"
"Tweekums","8","0","2","10 November 2014"," An enjoyable sci-fi thriller
","In the year 2044 Joe is a Looper that is an assassin sent from the future to kill victims from the future. The reason for loopers is it is hard to get away with murder in 2074 but nobody will miss somebody who is killed before they even exist! The victims are sent back tied and hooded; all Joe has to do is pull the trigger the moment they appear then collect his payment in silver. It isn't a difficult job but there is a catch; one day the payment will be in gold and that victim will be his older self. This doesn't bother the loopers too much; it means they can retire knowing that they will have another thirty years to enjoy their earnings. When Joe's older self arrives he isn't hooded and manages to escape; this is not good for Joe as his employers will harm him to get the older man. He learns there is a reason 'Old Joe' didn't accept his fate; he believes he can change the future and save his wife by killing the person responsible while he is still a child. If all that isn't confusing enough, as well as time travel, some of the population now have telekinetic powers.<br/><br/>Just thinking about time travel and the paradoxes it would cause inevitably leads to confusion but thankfully this film isn't too confusing if you can suspend your disbelief just accept that for the purposes of the film time travel is possible and follows the rules set out by the creator every time travel film seems to have slightly different rules! The biggest surprise of the film is the fact that the protagonist is not a good person; he is a killer who has no problem with his job, he isn't even bothered about killing his future self. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a solid job as Young Joe and Bruce Willis is equally good as his old Joe. Young Pierce Gagnon, who plays Old Joe's target manages to be surprisingly menacing for a child; a nice change from the usual precocious child character. There is plenty of action throughout the film and it is well handled and exciting. Overall a solid sci-fi thriller that fans of either genre can enjoy."
"bowmanblue","8","0","2","4 November 2014"," Wow - actually pretty good
","I've seen so many films now, half of them I manage to turn off around the half hour mark. Sometimes I think I've seen every different monster and every different car chase. Then something like Looper comes along and restores my faith in Hollywood.<br/><br/>It's about time travel. Therefore you can look up on the internet message boards threads about the major plot holes with the mechanics of time travel in general. They use words like 'paradox' and things like that. Basically, they're saying that the movie doesn't work scientifically. Well, if put to the test, it probably doesn't. But then nor does any time travel movie. So, if you can suspend your disbelief and like some slick sci-fi action, you should enjoy this.<br/><br/>In the future, they time travel. And those crafty futuristic criminals are only sending their 'hit' victims back in time to be executed and disposed of (by assassins called 'Loopers'). This prevents the future authorities from ever linking the future criminals to their murders. Clever, huh? Well, nearly. Because Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of those Loopers and his 'victim' sent back in time for him to neatly kill and dispose of, is only him! Or rather Bruce Willis, who is apparently what Joseph Gordon-Levitt will look like in about forty years time. But, Bruce Willis has no intention of just taking the traditional bullet to the head. He has his own agenda. And it involves escape and killing many people along the way. Why? You'll have to watch the film to find out.<br/><br/>It's well written. Special acting points to Joseph Gordon-Levitt for mimicking all of Bruce's little quirks and mannerisms in order to portray his younger incarnation. Plus full marks for finding a really dark and menacing kid who flits between sweet and psychotic (I think this is how young Anakin Skywalker should have been cast in Episode I, but never mind - too late now).<br/><br/>Basically, Looper is a lot of well-written, well-performed mind-bending time travelling fun. Yes, it may have some plot holes if you really want to dig deep enough, but there's so much good here, it well and truly overshadows the bad."
"jjalon95","8","0","2","13 October 2014"," overall great movie
","Writer and director Rian Johnson does a excellent  job creating a world where science fiction elements exist but are not as abnormal as something like Star Wars or Star Trek. Though the weapons, hover bikes, and telekinetic powers in this film do not actually exist, Looper gives the audience the impression that could actually one day exist in the future. Looper connects where other movies failed or missed the mark  because it gives the audience the feeling that the  world has been thought out very strategically. Also all of characters seem to effortlessly fit perfectly in the world that the director created. The protagonist is apart of a gang of killers and is hooked on a strange eye drop drug and very troubled because of the way he had to grow up in rough times. This makes him fit perfectly into the crime ruled place the world has become.  Looper successfully turns Joseph Gordon- Levitt into an acceptable young Bruce Willis with the power of make-up and special effects. Joseph Gordon-Levitt also does a very exceptional  job of not trying to become the person Bruce Willis is but instead depicting a character who may be a criminal but is also caring sensitive young gunman who might grow old and become the broken and hardened man Bruce Willis plays. A thirty year montage reveals to the audience how one young Joe transitions into becoming old Joe through a hard life on the run. Though older Joe finds love late in life, his past finally catches up with him just like he always knew it would when he send to the past to die. So when young Joe and  old Joe cross paths young Joe has to rush  through the hard life lessons and emotional maturing older Joe has taken thirty years to accomplish. Older Joe comes to the conclusion that  he can put an end to his problems by killing  the crime boss of the future, the rainmaker,  who is presently  a young boy living on the farm where young Joe is making his last stand against his gang who is out to murder him. However, the director Rian Johnson takes a very different  approach to the situation of endings all of your problems in the past before they ever get the chance to ruin your future. There is one surprise that all of the audience will probably see coming, but there has never been a good film made that was a hundred percent perfect. Very well thought out  science fiction can sometimes seem to be non- existent because of  too many complicated acts involving  physics that can bring the risk of creating a final project that is not worth viewing or being proud of. Sometimes films incorporate too many explosions or they tend to get lost in a plot that far more difficult to understand than it should be. It may be true that Looper is not the most perfect film ever made, but it pulls in every single element of the plot and storyline and ties everything together very nice and neat. From the moment that the movie comes on all the way to the ending credits Looper keeps the audiences attention without ever displaying a dull moment."

","In the year 2044, the world is in shambles. Poverty rates have skyrocketed, crime rate has increased, and around 10% of the population have a small genetic mutation that allows them to telekinetically move small objects. Thirty years into the future, time travel is invented and immediately outlawed. However, organized crime has taken advantage of this new technology as a way to easily get rid of bodies in secret, as it is essentially impossible to dispose a body in the future. As targets are sent back in time to what is present day and ""Loopers"" are given a specific time as to when the targets are to appear. The loopers kill the target who is tied up with a bag over his or her heads with a blunderbuss, take the silver bars attached on the victims back, and dispose of the body. When the looper is no longer needed, the mob ends their working relationship by sending back the loopers future self-back for them to kill, thus ""completing the loop."" The story follows Joe, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, a looper whose future self, played by Bruce Willis, manages to escape and causes turmoil trying to avenge the death of his wife. Future Joe attempts to find and kill the new mob boss, dubbed ""The Rainmaker"", who is currently a ten year old boy living nearby. The Rainmaker has been closing all loops still open and the future Joe is trying to stop him from ever becoming the mob boss in order to save his wife. Things easily get out of hand quickly, and Joe struggles to keep his future self from murdering a seemingly innocent child at the time. This thriller has amazing cinematography and special effects, an intriguing storyline, great acting, and will have you on the edge of your seat for the entire film, even holding back tears at the end.<br/><br/>Looper embeds the futuristic ideas of time-travel with all the elements of an action thriller and a drama all into one. The film is expertly written from where the film intertwines a love story and drama into an action packed sci-fi thriller. The movie is filled with a celebrated cast, whose acting brings the audience closer into the story as if they were one of the characters. Different from most action movies, Looper provokes the viewer to delve deeper into what makes humans decide to act the way they do and how their actions change what occurs in the future.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Rian Johnson, Looper features a complex yet alluring plot aided by the cinematography from Steve Yedlin. Although the storyline is difficult to follow at times, the screenplay brings up many questions that are left up to the viewer to be answered. Since the technology of time travel is still too complex, Johnson did an amazing job making sure that time travel followed its own rules and could be properly interpreted by the viewer and because every time someone is sent back into the past, it may affect those in the future, the characters never know if or how their actions would change the timelines in front of them. In Looper, Johnson creates a myriad of timelines that constantly change with each different action.Many different scenes in the movie makes the audience think as to why humans make the decisions they do. Since the basis of the movie has to do with time travel, Looper is effective in showing how the human species deal with these types of decisions. Yedlin worked with Johnson to make this concept more understandable, and draw the viewer into the story with many different camera moves and shots that makes the viewer feel as though they are in the movie, dealing with some of the same problems as the characters. <br/><br/>The characters cast in Looper comprised of a star studded cast featuring names including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt, and Jeff Daniels. The acting in Looper is what really contributed to the films positive reception. Since Bruce Willis was playing an older version of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Johnson was able to train both Willis and Gordon-Levitt to act with the same mannerisms and physical qualities one would have with their older self. The film was also effective in changing the looks of the older Joe whenever anything happened to the present Joe, as the timeline changes constantly. Although the ""Rainmaker "" was never shown as his future self, he was played in present day as a young 10 year old boy, played by Pierce Gagnon. Especially for an actor younger than ten years old, Gagnon did a terrific job in portraying the dark and twisted mind of the young ""Rainmaker."" Although the storyline may not end up the same as that of the older Joes timeline, the film will test the limits of your emotions and leave you begging for more.<br/><br/>This film brings the best of both an explosion filled action movie and a heart wrenching drama. Not only does the acting and cinematography of the film bring the viewer closer and more involved into the story line, but also the premise itself will leave the audience questioning how humanity decides what actions to take and how it affects his or her lives in the future. This film is a must watch and deserves to be rated a nine out of ten."

"tharnax","Null","0","1","24 August 2014"," Interesting yet lacking...
","'Looper' has all of the potential of an awesome sci-fi film: Time-travel and hit men mixed with a splash of gangster politics. The execution of this concept does suffer in some areas, most notably the make-up used to transform Joseph Gordon-Levitt into a young Bruce Willis (The make-up is extraordinarily bad in many shots ,especially in the lip area, many times appearing too red). The poor make-up detracts from Gordon-Levitt's otherwise great performance. 'Loopers' are hit men that execute mob enemies that have been brought back through time, thereby erasing their future existence completely. The time travel concept is used here in a very similar fashion as it was in 'Twelve Monkeys' (1995) which also starred Bruce Willis. Gordon- Levitt plays a young mob hit-man in the year 2044 who is assigned to kill his future self in order to ""close his loop"". The screenplay is original and exciting however, poor casting choices for many supporting characters brings it down to the level of a mediocre action flick. It's a shame that a great actor like Jeff Daniels is given very little to work with as a two-dimensional mob boss. The standout is Gordon-Levitt himself, he clearly worked hard to capture many of Bruce Willis' subtle idiosyncrasies and mannerisms. Writer-Director Rian Johnson shows promise in this major feature ,but clearly his best work is ahead of him. 'Looper' had the potential to be one of the great new sci-fi films, instead, it leaves you thinking of a dozen ways it could have turned out a heckuva lot better."
"Cjalln1","10","0","4","16 August 2014"," Novel ideas and strong themes delivered with precision; good solid sci-fi
","A strong, original plot, superb acting and heavy themes make this action/sci-fi movie an understated classic.<br/><br/>Interlinking motifs like the ticking clocks stitch the film together; the soundtrack is brooding and effective despite its minimalism. Camera shots and angles show little variation, but the clever script and darkened colour palette carry each scene smoothly and quickly. The parallels drawn between Joe and Cid are subtle, but clear on a second watch: the Older Joe's bloodied face, the stroke of hair at Joe's temple, the backstory of an angry child - isolated from his mother - doomed to cause havoc if his path isn't altered by kindness. This contributes powerfully to the idea of karma in the film, as a never- ending circle of events. There are a myriad of references and recurrences, like the arrogant Kid Blue's perpetual injuries and anger within each of the cycles of Joe's life. Joseph Gordon-Levitt seems to represent the arrogance of youth; the cafe scene belays the way he thinks of his life as his own to live as he chooses - despite the evidence of his future self in front of him. Bruce Willis embodies a weary older self, shaken by the death of a woman who cared for him so deeply and driven to change the past in order to save her.<br/><br/>The violence is bloody, but minimal and necessary (disregarding Bruce Willis' final killing spree to tie up the loose plot ends of the Gat Men gang). Excellent performances all round, specifically Emily Blunt (grounded but emotional as Sara), Bruce Willis (a hardened, yet surprisingly tender Older Joe) and Pierce Gagnon (otherworldly and ominous as the mature-beyond-his-years Cid), give the film a depth beyond its action-blockbuster advertising."

","There are any number of reasons time travel stories can make your head hurt. This film had a Young Joe, an Old Joe and a Dead Joe. Dead Joe was the narrator. See what I mean? <br/><br/>Well I liked the concept of this picture, but to say that there were numerous inconsistencies in the execution would be an understatement. For example, when Abe's (Jeff Daniels) gat men eventually found and finished off Seth (Paul Dano), his on the run future self began losing body parts and became disfigured. But when Young Joe killed himself at the end, Future Joe disappeared. Why the two different treatments for what should have been the same outcome? <br/><br/>I guess you shouldn't force yourself to think about these things too much. If you just accept the flow of the story as it occurs, then it's a fairly entertaining sci-fi/action thriller. Still, if you think there ought to be some credibility built into the premise for a time travel flick, you'll only wind up discombobulated here. Like why would anyone agree to become a looper if your life span in retirement was guaranteed to max out at thirty years?<br/><br/>Here's an interesting thing though. The first time I saw this movie was shortly after I caught an Encore presentation of a film titled ""Kid Blue"". I tried to figure out if there was any connection to the character in this film, portrayed by Noah Segen, with Dennis Hopper's portrayal in the 1973 Western. The only thing I could come up with was that Dennis Hopper was an outlaw too, but as you might expect, in the future they had bigger guns."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","0","1","15 June 2014"," 'Looper' loops up and down making it spectacular and disappointing.
","One of the main problems when rating a film is if the film contains a mixture of good and bad content. Filmmaker Rian Johnson creates an interesting action film starring rising star Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Joe. Joe is a Looper. A Looper is an assassin who eliminate people from the future. How it works is criminals get the need to put a hit on someone and send them into the past to meet assassins called Looper's to do the dirty work. ""Looper"" is set in 2074 that has an amazing setting. It has awesome transportation, beautiful women, unique guns, time travel and people who all live well. Joe is surprised one day when the mob wants to put a hit on him when he meets his future self (Bruce Willis) that he is hired to kill on the scene of his job. The mob basically wants to eliminate him from the future. ""Looper"" contains a really unique and original story that has good scenes of action. In some scenes the action gets really silly and weird and just doesn't work. The first 30 minutes are amazing, however the middle of the film is really odd and doesn't go in the right direction. Rian Johnson chooses Joe to head to a farm to hide from the mob, where he meets Sara (Emily Blunt) and her kid. Not a single actor besides Joseph Gordon-Levitt give good performances which causes the film to loose its drama. The main problem with 'Looper' is that it is a prime example of a film with wasted talent. It could have been amazing, and proves that it has some strong content, but doesn't do anything else strong. It loops around in a zig- zag in terms of how good it is, but overall is decent."
"cabbit75","10","0","4","14 April 2014"," Spoiler Alert- Looper Sequel Storyline and Looper story reasoning
","I think this movie is brilliant. It has more depth I think than people are giving it credit for. Yes it has a lot of unexplained plot holes but I think this is setup for future sequels. The story isn't just about Joe the looper.<br/><br/>(Spoiler Alert) It's really bridging off to Rainmaker who will grow up and kill the looper's because of the danger he experienced with Joe's future self hunting him down.<br/><br/>But also since Sara slept with Joe I think she's pregnant and will conceive another child which will be Rainmaker's brother and it will end with Joe junior's (Joe's unborn kid) killing Rainmaker (Cid). Just because his mother was spared doesn't change the fact the character was potentially dangerous and was influenced to be evil cause he lost his mother doesn't mean he will change and doesn't guarantee Sara will still not be killed since she was suppose to die.<br/><br/>So Cid will grow up becoming so strong beyond his control but with Joe's Kid also with the same gifts be the only one to stop him. Kind of like a Kain and Abel story but with a different ending twist.<br/><br/>So what's with the looper's having to do with Rainmaker you ask? Well what if the organization sees rainmaker as a threat and sends someone back to try and kill rainmaker? That would make them a threat and a reason to kill them all and stop time travel. But his one weakness is he won't be able to kill his brother who was born from a looper which closes the rainmaker story and gives life back to the looper storyline giving it open ended for other stories to be made for it.<br/><br/>This is just my input on what I would do for the story. Doesn't mean this is what has or will happen. But I think written correctly it will justify making a suspenseful and tragic storyline to continue it's edgy style. Maybe even not giving Joe's Kid powers can work as well. The connection is he figures out who his father was and finds out Young Joe's decision didn't work out as expected and needs to be resolved by stopping rainmaker."

","Looper is quite a unique film. The concept of time travel that is used is one that really requires a lot of thinking. This amount of thinking that is required can be a little distracting from the rest of the film at times. During my initial viewing of the film, I found myself struggling to piece the information together that was shown. The acting in the film is excellent, and the characters were very unique and engaging. The whole time travel paradox is a bit unsettling though. Overall, Looper is a solid film.

","Looper is one of the best original sci-fi films I have seen in years. It's a complicated film because it will bend your mind and is very conceptual. In short, you may have to use your brain here. This film has time travel as it's main point, but I like how the film makes new use of it. Over the course of the film, the plot may get complicated but wen all is said and done, everything gets straightened out.<br/><br/>Rian Johnson's film takes place in the near future when time travel has been invented. In the year 2074, going through time has been banned except by the most ruthless criminal organizations. In 2044, there are people like Joe called ""loopers"" who are tasked with executing people from the future. But when Joe's future self gets sent back for extermination, things may get a little hairy.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are very good as older and younger Joe. I thought Levitt does a good job impersonating the mannerisms of Willis and perhaps the use of prosthetics worked. Emily Blunt also manages to do well and adds emotion to her character.<br/><br/>Overall, a high-concept movie, but a very good one at that. It has a tough screenplay but it is very smart and engaging. There is no shortage of action and this will keep you on your feet expecting more things to happen. I also liked the concept of telekinesis and it made the film a bit more interesting. A very solid sci-fi film. I rate this film 9/10."

"schreiber-stephen","9","0","4","6 February 2014"," Is that the same pocket watch from Pulp Fiction?
","Attempting to pick apart this film for inconsistencies or things that do not make sense is a horrible idea. I have seen quite a bit of criticism of this film and it doesn't seem to make much sense why anyone would want to tackle any of these issues. Looper is a film that almost cannot be criticized for a number of the problems with the plot ""holes"" because of the time travel paradox created by just about every situation Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and old Joe (Bruce Willis) find themselves involved in as well as the slew of other characters also affecting timelines.<br/><br/>I think Looper is a movie that can be debated endlessly by just about anyone. When a loop isn't closed, it creates many different timelines as shown by the fact that Rian Johnson decided to put the video at the end of the film as to say ""this thing isn't over and will never be over."" Unfortunately, I have to mark this review as having spoilers because I have no way of being able to talk about it without giving something away.<br/><br/>I thought it was a neat idea to make Joseph Gordon-Levitt look like Bruce Willis but for the first part of the film I kept trying to figure out if the main character was Joseph Gordon-Levitt or not. It was wildly distracting. Aside from that, I thought it was a good attempt at making the two characters look alike.<br/><br/>I won't say too much more about the film because there are an awful lot of events that have consequences in time that end up being a bit strange and cannot be criticized too much because we don't even know what would happen in that version of a reality. I will say, however, that Rian Johnson did a great job in selecting and framing shots because so many shots looked excellent. A lot of the film had that gritty look that can be found in Brick. I think Johnson will be around for a while making movies that look just like this. I love this style of film making."
"PopCulturedwithMovieMike","9","0","4","29 January 2014"," A twisty sci-fi classic.
","After enjoying Rian Johnson's first film Brick a few years back, I was inspired to check what films he was working on. I noticed Looper in his bio and upon reading what it was about, I was instantly hooked and couldn't wait to see it. <br/><br/>I looked at the film as a sort of great hope for Hollywood. An R rated Sci-fi film that was wholly original. If it could succeed at the box office, then there was hope that Hollywood would start to green light other films that don't just have numbers in their titles. It's safe to say that Looper might very well live up to my expectations. <br/><br/>Looper takes place in the year 2044 where Joe, played by Joseph Gordon- Levitt, works as a Looper. His job is to dispose of bodies that are sent back in time from the year 2072. The job seems to be a piece of cake until his future self is sent back. Joe's reluctance to kill his older self sets up a chain of events that will change the future forever. <br/><br/>In Brick, Johnson puts a noir twist on high school. He administers the same treatment to Looper, which feels like a Sci-fi noir film set in the not too distant future. <br/><br/>Unlike many Sci-fi films from the 70's, Looper envisions a future society not unlike the world we live in today. Whereas many of the old Sci-fi films don't hold up today, Looper should stand the test of time 30 years from now. The future is not portrayed as a new and shiny metropolis filled with flying cars or slick gadgets. <br/><br/>Instead, it's a more bleak and mundane version of our world today. The cars are the same except they've been outfitted with solar panels and the gap between the haves and the have nots is even wider than it is today. <br/><br/>Looper is a tight, slick film that knows it's cool. Time travel films can sometimes collapse upon itself, but Looper never feels confusing. The rules are laid out to us and the film sticks to them. Looper never tries to bog the viewer down with the ins and outs of time travel, instead it forces you to invest in the characters. <br/><br/>This is where the film really succeeds. Joseph Gordon-Levitt continues to turn in great performances and solidifies himself as a legitimate box office draw. JGL also has many of Willis' mannerisms and looks down pat. The slight crack of a smile, the furrowed brow gives the illusion that we are watching a young Willis with hair. Bruce Willis returns to form and actually seems like he's invested in the film. Jeff Daniels steals every scene he's in as a mobster sent from the future to run the Looper organization. <br/><br/>Unlike most Hollywood films, Looper's characters aren't portrayed as black and white. Many of them, including Willis and JGL, are operating in shades of grey. We aren't totally sure we agree with the older Joe, but we can understand his actions. We can't help but applaud, but at the same time, scratch our heads at the younger Joe, who so dedicated to his profession that he is determined to finish the job and dispose of his future self. <br/><br/>The last act of the film slows down a bit and introduces new important characters. This is where some viewers may be turned off and could get confused. In the end, the threads tie together and the pay off is worth it. <br/><br/>The other problem with Looper is the same thing that plagues all time travel films and that is the inevitable loop holes. I've thought about Looper a lot since I watched it and I have indeed found a lot of loop holes and paradoxes. In the end, Looper doesn't want you to get caught up in time travel and diverging timelines, it's more concerned about making the viewer think about what it means to make the right decisions in life that will determine the future. A future where you can live with the decisions you've made or be destined to relive them in an endless loop."

While Willis' film-star mannerisms are too well-known for him too convincingly take on another's, JG-L is younger, and more than willing to subsume his own personality, in the service of the narrative. If there is any doubt of this logic, there is one trump-card: in this film, it works.<br/><br/>Some have criticized the ending, claiming it makes a wrenching shift to a different type of film, but I think the change was set up well early on, as long as you make the effort to pay attention to the details.<br/><br/>Speaking of details, I saw this film on a plane, and I think I lost out a bit from the cramped visuals and tinny sound.

","Watch this movie before writing it off as good or bad. <br/><br/>That should be rule number one for any cinema-goer. No matter how much you like this or that critic, watching a movie to create your own opinion should always take priority.<br/><br/>With THAT out of the way, here's what I think of Looper.<br/><br/>The movie starts off grim and very gritty, with presenting a cold- hearted character played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. We're introduced to an interesting lifestyle of crime, sex, drugs and alcohol. Obviously, if you've seen this movie's guidelines, you'll know things eventually go belly-up for Joe, who winds up having to kill his own future self. Of course, the assassination goes awry, Old Joe beats present Joe to the ball and runs away. <br/><br/>The rest is a series of well filmed action sequences, flash backs, character development and theories on time travelling. In all actuality, one may claim to know what time travel is and how it works, but this is all very much speculative. If you watch Science-Fiction expecting accurate scientific statements, read a book. Looper avoids geek-talk about time travel and that sticks well to its characters. A mob boss would not sit down with one of his employees to theorize about how time travel works, nor would future Joe waste very precious time explaining, as he says, with little sticks how time travel is accomplished.<br/><br/>These people are on a short time line and actively hunted down for very vaguely definable crimes. I absolutely loved how the lines became blurry between present Joe and Old Joe. Adding in the mix an apocalyptic child, whose only hope to redemption is just controlling his temper, with a most interesting Emily Blunt as a ""mother""... You'll be kept up until the very end. <br/><br/>Now, in retrospect, my one main gripe with this movie is the completely overshadowed ""TKs"" plot point. It's an interesting twist, but aside from marking people as targets, it doesn't seem to do anyone ANY good! You'd be hard-pressed to find evidence about how humanity just suddenly popped a telekinetic code in its DNA. So all in all, it's just one extra trigger to keep the movie going. I'm not so sure I dislike it all that much. The alternative would have been to use the tired old cliché of ""Angry young kid who suffered from experiments and now wants vengeance"". <br/><br/>Conclusion! <br/><br/>Loopers: Not the movie of the century, definitely original, definitely worth a watch. Don't fall in the trap of trying to figure out time travel. Modern science hasn't found a way to make it work, neither will you. Just watch the movie, escape life for an hour or two and keep quiet."

It has some obvious flaws (some of them what-the-hell level), although it tries to make sense as much as possible (even when, compared to this movie, Back to the Future's time travel plot and physics seem to have been written by Stephen Hawkings).<br/><br/>If we ignore those little things, Looper becomes a very enjoyable movie, with a nice mix of scifi and supernatural (let's call the ""TK"" that). The future has been presented is an overall credible way, and it has things in it that deviate a bit from the norm, which makes the movie look a bit refreshing in that aspect. We'll also find more typical futuristic gadgets (like the flying bikes), which are a nice touch and give the film some sort of classic scifi feeling without making it look outdated.<br/><br/>Even though a couple of things throughout the film can be a bit predictable, I was positively surprised when more twists than expected showed up, and was glad to be wrong about certain predictions I had in my mind.<br/><br/>Alas, not a bad movie for both scifi fans and people who want to watch an average thriller."

","This is not a science fiction movie with futuristic cities, super-advanced technologies or anything of the sort. If you are looking for anything close to, say, Star Trek, than this is not your movie. It is 2044 and people are still the same people as we know them today, the only thing different is that 30 years into the future, we have figured out how to time-travel and about ten percent of the population has mutated genes that give them telekinetic powers, although I don't see much use in levitating a quarter. Therefore the sci-fi element is never emphasized and always on the background. It is a part of the film as it is a part of the people's lives. It is common and treated that way.<br/><br/>With keeping the science fiction to a minimum, writer and director Rian Johnson uses all the space to set up a great story. No cheesy love story, no 'whatever happens, everything will be okay in the end', because the not-so-happy ending is what gives this film such a unique and fresh touch. I heard people complaining about the lack of action and that it was just all a lot of people talking. Action is not what this film needs to succeed, I say it's better off without it, and the dialogues are clever and never boring. Johnson again brings Steve Yedlin on board for cinematography, something absolutely worth mentioning. It is fresh, it fits the story and never feels out of place. Yedlin shows he has a wonderful style and I am anxious for Johnson and Yedlin's next collaboration.<br/><br/>The film's characters are well written though not too complex, and wonderfully cast. Each have motives of their own that give the film a little bit of a dark feeling. The film's tone overall is a bit dark, again something that makes this all work so well and I can really appreciate in today's happy-ending trend. Amazing Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays present Joe, a Looper. His facial transformation is never in the way and it feels good to see him leading the story. He remains his own self but puts in some Bruce Willis elements at the same time to make the whole time-travel circle complete. Bruce Willis as future Joe normally lets his guns do the work, but with the action at a low level he can finally show his other set of acting skills. It feels a bit awkward at times though to see him play so emotional, as if he has forgotten how to do certain things. Nevertheless, he is able to convince his audience. Emily Blunt also delivers as mother of young boy Cid, played by Pierce Gagnon. She puts up a more memorable role than I'm used to seeing her do. Even Jeff Daniels, future mobster sent back in time to run the whole Looper-business, although with relatively little screen time, gives us his best performance. But this kid Pierce Gagnon.. Man, was I surprised by his performance. He just blows me away. He shows the best child-performance I have seen in a long, LONG time. He reminds me of a younger Kodi Smit-McPhee doing The Road and I have no doubt that he will end up in McPhee's footsteps.<br/><br/>Looper is a film full of surprises. It is unique, contained yet vast and fresh. See it, let it all sink and you will love it."

","Looper was one of my most anticipated movies when I first heard about it. Bruce Willis and Joseph-Gordon Levitt in a time travel movie where they're the same person? Sold! The story is about Joe (Joseph-Gordon Levitt), a looper (who is a hit-man for the mob who send undesirables back in time to get a bullet in the head) who one day has a target that is revealed to be an older version of him played by Bruce Willis. From there on (without going into spoilers)the story involves Telekinesis, romance, and time travel.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch with JGL's character Joe being a confident, yet somewhat cold to others that shows a more emotional side of him. Bruce Willis is also great as the older version of Joe showing the same charisma of younger Joe but with a more elder view on life. The supporting characters are also great, notably Paul Dano and Jeff Daniels.<br/><br/>The movie is paced very well and has a pretty good script with the dialogue having a somewhat noir feel to it which I love and the time travel aspects are pretty well thought out for the most part. The action is very stylized and sometimes really bloody and brutal but necessary as it takes a toll on the characters (figuratively and literally). However the movie does find some humor with interactions between Joe and older Joe and probably on of the best montages I have ever seen.<br/><br/>But with all time travel movies, the plot holes of time travel and it's rules get in the way and sometimes make a simple solution seem impossible. However this is a small thing and the movie is one of the greatest time travel movie made."

","For all of you nitpicking detractors of the time-travel flick Looper, listen to what director Rian Johnson has to say about it in the Blu-Ray audio commentary: ""No time travel in any movie ever makes sense. It's complete balderdash, and it's just a matter of tricking an audience into believing it makes sense."" Now let that sink in, and then continue reading this review.<br/><br/>Looper is set 60 years in the future, but most scenes happen only 30 years in the future - the future past, if you will. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Joe, a so-called looper, which means being a contract killer who dispatches people that are sent to him from a future mob. This job is abnormally lucrative and after only a few years in the business, Joe already has a huge stowage of silver pieces at home, and the only valid explanation for this is that in the future, inflation will have increased enormously. But you won't have much time to think about such odds and ends because the time-travelling requires a lot of attention. Especially once Joe encounters his older self on the mat his victims appear on. It is revealed via voice-over that this is a standard procedure and even has a professional term: closing the loop. Our weird protagonist doesn't have a problem with doing that and the only thing that stops him from doing so is that his older self is Bruce Willis who KOs him in a matter of seconds. Well, that first half-hour was awesome.<br/><br/>What then follows is Young Joe searching for Old Joe so he can kill him, while Old Joe searches for the man that is at fault for Old Joe being sent back in time and kill him. And I can gleefully give the all-clear that Looper doesn't turn into a stupid scavenger hunt from that point on. Crucially for that is the introduction of two new characters: Emily Blunt's southern mother of one, Sara, who makes her introduction by smoking a non-existent cigarette and shortly afterwards making the acquaintance of Young Joe on her lawn with a welcoming ""I'll cut you the - rhymes with duck - in half!"" and her son Cid. Tensions are soon reduced, and Young Joe stays with the two: on one hand to protect them from Old Joe who develops some hugely unpleasant intentions, and on the other hand because Emily Blunt is a MILF. <br/><br/>Writer/director Rian Johnson proves that you can create great movies even if your parents are dyslexic. His story is rational and plausible as long as you don't over-scrutinize it and/or browse the internet on rants about the logicality in the time-travel scenes and his directing is entertaining and a very good mixture of sci-fi, action, thriller, drama, and even comedy. And more importantly than anything else, he accomplished to get a really decent performance out of Bruce Willis!<br/><br/>Another big plus point for the movie is the sound, and with that I don't solely refer to Nathan Johnson's immensely fitting score. The balance between dialogues so low that you will have to strain your ears to understand them and boisterous action scenes that are prone to give you a minor heart attack is impressive even if you usually don't pay attention to sound in movies at all. While these two extremes may have you switch the TV volume up and down every minute and thus annoy you, you shouldn't overlook the fact that this is actually a pretty cool stylistic device. And not the only in the movie. The beautiful shots of coffee in Joe's favorite French diner or the inauspicious burning cigar in the scene in which Young Joe comes home after the first confrontation with his older self, for example. In general, the film is technically on a really high level and has great cinematography, editing, set design, and VFX.<br/><br/>With all my laudatory words for Looper, what is it then that prevents it from being a masterpiece? Sadly, all the flaws I found while watching it - two times, n.b. - occurred in the final 20 minutes. This last eighth really disappointed me and not even because of the controversial ending, which I actually loved, but because of some other things most critics don't seem to mention. The scenes I mean are - without spoiling anything! – an Expendables-esque shooting spree, the comical and illogical killing of a character shortly before the final showdown, two characters that aren't hurt at all when the fast driving car they're sitting abruptly somersaults, and one character that gets shot in the face and doesn't die. Things like that bother me and really took me out of the movie, however, the emotional and jaw-dropping final showdown makes up for that in my opinion, and leaves you on an affecting and thought-provoking note.<br/><br/>Résumé: Looper portrays time-travelling better than most movies and also includes some maybe unexpected emotional messages that make it more than just an entertaining sci-fi flick. Director Rian Johnson gives us just enough explanation to understand the time-travelling aspects and at some parts, re-thinking what happened later on is almost necessary. However, because of this, you don't get the feeling that information is being thrown at you to help you with comprehending. It has good acting even in little supporting roles, distances itself from typical Hollywood movies with sometimes long dialogue sequences but also several wordless shots, and has absolutely sightly visuals. It profits from the self- ironic approach of director Rian Johnson and its little flaws can be forgiven. Due to all of that, it becomes a movie that you are definitely going to remember and that you will do well in buying on DVD or Blu-Ray since watching it a second time and then fully grasping everything that's going on is just as much fun as the first time."
"Tehmeh","7","0","2","7 August 2013"," So much potential. So much.
","There will be some spoilers. I assume the reader already knows what the movie is about.<br/><br/>That one scene. In the diner, where present and future Joe are talking to each other. Great scene, and I felt the amazing potential right there. Older Joe who has changed his ways, mourning a love that changed his life. Younger Joe, not caring about anything. The importance and fragility of memories, and what it means in their situation. That alone would make an amazing story, and it is the best scene in the movie. Imagine the possibilities.<br/><br/>Instead, the older Joe suddenly loses his charm and ""warmth"", turns out to be an almost sociopathic asshole who really doesn't care about anything else than getting his woman back. This development is too sudden, weak and does not follow the themes so strongly present in the diner scene, and I have to blame the writing. At some point, they decided that meaningful themes have now been taken care of, so let's get to some crime lord/X-men stuff - all things I didn't care about AT ALL at that point, and not much more even later on. Big mistake. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad movie, but I weep for the lost potential. ""Looper"" sets itself up to be a little gem and then...hngh.<br/><br/>Younger Joe becomes the ""good guy"", not at all from his older self's influence, but just because. In the end, the ""memories can be altered""-thing doesn't apparently even matter (younger Joe loving Emily Blunt's character, realizing the situation they are in is screwed) because hey, there has to be a sacrifice so that viewers can get emotional and pretend to cry. It was cutting the corners short, and forced. So forced. I can even forgive some of the Phoenix-kid plot straight from the X-men universe. Mainly because the child actor is pretty good.<br/><br/>There's one significant thing about the characters. Both Joes, Emily Blunt's character, the kid...I didn't care about them. I thought both Joes were ultimately shallow and very, very unlikable. I didn't root for either one of them. Blunt was of course pretty and doesn't suck, but again suffers from bad character development and writing. There's some forced dialogue that tries to get you feel for her and deepen the character, but it's done in a very ""let's get this out of the way"" - manner. It is possible to do much with very little, but this is not the right attitude. Still, I had more sympathy for her than the main characters. Funny, right? No.<br/><br/>How about the ""bad guys""? They're treated the same way, maybe even worse. Charismatic Jeff Daniels along with Noah Segan are set up - much like this movie itself - pretty well. You get interested. Then, nothing. Writer/director Rian Johnson throws them out like garbage without any kind of payoff or satisfaction.<br/><br/>The deep, wonderful themes where real emotions, interest and curiosity lie are wasted and instead the movie gives us something much cheaper. Not terrible or awful, but cheap and unambitious. It's as if the writer/director Johnson took someone's half-finished story and then wrote the rest himself. <br/><br/>This isn't a bad movie, but it could've been very good. ""12 Monkeys"" - good if done right. It was on the right track for about 30 minutes. That's why I'm frustrated and right now it makes the bad things and shortcomings seem so unbearable, although in reality I've forgiven a lot worse things with other movies. <br/><br/>I probably won't watch this again any time soon. Nevertheless, ""Looper"" at least tries to be original and takes itself seriously enough to a point. In a time of remakes, movies like ""Grown ups"" and...whatever stinking pile of crap you might run into, that's something to like and for that I give it a 7 instead of 6."
"thefadingcam","7","0","3","25 July 2013"," Almost a cult classic, but ultimately forgetful
","Looper approaches the condition of a cult classic, but doesn't really get there. Technically it is perfect: it's sober, solid, with great camera work, beautiful pictures and amazing editing. It is humble, and doesn't try to impose you its quality, not forcing you to like it, and that is a great attitude. The plot is very well written and interesting, even if some plot-holes common to time-travel themed movies may appear. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a great job impersonating a young Bruce Willis. Even his face's expressions are equal. Bruce Willis himself is also great, as great as any script allows him to be. It really is everything you could ask for a quality thriller movie with a sci-fi touch. The thing is, in this genre, you could expect a more breathtaking and ambitious touch, which means, although being everything a good thriller needs to be, Looper is not an unforgettable movie, one that astonishes you and makes you wondering for a long time. It is forgettable, but undoubtedly amazingly well done."

"alecarranza","9","0","3","6 June 2013"," Looper movie review
","Alejandro Carranza ""Looper"" Will Captivate Your Mind<br/><br/>I have just seen the movie ""Looper"" by Rian Johnson, an American director, writer and editor, and I would like to make my opinion about this incredible piece of art. This movie was released in 2012 and has been a success since the begging. ""Looper"" can be seen as an action, cime, and sci-fi. It is filled with intrigue and violence and it will break your mind. If I had to rate this movie, I would give it a 9 out of 10 because it very well done and the topic of was very interesting. It is not a surprise that ""Looper"" won 8 awards and had 23 nominations. It can even be considered as the best movie of this decade. This movie can be compared with the movie ""Inception"" of Christopher Nolan because of its visual effects and futuristic ideas. This movie got a 7.4 in IMDb and 9.3 in rotten tomatoes. These scores demonstrate that this movie was very good for the public and for the critiques.<br/><br/>""Looper"" talks about time travel and how this was used by the mobs in 2074 to get rid of their enemies. They sent the person to the past to be killed because in the future, if you killed someone you would be caught easily. The assassins that killed the people in the past where called Loopers. One of them is Joe. He kills many people but one day he finds out that the company he works for wants to 'close the loop'. Closing the loop is when the company tells the looper that to kill someone and then he finds out that it is he in the future. Before shooting old Joe, he hesitates and understands that the man with the bag in his head is he in the future and decides not to kill him. The conflict of the story starts with this and then gets worse when the company he works for finds out that he didn't kill old Joe. They both then face the conflict and run from the assassins who are after them. Also, a conflict is created between old Joe and Joe that makes this task harder on them. <br/><br/>First of all I would like to comment about the actors performance in this movie. Joseph Gordon- Levitt who played as John, exited the expectations in this movie. He never seemed fake with his actions and was able to become the character completely. When seen this movie I was impressed with his performance and demonstrates a growth from its previous movies like ""Inception"" and ""The Dark Night Rises"". Bruce Willis, who played as Old Joe, did also an extraordinary job. It was impressive how these two actors matched perfectly and I could really feel that in thirty years Joseph would be Bruce. Bruce Willis also brought a lot of experience to this young cast and made the movie much better. Another good actress was Emily Blunt who as well as Brus and Joseph, worked incredibly and created a sense of reality in the movie. <br/><br/>One aspect that I could exalt about this movie was its special effects. One scene that stranded out to me was when Joe prepared the place where he would commit the executions. In here, there was an incredible effect when the person appeared from the future blindfolded with a bag in his head. Music also helped the scene to create suspense and makes it seam that time goes slower when this is happening. Also, another aspect that was very successful in this movie was the similarity that existed between Joe and Old Joe. Even though this two actors are different, the make up that was used created a sense that they where actually the same person in different years.<br/><br/>""Looper"" teach us a very important lesson in life. This is, that every action you have has a reaction. If you act properly, good things will happen while if you act recklessly and badly there will be negative consequences. We learn this because at the beginning of the movie, Joe tells the audience that the life of the loopers was filled with joy because they got very good payment for little amount of work. This short cut, will then lead to the assured death in the future when the company 'closes the loop' or kills the looper. This means that because he chose the easier and illegal way in life, he will end up having to pay the consequences. This lesson can be applied in the every day life because you should always choose the correct paths throw life and not the easier paths. Most times, the easier paths will create suffering in the future.<br/><br/>The writer of this critique is Alejandro Carranza he is a student in Lincoln School from Costa Rica. He is currently in ninth grade. He is doing this film critic of ""Inception"" because he saw the movie in the class of Film Appreciation of the professor Pablo Morales and was asked by him to choose one movie to criticize. Alejandro enjoys watching movies in his free time. His favorite sport is soccer and he has been playing this sport all his life."
"hptish","9","0","3","3 June 2013"," Awesome film
","Got to be as far as I am concerned at least, the most interesting and satisfying sci-fi film that I have seen in years. Okay, there are plot elements and devices that have been used many times before. Even just having Bruce Willis in the film reminded me somewhat of Twelve Monkeys given the time travel connections, but what really set this film apart from anything that has recently preceded it was that the narrative was strong, and the characters, particularly the younger and older versions of Joe were well drawn out characters with flaws, but just enough likability to keep us rooting for them. Johnson has delivered another really cool film to add to the list of really cool films that he has already made. I wonder, seriously if there is a more interesting and fresh director out there at the moment."

"raphaklopper","10","0","4","16 April 2013"," ""This time travel crap, just fries your brain like an egg"". Rian Johnson really make a point with this phrase!
","For how long did the world had a good science-fiction film? Well, Nolan's ""Inception"" is a masterpiece and technically speaking it is a sci-fi. Then in 2012 Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus"" came and it was despised by the public. But it was never easy to make a good sci-fi film, because it always approached over the years many different tones and genres (""Alien""-Horror, ""Star Wars""-Fantasy, ""Blade Runner""-Action and Philosophy). And then Rian Johnson, director-screenwriter from the school thriller ""Brick"" and the ""comedy"" ""The Bloom Brothers"", with ""Looper"" not only made the best sci-fi of 2012 but also one of the best of its kind.<br/><br/>""Looper"" is located at the future in 2044 where time travel has not been invented. But it will be in the year of 2074 and will start to be used by the most dangerous criminal minds in the world. Where when they want to get rid of a rival or someone, they send that person back in time where will be eliminated by assassins called ""Loopers"" which from each death they will be rewarded with silver or gold, because technically speaking the death never happened. One of these Loopers is called Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a young selfish that drug-acted that have fun all night after another job well done. One day when he is about to close another job, he discovers that his new target it is his older-self (Bruce Willis). When Joe is about to ""Kill-himself"" the Old Joe manages to escape, and if any Looper let his target escape he also will be hunted down and killed. Now Joe has to find his older self and kill him avoiding his own death. But Joe barely knows the dark secrets that his older self from the future brings.<br/><br/>What Rian Johnson made so special in Looper? Mainly because while ""Looper"" can be quite original and unique. Johnson builds a credible and even possible future with poverty and corruption reigning (and also most of the population still use cars and only some use flying motorbikes). Also managing to join several clichés of time travel films from ""The Terminator"" to ""12 Monkeys"". That is, a possible frightening and terrifying future with a big twist in the film.<br/><br/>Not just clichés of time travel that Rian Johnson brings to Looper, but as I said before, science-fiction has always had many different genres and Rian Johnson knows that. Putting in the movie good old fashioned action (bloody violent and awesome as hell), but also dramatic moments when Joe meets Sara (Emily Blunt) and her son Cid (Pierce Gagnon). And also elements of Western with the Loopers (bounty-killers using revolvers and weird-awesome shotguns). Along with dark and violent moments, especially when Old Joe starts to show his true motives.<br/><br/>All this comes with a superb screenplay written by Johnson himself. The writing seems a mixture of Michael Mann with Tarantino and Joss Whedon. This means, long but never get boring well-paced dialogs, raising in them several different topics related to the history and making all characters relevant in the story. Speaking of characters, all of them are very well built and are part of the great genius that Johnson put in the movie. Mainly because there is no good vs. evil here, Joe shows to be really selfish in various situations, and the Old Joe shows several reasons for what he is doing.<br/><br/>But what they all have in common is fantastic performances: since Emily Blunt (great) to Paul Dano (which unfortunately barely appears in the film); Bruce Willis finally after a time with horrible action movies (except for ""Red"") showing that he can be a excellent actor; Levitt.....well I don't even know if that's Joseph Gordon – Levitt. Or Rian Johnson has a time machine and he went in the past and asked Bruce Willis in his 30s to act in the film, or that is an excellent blend of makeup and contact lenses or a MAGNIFICENT performance from Levitt.<br/><br/>""Looper"" is succeeds not only for its great originality, but also by the use of various genres and tones that science fiction films always approached by mixing together clichés of previous films. All thanks to a superb script, great direction and excellent cast, with a great genius since the beginning to the ""mind blowing"" end, ""Looper"" it was not only one of the best films of 2012 but it can be one of the best sci - fi movies ever made.<br/><br/>10/10"
"ParanoidAndroid97","9","0","3","12 April 2013"," Rip-roaring time travel epic- a flashback to the times when action films were still exciting...
","Looper is a story about a hit-man paid to kill prisoners that have been sent back in time to avoid their corpses being found in the future. However, it all goes wrong for him when his future self is sent back and escapes. This film could have been an endless chase between young Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and old Joe (Bruce Willis) but fortunately it avoids this by adding a whole new dimension to the story- a mysterious young boy called Cid (Pierce Gagnon) with extraordinary telekinetic powers. The plot is well-thought-through, if sometimes chaotic and completely mind-boggling (especially after the turn of events at the end of the movie, at which point you have many questions about whether so-and-so actually died or not, or whether the people old Joe killed would still be dead) but regardless makes up a sci-fi/action epic that will keep you on your toes throughout. The acting is good enough to be convincing and allows the viewer to focus on the more important elements of the film. the script is also excellent and allows both Gordon-Levitt and Willis to experiment with their characters. Credit must also go to Emily Blunt, Cid's mother, who puts on a surprisingly good Southern-American accent and a similarly good performance. A very commendable 9/10."
"StevePulaski","8","0","3","1 April 2013"," How would you market this career at a job-fair?
","Rian Johnson's Looper is an intriguing science-fiction film, with a devotion to story and plot that is larger than competitors of its genre within recent years. It elaborates where other films would cop-out and purposely mystify. However, like great science-fiction, it requires significant attention to its patterns, detail, and design - something I underestimated prior to viewing.<br/><br/>For that reason alone, perhaps Looper warrants another viewing on my part, just as a refesher. Constant evaluation seems worthless, as it so often does, an a crash course-research job seems oversimplifying. I sort of just want to experience the film again on its own terms before jumping random and arbitrary theories.<br/><br/>I'll keep the story relatively basic; we are now in 2044 (the present), where Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) works as a ""looper."" A ""looper"" is responsible for whacking the criminals mob members send from the future, 2074. Joe will wait in an empty field when a man, masked and on his knees, will spawn in thin air like a video game character before shooting the man with a loud, ear-shattering blunderbuss. He'll proceed to dispose of the corpse in a furnace. This whole process exists because, we're told, it's much harder to dispose of a corpse in 2074 America. Apparently, it's much easier to conceal and operate a time-traveling machine (which is illegal, mind you).<br/><br/>A looper, inevitably, meet their fate when the mob members eventually spawn their own self thirty years into the future. This is known as ""closing the loop,"" and is feared and unexpected in the career of loopers. Joe finally meets his older self (Bruce Willis), who he recognizes since he lacks the obligatory ""mask over face"" deal, and proceeds to have coffee with him in a diner and a long discussion before discovering his intentions. Later in the film, he meets Sara (Emily Blunt) and her younger brother Cid (Pierce Gagnon), two locals living on a farm that wind up getting mixed up in Joe's predicament.<br/><br/>A small feature that seems to have gone unnoticed by the public is the terrific makeup job conducted by a team of over twenty specialists who deserve more work in the field. The goal is to make Gordon-Levitt resemble a younger, spryer Bruce Willis, and the result is surprisingly great. Imperfections, however, such as more makeup on the character than in previous scenes, have been dually noted, but posed no distractions for someone who sometimes feels underwhelmed by scenery and makeup effects.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt does some powerful work here, further establishing that he long ago assumed the impact and power as a character actor. From sci-fi, to action, to comedy, to drama, etc, it would be an understatement to regard him as just an actor; he's one of the most diverse souls in Hollywood today. Emily Blunt is anything but typical here, assuming a role that allows her to be brash, strong, independent, and something of a role model. Another surprising feature about Looper is its treatment of supporting characters, not simply giving the little ground to walk on. Jeff Daniels is great as Abe, the main boss, and Paul Dano, another terrific character actor who just showed untold potential in For Ellen and Ruby Sparks is Seth, Joe's pal who is fearing the worst after he ""let his loop run"" - meaning he failed to shoot the man after spawning.<br/><br/>Like almost all science-fiction films, one can dissect them apart in such an unforgiving way that nothing would be left except for confusion and plot holes. I do not consider in-depth analysis to be a conventional part of my film criticisms, although I feel inclined to question aspects in a more collective manner. For instance, why can't the mob spawn the men directly into the furnace, omitting the danger and inevitable, ""self-inflicted"" murder a looper must commit? Also, I reiterate the question of how hard can it be to dispose of a corpse in 2074, when time-travel equipment can be made seemingly easy to access for an already criminally-run sector of the population? Has the futuristic black market become something of an incalculable empire? Looper does have a tad more explaining to do, but to its credit, its world and concepts aren't as arbitrary or as impossible as they sound. I could suspend most disbelief, much to my surprise. The future it paints isn't so much as flashy as it is attractive, detailed, and practical - like a high-resolution, digital photograph brought to life. Its crisp visuals and slick photography make it all the more captivating to watch and enjoy. One small aesthetic I, too, neglected to mention is the sound. For a science-fiction film, I was stunned at how effective it was at using auditory levels and sound editing. The use of genuine, abrupt sound is perfect when incidents like the first shot of the blunderbuss occur, or when Cid activates his extreme telekinetic powers. The effect is jarring and bombastic in the most stimulating way.<br/><br/>Johnson has proved himself to be a storyteller above anything with Looper as his attention and development to a world so close yet so foreign to our current one is an achievement. His writing scarcely falters and his talent as a director rarely does as well. Assisted by only competent talent and terrific uses of smaller aesthetics, Looper is a well-done science fiction endeavor that finally caters to a more demanding, unfairly rewarded demographic. I'd just love to see how the job of a looper would be marketed at a town job-fair.<br/><br/>Starring: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt, Pierce Gagnon, Paul Dano, and Jeff Daniels.

Someone should have time traveled to destroy the screenplay for this thing.<br/><br/>That said, it's a passable gangster movie/drama and has some interesting shootouts with a lot of atmosphere and style in a unique world that I had no trouble appreciating. It also lays down some good drama, and the acting isn't anything to complain about, with more than acceptable performances all around. It's worth watching, in spite of everything.<br/><br/>If you can ignore the bad sci-fi, it's quite possible to enjoy the ride. Just do me a favor, and if they ever make a novel out of this... don't read it. This movie isn't for the plot."

","This film is about a young man who kills people from the future who are transported back in time for him to kill.<br/><br/>It is easy to have loopholes in time travel stories, but ""Looper"" deals with the science well. It has no major pitfalls, except the fact that it does not address the creating of a parallel universe when the past is changed. Anyway, I can easily overlook that and enjoy the story as it is, because it is an interesting science fiction plus action thriller combined into one. The plot is confusing at first, and I also got confused because Joseph Gordon Levitt does not look like the usual Joseph Gordon Levitt, which is distracting. Once I got into it, I think it is an action packed, fast paced action thriller. The ending is a little predictable, but I only correctly guessed it just before it happened. ""Looper"" provides adequate entertainment, and I enjoyed watching it."

","The movie was a gripping beginning, with enemies from the future appearing mysteriously and being shot at close range by the young Joe. OK, s it doesn't make sense (as one reviewer comments, apparently time machines are cheaper/more convenient in the future than incinerators) but it makes for a hell of plot idea. Similarly the gruesome ""doctoring"" done on an escaped looper to make him ""turn himself in"" (sort of).<br/><br/>The high point of the movie was the encounter between old Joe and young Joe in the diner. I'm not a huge fan of Bruce Willis because I don't think he can really deliver the one-liners well (e.g. in the Die Hard movies), but he doesn't overdo it here.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the plot twist introduced at this point just sends the movie off in an entirely different direction. Not that it wasn't entertaining, but it was a little much for my brain to handle. But then Bruce warned us that thinking about time travel would fry our brains didn't he?"

","I can't believe there are so many people giving this film very low ratings.

Come on people! If your knowledge about time travel is so profound and accurate, why hasn't time travel been invented yet? We cannot use our current scientific knowledge to explain things that will or will never be invented in the future. And at the end of the day, this is not a science documentary but a sci-fi film. So stop reasoning if the premise of the film make scientific sense, or breaking your head to figure out how the present (Joseph Gorden-Levitt) and future (Bruce Willis) self should link with each other if certain timeline is changed.

Simultaneously he picked movies like 50/50 and 500 days of summer which highlighted his range and ability. <br/><br/>In Looper, Levitt continues with the same formula as he stands with icon, Bruce Willis while playing a bounty hunter of sorts in this time travelling Sci-Fi Thriller. Willis leaves his mark with his performance while Levitt continues to deliver and shape a blossoming career.

This is a character-driven story, and a rather good one.<br/><br/>There's a neat, ""noir-ish"" tone to the movie. There's some exposition in the first half-hour that helps us understand the rules of this universe. A great many of these rules are explained in an early sequence where a friend of central character Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) fails to ""close his loop"" by killing his future self. The results are gruesome, but not in any way we see explicitly.<br/><br/>Great sci-fi doesn't actually have to be believable. It just has to provide a setting for a story that wouldn't make sense in our own world.

"evanston_dad","8","0","1","10 February 2013"," Strong Message Was Enough to Make Me Overlook Numerous Plot Weaknesses
","This time travel sci-fi thriller is one of those movies that instantly begins to unravel if you start pulling at its plot strings, but if you're willing to just accept certain things as presented without questioning them too much, it provides a lot of entertainment and a welcome message about the role strong parenting can play in helping children navigate the journey into adulthood.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of the best young actors currently working, and he gives a terrific performance here even under heaps of makeup designed to make him look like a young Bruce Willis. Willis is the adult version come back from the future to be bumped off by himself, in some strange system of hit men established and run by a mysterious crime lord living in a near-future world. Why on earth the system would have people sent back to be killed by themselves in the first place is only one of the first wonky plot devices that it's best not to think too hard about. The wrinkle in this particular plan is that Gordon-Levitt can't kill himself, his older self gets away, and Gordon-Levitt must track him down before he kills the child who will grow up to become the aforementioned crime lord who will ultimately be responsible for his (Willis's, and by extension, Gordon-Levitt's) death and the death of his beloved future wife. Are you following? <br/><br/>If not, don't worry. It all makes sense, or mostly does, while watching the movie. The best storyline in the film is that of Emily Blunt's, who plays the mother of the kid who will turn into the evil crime lord responsible for the bleakness of the future world. It's her character that understands the need to intervene as a parent and that with strong guidance someone who might have tendencies to turn into something bad need not necessarily take that path. Gordon-Levitt's character comes to that realization too, and takes action to stop the endless cycle of violence and destruction that this looping system has created. The ending provides an emotional payoff that makes the grimness and violence of what precedes it worth sitting through.<br/><br/>A strong film for its genre.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"
"Lucy_Rose84","10","0","3","9 February 2013"," Incredibly crafted, mind-bending thriller
","This was my favourite film of 2012. It is a gripping sci-fi thriller, with superb performances and carefully crafted plot that keeps you guessing right until the mind-blowing climax, and yet retains a real warmth and humanity. Essentially it isn't about the special effects and mind- bending notions of time travel. It asks a fundamental question: is evil inherent? And if it isn't, what would you do to stop it appearing?<br/><br/>The pace is incredible, with the intricately woven plot carefully unfolded piece by piece so that we are continually surprised, but never confused. Rian Johnson gives the age old notion of time travel new life by introducing innovative ideas such as torturing a young Paul Dano in order to torment his fugitive future self. <br/><br/>Add to this an array of pitch-perfect performances and you're on to a winner. I'll admit that Joseph-Gordon Levitt makes a visually unconvincing young Bruce Willis, in spite of the painstaking prosthetics (which I found pretty distracting), but no one can deny that he gives a cracking performance as Joe the Looper - a hit man hired to bump off the enemies of the 'bad guys' who are sent back from the future. Bruce himself does what he does best, while Emily Blunt gives the performance of her career as a guilt-ridden young mother determined to do right by her son. Pierce Gagnon is terrifyingly convincing as Blunt's son Cid, displaying a maturity far beyond his years with a performance that rivals Haley Joel Osment in Sixth Sense.<br/><br/>People who want to pick holes in the theory and logistics of time-travel are missing the point of this film. I found the explanations utterly believable, but what really got to me were the characters and performances. It is a taught, intelligent piece of film-making in which every element is perfectly crafted so as to enhance the whole without drawing attention to itself."

Hired by mobs from the future, the Loopers are run by Abe (Jeff Daniels) who is sent back to look after things in the present (past?). One of these loopers is Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who learns that one by one, all the loopers are being sent back to be killed off. Loops are being closed off and if they fail to kill their future selves then a hit is order to kill either the present Looper or the future Looper.<br/><br/>As Joe fails to kill his future self (Bruce Willis), his future self tries to change the course of time and the future, while the younger Joe just wants to live out his life and will do so even if it means killing his future self. The plot opens up to show how and why the future Joe wants to eradicate the mysterious crime boss The Rainmaker. He believes that killing him while he is young will allow him to live the life he has lived....you following? <br/><br/>What the film does is give you two protagonist and you are never quite sure who to root for. Is it the older self who has learnt from his mistakes or is it the young Joe who is yet to learn from it. As the story unfolds the young Joe comes across one of the three possible targets that could be the potential young Rainmaker and sets out to protect him and his mother (Emily Blunt) from the older Joe. One has knowledge of the future and his own life whilst the other is living in the present doing what he believes to be right. It's a conflict which continues for both Joes' to struggle with as well as for the viewer.<br/><br/>A film that does well in creating an emotional response, the main characters provide an interesting emotional arch and has more depth to them than you would normally expect from these types of films. Emily Blunt character and her son gives the film it's change in pace. It starts up fast and frenetic and slows to a more meditative and reflect tone as characters become aware of their destiny and how some things are impossible to change.<br/><br/>A sci-fi film with plenty of intelligence, it never relies heavily on special effects or set pieces to provide entertainment. It feels very usual to see how little action is on show and more on the character development side of things. It does borrow from plots of other great sci-fi like the Terminator but it isn't as straight forward as that. It's like having the choice in going back to kill Hitler as a child knowing what he would do but having the strength to kill an innocent young human being with little or no evil in them yet.<br/><br/>A complex and interesting film brimming with ideas, with a standout performance from new comer Pierce Gagnon as the potential future crime lord. A kid so young not being out done by established actors on screen. Most may find the make up on young Joe a little distracting but nevertheless it is a passable resemblances to Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>A thoroughly entertaining film with a strong and complex narrative which will lead you to think about it for days on end as you try to work out it's convoluted plot."
"Ash-radford","10","0","3","1 February 2013"," Clever for the smart people
","I never saw this in the cinema due to a friend saying it was only an OK film. So I thought I'd wait and not waste my money on just an OK film. But now that I have seen it... Wow. It went straight into my top ten films of all time. <br/><br/>Now to why this film is so great: amazing actors, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's make-up is astonishing it took me a while to truly recognise him, and his acting picking up on little mannerisms of Bruce wills make him totally believable he could have been a younger Bruce Willis. But stealing away the thunder was Pierce Gagnon who plays Cid, a young boy who has already been through so much, and has developed amazing telekinetic powers more powerful than everyone else combined. But is too young to understand it all. He was so believable I almost cried after finding out what his life was like. And even though we're told he becomes an evil gang lord that is unstoppable and eventually kills Older Joes wife and we're supposed to dislike him, I couldn't help but worry for the kid when Bruce Willis was trying to kill him, it's not really the kids fault, and after loosing his family at such a young age and left all alone, who can blame him for turning out the way he did. But thankfully Joe changes everything and the kid can grow up with a loving family. But then if you have managed to follow the plot it's easy to forgive older Joe for trying to do it, it's mixes in so many emotions. Matched the strong story they have managed to pull off a masterpiece creating this film. <br/><br/>But this film is not for people who only enjoy the works of classic directors such as Hitcock. People who like to see influences from older films in modern movies. This movie doesn't do or need that. It's amazing all by itself, and anyone who thinks I'm insane to even compare to a director such as Hitcock, just remember Hitcock wasn't always the master director everyone thinks he is today, example Vertigo was not successful when it was released.<br/><br/>Now to address some confusions a lot of people have with this film: Yes people travel through time but is the movie about time travel? Not really. Is this film about people that have what some people call 'superpowers' ? No. This film is about how far people would go for what they want. Like many other films such as Taken and others. But this one has time travel, it has telekinetic powers, which makes it cool.<br/><br/>Time travel- a lot of people are saying it was never explained and would have caused major plot holes and paradoxes, that none of it was believable. But having a background in physics I can truly say nothing within the known laws of physics says anything in this film is impossible. And the biggest confusion most people have is that time is just an illusion that we humans created, it's difficult to explain but basically time doesn't work how most people think it does. I would go further into detail but why bother. I think most people have read too much into this which is why they disliked it, the secret to enjoy a film, is to not read too much into things. Movies are entertainment, they're not suppose to be entirely realistic, if I wanted just pure realism I wouldn't watch films I'd just live my own life, cause it doesn't get more real than that. And it's free.<br/><br/>Telekinetic powers- again studies show there's fact in here. Surely everyone's see that toy where you put on a helmet and you can move a ball up and down a tube with your mind. And surely everyone's heard of evolution! But yes I know what your thinking, evolution happens over many many years its taken a few tens of thousand years to get to where we are now. So this film is saying some people have evolved to having telekinetic powers in the next 30 years? Well yes and no, the film says people have these powers but its not that strong as most can only lift up a coin. But is it possible? Actually it just might be, human evolution hasn't stopped not even close, actually it's accelerating! So there's no reason why it couldn't happen, our brains already give out waves of information. The only reason humans grow old and die is because the brain is too stupid and hasn't fully evolved to prevent the body it controls from growing old and weak. So theoretically it's possible, remember gravity is still just a theory. <br/><br/>So if you've seen this movie but thought it wasn't believable enough, watch it again and ask yourself, why couldn't this be real. Is there a way you can prove its impossible. But in the end Remember its still just a film just sit back and go with it stop criticising every little detail cause you're going to miss the film if you do.<br/><br/>I've touched upon the two major elements that seemed to halt the entertainment happening to people who thought its was a failed attempt of a time travel film. And even after reading this and you find everything I've said is a lie, there's no hope for you."

At some point in the movie it dawns on you why even the title of the movie has a deeper significance than being simply the name appropriated by the mob's high-rolling hit-men.<br/><br/>For me the revelation came at a point that I was totally drawn in to the film, and emotionally invested in both the moment and the characters.<br/><br/>It was one of those stomach-churning moments that turns a good movie great."

Set mostly in 2044 Kansas, but filmed mostly in the sugar cane fields of Louisiana, the actors and characters are first-rate. But it is not a movie to be watched casually, paying half-attention. It is easy to miss something and get confused.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Young Joe, sent from the future, a ""looper"" whose only job is to be at a certain place at a certain time, and using an old-fashioned blunderbuss kill the hooded person sent via time-travel from 30 years in the future. Since time-travel has been outlawed these are always criminals that need disposal without a trace. That is, if they are executed 30 years earlier, in essence they never existed. The dead person has silver bars attached to his back, the looper takes this as payment for his services. If he executes his old self, he gets gold bars then is free to travel and live for 30 years.<br/><br/>One day Bruce Willis as Old Joe shows up, unhooded and unbound, sent from the future to be terminated. They called this ""closing the loop."" But when Young Joe recognizes his older self he hesitates, and Old Joe gets the best of him and runs away.

But you have to pay attention!<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW: Soon after we see the Young and Old Joe encounter, we see what amounts to a flashback, to a time 30 years earlier where Young Joe actually does kill Old Joe, collects his gold bars, and travels to China where he spends his money and grows old, turns to a life of more crime when he goes broke, meets his wife, and then gets rounded up to be sent back for execution. But he escapes, takes off the hood, and returns with plans to hunt down the child who will become the Rainmaker. They find Emily Blunt as Sara who has a 5-yr-old boy, Pierce Gagnon, really very good as Cid with extreme TK powers, and who we eventually learn is destined to become the Rainmaker, as a direct result of seeing his mother killed and then not being nurtured properly.

","You can never go wrong in choosing a movie that stars Bruce Willis or Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but when they come to together, that's when the magic really happens! Looper is the brainchild of Rian Johnson, who likes to bring us unusual stories, that mainly star JGL, however Looper is much easier to follow than most of Johnson's other films. While I'm not his biggest fan, his attention to detail has always really stood out to me and is perhaps never more evident than in Looper. Johnson actually used make-up and special effects to make JGL resemble a young Bruce Willis, which I found to be ingenious. Not to be overlooked is of course how clever a story Looper is, as it blends together time travel and the mafia. In the future, time travel has been invented, but like every other good thing, it is illegal. The mafia controls time travel and uses it as a weapon to commit murder. In this future world, it is impossible to dispose of a body, so the mafia sends their targets back in time where they are met an executed by a hired gun, known as a looper. The performances are of course top notch, Willis, the action star of a generation, only gets better with age, and JGL is the simply put the hardest working, most under appreciated actor in all of Hollywood. To be completely honest, this intriguing, action-packed, thriller was not as good as I expected it to be, and I really didn't care for the way in ended.

If you don't understand how ridiculous that argument is then you shouldn't watch the movie. It won't make any sense to you. There are plenty of things wrong with the time travel concept if you analyze it, but that's because it is TIME TRAVEL... you know, jumping around instantaneously in a dimension that our brains can't understand.

","Such a surprising cinematic experience. I was apprehensive before watching because most movies dealing with time travel completely butcher it and make the movie seem more silly than anything. Thankfully, Looper did a very good job with it. They didn't try to explain anything about the science of it, which I was fine with, but I felt that they nailed the concept. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did an amazing job, not only acting but as portraying a young Bruce Willis. Obviously the make-up department deserves credit for the look but JGL mastered all of the mannerisms and the style of talking. Very impressive performance on his behalf. And I love Emily Blunt so her being in the film is a nice bonus, plus it's nice to see her take on a slightly different role from her typical typecast. The only negative in the film, in my opinion, was the telekinesis element. I thought it was a really silly aspect of the film and didn't need to be in there at all. The Rainmaker, could've easily been portrayed to be a genius child, not a borderline superhuman. That's really the only part of the film that was mediocre. Looper is definitely a movie that I think most people would enjoy. Some will probably find it challenging to follow but those that follow it well will surely consider it entertaining."

","""Looper"" is a futuristic tale about time travel. And we all know about the rules of time travel...<br/><br/>1) DO NOT travel back in time. <br/><br/>2) If you travel back in time DO NOT stand face to face with your past self. <br/><br/>3) If you do travel back in time and are standing face to face with your past self DO NOT reveal anything about your future. <br/><br/>But this movie took the rule book and through it out the window. Joe (JGL) is a ""Looper assassin"" and it's his job to kill people sent from the future and to dispose of the body. All's well until the boss in the future decides to ""Close his Loop."" Which entails sending his future self (Bruce Willis) to the past for him (JGL) to kill. Now having JGL kill him straight away would be one boring movie so Bruce Willis gets away and the story begins.<br/><br/>I liked this movie because it shows you how the future, and the past alike, are NOT set in stone. What JGL does in pursuit of Bruce Willis changes Bruce Willis's memory and alters what happened to him in his life. The two ""Joe's"" have two different hearts, desires and beliefs. Bruce Willis's Joe is desperately in love and comes to the past to kill the reason his wife is dead while JGL is hell bent on protecting the reason Bruce Willis's wife is dead. (partialy because at this point in time the ""reason"" Bruce Willis's wife is dead is still just a little boy and partially because he has feelings for this little boy's mother. Played by Emily Blunt.) Needless to say this makes things confusing for Bruce Willis when he unexpectedly and out of nowhere has feelings for this woman he's never seen before.<br/><br/>If you don't pay attention it may be a little hard to follow, I mean it IS a movie about time travel so it does jump around a bit, but if you do pay attention and understand it the storyline is action packed and touching. JGL sees the man he grew into and became, and he is shocked, saddened and just unpleased with himself. Bruce Willis sees who he was and wants a better life for himself, and tries to do that by forcing the woman he loves on JGL, so that he (JGL) can live the life that was stolen from him. (Bruce Willis)<br/><br/>The setting was also fun to see the characters interact with. You get both the city and the country and the future and past.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was well written and well acted, and once you get past the fact that JGL is wearing a fake nose and chin to make him resemble Bruce Willis you really get into the story. Any action junkee will love this movie, (and this comes from the rom-com queen) I give it a 6 for storyline, a 1 for setting and 1 bonus point for casting. 8/10 in total."

","I was at least entertained and intrigued. It wasn't a powerful film or insightful or thought provoking, but it was interesting, at the very least. And Joseph Gordon-Levitt is surprisingly turning out to be a good leading male in these ""action"" films, even though he's a bit small in stature and typically known for playing the quirky, lovable goofball. I do use the word ""action"" lightly since this wasn't really an action film. JGL kind of has the Keanu Reeves look without any of the actual stunts or breaking a sweat, he mostly just carries a big gun. The movie is watchable. I like the original concept of the film. Though, the entire concept of this film is impossible. That's the problem with time travel, none of this film would have happened if they changed the past. It just doesn't work that way and you don't have to be a rocket scientist about time travel to figure that out. A little disappointing that they made an entire film with a star like Bruce Willis and didn't try to delicately hide the fact that the entire concept of the film...would never happen if they actually changed those events. That's a pretty big oversight but I'm willing to still give it a halfway decent score 'cause it was at least a 7 on entertaining and engagement but not exactly riveting. You'd be better off to see the time travel one with Jake Gylenhal. That was a really good film."

","Looper (2012) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>I think to fully enjoy LOOPER it's best that you go in with very limited knowledge as to the story and the events that happen. If you've seen the trailer then you know all you need to know. The film takes place in the future where ""loopers"" kill people being sent back from the future. A loopers job is over when they send his older self back to be killed. LOOPER is a very rare type of science-fiction film meaning that it has a brain, which is something missing from most of these types of movies. I'm not typically a big fan of the genre but there's no question that when someone takes the time to come up with a great story then the result can be something special. Writer-director Rian Johnson deserves a lot of credit for not only making a smart film but he also deserves credit for keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat and not knowing what's going to happen next. I said it's best to view this film knowing very little about what happens and that's because there are so many twists and turns that it would be a real shame for someone to know what happens before actually seeing the film. Even a smart film will often times go off the rails because the twists become confusing and make no sense but that never happens here. The film flows beautifully in and out of every plot twist and in the end the viewer feels rewarded. The performances are another major plus with both Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt doing good work on their own and especially when they're together. Emily Blunt and Paul Dano are also good in their supporting bits. LOOPER is certainly a film that manages to take a familiar plot (time travel) and do something originalwith it."

","The first 45 minutes or so of this movie were fantastic. ""Why haven't I seen this yet?"", I thought to myself. After, however, the diner scene with JGL and BW, everything went downhill. <br/><br/>The start of this movie is fantastic, it's thrilling, it's well acted and thought out. Some note that many things aren't plausible and the plot doesn't really make sense to begin with. I agree with that, but what the heck, it's a thoughtless action movie. I don't always need everything to make sense or be a thinker.<br/><br/>The end of the movie is the part that really frustrated me. We transition from a movie about JGL killing for the mob to JGL almost killing his looper, which is fine. I like that transition. But within minutes, the movie has transitioned again to an entirely different, completely unexplained final 45 minutes of the movie. <br/><br/>The ending left me thinking, ""Why on earth did I just watch this movie?"" - nothing is finished, nothing is closed, nothing makes sense. Very poorly done. <br/><br/>On a side note, it was all acted very well."
"TheUnknown837-1","7","0","3","10 January 2013"," Second-hand action scenes prevent it from being a masterpiece, but Rian Johnson's film is appreciatively clever and packed with intricate details.
","The biggest strike counting against ""Looper"" is that its director, Rian Johnson, is not yet much of an action specialist. And although this new movie has been raved up and appraised for its admittedly clever and intricate ideas involving time travel, the bits and pieces consisting of shootouts, brutal beatings, and a little boy whose temper tantrums result in telepathic explosions are a big part of what Mr. Johnson hopes to accomplish. Now the action scenes are not horrible, but they are not particularly exciting either. Mr. Johnson stages his misc en scene in awkward places, instructs his actors to move too slowly, and the camera is frequently searching for carnage it cannot find—usually because the low-key lighting is too heavy for it to see anything. There is even a scene where a truck gets flipped forward and we just barely see part of the vehicle in a subsequent wide-shot before it disappears off the edge of the screen. Maybe it was staged to come out like that, but I think the filmmakers just got lucky.<br/><br/>So that's the regrettable news: ""Looper"" is not the masterpiece I hoped it to be. The good news, however, is that its story is appreciatively clever and very detailed. Mr. Johnson, who composed the original screenplay, has devised a setup that Christopher Nolan would probably appreciate. Time travel does not merely exist in his world; it has elaborately detailed limits and restrictions. The story gets off on the right foot with its protagonist (Joseph Gordon-Leavitt, an actor I never get tired of seeing) telling us how it all works. Because he exists in the present and the people he's hired to murder and teleported to him from the future, we cannot see the actual time travel process, but he's been informed of how it works and he shares his knowledge with us. Going back to Christopher Nolan, ""Looper"" reminded me of ""Inception"" and how in that movie, Leonardo DiCaprio filled in the blanks. This is appropriate, since ""Looper"" wants to be a little edgier than just a simplistic, corny action exploitation picture.<br/><br/>Save for a completely unneeded flash-forward sequence (in which we see how Mr. Gordon-Leavitt grows up to be a weary-looking Bruce Willis), the movie is subtle and restrained in detailing the future. It stays in the present, and when a man-to-be-murdered is transported into the present, there is no ostentatious, glowing special effects. No bright flashes, no streaks of computer-generated lights. Just a cleverly utilized jump cut accompanied with a subtle whooshing sound effect.<br/><br/>Some people are destined to be angered, and some have, by the portrayal of a child in this picture. In short, the little boy featured in this movie is blessed with a gift. He's like John Connor from James Cameron's ""Terminator"" movies, except he is destined for bad things instead of saving the world. In regards to the young actor's performance, I was not all that taken with Pierce Gagnon's dialogue delivery, but was utterly stunned by his stunning use of expressions. When this kid puts on a frown, he looks genuinely scary. Even if he did not have mind powers strong enough to detonate a house or rip a man to shreds, you would not want to be caught near him. The only fault to come out of this is that it begins to contradict what Rian Johnson's screenplay would like us to resonate with. Without giving away too much of the plot's third act, the movie tries to make a point that a person's companionship during childhood—the people he or she grows up under—will determine his future. All fine, except this kid is portrayed as so temperament prone and so psychologically unstable that I found it hard to believe that anybody, even a teary-eyed Emily Blunt, could ever reshape his future.<br/><br/>All of the performances are generally good. Mr. Gordon-Leavitt, playing Bruce Willis's younger self, is exceptionally effective. The make-up applied to heighten his resemblance to Mr. Willis is a good starting point, but he also mimics the expressions and idiosyncratic tendencies: the drawl in the voice, the lifting of the eyebrows while maintain a squint, and so on. Mr. Willis is his usual self, and it is nice to see him tackling the role of a morally weaker man afraid not for his life, but somebody else's. Emily Blunt, no stranger to praise from me, is also strong in her role.<br/><br/>Had ""Looper"" made some tweaks to its third act and Mr. Johnson had recruited some expertise to assist him in coordinating the action scenes, it probably would have reached the heights of excellence it has strived for. But as it is, it is a perfectly fine movie worth seeing and I did enjoy it more on the second viewing. Rian Johnson does have a lot of imagination and cleverness and to complain that his nice, perfectly good movie is not a masterpiece—considering this is still very early in his career—does seem a little silly."

","Like other reviewers, perhaps I expected too much of this film, which is in its conception a clumsy amalgam of Blade Runner, Terminator, 12 Monkeys, and Carrie.<br/><br/>Yes, this is true.<br/><br/>As an earlier reviewer noted, the first 30 minutes were intriguing, and even though a modicum of reflection would quickly poke holes in the main premise (a future crime syndicate sends undesirables back in time to be whacked by assassins called ""loopers""), the action and the novelty of the setting (2042) are enough to distract the view in a pleasant and stimulating fashion.<br/><br/>But then the storyline, after having hinted at some very intriguing intellectual possibilities, begins to introduce deus ex machina by the bushel full to bring the plot to a conclusion that the writer probably thinks is pretty clever.<br/><br/>It is as if the writer, after starting with a strong idea and opening these possibilities, realizes that he doesn't have the answers to the questions he raises, nor even any plausible possible explanations.<br/><br/>Unlike some of the other negative reviewers, with whom I agree for the most part, I'll not belabor the *small* stuff--and there's plenty of it--arguably too much even to list.<br/><br/>But I'll merely mention that while the film starts with a dramatic and shocking scene that is explained in a voice-over narration (the stuff about the future mob, etc.) ala Blade Runner, and every quickly and briefly mentions that things have gone to hell in a handbasket by 2042--oh, and by the way, some of us now have telekinetic powers (""TK"")--this introduction to TK is then never mentioned until the last 3rd of the movie, and plays no other role than to be used as a sort of wildcard plot resolution tool.<br/><br/>Got a problem with bad guys who have all the cards and will surely kill the hero and heroine, thus ending the story without a proper dramatic arc? Pull a mini-Vesuvius (TK run amok) out of your writer's Bag o' Tricks and use it to get the main characters from point A to point B in the advancement of the plot.<br/><br/>It's that kind of a movie."

One day, he was sent his future self (Bruce Willis) to kill. Old Joe escapes being shot by Young Joe, and from there Old Joe plots to kill the future mob boss (called ""The Rainmaker"") while he was still a little boy named Cid. This was to prevent a future event where the Rainmaker kills Joe's wife. However, Young Joe gets finds Cid first and gets close with his mom Sara (Emily Blunt). How will Young Joe and Old Joe resolve this conflict of interest?<br/><br/>Honestly, did we not already see the concept of killing a person before he matures back in the 80s with ""The Terminator""? Cid's mother was also even named Sara -- shades of Sarah Connor in ""Terminator"" isn't it? This future Rainmaker wasn't helpless though, as he had remarkable powers of his own. Are they asking us to also believe that super power mutations will be the order of the day in the future? <br/><br/>It is very easy to like this movie if you just glide over all of the time travel improbabilities. The whole concept is so violent and sort of illogical, yet JGL and Bruce Willis make it all look so cool. I have never seen Emily Blunt look so tough before.

"angie_l","6","0","2","6 January 2013"," The trouble with time travel
","I love sci fi movies and futuristic ones, even if the future is a deteriorated version of the now instead of an improved one. The trouble with time travel is it always leads to plot holes and this one had a couple. The movie was good except for some nagging logical inconsistencies. So I am going to talk rather openly about the movie, though you may not fully understand unless you have seen it.<br/><br/>Joe BW - the Bruce Willis version of Joe 30 years older, Joe JGL - the younger Joseph Gordon Lovett version of Joe<br/><br/>Joe is a looper, killing people from the future. When your loop is closed, the last person you kill is yourself with a big pay out. Then you have 30 more years to live until you are the older version of you sent back in time and killed by yourself. So Joe BW kills himself when he is young and lives out the rest of his 30 years. Most of it still living a drugged violent life until he meets a woman who cleans him up and makes him anew. When they come to send him back in time, his wife is murdered. So, Joe BW who is now a very skilled killer manages to jump back in time and survive Joe JGL trying to kill him - this is already a change since Joe BW killed his older self. Joe BW comes up with the plan to eliminate the rainmaker, the terrible gang leader in the future he feels is responsible for his wife's death. I am guessing all along they were killing people for the rainmaker??? The idea is killing the rainmaker will save the wife and keep him from being sent back in time. Right? Another key point, though Joe BW exists at the same time as the younger Joe JGL, whatever happens to Joe JGL affects Joe BW. Joe JGL cuts himself and Joe BW gets the scar - time travel shouldn't work that way, Joe BW should solely be the product of the life he lived unaffected by changes he causes, but these are the rules the movie sets up which also contributes to the plot and the plot holes. Also let me add, the impression I got was the reason Joe BW survives his loop being closed is because of his wife, yet he obsessively checks his watch to make sure he still meets her. Joe BW when young killed his old self presumably because he didn't meet the wife and she didn't die. So since scars show up on BW's body, if the future is changed so Joe JGL doesn't meet the wife, Joe BW should disappear.<br/><br/>Anyway, Joe BW's plan is to find the rainmaker who is still a child and kill him to change the future. As Joe BW is about to shoot the rainmaker's mother to get to the child, Joe JGL has an epiphany about what made the rainmaker so bad and kills himself to stop his older version Joe BW. The idea is Joe BW killing his mother is what makes the rainmaker evil. Here is my issue, in the original time-line, Joe BW had nothing to do with the rainmaker and therefore had nothing to do with what turned the rainmaker bad so even without Joe, we still risk the rainmaker being evil. Second, if the rainmaker is who sent Joe BW back in the first place, him not turning bad would mean Joe BW should disappear as he was never sent back in time - also because Joe BW is not unique from Joe JGL, whatever epiphany Joe JGL has, Joe BW should have. So the fact that Joe BW only disappears when Joe JGL kills himself means that the rainmaker must still be bad and have sent Joe BW back in time. Remember, it is not Joe who is originally responsible for the rainmaker being bad. Every second Joe BW is there means that whatever has happened in the now has not changed the future.<br/><br/>The better ending would be Joe JGL having his epiphany about why the rainmaker turns bad changes the future. Joe BW who is about to shoot his mother should have the epiphany too and then disappear as the future is changed and he is never sent back in time. Then perhaps, Joe JGL can either go on his way or stay with the rainmaker and his mother to help protect them and ensure the rainmaker will be good instead of evil as he has potential for both.<br/><br/>Have you gone cross-eyed reading and trying to understand this? I still liked the movie but will still be waiting for a time travel story that can iron out the difficulties with time travel."

","In the far future, time travel is invented, but outlawed, and used only by criminal elements of society. However, in the far future, the underworld has a difficult time getting rid of bodies, which are tracked efficiently by the Government. So they come up with a creative way of disposing bodies. They send an operative, Abe, back in time (by a few decades) to monitor a group of hit men called loopers. Loopers are contractually obliged to receive masked victims from the future; they lie in wait at a predetermined hour, rifles cocked and ready to shoot. In front of them, the victim suddenly appears; the looper then shoots him down, wrap up the body and cremate him, leaving no trace.<br/><br/>The loopers are monitored actively by the 'Gat Men', who work under Abe to ensure that the Loopers stick to their contract. The loopers are paid princely sums, but accept an expiration date for their services in a unique way; one day, in the far future, his own self would be blindfolded and sent back in time to be executed. The looper is supposed to kill his older self, an act they call 'closing the loop'. (How that closes the loop is beyond me.) Once they execute themselves, they are retired from service with a heavy gold retirement package.<br/><br/>The protagonist is Joe Simmons, who has been a looper for a long time. He faces his own future self, but is overpowered. Joe begins a hunt for his older self. <br/><br/>Fast paced, novel, and gripping, Looper is a strong entertainer. I've always enjoyed Gordon Levitt's performances, and Bruce Willis, playing Gordon's older self, gives a strong performance himself. The story is well drafted, the action sequences are well done, and the story for the Rainman character is masterfully molded in the background. <br/><br/>However, while I enjoyed the movie, it has its own flaws. My friends raved about the movie and heralded it as groundbreaking. I don't think I would go that far. The time travel rules established in the movie are clumsy at best. The truly great time travel movies generally stick to their own rules and make sense in some manner. Here, it seems to have superficial thought at best. The future self is affected by the actions done on the current person. In one sequence, the older self is trying to flee, but the Gat men are actively torturing the current self as this happens. They wound the person, and the older self gets a corresponding scar; they cut off limbs and the future self physically changes accordingly. This was a wonderfully horrific sequence, and built on to a gripping tension, but it just doesn't make sense. If such drastic changes are made, then the entire future life has to be affected... in this case, the implication is that the guy's future doesn't change at all even through something drastic as amputation.<br/><br/>But if you can stop your thoughts from frowning at the logical inconsistencies, the Looper is a strong entertainer."

","As always when it comes to time travel themed movies it inevitably raises a few questions regarding the applied theories, and I guess there are different ways to approach the matter. The way I see it there's the ""Back to the Future way"" which is sort of a tongue-in-cheek approach, and there's the ""Terminator way"" which is more of an absolute-truth approach. ""Looper"" does however try to move focus away from the time travel theory babble and instead concentrate on the storytelling. Normally I'd enjoy a story digging into the complexity and paradoxes of time travel, but in this case this strategy works to the movie's advantage, at least to some extent. It's like the movie makers are saying: ""We're not supposed to understand this anyway"", so it's tempting to just leave it at that. I'm initially convinced of the theories' irrelevance.<br/><br/>The film's main character is Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who works for the mafia as a Looper. Loopers execute people sent back from the future by the mob, as a way of disposing people without detection. Joe is seemingly living an enjoyable life consisting of money, parties, girls, drugs, and some assassinations every now and then. The movie has a nice style to it. Music, editing and pace occasionally make it feel almost like a sixties or seventies movie, but in a smooth and not very obvious fashion. The narrator voice also gives it a noir touch which suits this story well, although as time progresses the movie goes through something of a transformation when it comes to tone and feel, and it doesn't quite end in the same manner it started. <br/><br/>I've lately grown fond of Joseph Gordon-Levitt as an actor, although this might not be his strongest performance so far. Casting in general is fine but not outstanding. Pierce Gagnon is however absolutely brilliant in his role, and I hope to see much more of him in the future.<br/><br/>Anyway, one day Joe find himself aiming a gun at his thirty years older counterpart and things take a turn for the worse. Young Joe (Gordon- Levitt) and old Joe (Bruce Willis) engage in pursuing different possible timelines, i.e. different possible eventualities. This is what I liked the most about the movie - the fact that the story is driven not by the standard good guy-bad guy dispute, but rather the conflict of interest between the two Joes, who essentially are one and the same person. It's exciting to think you know exactly what's going to happen because of old Joe's spent life and memories, and at the same time not knowing anything about forthcoming events because of young Joe's persistence to control his present life. Paradoxically this is also the biggest problem with ""Looper"". Since it avoids to establish some sort of rules of how time travel in the film's reality works, it's hard sometimes to understand why events play out the way they do, how the present affects the future, etc. I appreciate the different style of the movie and its attempt to uncomplicate the time travel business in favor of the story's depth, but I can't help but feeling this is also an attempt to cover up possible plot holes. When it comes down to it there are certain things you have to explain when making a movie of this sort, and you can't really get away from that. All in all this is an interesting story told in an unusual and inspiring way, but it partially fails to explain itself."

","Directed by Rian Johnson, Looper, stars Joseph Gordon Levitt & Bruce Willis in the lead along with Emily Blunt. It is without doubt one of the best sci-fi movies this year. The one thing I loved about Looper is the unconventional attention to the plot. Unlike other sci-fi movies you are not welcome to JUST beefy visuals and eye-candy which diverts your attention away from the plot. There's not much 'sci-fi bling' in Looper, instead you are greeted to brilliant writing and awesome dialogues. From the very first scene the plot manages to cling on to you and immerses you.<br/><br/>Don't be alarmed when I say its all story and less action, there's plenty of action sequences and rather meaty ones at that. Once again though these sequences invests more emotionally in you than just being set-piece moments and adrenaline rushes that you forget once you leave the movies. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's constant narration of the things he end up doing kept things slick like noir-pulp. His makeup to resemble Bruce Willis was totally uncalled for. It's not the Joseph we've seen in his recent flicks, literally! But you end up buying it anyway. And even with those layers of prosthetics and cosmetics you have to give it to Joseph to portray a believable young Bruce Willis. And about Bruce Willis, he had some good scenes as well as some mediocre ones which felt like he'd warped from his Die Hard days. Emily Blunt kinda stole some limelight from the male leads, her character was well written and arrayed with an abundance of emotions.<br/><br/>Another thing I loved is the comprehensible accounting of time travel and events linked to it. Usually when time travel is involved you need to rack up your brains (*cough* LOST *cough*) but here in Looper everything is explained as simple and pleasantly plausible. There are plot holes of course but none that's too tangible and never the ones breaking your discernment of the over-all plot. The loopholes in Looper have been covered up subtly and to some extent giving justifications to each and every time-travel jargon. It could be just lame and just some words strung together but that actually saves the causalities that arises from time travel.<br/><br/>Apart from all this Looper has some pacing issues towards the 3rd act. One moment I felt I was thrown in a time-jumping mob war and the next I was thrown amidst a supernatural-family-drama. An absence of an enjoyable soundtrack also takes away some brownie points.<br/><br/>Rian Johnson's signature style has been smeared all over Looper. A bit of 'Brothers Bloom' and 'Brick' could be seen throughout the movie. I found it stylish, cool and totally plot-oriented. Rian proves that a time-travel movie need not be convoluted nor ambiguous, or laid with brain-teasers that keeps you thinking after you leave the movie theater. Looper is quite an entertainer and one of the better made time-travel movies ever made, something you could watch and drive home without burdening your brain asking 'how come', 'why this' and 'why that.'"

","For starters I enjoy the type of movies that star Bruce Willis so my opinion is a little biased. That being said, the main reason I went to see this movie is because of the time travel aspect. This is a very complicated subject and I was very interesting as to how they where going to incorporate this and solve ""the problem"". <br/><br/>And it started out very good, the story was very plausible and the moral dilemma that comes with being a looper gave you enough to think about. Up until this point I really though this movie was going to be a ""9"" for sure. However Then it changed and the story became less and less plausible and the plot wasn't as strong as I would have liked.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS FROM HERE***<br/><br/>The point where it went wrong was when they introduced TK (telekinesis), This didn't add anything to the story. Of course they had to think of a way to make the ""rainmaker"" figure exceptional and very strong I personally just thought this just was not the way to go. It felt like they where blending two different stories into one.<br/><br/>second point was the plot, as I said the time travel subject is very complicated so if you start thinking about the plot you start to see the error because when he commits suicide in the past then his older self will never come to exist. This will then lead to him never meeting his older self which in turn will lead to him never being in the situation that he has to kill himself. And this would create a loop where still in 50% of the ""time"" the world is ruled by the ""rainmaker"". Personally I would have liked an ending that he would have killed ""cid"" and then just stood there for a few moments then cut to the other child (where he got caught by kid blue) and then see all kinds of metal items floating around that kid and fade to black.<br/><br/>In sum, a very intriguing movie, very good acting and the resemblance between Bruce Willis and his younger self was very striking. So if you don't over think/analyze every movie you watch you will be enjoying this movie a lot!"

","The WORST MOVIE! In some aspects I liked it but most of it was very bad. Here's why: they shoot numerous people and their guts fly to the walls and second they start killing small innocent children.. Full on nudity scenes... And it was said that it would be about time traveling. No, god no it wasn't. To be honest I was expecting a Inception-like movie but I was very wrong. Only reason why I didn't leave after half an hour was because I kept hoping that it would get better and that I would find out how it would end. I realize that I contradict myself a bit but involving small children made me almost walk out of the theater. As a person who watches Game of thrones and shows and movies that have lots of violence, I couldn't handle this movie. Only good things about this movie were the way they communicated through the old and the young self (the skin) and the child's skills, but still one of the most cruel and disgusting movies I have ever seen.

You end up rooting both for and against both the protagonist and the antagonist; that's a very difficult thing to pull off properly, and this succeeds.

","What is the perfect crime? I don't know if killing men sent from the future, and therefore unidentifiable, qualifies, but it's certainly close. Of course, if you should screw up somehow, those same people would know immediately. What then?<br/><br/>It's 2044, and while time travel has yet to be invented, those in the future use it to their advantage by sending individuals who threaten their business interests back to that time where they can be eliminated by men awaiting their arrival. The men who execute these unfortunate individuals are known as loopers. Joe Simmons (played by Joseph Gordon-Leavitt) is one such man. Simmons (Gordon- Leavitt) is in the employ of a mafia boss in Kansas City who he calls Abe (played by Jeff Daniels). Abe (Daniels) was sent back in time to manage the organization's hired guns as well as their other illicit operations as only someone from the future is uniquely equipped to do. When loopers have outlived their usefulness, they are sent back to be executed their younger self who receive payment in the form of gold rather than the customary silver. This is referred to as ""closing your loop"". In his spare time, Joe abuses drugs, maintains an intimate relationship with a showgirl named Suzie (played by Piper Perabo), frequents a club owned by his employer and is studying French to prepare for his eventual retirement in France. Things start going awry when Seth (Joe's friend and a fellow looper played by Paul Dano) is confronted with the task of closing his loop and fails. His superiors are more than a little displeased by this and so Seth goes to Joe, hoping his friend will hide him. Eventually, Seth is found, maimed, and his now disfigured older self is executed. This is after Seth and Joe both learn that a crime boss known only as The Rainmaker is behind the recent rash of closing loops. As Joe resumes his usual routine, he too is given the task of closing his loop when his older self (portrayed by Bruce Willis) appears before him. Joe's younger self cuts a message into his arm so that he can discuss the situation with his older self. Old Joe (Willis) confirms that The Rainmaker exists and is closing loops, in addition to killing the woman Joe would eventually marry. Both Joes are attacked by men working for their employer and flee, neither intending to do anything other than the task they set out to. Old Joe's being to kill The Rainmaker's younger self, young Joe's being to close his loop.<br/><br/>Obviously, this is a very complicated story. It's made even more so by characters I haven't mentioned yet. One of them played by the always talented Emily Blunt, the other by child actor and relative newcomer Pierce Gagnon. That said, I found it surprisingly good and highly entertaining. The complicated and paradoxical nature of sending someone back in time to be executed by their younger self as well as other questions about time travel are complicated and that is dealt with by a rather humorous line and then never brought up again. Thankfully. The story is gripping, the performances top-notch, and the conclusion leaves the audience wanting more and wondering what's next. This is a great film."
"estebangonzalez10","8","0","4","5 December 2012"," Well developed characters in a futuristic film
","¨ Time travel has not yet been invented. But thirty years from now, it will have been.¨ Looper is a fantastic sci-fi action film about time travel, that writer-director Rian Johnson manages really well by focusing more on the character development than the actual dilemma that may present itself with a subject like this. If you stop to think about the plot too much you might find some holes, but Johnson doesn't give you too much time to think about those issues, but rather presents several great action scenes mixed with dynamic characters to change the focus of the film. There is one scene where Bruce Willis's character talks to Joseph Gordon-Levitt and tells him: ¨I don't want to talk about time travel because if we start talking about it then we're going to be here all day talking about it, making diagrams with straws.¨ That is exactly what Johnson wants to avoid in a film like this. He presents the world he creates in such a way that we just have to enjoy it without questioning things. He doesn't want the viewer to debate if such a world is possible, but rather simply to play along with him in this futuristic world he has created. His main focus was on the characters and the action, and he did a superb job giving the characters a lot of depth. I really had no idea what direction Looper was heading at times, but I really enjoyed the originality of it. The performances were really great as well. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a young Bruce Willis to perfection, mimicking his mannerisms all too well. He really steals the show here, although the computer effects on his face to make him more Willis-like physically were a bit distracting for me.<br/><br/>In 2074 time machines will have been invented although there use will be illegal. They are used only by mobsters to get rid of the people they want eliminated. These mobsters send these people blindfolded thirty years back in the past (2044) where killers named ¨loopers¨ await for them to kill them. Although time machines haven't been invented in 2044 these loopers are hired by one of the mobsters from the future named Abe (Jeff Daniels) who has gone back to live in the past and assure the loopers do their job. The loopers also know that if the mob finds one of them in the future (2074) they will send them back and have them killed to close the loop. It is sort of like a retirement plan because the looper is guaranteed he will live for 30 years and will get paid really well. One of these loopers is Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who is young and always delivers despite being a junkie. He has a romantic relationship with Suzie (Piper Perabo), a hooker, and his best friend is also a looper, Seth (Paul Dano). When Seth isn't able to close the loop and kill his old self, Abe goes looking for him and kills him. Joe knows what he has to do when his old self is called, but fails to close the loop as well when old Joe (Bruce Willis) knocks him out. Thus the race begins to find his old self and kill him before Abe and his men find him. Old Joe on the other hand wants to find a key target who in the future will be responsible for the death of his loved one in order to prevent her loss. The entire plot becomes more and more complicated as we move on, because like Abe says ¨This time travel crap, just fries your brain like an egg, ¨ but it does make for one entertaining movie.<br/><br/>This was Rian Johnson's third feature film after his successful 2005 debut, Brick, and his follow up The Brothers Bloom. This is probably his most successful film considering the budget he had to work with, and he is making a name for himself by creating these original and character driven films. His stories are really interesting and despite all the action and futuristic scenes he also creates memorable characters. The child actor in this film, Pierce Gagnon, is also really remarkable. He was a delight to watch on screen. Emily Blunt also has an important role in the second half of the movie and delivers as always. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is perhaps one of the most underrated actors of our days. He is excellent in this film, and Bruce Willis well he is simply Bruce Willis, one of the best action stars of out time. The film starts out a bit slow with the introduction, but once Bruce Willis shows up the action begins and the characters begin to develop before our eyes (especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character). This is a unique and original film, and I recommend it.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"
"smerve2002","10","0","5","4 December 2012"," What is the right choice?
","I really enjoyed this movie. Let me start by saying that I did not for one second question any of the information that was presented to me I just accepted it for what it was. I felt like this helped me to understand the movie better and therefore enjoy it that much more.<br/><br/>*******Contains Spoilers************ For a movie that was about the future and time travel it was refreshingly low tech. Even the time travel device resembled an aqualung. The whole Looper occupation centers around killing people from 30 years in the future and disposing of them in the past. The problem then becomes the end of the Looper's career. Each Looper who has an older self that is living 30 years in the future has to ""close the loop"" by killing that older self when he is sent back into the past. This seems crazy, but these Loopers are given 30 years and a big pay day.<br/><br/>So obviously these 30 year older selves do not want to die. Bruce Willis (Older Joe)'s whole mission when he is taken to be sent back to the past becomes about killing the mob boss (the rainmaker) when he was a kid in the past. His wife gets accidentally shot when he is taken and then he overpowers his captors and goes back in time and overpowers his younger self and escapes.<br/><br/>Older Joe only knows that the Rainmaker can be one of three 5 year old kids that were born on the same day in the same hospital. He goes in search of them to kill them and younger Joe fights him for one of the kid's addresses which leads him to a farm with a single mother and her little boy. Younger Joe stays with the mother and the boy while Older Joe does successfully kill one of the other children (It is never shown and Bruce Willis breaks down afterwards letting you know that it was hard for him to do). Older Joe sets out for the second child on the list while Younger Joe is forming a relationship with the single mother and her little boy.<br/><br/>The second child happens to be the daughter of a dancer that younger Joe knows and older Joe is having an issue with needing to kill her. He goes in and is ready to do it only to realize that it is a trap set up by Younger Joe's employers. They take him in and Older Joe shoots everyone and everything in the whole place. Meanwhile one of Younger Joe's coworkers is at the farm looking for him and his older self. This is when everything gets crazy. Throughout the movie they have told us that about 10% of the population has a mutation which allows them to be telekinetic. The extent of this ability is that they can make quarters float. Apparently this boy can do more. When he gets upset he is able to kill people. He is unable to control his power and kills young Joe's coworker.<br/><br/>Old Joe now knows who the Rainmaker will be and comes to the farm to kill him. The mother is not going to let her son get killed and Older Joe is chasing them and shooting at them. Finally the child gets away and the Mom is standing there trying to protect him from Bruce Willis. Younger Joe comes running up and realizes that there is only one solution. If the Rainmaker would have been able to grow up with his mother then maybe he wouldn't be as evil in the future. He can't let old Joe kill the mother. He shoots himself and old Joe disappears.<br/><br/>The ending was very profound. You then realize that he made a choice. Was it the right choice? Who knows. It saved at least three innocent lives in the process. Bruce Willis' wife, the kid that was not the Rainmaker and the mother. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It really made me think and not about time travel but about humans and what drives them. I've never written a review before but this movie compelled me to do it."

","What happens in the future when the Mob wants to get rid of people? Well, they send them back in time of course. To a point in time where no one is looking for them. Standing in wait are these assassins named Loopers, who kill these time travelers on the spot and then incinerate the bodies. Of course, what happens when a future version of yourself is sent back and you must kill him, failing in the process? Well, now you're being hunted down while trying to set things right and kill yourself, I mean, your future self. Still with me? Because if you are, and you think that sounds cool, then you'll like the movie Looper.<br/><br/>In the film, Joseph Gordon-Levitt portrays a young Bruce Willis with eerie accuracy, in a large part thanks to some excellent prosthetic makeup. What's so enjoyable about this film though, is that it's just original. At every turn, writer/director Rian Johnson is turning your usual expectations for a sci-fi film on its head. The future is not full of flying cars and robots, but it's a more gritty, realistic idea, where only the rich have hover bikes, and the poor still drive wheeled vehicles. As well, things like telekinesis and time travel are treated as everyday things. There is some social commentary here, but that's not the real meat of Johnson's story. The real questions he proposes, is the age old question -- Can you change the future?<br/><br/>While Looper bogs down in it's latter half, as Gordon-Levitt finds himself holed up at a farm with a single mother and her child (who could give Damien from The Omen a run for his money in terms of creepiness), Johnson manages to hold the film together and deliver an emotional ending. So it isn't perfect, but Looper is one of the more daringly original sci-fi films in a long while. Featuring stellar action, good performances, and plenty of food for thought, Looper is a worthy sci-fi successor in the Kubrickian-fashion.<br/><br/>I give Looper an 8 out of 10!"

Not quite as occasionally a person will escape, and the ""Loopers"" own neck goes on the line then. I am normally excellent at guessing plots and endings, but this movie kept me going and guessing right up until the last 10 minutes-when I started to have pieces of the plot fall into place, as is intended obviously.

","On the face of it, Rian Johnson's thriller Looper, utilises many conventional visual signifiers of recent science fiction films, with a high concept idea at its centre. But unlike the many other dystopian future films, it doesn't get held back by the importance of the technology within the world it creates. Set in Kansas in 2044, the opening scene sees Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) standing alone in a wheat field with a blanket spread out a distance in front of him. Appearing instantaneously is a kneeling figure with his head covered in cloth, and Joe shoots. Like many other genre films, Looper has a reliance on narration from its main character, a necessity of complex narrative, but it is an important element, and one which further exacerbates Johnson's passion for film noir (as seen in his debut high school noir, Brick in 2005).<br/><br/>Thirty years in the future, time travel has been invented. For unexplained reasons, this technology has been outlawed, but is being used exclusively by crime syndicate's who are using people like Joe to assassinate people they send back in time. Joe, like the other loopers he works with are narcissistic, taking recreational drugs, simply living in the moment, with no apparent concern for the future, and particularly with the world they inhabit. A looper will eventually be retired, but once a looper is no longer required, this is known as closing the loop. What this involves is their future selves being sent back in time to be killed by his younger self. In a quirk of control, a being known as the Rainmaker, is attempting to put a stop to loopers altogether by closing all the loops. Panicking when confronted with the unclothed face of his future self (Bruce Willis), young Joe is knocked aside, and old Joe escapes the find the Rainmaker as a child, and stop the death of his future wife.<br/><br/>Whilst many other time travel films become often convoluted in their complexities of paradox, Looper manages to disregard the codes of science fiction paradoxicals and presents a refreshing layer of humanity. In a pivotal scene, when young and older Joe occupy the same time and space, they meet in their favourite diner - ordering the same meal - and older Joe complains at his younger self at his attitude towards life (I'm pretty sure we would all participate in this diatribe presented with the same context, to tell your younger self: ""You're a d**k""). Whilst the young Joe has no future outlook, future Joe has an image to cling to, specifically the woman who will eventually save his life. It's a scene fraught with tension and high chances of danger for the character(s), and one that has a bit of a poke at the concepts of time travel paradox. In fact, when quizzed about the possibility of changing the future by acting differently, old Joe bursts into anger, a character and a script knowingly telling the audience who will dissect time travel contradictions to essentially f**k off.<br/><br/>What ensues is a customary chase narrative, with the twist that Joe chases his older self - the younger is also being hunted by other loopers, as his inability to close the loop leans that he has to be eliminated. The hunt for the young Rainmaker leads to the farm of Sara (Emily Blunt) and her young son, Cid (Pierce Gagnon). The fact that young and old Joe share the same time/space, leads to a nice touch, where new experiences of the young Joe, reverberate in the memory of the elder. With this complex central concept, it would be easy for the script to become over elaborate, but Johnson keeps the plot simple, making it an incredibly satisfying narrative, that is intelligent, but does not over-intellectualise the themes.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt's performance is unsurpassed, he manages to possess the mannerisms of Willis without poor impersonation. Just one look of the face and his eyes and mouth (particularly) have this perfect essence of Willis. It's a big little film, that brings themes of addiction, paranoia, and the idea that in our youth, we inevitably make bad choices and often damage ourselves for in-the-moment selfishness. Johnson clearly has been influenced by Philip K. Dick, and even some of Blade Runner's (1982) visual tricks are utilised here. But whilst Dickian aesthetics dictate the overbearing corporation of government, Looper has a very human heart, which is illustrated in the relationship (new to old Joe) with the farmer and her son, and provides one of the most beautiful and convincing climax's in sci-fi cinema in some time. So therefore, Looper presents a very persuasive image of a future where society has collapsed and the highest paying job seems to be a hit-man, it also shows that even the most self centred of people, the types who would risk the lives of others for money (ahem), can be moved by the idea and realisation of humanistic beauty, and the innocence of love."

It will be absolutely impossible to kill anyone in 2074 due to advanced tracking/tagging technology, so they'll instead send their victims thirty years into the past for them to be killed on the spot in 2044 by the titular ""loopers"". These are people in 2044 that are aware of this mind-boggling scheme, and are hired as assassins by the syndicates in 2074. Sh*t starts hitting the fan when looper Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) sees his older self (Bruce Willis) being spawned in front of him and fails to kill him...<br/><br/>You probably already knew this movie involves time travel, even mimicking some elements seen in The Terminator at a certain point, but as Bruce Willis' and Jeff Daniels' characters so aptly mention, it doesn't want to linger on the specifics of it (and I will follow the movie's example in this review). It also doesn't try to overly explore its futuristic setting. The world is depicted as a dystopian high-tech/low-life place, without focusing too much on it.<br/><br/>All this means the movie offers no foolproof explanation for its own time travel logic, and you WILL be left with a lot of questions and theories that might just fry your brain. Writer-director Rian Johnson instead asks his viewers to bear with its logic, just like he did in a way with his quirky high school film noir Brick(2005). Your enjoyment of Looper will depend heavily on your willingness to do so.<br/><br/>On the other hand, this approach prevents the movie from being riddled with too much physics lingo and actually frees up screen time for plot and character development. This was clearly a thoughtful and deliberate choice by Rian Johnson, for which I sincerely wish to applaud him. In short, the ideas about time travel do form the premise of the film, but they are NOT what Looper is about. Instead, they are used as a tool in order to raise some interesting questions in regard to the main character Joe and the (differing) choices his younger and older self make. Old Joe will have experienced certain life-altering and character-changing events, while young Joe is obviously unaware of them or has no emotional connection to them. In this sense, the movie is a time-spanning character study of two film noir anti-heroes who are basically the same and yet simultaneously very different.<br/><br/>In other words, when Looper's end credits roll you will realize the story has gone in a completely different direction than the one it started out with. (I really can't go any deeper into this, as it would spoil a lot of the surprise for you.) In fact, the plot swings out into all kinds of unpredictable directions throughout the entire movie. This unwillingness to provide some form of ""easy"" narrative grip to the audience might make some very nervous indeed. Others will revel in its unpredictability and be mesmerized by its many surprising shifts. Again, your willingness to go with the flow will be decisive for your enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>Stylistically, Looper had more of a neo-noir than a futuristic cyberpunk vibe to it, at least that's how I experienced it. It's beautifully shot and for most of the time doesn't intend to distract from the film's content. It's certainly no case of style over substance. The movie's pacing is also more akin to a typical film noir, than to an action-packed science fiction blockbuster. There is certainly some great action, but it is used rather sparsely and only when it matters most.<br/><br/>The acting was very good overall and remains credible and convincing throughout. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is made to look like a younger version of Bruce Willis through the use of make-up prosthetics, expertly crafted by Kazuhiro Tsuji. It is never ever apparent Joseph is wearing any. It seems like the character is played by an actor we haven't seen before, but kind of looks like both Joseph and Bruce. It's never ridiculous and it never distracts. Joseph even manages to give his character a certain Bruce Willis vibe, which is then (almost uncannily) mirrored by The Bruce himself. It's a great duo of characters that don't seem to know how to behave to one another. Emily Blunt portrays a likable supporting character, convincingly shifting between ""I'ma whoop yo ass if you don't behave!"" to a sweet young mother acting out of a sense of responsibility and love.<br/><br/>However, one character literally made me smile from ear to ear at times because of his performance. Pierce Gagnon, who plays the absolutely intriguing and intelligent Cid, has to be one of the best child-actors I have ever witnessed on screen. He does so well, it actually sometimes feels as if his character is an adult trapped in an 8 year old's body. Whenever he stares into someone's eyes, you would swear he can pierce their soul and read their inner thoughts. I won't spoil anything, but know this reviewer got goosebumps several times because of the way this character is written AND performed. Really stunning stuff! <br/><br/>It's an original and refreshing movie with a premise that will make you think, and then without constantly shoving all sorts of (meta)physical mumbo-jumbo down your throat, but instead focusing on character, will lead into an ending that will make you feel. If you are willing to take its internal logic on time travel for granted, you will probably enjoy Looper.<br/><br/>8/10 !"

","Time travel conundrum action flick from writer/director Rian Johnson whose debut feature, BRICK, is one of the most super-hip, ultra-quirky and subversive modern noir detective flicks ever made. If Raymond Chandler had been a high school slacker in waiting in the 21st century, BRICK is something he would have written. Needless to say, I like it and rate it highly, and was the primary motivation in my wanting to watch this offering.<br/><br/>LOOPER is a bigger budgeted sci-fi thriller with some celebrity muscle in the cast (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt and Jeff Daniels) and some studio monetary polish shining the surface. The hook is that in the near future criminals from the more distant future are sent back in time to be executed by hit men called Loopers, thus all evidence of the killings are erased from that distant future time. Loopers are well paid for this service, but there comes a day of reckoning when the act of ""closing the loop"" may be visited upon them, involving their own future selves being sent back for the chop. Joe (Gordon-Levitt) is a Looper whose future self (Willis) is sent back but doesn't want to play ball and goes on the run. This leaves Joe with the prickly problem of having to find and kill his future self whilst evading capture by his fellow criminals. The narrative is further complicated when Joe meets young mother Sara (Blunt) and her son Cid on their isolated farm. Cid it seems has a big part to play in Joe's future destiny, but what, exactly? <br/><br/>LOOPER is fast-paced, thoughtful and well-executed. The paradoxes and complexities of time-travel theory are neatly glossed over and generally airbrushed out so they don't give the audience a distracting and perplexing headache. <br/><br/>The way in which Gordon-Levitt and Willis play the same character at different ages is masterfully handled through shared physical similarities, vocal inflexions and mannerisms and some pretty nifty acting and interplay from the two leads. This adds a great deal of credibility to the proceedings, helping to suspend disbelief significantly.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it is slick hokum, yet has a degree of heart and soul with a nice twist of sacrifice and redemption thrown in. Johnson is sure-footed in most of his moves here and at least delivers something a decent cut above the low-brow common-denominator. Oh, and Jeff Daniels scene steals like the clued-in pro he is â€“ always worth a look."

","This is a gripping thriller based on a future time-travel scenario. This complicated and intelligent movie was written and directed by Rian Johnson. Kudos to him, because he's really created a movie that has movie goers sitting on the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>Gorden-Levitt and Willis were well cast and played their roles believably like the good actors they are.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Johnson's vision of the future in 2044 and 2074. It seemed realistic to me (although why is the future always so bleak?) OK, maybe the movie was too violent at times. The hero of the movie is a hired killer and essentially we're shown one murder after the next. Lots of shootouts too. I can't say the violence was gratuitous since killing was what this movie was all about. If this kind of thing upsets you, I wouldn't see it.<br/><br/>There was one horrible scene in particular. However, it wasn't that this particular scene was gory, it was just that the implication of what was happening was horrific. Admittedly, it fit right into the plot.<br/><br/>I had no problem following the story, although it is a little complicated. There were a few minor plot problems. I think the movie might have been stronger by showing us in more detail what evil the Rainmaker causes in the future. It's still not clear to me why the Rainmaker was trying to close the loops. I think Joe could have used more character development.<br/><br/>Of course, very few time-travel stories are able to deal adequately with the inherent paradoxes and butterfly effects that make time travel logically impossible. This one barely tries. Indeed, it makes changing the past part of the story, as if the paradoxes don't exist.<br/><br/>But none of this ruined the movie for me."
"ksuyeon10","7","0","2","25 November 2012"," Good Film - Don't think about time travel too technically, what was meant to be will
","I enjoyed the movie. WHAT WAS MEANT TO BE WILL BE<br/><br/>Spoilersssssssssss<br/><br/>Let's start with clearing this up, Cid is not Joe and Joe is not Cid, I have seen people in this thread being confused about this. He just empathises with the kid and realises that he too, if he had a better childhood would not have grown up to be a looper. <br/><br/>It doesn't matter, once Joe is in the loop of being a looper, he was always going to get killed or kill himself anyway (maybe this was the conclusion that Joe the main character had; he does say in the movie that loopers are short sighted)<br/><br/>Also if you believe that things that are meant to happen will always happen, i.e. Joe was always going to be dead in 2077 or whatever year it was and Rainmaker is always alive in 2077, with superpowers (telekinetic powers)<br/><br/>1. THE NEW FUTURE Even where Cid does not grow up to be a rainmaker (i.e. in the unknown future, as in the ORIGINAL ending of the film where he lives happily with his mummy), the end result is that the loops are already closed (by Old Joe revenging on the Gat Men, and killing them all, thereby closing the loops himself), and also with Joe disappearing off the planet by the young Joe shooting himself. <br/><br/>2. THE ORIGINAL FUTURE THAT WAS In future where Cid did become the rainmaker. The Rainmaker closes the all the loops (including killing the Gat men). The young Joe kills the Old Joe and takes the gold. Because at this stage the young Joe is not too long sighted as he himself says and does not think a great deal about the future. <br/><br/>So the end result was always the same, in the year 2077 Old Joe is wiped out and so are the loopers whilst the Cid/Rainmaker lives."

","Before viewing this movie, I thought it was going to be about time travel. Don't get me wrong, the movie does contain time travel. But it isn't about time travel. I'm happy that it isn't about time travel, because if my expectations had been met then it would have been an 'okay' film. It's better than that.<br/><br/>The first forty or so minutes you might be sitting and wondering what's so great about this movie. The plot is only slightly original, the plot holes are big as they come and the characters aren't that interesting. But then slowly the pieces start to fall together and the real plot appears. Far more intricately woven and suspenseful then you would've imagined in the beginning. The story builds character, then completely destroys it as mixed emotions rule the scene. Without spoiling anything, a character you might have been rooting for becomes its antithesis. Something I haven't seen often in film.<br/><br/>As for the specifics, the rationale, the paradoxes that accompany the concept of time travel; Like a character later states, ""It isn't important."""
"phsamuel-work","8","0","3","22 November 2012"," Why so many negative reviews?
","I watched this one in a dollar movie theater. And I didn't plan to watch any particular movie. I did take a look of IMDb before watching it. The only thing I was aware of was that the user rating is quite good (7.9). But I have no idea what the movie is about before watching it.<br/><br/>Overall, I did enjoy the movie. One can say the plot is predictable. But really? Almost all Hollywood action movies are predictable if one puts it that way. At least I would say there are several possibilities that the movie can end. Of course, the current ending is one of them. But to say it is really predictable is kind of unfair, at least one cannot be sure if it should end this way. <br/><br/>Now. The thing really puzzles me is why the movie gets so many negative reviews. Even more puzzling is that the movie itself actually gets pretty high user rating. One conjecture I made is that many reviewers feel that they are physics experts and to them the time machine part is not ""logical"". A common complain is how the whole thing would have happened if Joe killed himself at the end. I am not sure those ""experts"" heard of parallel universes (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many- worlds_interpretation) and if they really care about accuracy interpretation regarding science, I'm not sure why they don't complain about the time machine in the first place. <br/><br/>I believe another source of negative reviews originates from the controversial part of kids getting killed. But come on, this movie is rated R. And I don't agree to some reviewers that the kids were killed for no reason. The motive of old Joe is totally reasonable and he did show remorse for his crimes. <br/><br/>In summary, I would argue that most negative reviews are biased not based on how entertaining the movie is but on how ""correct"" it is regarding ""science"" and ""morality"". If you care a lot about ""science"" and ""morality"" in a movie, please avoid this one at all cost. If you just want to watch an entertaining action movie that doesn't have many logical holes (definitely not more than the ""superhero"" movies), by all means please."

","Straight to the point, I had to pick a movie fast and escape the hassle of the family holidays. Currently still tapering down from too much soda and a heart attack of excessively buttered popcorn, this movie began to sink in deep. To reflect on the obvious in general with time travel, I was just relieved to see this was not another overly complicated Rated R version of Back to the Future.<br/><br/>In short this movie has something more than just your typical Action, Sci-Fi and Thriller, this one also has great Drama. I could literally feel the pain of their stories unfolding as they grasp at normalcy in a world born of misery. Overall, good movie, hope you enjoy it as much I did."

","I watched Looper with mediocre expectations and I wasn't disappointed. Looper does not meet the standards of a satisfying sci-fi movie. I know that Time-travel itself is an unexplainable phenomena and CANNOT exist,but i have seen movies like Back To The Future,explaining the concept in a better way. Well,the genre of the movie is action,so lets focus on the action. This movie does not meet the hopes one might have,for a Bruce Willis starring action movie(though,its pointless trying to set a bar ,when one has seen Die Hard,but one can hope). But apart from these,the movie DOES have its moments,that can make you think. Comparing to other science fictions-this movie is not Inception. But definitely better than garbages like In Time."

","This film was amazing in my opinion one of the best movies I've ever seen people complain at this for unoriginality which is untrue this is about as original as your going to get for these days. I thought the acting was terrific except for the rainmaker. The concept of an economically downfallen America and the time travel and the loppers and the drugs and time travel were awesome. Some movie mistakes a tiny bit flawed but this film in my opinion was better then most of the 2012 films I've seen this year. Now this film is one of the reasons why Joseph Gordon Levitt in my opinion a brilliant actor and maybe one day some Oscar nominations. This film was put together beautifully and for the people who think this film was all about Joe chasing Older Joey it's not because that plot is basically Cat and Mouse. This film is more than that Older Joe wants the younger Joe to go through his way of life. That's all I have to say and if you read this thank you for reading my first review."
"darkobogojevic","6","0","2","20 November 2012"," Time travel mash up!
","Well, one thing is for sure...this movie has one really original scenery and as surprise is very well executed!! I don't like time travel mash up, because if you change something insignificant in present day you can not even imagine how can that influence on future, and one movie can not calculate all possibility's in 120 min. But this time I must admit that Looper, almost hit the spot. One thing I really don't like in this movie is not well balanced pace...after pretty fast introduction and even faster plot, we are dropped in very slow and inconclusive scenes in the house at corn field, after what we experience culmination of slow and fast picture stream scenes, that's very confusing. Acting is average, action scenes OK and very innovative way to deliver time torture. All in all, little bit overrated, but very entertaining!"
"divinours","8","0","3","19 November 2012"," Time travel does not have to be overly complicated...
","A very intelligent and elegant movie. Some reviews here on IMDb say it lacks ambition or depth, that the motivations and rules behind time travel are not explained enough. I disagree. While the director could have chosen to deliberately obfuscate things (fairly easy to do when time travel is involved) to make the movie look 'deep', he focused on a tight storyline and convincing character development, letting your imagination fill in the details. This results in one of the rare time travel movies that is at the same time thought-provoking and easy to follow. Not a small feat in my opinion!<br/><br/>The actors are excellent (the little boy fits perfectly as the 'future-that-was' Rainmaker), and the relatively slow pace (compared to an action movie) gives them time to show it; it also lets the atmosphere sink in. The depiction of poverty and vagrancy-ridden 2044 is also rather convincing, although I have a hard time believing our current-day car models will still run in 30 years, even grafted with solar panels - I don't know whether this is deliberate or if the budget allocated to the sets was tight (probably the latter). No big deal though - the movie is much better than many million-dollar blockbusters with perfect sets.<br/><br/>My main gripe was with the ending; I did not find young Joe's final decision to be completely credible. He spent most of the movie fighting against his loop to protect his own future, and is turned a bit too quickly by his very recent bonding with the Rainmaker kid, and the possibility of letting the latter take the 'good track' (even if Joe's own childhood experience does provide some explanation).<br/><br/>All in all, a very enjoyable movie that I would heartily recommend."
"chaos-rampant","Null","0","2","18 November 2012"," Closed loops
","Below, I am going to provide a small list of films that explore karmic cycles in what I think is a powerful way.<br/><br/>This first. It has a few parts that intrigue. The parting wisdom is that you control your course through life, cause your own unhappiness, but you won't know that (deeply, clearly) until you 'meet' (see) your own self as it plots and machinates some destructive pattern. <br/><br/>This is presented in the garbled, always messy context of sci-fi time travel and the noise and furore of an action film, but by all likelihood meant in the Buddhist sense of karma and meditation, which is in its purest form -far from cloudy 'spiritual' fashions- the daily practice of purging yourself of your self.<br/><br/>Karma (from sanskrit, meaning 'action') is probably not what you think it is - it is not fate, but rather a description of the mechanism that produces what you perceive as fate. You do so, thread events around a self-centered narrative, because your self wants control of this life, we all do, it comes from the natural instinct for survival, this is in fact what happens each time you remember or plan ahead, you are trying to assert control of the narrative.<br/><br/>A few pointers here. You have here memory as traveling to the past, and as a loop, as wormholes in the fabric of normative reality. (frequently addressed in life as someone being 'lost in thought', phasing out his environment) <br/><br/>The Bruce Willis self caught in the memory-loop of trying to rewrite the story to serve the memory of a loved one. The Gordon-Levitt self who awakens to the destructive course of action by killing the self.<br/><br/>The damage this causes exemplified in the inner child with telekinetic powers (we all in a way have them, we know them as intuition, it's how films, abstract air on a screen can move us), in his blind , violent reaction to stimuli.<br/><br/>The film is throwaway, I'm sorry to say. As said before, the generic context adds close to nothing, it's just a load of stuff the filmmakers have to explain. The problem arises when simultaneously trying to move forward different parts of a profoundly inane story while ironing out kinks in those few metaphors, which forbids an agile vision of what it wants to do. Complexity is not intelligence, folks.<br/><br/>More sophisticated films on the subject? Chaos recommends:<br/><br/>The Soviet silent By the Law. (about misdeed tearing up the very fabric of the earth)<br/><br/>The Postman Always Rings Twice, Out of the Past, Detour, in fact most good film noir is a deep inspection of hallucinative fates and possible authors behind the world. <br/><br/>Rear Window > Blowup > Cache. (on mental images ambivalently shaping the narrative)<br/><br/>Most anything by Resnais, but definitely Je t'aime, Je t'aime. (on memory and endless returns, copied into Eternal Sunshine) <br/><br/>The American Friend. Solyaris. The Hourglass Sanatorium."

That is the looping of past and the future. But also you cannot predict the end of the movie. This makes it very interesting. Mostly I can guess the endings but it was not possible for that movie. By the way kinesthesis is the sauce of the story and it is used as best as it can be. At the end it has a great story unpredictable ending and interesting fiction. The cast is also good.

","A bright, complex challenge to some of time travel's longest-running traps, backed by a seriously curvy, dazzling plot. Although some holes can't be avoided, (that goes with the territory) Looper is able to lean on its high-concept premise for support during such moments and effectively gloss them over. Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, no strangers to sci-fi action sagas, seem perfectly at-home in this oddly familiar future setting, and though they're hounded by a violent gang of darkly-clad killers, the film's darkest role alternates repeatedly between its two leading players. There's a lot to celebrate in the details here, from the oil crusted, not-so-distant future (which, admirably, looks an awful lot like the present) to the strict rules and regulations of the core concept, and for a short while the film seems content to toy with the spoils of its own ingenuity. Of course, there's also a time for leaving such trivialities behind, and Looper doesn't back away from it. When push comes to shove, it smartly explores the depth and dimensionality of its cast before ultimately pursuing an unexpected, yet appropriate, final destination. Smart, savvy and convincing, my one qualm is that it's occasionally too passive in pressing the accelerator. Worthy of (and rewarding to) multiple viewings."

","I must say, at first I thought that the ""Looper"" is overrated. It was hard to believe that someone can create a new good Sci-Fi movie about time traveling. But I was wrong. The movie has a unique story in Sci-Fi genre and it is very well written. Not only that, it plays with your mind and shows different pieces of the movie in a way that forces you to think about it for hours after you come out of the theater.<br/><br/>Although I enjoyed watching the ""Looper"" and story line was strong, I have some critics on how Rian Johnson directed the movie. There are some weakness in the move that could have been easily taken care of. For example the vehicles (flying bikes) was not really matched to the time of the story. The guns that are being used was very old guns from 60s or 70s. The only high-tech equipment that you can see in the movie is the cell-phone!"
"Manal1987","8","0","3","10 November 2012"," A Sci-fi Triumph.
","I'm not a big fan of sci-fi movies, not to mention those about time- traveling.<br/><br/>The above mentioned statement was definitely refuted by Looper! Reasons?! <br/><br/>One: The movie is not made for action buffs. There's a story -a good one- that controls the plot line and hinders it from becoming a mundane action movie. So you won't stumble upon forced scenes of ""visually stunning"" crashes and explosions, and others of unnecessary shooting and chasing. Everything in the story is taken care of, even the tiniest details (that would make you want to watch the movie more than once). Despite the futuristic setting the possible mind-fuzzing plot holes (but isn't it the case with all time-traveling movies?!), Looper is a story about the ""human""; egoism that turns into selflessness, and anger that turns into understanding.<br/><br/>Two: Joseph Gordon-Levitt is unbelievable! Had I known that that kiddo from ""3rd Rock from the Sun"" would turn into such an unquestionable talent, I wouldn't have missed an episode. Levitt plays the role of Joe, a hit-man who kills criminals sent from the future until, one day, he realizes that his target is his future self (played by Bruce Willis). Levitt managed to brilliantly imitate Willis's voice tone and facial expressions without losing his powerful presence in the process. And it's not sex appeal I'm talking about here! I'm talking about a pure talent that matures right before our eyes with each new movie. As Bruce Willis... well, he was just Bruce Willis! Levitt, Emily Blunt, Noah Segan, and the 6-year-old Pierce Gagnon are the real stars of the movie.<br/><br/>Three: Aided by an out-of-this-world cinematography, Rian Johonson did a great job directing the film. His slow-motioned shots, character close- ups, flashbacks and mise-en-scene accentuate the human core of the story, backgrounding everything else.<br/><br/>Watch it."

","""Time travel has not yet been invented. But in 30 years it will have been."" With these lines spoken through voice-over by Joseph Gordon- Levitt, we take a thrilling journey to 2044 Kansas where we met Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a ""looper"" whose job is eliminate people from the future so they can erase their existence. One clause of the ""looper"" contract is that each looper must eliminate his future self (known as your ""loop"") in order to end his contract with the organization. The most part of this clause is to NEVER let your loop run. When Joe's loop (Bruce Willis) escapes his clutches, Joe's life is now in jeopardy for his bosses will stop at nothing to get Joe and his loop back. <br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance as the self-absorbent, selfish Joe is one of remarkable talent. The first real flawed character that the young actor has ever played is riveting to watch as his attitude changes throughout the film from a selfish snob to a soon humbled young man after encountering the brave, strong-willed Sara (Emily Blunt) and her son. Levitt's achievement to play a killer who learns what his life really means and what it has done to him excels all past roles the youthful actor has taken. Simply spectacular."

","One of those examples of how the choice of a specific director is essential for a screenplay's success. Truth is, if ""Looper"" had gone to someone else's hands, it could have probably lost itself in the dust of the genre's usual clichés. <br/><br/>In a time where Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" still slams its weight, Rian Johnson delivers us an alternative story, refreshing from what has been done lately. It's not just about the meticulous plot where all the pieces seem to fit almost naturally, it's the easiness of how it flows to the screen, in a way that immediately introduces the viewer into the movie's rhythm. Even if it's a piece of sci-fi action, Johnson prefers to focus himself on the storytelling instead of blasting around with visual effects. This is really clear in its style, specially in ""Brick"", his modern homage to the ""cinéma noir"", and where he collects all the points - that's why the film shines more than recent others. <br/><br/>Other good aspects: the beautiful photography and the numerous ""slow-motion"" plans, always without forcing too much. Joseph Gordon-Levitt show us once again why he is one of the most interesting actors around, as he can, quite so hauntingly, appropriate Bruce Willis' way of acting and put it into his own performance, in order to enhance the two of them's similarity. <br/><br/>Strange mixing between Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" and Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report"". Possibly a subtle ""clin d'oeil"" to these masters in a delicious sci-fi essay - 8/10."

Furthermore he got a fake Willis snout. Distracting. Oh yeah. Distracting. JGL can probably play himself (as JGL of some sort) and I am sure that will pass off as a Young Willis just fine in Loopey.

","""Looper"" is a movie that convinces from several points of view.<br/><br/>It has a rather intriguing science-fiction story line that is quite well used in here and not over-employed. This means that the film is still down to earth and doesn't include too many technical details or other stuff. If you want this kind of film, you should watch Star Trek.<br/><br/>The film includes a lot of moral questioning and provokes many philosophical thoughts of what is right and wrong.<br/><br/>The story itself is not too complicated but filled with tension to keep you on the edge of your seat until the end.<br/><br/>The acting is very solid in this film and especially Bruce Willis plays one of his best roles in the last years and not only the superficial die hard guy with sick humour that he usually incarnates.<br/><br/>The film is filled with a few great action scenes and a couple of stunning special effects but they are very decently used as the main focus remains on the acting and the story.<br/><br/>The movie has also a few shocking moments you wouldn't expect that give especially the character incarnated by Bruce Willis a lot of depth.<br/><br/>Overall, there is not much wrong with this movie but there are still a couple of things I've disliked about it.<br/><br/>As this movie is mostly free from the usual stereotypes, it is sad that one stereotype had to be included in this which is a love story towards the second half of the film that adds nothing at all to the main plot and seems only to be included to follow the norms and please a larger crowd.<br/><br/>Another critical point is the ending that is quite controversial. Some people adored it, others literally hated it. I disliked the ending but not that much because of its content but because it comes very abrupt. The tension raises continuously in the film and when you fell ready for a stunning showdown, the whole thing gets suddenly aborted which left me a little bit frustrated after all. I'm somewhat hoping for a director's cut or additional scenes when this will be released on DVD and BluRay but I'm not sure if this may ever happen.<br/><br/>In the end, the positive points are though way more numerous than the negative aspects of this film. The movie is not a masterpiece but clearly one of the best cinema flicks of the year. This one here is definitely worth a watch for anyone who likes Hollywood cinema.<br/><br/>By the way, it's a quite refreshing idea to see Bruce Willis' character retiring from his dangerous job to get into the big city life of Shanghai where he ends up with a tough Chinese lady that somewhat transmits an irresistible charm. These few scenes made me laugh a lot and had a very sympathetic touch in my humble opinion."
"jafar-iqbal","7","0","2","4 November 2012"," This is a good movie, not a great movie
","Luckily, I managed to get into the cinemas for Looper before the run ended. A month since it released, and it still seems to be going strong. That privilege is reserved not for the big movies, but the big movies. And, ever since it got onto the radar, Rian Johnson's thriller was always referred to as one of those big movies. So I finally got my tickets and took my seat, and prepared for the big movie.<br/><br/>By now, you've probably seen the movie and know what it's about. But if you don't, Looper is a time-travel thriller set in the not-so-distant future. In this present, hit men – known as loopers – assassinate men who have been transported back from the future by underworld gangsters. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is one of those loopers, but everything starts to go wrong when his next hit is himself (Bruce Willis).<br/><br/>The plot is absolutely brilliant, it really is. Original, inventive, and provides so much scope for some amazing storytelling. Add to that a stellar cast, which also includes Jeff Daniels and Emma Blunt, and you've got a recipe for success. All the publicity about Looper seemed to suggest that this was going to be this generation's The Matrix.<br/><br/>So it really annoys me that I was so disappointed. I wanted to love this movie, I wanted to be blown away the way I was when I watched Inception for the first time. Perhaps it was my fault for placing too much faith in it but, whatever it was, the movie disappointed me.<br/><br/>I think that the movie just did not live up to the potential that amazing concept could offer. The idea of a man needing to kill his own future self is extremely exciting, but the novelty wore off very quickly. That's partly due to the fact that, like we see so often nowadays, Bruce Willis just wasn't that great. For the film to work, both Levitt and Willis needed to deliver, and the veteran messed up. As a result, I ended up not believing in what he was trying to do.<br/><br/>Levitt, on the other hand, is really good. He's fast becoming one of my favourite actors, and he gives another strong performance. A lot was made about his prosthetic face, and rightfully so. His whole complexion is different and, while he doesn't really look like Bruce Willis, he does a decent job of acting like him. Emma Blunt, too, is excellent, and is probably the real emotional heart of the film (even more so than the two men).<br/><br/>But it's probably her character that antagonised me the most. She's an integral part of the second half of the movie, where the entire plot is turned on its head. It should have been a brilliant twist; instead, I was left scratching my head a little and wondering what happened to my time travel thriller. The new plot twist plays out very predictably, and ends even more predictably.<br/><br/>There is still a lot to like about Looper; it's a great view on what our future could be like, and there are some brilliant performances from the supporting cast (Paul Dano and Garret Dillahunt come to mind). Action scenes, even some of the more emotional scenes, are good. This is still a good movie, don't get me wrong. What disappoints me is that the film takes too many twists and turns, with the badly-executed twists cancelling out the better ones; leaving you with a somewhat anticlimactic end.<br/><br/>Rian Johnson is still a director to pay attention to, and Looper is still a watchable movie. Maybe the hype killed it for me. Maybe if I watch it again in a year's time, my opinion will have changed. But for now, I write this as a disappointed film fan."

","They say the greatest art is the art that evokes the strongest response, either love or hate, and this movie does that. <br/><br/>It seems some people were disappointed that the movie wasn't more about time travel, that the trailers were misleading. For me having a smart, unpredictable movie is something really rare in Hollywood currently that this movie stands out even more. So many rehashes of superhero movies with the exact same plot, it's nice to see something original. This is a movie you can have a discussion about afterward because it provokes questions (something I really think great movies do).<br/><br/>Every detail was done well, the music was incredible, acting was stellar across the board, Emily Blunt was truly amazing. The futuristic setting was one the most believable I've seen, very similar to our world but on steroids. <br/><br/>Go see it, a couple of times."

Of course, the actors are known and good (starting with Bruce Willis, Joseph Gordon- Levitt, Emily Blunt; although the most brilliant performances were Pierce Gagnon as Cid and Paul Dano as Seth), but the topics of time traveling, telekinesis and loyalty and greed among hit men have been exploited widely before. The pace is also uneven, at times too fast, then too slow (especially in the country house) and full of reasoning on human and past issues. <br/><br/>Thus, Looper is okay for killing 1h 45 minutes, but do not expect a state-of-the-art or conceptional experience."

","Looper is set in a future where time travel is possible, but illegal, and used by the mob to take care of hits. The mob sends targets 30 years into the past to be killed by hit men, or loopers, like Joe (Joseph Gordon Levitt). But for Joe, someday the mob will send his future self (Bruce Willis) back to the past in order to ""retire"" him, and therefore close the loop. Will Joe have to kill himself?<br/><br/>The Good:I am not a fan of Joseph Gordon Levitt (just a personal thing), but he does a good job, as he always seems to do. They also do an OK job in altering his appearance just slightly enough so he resembles a younger Bruce Willis who plays the future Joe, but as someone who remembers Bruce Willis when he was younger it didn't fully work. I give an A for effort. As the story continues though Levitt did get a little of Willis' speaking tones and patterns well in a few scenes. The overall feel and look of the movie is also well done. It is a gritty future, not one of those super CGI cartoon ones that most Sci-Fi movies try to portray.<br/><br/>The paradox and consequences also can be a hard sell if not done right or over thought. This movie does a decent job with it, and it sets up some good twists. Overall the imaginative story of the movie is worth watching, and makes it much more of a drama than a action film like most time travel films are, but there is some good action.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis also does a decent job, which has been few and far between in recent movies for him. Not as good as he was in ""12 Monkeys,"" but still good, and this is a much different movie than that one.<br/><br/>The Bad: I am always disappointed when a movie uses a British actor or actress in a role where an American southern drawl is required. Emily Blunt is a beautiful woman and a good actress, but knowing she has a sexy British accent, makes her a hard sell. Also why did they give her that hair color? Stick to the darker colors, there is no need to down play her hotness. The writing was good as far as the Sci-Fi aspects and story are concerned but dialog wise it was nothing stunning and spotty good and bad throughout. Lastly, I had the biggest twist figured out before the filmmakers even gave their first big hint.<br/><br/>Over all I give it 8 out of 10. It's got an imaginative, if not fully original story and a somewhat gritty appeal. The twist in the end was not .""Oh, my!"" great but it was good enough.<br/><br/>Like my reviews, hate em?

","Memories that fade and disappear, feelings that rise out of nothingness. Disconnected parts of ourself. Overwhelmed by the narcotic power of movies; the essence of flickering lights. Falling down the rabbit hole, chasing your own shadow; a you you can no longer understand. Frame by frame our mind constructs a coherent whole with a singular inevitable direction, meaning. Escape your fate, feel it changing; the exhilaration of freedom, the danger of it.<br/><br/>The above fragments are what came to me after watching this film.<br/><br/>Looper is an action movie with a sci-fi plot revolving around hit men who kill people sent back from the future. The concept here is that one of these hit men has to kill an older version of himself and once he knows this he can alter the future and the past by knowing what is going to happen to him in the future.<br/><br/>Obviously, Looper refers to the 'Back to the Future' trilogy but here it becomes a metaphor for life and the soul; something almost spiritualistic.<br/><br/>It's pointless to cite all the cinematic references in Looper, the point of the film is to draw on a whole language of cinema and through the mastery of the language renew it.<br/><br/>Looper is a mind-blowing experience - unless you get too fussy about plot logic and miss the point - it's the kind of rare movie that can call itself an instant classic. The camera-work, the acting, the music, the editing, the script; everything is brilliant.<br/><br/>This is a truly original and surprising work which functions on several levels: a genre film, an essay on artistic influence and memory, a cubist work on redemption and remorse...<br/><br/>At heart Looper is a fantasy; a heroic-fantasy and an artistic puzzle. Inception and Source Code have both recently covered similar territory with flawed or cursed characters immersed in a dream-logic and written as a narcotic form of mythomania.<br/><br/>As an experience Looper is thrilling, unsettling and sublime. It is also great fun; Hugo Cabret was also a similar experience although on the surface very different, Hugo Cabret dealt with a time machine from the past; the lost films of Méliès and their destruction by the coming of a new future. In Looper the future threatens the past with its self-awareness, is this a comment on the future of cinema? If Looper is the future of cinema then we're all safe. <br/><br/>At the end of Kurosawa's Rashomon a baby is left in the hands of a stranger, the question posed was 'can we trust our fellow man?' Looper poses a similar question but goes further and asks, 'can we trust ourselves?' can we believe in ourselves, even if we know we've made mistakes in the past can we change things for the better, make a better future, is there hope for humanity? This philosophical ambition and weight elevates the nature of the film itself and makes the difference between pure entertainment and art."

","Well, 2012 certainly provided a breath of fresh air when it came to sci-fi actioners. First, Dredd 3D, and now, Looper.<br/><br/>Wonderfully directed, acted and written, Looper, to me, did what Inception achieved a few years back : combine exhilarating action, engaging sci-fi (and at times, it almost becomes ""horror"", in some regards), and a solid script.<br/><br/>The structure of the film is definitely one of its strong points, allowing a complex and multifaceted story to unfold without getting too confusing at any point. From the vintage intro/title sequence to the slick montage where you see several decades in Joe's life go by in a few minutes, you know you're in for a appealing ride. Juggling with several stories, subplots, and characters, Looper always comes up with something unexpected, whether it's a plot twist, a bloody action sequence or an intense confrontation between two protagonists...who happen to be the same person.<br/><br/>Another interesting aspect, which is subtle but is brought through a few key moments, is the clash of generations. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Lewitt) and old Joe (Bruce Willis) each have respective back stories (or future stories) and values that they try to preserve, despite being the same character.<br/><br/>In terms of visuals, Steve Yedlin's photography is polished yet has a certain vintage edge to it. While the city is depicted as chaotic and dangerous, they opted for flamboyant, nineties' style colors rather than the usual, gritty ""blueish filter"" with reduced color saturation. And it serves it well...the sequences in the cornfields and the surrounding area look gorgeous and, at the end of the day, serve the ever-evolving script very well in avoiding an overly-gritty or dramatic visual tone that would differ from the real intentions of this film. The direction is stellar as well, thanks to Rian Johnson and Bob Ducsay (editing) for making the whole experience so dynamic and fluid, given the complexity of the story they had to tell.. Performances from Bruce Willis, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Emily Blunt and Pierce Gagnon are absolutely flawless.<br/><br/>The film's pace does slow down a tad bit at the mid-point. However, it doesn't last very long and it gives the viewer the chance to better understand some of the subplots. When the pace shifts back, it's quite frantic. I thought the ending was really satisfying and avoided all possible clichés. <br/><br/>In an immersive depiction of a near future, Looper is a slick blend of classic confrontation and sci-fi movie elements, deployed through the puzzling time mechanics of its refreshing script. <br/><br/>Must-see for any action and sci-fi fan.<br/><br/>(3) <br/><br/>Scoring system: (1)Masterpiece (2)Remarkable (3)Very Good (4)Good (5)Average (6)Bad (7)Awful"

","One thing I must say right off the bat is that ""Looper"" is definitely not predictable. I literally didn't know what to expect from one moment to the next. I liked the performances of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis and especially Emily Blunt as a gun-toting, no-nonsense mother of a paranormally gifted child who could hold the key to the future. Levitt inhabits the same time as Blunt and works as an unusual hit-man for the mob. Willis is Levitt thirty years in the future, living in China and happily married at least until things start to go wrong. As with all time travel movies this one has its share of paradoxes endemic to the genre but it shouldn't hurt anyone's enjoyment of the film. ""Looper"" isn't great science fiction but it's pretty good and I can recommend it as a good piece of escapist entertainment."

","The crime lords of the future have discovered a new method of eliminating their victims. Time travel, although banned in that future, is used to send someone back by 30 years where a hired assassin shoots him at the designated place and time. These assassins are 'Loopers' and their job pays them a lot of silver bars. Occasionally, the mob will decide to close the loop in order to secure itself, which means that the Looper will be sent his future self as a target. Sometimes, the shock of seeing his future self is enough to distract the Looper and before he knows it, he has lost his target and now the mob has a bounty on his head.<br/><br/>Joe (joseph Gordon Levitt) is one such Looper whose future self refuses to get shot upon arrival on the present day. With the closure of his loop in jeopardy, Joe makes a run for it to explore the possibilities of himself and his future self to co-exist at the same time. He finds shelter in a farmhouse where Sara and her son Sid live. Older Joe (Bruce Willis) lost his wife to the attacking mob men who were directed by the Rainmaker. He manages to escape to the intriguing time and place in front of his Looper self in the past. While his escape puts the lives of both the Joes in jeopardy, they are individually determined to survive and find a way to co-exist in the same period. But older Joe's vengeful plan is to seek out the child who will grow up to be the Rainmaker, the one responsible for his wife's death and prevent the tragedy by killing him. Both the Joes are at the crossroads of this plot while the threat of the mob finding them is ever lurking. <br/><br/>Bruce Willis has been in similar shoes before. Intriguing stories and calmly aggressive characters are not new to him and he pulls off being Joe quite comfortably. Although, we would have preferred to see more of him in Looper. That's also because Joseph Gordon-Levitt is not a convincing lead actor. His calmness more often tends to portray boredom. His range of emotions, stature, dialogue delivery fall short of what it needs to be of a leading man; especially when his older self is Bruce Willis. That perhaps is the most disappointing feature of Looper. Emily Blunt as Sara, does a fine job of depicting varied emotions, appears protective as well as aggressive with an aura of being vulnerable at the same time. She also does a great job with her country accent that certainly de-glamorizes her. <br/><br/>From kinetic powers to time travel, director Rian Johnson adds scientific elements to make the plot even more intriguing than it already was. The shocking revelation at the end isn't completely unexpected but yet leaves us reeling for the conclusion. Avoiding dramatic and lengthy character focused scenes, Johnson sticks to the screenplay that just keeps the story moving on to the next chapter However, there are parts when we haven't seen older Joe for almost 30 mins while his focus on young Joe and Sara's relationship does seem to drag. A little more of Bruce Willis' older Joe would've added some powerful acting and dialogue to an otherwise dull and weak performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He failed to impress in the shoes of Commissioner Gordon's chosen aide in 'The Dark Knight Rises' and now, Looper. It is yet, an intriguing watch and an interesting take on time travel's utility. It questions the sympathetic human mind on one hand with the desire to save your loved one on the other. When an inevitable future that will turn bad is being made in front of you, how can you change its direction? The Looper will have to take a decisive shot. <br/><br/><ul><li>7.63 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"

Showing people that what they thought is wrong or the truth is not about what they thought in the final, became a popular method in Hollywood since then, which is launched successfully in some of the films with solid structures, ornamented with smart screenplays which were logical and unpredictable. The Sixth Sense was an unsuccessful example with regards to logical issues, because the main character did not comprehend for a sufficiently long time that he's dead even he interacted with people long enough who did not even see or hear him once. However The Sixth Sense was a huge success not because it's fully rational but its power of evoking astonishment.<br/><br/>Looper is i think another unsuccessful example of films full of illogical events, though it's not promising a puzzling final scene. One might list dozens of unreasonable scenes which we witnessed while watching the movie and flush out.<br/><br/>But how can we say that reason is the only factor for viewers to judge a movie? In nearly all of the action movies, we see the actors jumping, falling, running, fighting like a supernatural creatures. They see,hear, think everything, shoot every enemy at once with precision, they get wounded but never die! Sometimes, they rob a bank or kill on their own tens of guys right in the city center but never get caught or shot.

","Hollywood is known for its original premises and smart plots especially in the sci-fi genre. Looper is clearly not one of them. An intriguing setting is put to waste by a nonsensical plot that takes too long getting to a rather underwhelming result. Plain and simple..avoid Looper in this week's movie watch list. I know its a sci-fi movie and gems like Inception and Minority Report come to mind but put them aside. Looper is not even a patch on them. <br/><br/>Looper starts off well. The movie has quite an odd title but you get to understand exactly why its so, quite early in the movie. The rather unique premise is aided by some no-nonsense explaining within the first few scenes of the movie by the protagonist narrating in voice-over. So far..so very good. But that's just it. That's where it ends. Its as if after this even the director was scratching his head – okay so now what. Where do I take it from here..and I doubt he got any good answers. <br/><br/>After that, the movie takes you on a roller coaster ride tonowhere and by the end of it all you are just desperate to see the ending credits. The only somewhat saving grace, comes rather late in the movie and even that is pretty underwhelming, considering what you've already endured <br/><br/>As for the performances, well those are pretty decent. Joseph Gordon Levitt looks funny (I guess that's required for his character) but delivers well. Bruce Willis is in a strange role and doesn't have much to do. Kids have a lot to do in this movie and one particular kid is rather impressive. Emily Blunt also does justice to her role – no complaints there. <br/><br/>I, for one, am scratching my head on how the established reviewing fraternity have given this movie a generous 4 stars. Perhaps they didn't understand the plot or maybe they understood it a little too well – either way I was rather dejected with what was offered. I fail to see how this could be seen as brilliant and thought-provoking. Its original and creative yes but then so were Wanted, Jumper and the like..we all know how those turned out. <br/><br/>So don't get swayed by all the critical acclaim. As I was reading somewhere its been a long time since a good sci-fi movie with a decent plot came out. As soon as they saw Looper they've jumped to the conclusion that this is it.

","Joseph really looks like Bruce.<br/><br/>It is not just the achievement of make up artist, but also his ability of imitation.<br/><br/>Joseph is really a fantastic actor.<br/><br/>Bruce is not had make-up and he did not seem to imitate Joseph in obvious way, but he also seemed to try to imitate Joseph a little bit.<br/><br/>In the scene Bruce holds a wife in the bed, smiling to her, I thought he incredibly looked like Josph. His way of smiling is a little bit more naive than he usually does in other movies and that was just the same smile as that of Joseph.<br/><br/>The story itself is so so to me. It was really exciting first, but after Joseph arrived at the firm, it gradually got boring.<br/><br/>Still, the idea was new and interesting. and as I said above, acting and make-up were amazing.<br/><br/>So, in total it was good."
"nikhil_taneja","9","0","2","27 October 2012"," Looper review from the future!
","It's the year 2044. No, I mean, literally it's the year 2044 right now. While writing his review of Looper, my naive but good-intentioned past self secretly hoped that his future self (which is my current self, at the moment) would write this review from the future. Time travel wasn't invented back in 2012, but after aliens took over Earth in 2034 because the humans tried filming the 30th edition of Roadies on Mars, they introduced all these cool things like time travel, cloning, artificial intelligence, and err weekly anal probes. (Don't worry, the aliens aren't all that bad – they look more or less like Adam Sandler, and they proved to us humans that they mean well by banishing Arnab Goswami to Venus). So, here I am!<br/><br/>Everything's going great in 2044, Hollywood wise – after Leonardo Di Caprio shifted base to Mars because there were no more great directors left to work with, Joseph Gordon-Levitt firmly took over as Hollywood's biggest star. In fact, after Looper became a worldwide hit, director Rian Johnson became really famous too – and his recent gritty reboot of Robin Also Rises was both critically acclaimed and an inter-galactic hit. Of course, his success was helped when Christopher Nolan decided to give up the conventional way of making movies to start a live show where he'd inception movies into people's minds directly.<br/><br/>Levitt in a still from the film. AP As for Bruce Willis, he recently starred with his son and grandson (none of them being Ashton Kutcher) in Dying Hard Over and Over Again, aka Die Hard 31.0. So yes, that's a yippee-ki-yay for you, fan boys: no one's been able to dethrone Willis yet! Liam Neeson did come close in the 10s, but Taken 7, where he kidnaps himself, proved to be his undoing.<br/><br/>But enough on the state of affairs – let's talk about Looper. The movie recently celebrated its 30th anniversary and saw a re-re-re-re-re- release in 14D (in which basically Bruce Willis' hologram comes out of the screen and punches you in the face every now and then) and even all these years later, it remains one of the most genuinely futuristic, intelligent, unique and original movies of this century!<br/><br/>For those who missed it when it released in 2012, here's the lowdown: Looper is set in 2044, where mafia hit men called Loopers assassinate people sent to them from 2074. Sometimes, they are also sent their own future selves, and it's necessary to kill them to ""close your loop"", or else, because of the complexity of the space-time continuum, things could get really strange and the world could blow up in your face or something to that effect.<br/><br/>Joe (Joseph-Gordonn Levitt) makes exactly the same mistake – when his future self (Bruce Willis) is sent to him to be disposed of, he lets him escape. And in the thrilling and unpredictable plot twists that follow, the world almost blows up in his face or something to that effect.<br/><br/>One of the biggest reasons that Looper works so convincingly was that it presents a complex but refreshingly original idea in the simplest manner, but not in one that insults the viewer's intelligence in any way (even though human intelligence in your time was like a quarter of what we have now, FYI).<br/><br/>The story does not deal so much with what would happen to the present if future Joe (Willis) stayed alive in the present, but the fact that it is really important for present Joe (Levitt) to kill him because future Joe has traveled back in time to do something horrible (I'm going to let you find out what that was). And more than the traditional science- fiction riddle, it is the moral implication of what future Joe wants to accomplish that makes the plot so gripping and terribly entertaining, which is quite a major achievement for a sci-fi film.<br/><br/>To use a cliché (because cliché's have still not gone out of fashion in 2044), the film's true hero is the script and after his awesome but largely unknown debut with 2005's indie college noir flick, Brick, writer-director Rian Johnson proves with Looper, why he deserves to play with the big boys.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis do some of their best work in Looper, especially keeping in mind the tremendous effort the actors took to look, talk, act and behave exactly like each other's past and future selves, respectively. But yes, as much as I fan boy-worship Levitt, I have to admit that he still can't kick butt like Willis. And as history (aka your future) proves, no one can!<br/><br/>So there – I've laid out all past, present and (your) future evidence to convince you to watch the movie. You don't need to be a sci-fi buff to love Looper, you just need to be a fan of great storytelling, although the sci-fi, action, comedy, suspense and horror can only help! Watch the movie right away, if possible, to get bragging rights to your friends that you saw it first – because this is all that people will be talking about for quite some time into the future.<br/><br/>And just in the interest of social service, here are some tips to help you have a good future: Keep the towels handy, and learn Mandarin. And oh, if you live in Mumbai, buy a few auto-rickshaws.<br/><br/><ul><li>Nikhil Taneja (Firstpost.com) www.twitter.com/tanejamainhoon</li></ul><br/><br/>For more reviews: http://www.firstpost.com/author/nikhil"

","It was about time, finally I see a movie that in a few years I can call it ""classic"".

About the actors, of course everyone was amazing on their roles.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been spectacular this year, first The Dark Knight Rises and now Looper, in few years he will get even better and show us what young actors can do. Bruce Willis, no words, is performance was extraordinary and he shows us that he is still not old enough to stop his career. Emily Blunt getting good and better, movie to movie, wonderful actress. Paul Dano, Noah Segan, Piper Perabo, Jeff Daniels and forward must say that was the first movie I saw with their performances and I may say that I wish I would have seen more because their all incredible.<br/><br/>Resuming, Rian Johnson can't stop doing films because he has the gift that many directors don't have, inspiration.<br/><br/>10/10"

"finnlife1","8","0","2","27 October 2012"," Very enjoyable, impeccable acting, interesting storyline.
","Alright today i saw Looper, i have been wanting to be seeing it for some time, straight up i will tell you it's a great film, definitely worth a watch unless you're one of those people that hates anything that isn't exactly like real life, that's what a lot of negativity for the film is for, forget about the world, get into the world of the movie you are watching, who gives a darn if time travel is ridiculous? In our world it is, but in the world of the film it is not. Transformers doesn't get picked on for being unrealistic, neither does The Terminator, Spiderman, Superman, anything like that, so this film should not be picked on for those reasons either.<br/><br/>Where to start? Well i'll outline the plot without spoiling it, a looper is a person who kills people from 30 years in the future so as to remove them from existence, in Loopers Joseph Gordon Levitt is given a job to kill his future self who is played by Bruce Willis, this is an interesting concept in itself which makes more sense when you watch the film, through the use of tight directing and techniques this will become apparent to you.<br/><br/>Looper went too great lengths to make sure the plot was tight and lacking inconsistencies/holes, everything made sense in the film and it wasn't a hard film to follow, that's not to say it didn't make me think after-wards, smaller details within the film were also kept track of, they didn't seem to forget any details at all, the film also seemed real, guns were nowhere near as accurate as Hollywood makes them out to be in a shoot-out, even the hero made plenty of stuff ups which i liked, it made the action sequences more real, not simply the enemies having bad aim and the main Character just being perfect with a gun.<br/><br/>Technical details aside the plot was brilliant, plenty of twists and turns, not jarring, but enough to keep you interested and making it hard to guess exactly what's going to happen, a few times in the movie i thought i knew what was going to happen and i turned out wrong, there were some false trails put into the movie to try and put you off-track and have you guessing at the wrong possibilities, thinking back the story arc was a bit strange in the direction it ultimately took and the ending was not what i was expecting, nobody was expecting, the whole cinema was quiet when it ended which was saying a lot considering half of the cinema was full of teenagers. Despite having said this at the the same time i appreciate that the story was changing direction because some sections of the film did drag on a few minutes longer than i would have liked. The acting? Now this was one of the films very strong points, Joseph Gordon Levitt is a damn fine actor, he will be as mentioned by many, a star. He plays a cocky young killer, he nails it 100% and picks up a whole bunch of Willis mannerisms which most definitely make a difference in making JGL seem like a younger Bruce Willis, coupled with great direction you see plenty of close-ups capturing those minute facial expressions which mean so much more than even large obvious expressions, a slight shift of the eyes change JGL from a cocky young killer to a man worried about his mortality. As always Willis is good playing his usual role so i don't think i need to go there. Emily Blunt, She played her role in the film well, so well she invoked in me the frustrations that other characters in the film undoubtedly felt.<br/><br/>By the way if you're worried about not understanding the story, don't worry, the characters are distinctive and easy to remember and the plot isn't made to be confusing like films such as Inception. but it will make you think. Go see the film, but don't be one of those guys, by that i mean ""This film sucked! I mean time travel in 30 years? The mob running cities? Killing your older self? That's stupid."""
"markgorman","8","0","2","26 October 2012"," Sliding Doors with Guns.
","Let's get this straight. Looper is not, as many say, ""the Matrix of the 21st Century"" it's ""Sliding Doors with Guns."".<br/><br/>It's a clever attempt to play with the concept of 'what might have been' on a very grand scale (although, interestingly, not, as I was expecting, on a mind boggling scale).<br/><br/>It's a big movie but it's not one that, had it failed, would bring the studio to its knees and I kind of liked that. Clocking in at $30,000 ain't really that big a deal.<br/><br/>It's set in 2047 in a now ragged USA with China having taken ascendancy in the world. I liked the fact that director and writer Rian Johnson (Brick) doesn't turn it into Blade Runner but adds a few neat sci-fi tricks (like flying motorbikes). Loopers are ""disposal men"" of their future selves who are sent back from 2077 for, well disposal,. They are called Loopers because the film is all about time loops. 2044's Loopers are disposed of 30 years hence (and they know it) by themselves hence ""Closing the Loop"", but occasionally it goes wrong such as here where Joe (our Hero played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has to close the loop on himself (Old Joe played by Bruce Willis). But it all goes Pete Tong and so we now have two Joe's on the go.<br/><br/>Young Cid (a remarkable performance by 5 year old Pierce Gagnon) has Telekinetic powers and a temper that makes Linda Blair look merely snippy in The Exorcist. He's the son of love interest (Sara) - played well by Emily Blunt) and he appears to be the key to the loops.<br/><br/>I could go on but won't because there's a lot of detail to consume and there's 300 odd reviews here that will tell you all you need to know about the detail.<br/><br/>Suffice to say it all pans out cleverly; the various loops are closed in perhaps unexpected ways and we are left with a movie that is clever, well acted, slick and genuinely original.<br/><br/>It's a definite recommendation. 8/10."
"jake-law123","8","0","2","25 October 2012"," Best film of 2012.
","Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon Levitt join forces and tackle the sci-fi genre after Inception and Die Hard. Very interesting story mixed with sci-fi action, along with Bruce Willis's humor and Levitt's charm. So far, the most interesting film of 2012. Not too far ahead of The Dark Knight Rises, which to be honest was kind of disappointing, but still good. This film takes us on something not yet seen.<br/><br/>In the year 2074, outlawed time traveling will be used by the mafia to send people they want dead back to the year 2044, where they are killed by hired assassins called ""loopers"". They do this for the mafia until their older selves are sent back and are killed by them, called ""closing the loop"". Joseph Gordon Levitt, a looper who is very happy with his job, encounters his old self, (Bruce Willis) who gets the drop on him, causing him to go on a hunt in order to close his loop.<br/><br/>Some may call it another typical time travel story, but I disagree completely. I think it brings a fresh intake on sci-fi action. Doesn't get very confusing like most time traveling films, and manages to keep you interested with the story and characters all the way. You even stay connected with Bruce Willis as the antagonist, which is hard to do.<br/><br/>Film, (unlike others) doesn't get carried away with CGI and go full blown in your face visuals. It stays par and only uses visuals when it absolutely needs to. Manages to keep the story interesting, even when things calm down. I stayed interested every second. Not a moment of the film seemed slow or out of place. Some might fine the time traveling making no sense, but that's if you think about it too much. So ignore that and you got a heck of a ride.<br/><br/>This film is one of the first decent sci-fi films that have been released in a while. Great story, great characters, and a great cast. Willis and Levitt make a great pair together. Definitely worth watching. Better the second time for sure."

","2012 was a year set to be jam-packed with highly-anticipated releases, such as The Hunger Games, The Avengers (or Avengers Assemble), The Dark Knight Rises and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, to name but a few. However, for me, surprisingly it was a smaller, less anticipated project which caught my eye.<br/><br/>A fan of The Matrix and Inception (two of the most complex and impressively woven films I've ever seen), this interesting take on the future of our planet had me hooked from the first teaser trailer. An impressive cast, trustworthy director and an intriguing plot is what first comes to mind.<br/><br/>Let me tell you, I was most certainly not disappointed. The incredibly clever writer/director of Rian Johnson does a perfect job of setting the scene in the first half an hour or so, surprisingly keeping the fast pace and tension throughout the entire film. Joseph-Gordon Levitt and Bruce Willis do a magnificent job as the joint main characters and are complemented by Emily Blunt, who yet again proves herself to be a rising star, not just in Hollywood but the film industry in general.<br/><br/>The film's intertwining script is delightful. Each scene maps into the next with fluidity not seen for a long time in film making. The plot twists and turns (for which there are many, I might add, although I won't give anything away) hit hard when they are revealed. <br/><br/>Looper proved to me that you don't need high anticipation or an enormous budget to produce a fantastic film. Where ever you may be in the world, however remote or however busy, make sure to get to see this film as soon as you can. Because it all really boils down to the overall message of the film: how far would you go to protect your future?"

","the movie is good in many ways. the script is original. acting is adequate. i enjoyed the move, it is a well planned, paced, fiction movie. i always loved science fiction movies. by the way, Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors. however, he hasn't been done anything worth to talk about since ""live free or die hard"" in 2007. he takes small roles in undistinguished movies for ""his pension bonus"" i guess. looper can be called as ""Back of Bruce"". Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance could be better, or any other actor could be thought instead of him. Pierce Gagnon,5 year old actor was shining. this boy will do great things in the future."
"tedari","7","0","2","23 October 2012"," Missing an act
","If we are to understand that all movies that follow the Hollywood formula are split into three acts then Looper is missing an act. I'm not saying that there should be an investigation into a missing act, I am merely pointing out that as strong as Act 1 and 3 were, the second act was poor. <br/><br/>The beginning was good, and so was the end, but the middle just seemed to be confused and shaky, much like this review. <br/><br/>The story that takes place in the second act doesn't really fit with the rest of the story. I don't want to go into too much because I want to write a review for a change without pressing the spoiler button. <br/><br/>The movie is watch-able, but I just feel as though I was short changed on such a promising idea. This could have been a top time travel story; however, it settled for mediocre. Sorry Looper, but 7 is generous seeing as you robbed me of 33.3333 % of a film."
"Ryan_MYeah","9","0","2","23 October 2012"," It's hard to find movies as original as this one. You've never seen one like this before.
","""This time travel crap just fries your brain like an egg"", quips Jeff Daniels in Looper, the latest movie from modern film-noir favorite Rian Johnson. This marks the third movie for Johnson, director of the 2005 cult classic Brick, and the forgotten The Brothers Bloom from 2008. Looper had a lot of hype leading up to its release. It was the opening film of the Toronto International Film Festival, received enthusiastic word of mouth, and the three main stars even hailed it as the best movie they've ever done. If you want to talk about ORIGINAL screenplays, then Looper's well worth your time. It's hard to find movies as original as this one.<br/><br/>The year is 2044. Time Travel will be invented, and outlawed in 30 years, used only in secret by mob bosses. It is very difficult to kill a person in that day due to such advanced tracking technologies. To work around this, the mob sends these targets back in time (in a way faintly reminiscent of The Terminator) to be murdered and disposed of by trained assassins known as Loopers. One of these assassins is Joe (Played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt). An ace at his job, he collects his payments of silver bars for a job well done, stocking it up to move out of the country. When the Looper's services are no longer needed, their future selves are sent back to be eliminated by their past selves, a process called ""closing the loop"". However, a moment's hesitation causes Joe to fail killing his older self (Played by Bruce Willis), who is dead set on exterminating a mob boss as a child to stop a tragedy in his own life from happening.<br/><br/>Johnson clearly takes influences and methods of various legendary Science-Fiction's (Similar to the style of Quentin Tarantino), but weaves them all into a fantastic whole that totally feels its own. Aside from just sci-fi, Johnson also mixes in his usual neo-noir flair, and the scope of spaghetti westerns. All of his characters are nothing short of brilliant, and especially through his directorial style (with outstanding editing by Bob Ducsay), the movie shines bright.<br/><br/>Johnson particularly does well to showcase the various themes, one in particular of mankind's common quest, and even futile efforts to ""change the future"". It really places an emphasis on the importance of choice, and the long term consequences of it. In the rift between times, one bad decision could be doomed to repeat itself in a vicious, never ending cycle. That's one of several heavy ideas, and Johnson relishes in provoking the mind with them all in a way that almost makes Inception look like child's play in the process.<br/><br/>Of course, the characters would probably be nothing without the complete dedication they deserved, and the kind of dedication their actors delivered, and then some. Bruce Willis hasn't been this good in years, feeling less like his usual John McClain, and more akin to his emotional performance in the underrated Unbreakable. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (fresh off The Dark Knight Rises) is the perfect match and adversary for Willis, and not merely because his appearance is so uncanny for a younger version of him. Part of what sells the illusion of this movie is how much the two are alike in their mannerisms, but feel like polar opposites in their personal motivations.<br/><br/>If you want a real standout, look no further than Emily Blunt, whose character, Sara, is a single mother living on a farm, and totally prepared to protect her family. Willis and Levitt did their roles well, but Blunt deserves extra credit for how hard it must have been to properly play this character. Sara is a stern and tough soul, and a loving and understanding one at that. At the same time, there's this vulnerability in her, like an uncertainty and terror welling up inside, despite how committed she is to her duties. Blunt may not be the flashiest aspect of Looper, but she is without doubt the best.<br/><br/>Overall, Looper is impressive, a must see for any fan of science-fiction. Still, I want to avoid giving it my highest rating until seeing it again. It's a hard movie to really nail down. In fact, in trying to formulate my thoughts, this one review took me nearly two hours to finish. Looper is a movie that needs time and contemplation for one to let it soak in. The food for thought it leaves you with can be overwhelming to think over, but that's what makes it such a rewarding experience. If you want something that'll challenge the mind, and may even have more in store on multiple viewings, this is a perfect choice for you. You've never seen one like this before.<br/><br/>****1/2 / *****"
"sharrison12","9","0","3","22 October 2012"," Clever concept, solid script, awesome special effects, fantastic characters
","It is rare to find a film so rich in so many qualities. This film is most certainly not your average sci-fi doctor who crap. This is obviously a very well thought through, well written film which a lot of effort has been put into. <br/><br/>Despite the time travel idea being highly confusing at times and sometimes does not even fit, it is very well laid out and explained, giving the most normally-confused-by-the-time-travel- stuff viewer an easy way to follow it. One flaw I did notice however is the fact that the the time travel idea does not always consistent, for example when Old Joe tells his younger self that his future is to turn out the same way his own way, despite the fact that Old Joe would have been in a different position to his younger self when he was that age (if that makes sense). This is only due to the fact that the writers had to work around certain things for the end result to be clever and thought provoking.<br/><br/>Despite the main theme of the film revolving around time-travel, the main essence of the film comes from the relationship between the certain characters, and how those relationships affect the ongoing ones around them. The strong acting supports these characters and especially a strong performance from a boy who plays a very sinister and almost terrifying child, since you are told who he is to become in the future, and you can picture who he is to be by the strong powers and emotions he possesses.<br/><br/>Besides the concept and characters, the main feature of the film you fill pick up on is the stunning visuals and the intense violence. <br/><br/>This film is possibly one of the best I have ever seen. A must see and will certainly give you a contrast to trash which has been on this year (so far)."
"GibsonExplorer1976","7","0","3","21 October 2012"," A very good action movie with a premise that makes little sense
","I really enjoyed this movie. I was interested right from the beginning and it kept up for most of the film, (except the ending, which was a little too melodramatic), but there were a few things that hindered 'Looper'.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of information given to the audience without allowing them time to figure things out by themselves, and Looper does do exactly that for the first fifteen minutes through voice over. I understand that casual action film-lovers do not always enjoy thinking while watching movies, but giving the audience the opportunity to work out just what a 'Looper' is and what 'closing your loop means' by reading expressions on character's faces and listening to them talk to each other about these things would have sat better with me.<br/><br/>Despite the premise having a number of holes, it was nothing that ruined the plot. Instead of wading down in working out exactly how time-travel works (as Bruce Willis' character succinctly puts: 'We would be here all day making diagrams with straws'), the film focuses on a great story. I found the tension slowly rising throughout most of the film and there were a number of interesting surprises that kept this film separated from other recent sci-fi action flicks. The idea of a telekinetic 'virus' infecting a small percentage of the population is not simply there to strengthen the near-future society, but instead plays a pivotal role in the plot towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, things did get a bit too melodramatic near the end. I was emotionally invested in the well-developed characters for the first three quarters of the film, so I don't really understand why the writers felt the need to write a pretty drawn out 'touchy' scene that actually decreased my sympathy for what was going on.<br/><br/>Despite the ending, I thought this was a very good sci-fi movie"
"steven-carter","6","0","2","21 October 2012"," Hard on the outside, soft on the inside
","Saw this last night. Surprisingly violent but also thought provoking. Much darker than The Matrix (a film with which it has been compared). Not in the same league stylistically, but grittier, more visceral.<br/><br/>I wouldn't take the sci-fi time travel stuff too seriously. It is a conceit to examine the idea of nature versus nurture, how love and insight (or the lack of it) can influence the direction of our lives.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis should be commended for looking age directly in the face and dealing with it head on.<br/><br/>There were some great little twists and riffs on the time travel theme - the idea that physical or mental alterations to the younger looper ripple through the older looper - very nice.<br/><br/>However, the story isn't as original as people are saying. This film bears more than a passing resemblance to a short story by Jerome Bixby called ""It's a Good Life"" (a short story that also appeared in the movie adaptation of The Twilight Zone in 1983)."
"mithil293","9","0","3","21 October 2012"," Looper is one unique thrilling piece
","One look at the trailer was all it needed for me to know that 3 months on I will be witnessing some majorly spectacular motions on the screen. Like they say, I was psyched up about it, even went to voluntary promotion of the movie by badgering my friends before they were all awed by the trailer. I would recommend anybody interested to check out the trailer first.<br/><br/>The story transpires between the time frame of 30 years, not really. Joe Simmons is a looper, a guy who kills humans sent from future(approx 30yrs) by the mafia or other criminal organisations as it's believed that it's impossible to kill someone secretly in the future. By doing their work they are liable to hefty bounty in silver plates. Then comes a day in the life of a looper when unknowingly he kills his old self sent from the future, later evident by the gold bounty and the acknowledgment that he has 30 years more to live from that exact date. The problem occurs when the system goes haywire and Joe Simmons older self escapes his death in the hands of his younger one.<br/><br/>When I walked out of the theater still grasping titbit's of the plot, I got a call from a friend. When I mentioned him the movie he asked me if it is as exerting as Inception. Such presupposing questions are normal if one has watched the trailer or has read a lot into the hype. The first half whiz by elucidating the plot and the world at the present date. Writer blends creativity and innovation in such a unconventional manner that sometimes one is intrigued by what he is seeing. The cars running on solar panels, motorbikes hovering or the various gadgetry that carves the look of the movie. These things augments the movie experience to another level, but mind you they are just the sidekick to the main element – story and it's screenplay. I realised myself deeply engrossed when my friend was tugging my hand for something he missed. It was irony the way Joe Simmons present and future character fought for their own needs,to save their own life. Second half is very much ups the tempo just when you think that the story is heading where it not suppose to be. There is not much rumour in the movie but it more than thrives on it's unique concept and it's amazing performances. The music is aptly well synced with the situation and unnecessary use of background score is negated.<br/><br/>I couldn't stop smiling when Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing the younger JS sits opposite Bruce Willis playing the older JS in a coffee shop acting out the same signature Willis expressions. Although the makeup does add to the effect, but Levitt simply owns the movie simply for the way he emulates another guy with such perfections. For Bruce, this is for him Die Hard at a smaller scale. Although serious most of the time, he adds that little charm and humour to the movie. Emily Blunt playing Sara is does her part very well and most of her scenes in the second half are very enjoyable. I am not revealing much but the way Pierce Gagnon acts out the kid is ridiculously amazing. Director Rian Johnson is new name to me but his movies are not. He needs maximum praise for writing and directing such good and enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>It's a must watch for the guys bored with regular cinema, even without the story it's different and unique for the way it's handled. For the guys who fear of inceptio-nia, don't worry it you just need to have good functioning average brain in the right place to watch this, nothing more."

","OK to sum up: this movie is the Blade runner meets 12 monkeys meet scanners meets minority report meets the omen. Yes, the ideas are borrowed but they are so nicely connected and put into a nice piece of work. the story is so well told that I have to say that director did excellent stuff here. The actors are good enough to make story believable. The script is well written. good twists and smart line ups. The world where the story happens is so believable and live, that you are soaked into the story five minutes after films starts. all in all: easily one of the best movies this year.

","Looper is thought-provoking, original, entertaining, action-packed, funny, intelligent & well-made movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is terrific as usual with the makeup most of his face to make himself look like Bruce Willis physically, toning down his voice and mannerisms to Bruce Willis as well. Bruce Willis is great, he's back in action once again (he's having himself a good year with this, Moonrise Kingdom & The Expendables 2). Jeff Daniels (reunited with both Gordon-Levitt & Johnson the director) is terrific in his small role. Emily Blunt (who is one of the best working young actresses today) gives the best performance of the cast as a vigilante mother who lives in a farm with her ""gifted"" son.<br/><br/>Rian Johnson is definitely a director to look out for after this, The Brothers Bloom & Brick under his belt, very talented guy. Nathan Johnson's score is worth-mentioning. Looper is now one of my top 5 favorite films of the year. Fantastic stuff."

","Writer/director Rian Johnson's third feature (""Brick,"" ""The Brothers Bloom"") is another mashup, of sorts, in a season full of genre hybrids. On the face of it, ""Looper"" brands itself as a time travel tale smack dab in the classic science fiction tradition of films like ""The Butterfly Effect"" (in which Ashton Kutcher goes back to the past to change the present), ""The Jacket"" (in which Adrien Brody goes into the future to change the present), and ""Donnie Darko"" (in which Jake Gyllenhaal, well, we're never quite sure where he goes or why, but he looks good doing it). Of course, there's the iconic (and quite dark for its era) ""The Time Machine"" and the (much lighter) ""Back to the Future"" franchise, both of which send the protagonists forward or backward in time to escape an unexciting and, possibly, dangerous present.<br/><br/>""Looper's"" premise (laid out in the opening narration) is that time travel has been, or will be, invented at some point in the future. Bad guys can, thus, be sent back in time to be exterminated in the present, thereby eliminating them before they can get to be the bad guys they are to become. ""Loopers"" are the assassins in the present (well, 2044) who've been given the lucrative assignment of preemptively eliminating these to-be-bad guys (from 2074, follow?). As it always has been, and always will be, ethics are trumped by dollars. It's a tough job but somebody has to do it. As the movie opens, we see ""Joe"" (the always-dependable Joseph Gordon-Levitt) as the somebody in the process of carrying out this mission as future felons pop into view, only to be blown away seconds later in the middle of a cornfield. A Field of Nightmares, as it were. But Bruce Willis appears and, as he is wont to do, throws a major monkey wrench into the production and the story barrels off from there.<br/><br/>Rian Johnson's project benefits from a stellar cast, including Emily Blunt, Paul Dano. Noah Segan, Piper Perabo, and Jeff Daniels, all turning in intriguing performances that confound at every turn. Look for little Pierce Gagnon as Cid, a Damien/Omen meets Haley Joel Osment's ""I see dead people"" Cole as a sweet but creepy kid who steals every scene he's in, no easy task in this sea of veteran talent.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Steve Yedlin (who also shot Johnson's previous features) maintains a consistent style throughout, making the present day settings somewhat indistinguishable from the future, adding to the delightful confusion of the audience. The music is never obtrusive as composer Nathan Johnson's original score serves the narrative without being showy. The pace is on par with the typical thriller, as editor Bob Ducsay ensures that the action flows at a steady rate without extended periods of introspection, as the filmmakers foil every attempt on the viewer's part to calculate the machinations and solve the riddles appearing on screen.<br/><br/>Sci-fi morphs into action-adventure and psychological thriller as the viewer attempts to fit the puzzle pieces together. The identity of many of the characters, present and future, is a mystery -- and, as it turns out, that's really the point of it. There's plenty of eye candy, to be sure, but figuring out who's who and what they're really doing occupies most of the brain throughout ""Looper."" Johnson had a choice here. One option was to make the narrative so confounding that, a la ""Inception,"" people would be scratching their heads afterward, at the risk of them becoming disgusted at what they view as self-indulgence on the part of the filmmakers. The other option was to push the movie ever so slightly in that direction but, with a bit of humor and well placed tongue-in-cheek, not take itself so seriously as to annoy the audience into writing it off as a lost two hours (and it is long at 118 minutes). ""Looper"" walks a fine line between the two but, in the end, is more feast than famine, putting it in the category of films that must be seen again to be appreciated."
"knowyourmovie","7","0","1","16 October 2012"," ""Inception"" For Dummies
","""Looper"" is one of those a tad above average movies with intriguing and original concept, poorly developed into the uneven, unpolished, and confusing story. <br/><br/>Sadly, ""Looper"" could have become so much more than that if the writer- director Rian Johnson succeeded in developing the interesting, promising concept into a coherent, believable story.<br/><br/>Instead, ""Looper"" is a ""mixed bag"" with the few original, truly powerful moments diluted by the unnecessary, stereotypical, distasteful, hardly believable, unmotivated, or weakly implemented scenes.<br/><br/>In addition to lacking depth, ""awe"" factor, and good taste, ""Looper"", with all its mind-bending time travels and difficult moral dilemmas, is surprisingly not thought-provoking.<br/><br/>The artificially simplified reality of ""Looper"" is closer to a simulated reality of a computer game, than to the endlessly complex reality of human live. The movie deceptively pretends to be more than it actually is, to go deeper than it indeed goes, and as a result leaves the viewers underwhelmed and unsatisfied.<br/><br/>On a positive side, ""Looper"" has earned my respect by not having a cheesy Hollywood-style happy ending as opposed to somewhat similar ""SourceCode"".<br/><br/>Paying proper attention to the Joe's (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) character development has definitely strengthened the story as well. Joe's transformation was happening subtly and gradually, as a result of trials and soul searching and because of that it felt realistic enough.<br/><br/>At the same time, we cannot but notice that the transformation Joe was going through should have affected his older version and perhaps should have made his future self, Old Joe (Bruce Willis), more humane. That not happening somewhat undermined the very foundation of the movie. <br/><br/>Let me be clear: I realize that someone determined to find plot holes will probably find them in every movie on the face of the Earth. However, while some plot holes can be quickly forgiven, the others cannot be overlooked that easily.<br/><br/>As a good illustration, consider the life-changing event supposedly experienced by Old Joe. According to the movie, he, a cold-blooded killer and a hopeless drug addict at the time, fatefully meets a fascinating woman who somehow (!) falls in love with him. That relationship transforms Joe, cleanses him, cures his drug addiction, and overall makes him a new person. All that magic, I might add, happens in probably less than a minute of the screen time. We are basically told to simply accept it as a given.<br/><br/>Only couple minutes later, the supposedly ""transformed"" Old Joe methodically murders two innocent little kids and is close to slaughtering the third one. I do not even take into account those unfortunate adults who just happened to be in Old Joe's way during his horribly shocking killing spree.<br/><br/>As it turns out, one of the kids was destined to become the ""Rainmaker"" – a mysteriously powerful and bloodthirsty criminal boss, responsible for the deaths of many people including Old Joe's wife. Because of the time travel paradox, if Joe kills the ""Rainmaker"" as a kid, there will be no adult ""Rainmaker"" in the future and Old Joe's wife as well as many other people will still be alive.<br/><br/>To me, it is one or the other. Either the cold-hearted drug-addicted Old Joe was indeed transformed, cleansed and cured by his wonderful relationship with the mysterious woman (which already sounds suspiciously cheesy, but is still acceptable), or he was not transformed at all. If the former, his killing spree is completely implausible, if the latter the ""love story"" contradicts the rest of the movie and most of the Old Joe's actions lose their motivation.<br/><br/>The acting was generally good, but not great. Bruce Willis played his usual self quite comfortably and confidently. While his performance generally met our expectations, there was nothing truly significant about it.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt was tasked with playing young Bruce Willis. The impersonation sort of worked, but not to the complete satisfaction, ending up being a little forced and unnatural. The overall impression was mixed: Joseph Gordon-Levitt was much more interesting in the scenes where he was not trying to pretend that he was a young Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt was good in a quite stereotypical role of Sara – a ""tough"" chick, who of course just happens to be kind, loving, and sensitive inside. Sara is a strong, lonely woman desperately trying to redeem her dark past by singlehandedly raising Cid, her early developed but emotionally fragile son, on a remote farm in the middle of nowhere.<br/><br/>And that brings us to the true star of the movie - Pierce Gagnon who quite impressively played Cid. Surrounded by the far better known and far more experienced actors, Pierce Gagnon still managed to steal every scene he was in. Every second the young actor was on the screen, he was perfectly believable, both as a regular ten year old boy, and as a mysterious carrier of the supernatural telekinetic abilities.<br/><br/>A good actor Jeff Daniels was stuck with playing local criminal boss Abe - a badly written, clichéd character that does not do justice to his talent. Abe is one of those accessory, disposable characters, whose sole purpose is to serve as plot devices, supporting the clumsy story twists. To Jeff Daniels' credit, he manages to make the most of his obscure character and is fun to watch in the movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Looper"" is a typical case of a poor cinematic implementation of an interesting, but underdeveloped concept with unrealized potential. The movie can be recommended as one-time entertainment only – slightly above average, but overrated, shallow, sometimes distasteful, and overall easily forgettable.<br/><br/>knowyourmovie.blogspot.com"
"Amadio","4","0","2","16 October 2012"," Looper - surprisingly tedious SF
","I like SF, I like Bruce Willis (5 Monkeys was greatly enjoyed), and I can suspend disbelief for time-travel. So how come Looper was so tedious? (Seriously, I nearly left the cinema). I had been looking forward to this film for months. The whole concept of going back in time to be assassinated, and one day the assassin having to kill himself (they seemed to be all men) is most interesting. What is not interesting is long slow shots of people we are supposed to feel for and be interested in when they are most unenjoyable and cruel, heartless people. I didn't expect The Matrix, I did want some tension, not just people bursting in and shooting. For farmhouse tension see Inglorious Basterds, not the lame Looper. For SF gun-play, The Matrix, not cutaway 'oh-look-at-the dead-bodies' Looper (certificate 15 effect?). Even the characters in The Island were more approachable and easier to feel for. Most of the time, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, holds the Willis smirk - yet in this film, Willis never does! It could have been anyone instead of BW. The bad guys are neither menacing nor effective , mostly canon fodder, and the portrayal of the future (before time-travel) is pretty lame. This film is big on emotion, caring about family, but it just doesn't come across as believable. And, as for the ending, completely unbelievable. It is a 'nice' and 'good' ending, but since the characters are professional murderers it beggars belief. This film was written for Redford and Streep. With tighter editing it could have been so much more."

","A Time-Travel movie with Willis and Gordon-Levitt playing the same character? Sign me up!!<br/><br/>When i first saw the trailer for Looper, i was instantly intrigued, Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Joe, an assassin known as a Looper, The year is 2042 and time travel hast been invented yet, but in 30years it will have been! When the mob from the future wants to get rid of someone, they send that person back 30 years to a location where Joe would be waiting gun in hand, to take them out and dispose of the body. Everything is going well, until one 'Job' is sent back and Joe realises it is his future self (played by Willis).<br/><br/>The younger Joe is living well, he is paid handsomely for the work he does, and it seems as a result has become addicted to some kind of futuristic drug that he drops into his eyes regularly through the film. The older Joe has a stronger maturity to him, and seems to despise his younger self, wondering how he could've been so arrogant and stupid!<br/><br/>The strengths in this movie are in the performances, especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The way he mimics a young Bruce Willis (from Die Hard era) is fantastic! I've always been a fan of Willis and his performance in this movie is great, in a way he is the 'bad guy' of the story, but you always have a sense that he has good intentions behind his actions.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt played her part, but i wasn't overly impressed, however child actor Pierce Gagnon who plays her little boy was creepy as hell and was very good in this movie. Talking of which, his character of Cid plays a massive part in the story. The trailer did very well to cover another pivotal point to the story all revolving around this little boy.<br/><br/>My favourite thing about this film is that it is Original. It isn't a remake, or adaption of a book. It is a simple, well laid out, great action packed Sci-Fi Blockbuster. It kept me guessing right up until the credits and even then i was talking about it long after with my friends. Looper is confident time-travel movie that fills in all its own continuity holes, it packs an emotional punch and never gives away what is going to happen next! <br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","Anyone liked Looper? I found the concept brilliant but the execution tepid. Too many horror elements brought into what could have been a good sci-fi thriller. What was that part about the precocious (to stretch the word) child? Bruce Willis willing to take down poor children in his quest for his wife forced moral questions on a film that could have done without them. The action was gratuitous and the story mostly vapid! The only saving grace: Joseph Gordon Levitt, whose prosthetic nose accords him a menace that brings him closer to his future self, Willis, yet does nothing to deflect his trademark boyish charm."
"siderite","7","0","2","14 October 2012"," Bruce Willis saves the world BEFORE he was Bruce Willis
","I am sorry to be so cynical about this film, because it was well done and well played, but in the end it was just two hours of touchy feely and not much of it made any consistent sense.<br/><br/>We enter this world of killers that are paid to kill people sent from the future. You see, you can't kill someone in the future, it's too easy to track. These killers are well paid until they have to ""close the loop"", kill their older selves, that is. One of these killers voluntarily goes to the past because the bad guys killed his wife. And we have gone full circle. If it's so difficult to kill people, why did they kill his wife? Then the whole film is about younger self tracking older self, which makes no sense at all, unless younger self would still do all the wrong choices older self did in order for him to exist.<br/><br/>Bottom line: a well done movie, but a flawed one. The feel of it is gritty and shows a sort of desperation in the future, something that is great to behold. However the premise is crap and it doesn't get any better from there. Close-ups of Emily Blunt and Piper Perabo in her undies didn't save the film either, nor did the small child that was possibly the best actor of them all. In the end, the film can only be average, even if it is not the average type of movie."

","Looper follows the story of a group of people called Loopers. 30 years in the future people get sent back in time to be killed. A looper named Joe gets his future self sent back and he has to kill him and finish his job. Young Joe doesn't kill his older self and the agency comes after both of them.<br/><br/>Looper is full of action. Nearly every scene has gun shootouts or fist fights. Alongside the action is a mild amount of blood. Every time a person gets shot a fair amount of blood squirts out. Not much for the first 3/4 of the film but the last 1/4 has more blood. THis doesn't bother me that much as it's only shown for a second at a time. The action though is excellent as the film needs plenty of it.<br/><br/>Looper can be a bit confusing at times. WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD! There are three different beginnings with one of them not making sense. The first one shows Old Joe escaping and Young Joe falling off his balcony and then cutting the scene to when Old Joe comes back in time and is killed. It then runs down the next thirty years of Joe's life to when he is sent back in time and the first beginning happens again. The first beginning was completely pointless as it happens again later. This confused me as I don't know where it fits in the story line and if it means anything by going back in time to re-show it a different way.<br/><br/>To sum up it's good, but I wouldn't rush to see it again. Some scenes may upset or disturb some viewers as well."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","9","0","2","13 October 2012"," ""Looper"" will be a strong contender for sci-fi movie of the decade.
","Along with Edgar Wright, Rian Johnson is one of the top modern directors breathing life into original and accessible projects. Brick is one of the best neo-noirs of the last decade and The Brothers Bloom is potentially better and certainly funner. He has an excellent grasp of intertwining characters and style, particularly highlighted with his work on the less active but just as explosive episodes of Breaking Bad, my favourite TV series. From the concept to the talent, Looper always looked like a guaranteed winner and it definitely delivered. It's a brilliant blend of unsettling (often brutal) and creative ideas with an elegant and gritty style. The cinematography is definitely a highlight, with robotic movement in the panning and disorientating angles. After the whirlwind first hour, it settles down to a warmer second half where it becomes surprisingly powerful, with a sensitive yet bleak emotional core that provided some really heart-wrenching moments that matched its unrelentless thrills. <br/><br/>Although its science-fiction ideas are thoroughly fascinating, the most interesting part of the writing is how it handled the anti-hero(s) of present-day Joe and older Joe. With their conflicting motivations and differing risks the characters will take, there's a very organic and fierce rift that divides them, something I was skeptical on how that could be created but is justified in the film (in a scene where the consequences are shown in an implicated but graphic way). The moral compass switches around in a great subtle way. One scene, Joe is the bad guy and Older Joe has the good intentions and it effortlessly turns in a way that really resonates with the viewer, despite the fact that he is a somewhat despicable character. It's a film built on inner flaws and unconscious desires and there's a lot more implicated than shown which makes for a richer experience. There are many twists throughout, but unlike some films which boast them, Looper allows the twists to be unexplained for the audience rather than the characters.<br/><br/>However, it does have some messy elements. The action sequences are at their best when it's short and sharp, as Johnson doesn't know how to handle longer shootouts as they feature jarring editing and cinematography. The comedic moments feel too silly and out of place for a sincere film like this and if they were going for laughs, they should've gone for a different style of humour. Paul Dano and Jeff Daniels, while good, aren't sinister enough for their roles, though it is great seeing Garret Dillahunt, who's one of my favourite bit-part actors ever. None of these aspects hold the film back which is a good thing, but they could have been trimmed for an even tighter film even though the film does wind down for the 'farm half,' I thought it fit the pace rather than ruined it like some others feel it did.<br/><br/>As well as time travel, the film also has the science-fiction aspect of human telekinesis, known as TK, which while at times it feels unnecessary and almost turns the film into the special demon child type movie which has been overused in horror for the past few years, this was executed in a fresh and emotionally charged way that suggests the next step of evolution for both technology and humanity and how the human condition will deal with them which is a very interesting concept. While any time travel film suffers from logical problems and plot holes let alone articulating its own rules adequately, Looper delivers its exposition very well and even leaves enough room to offer a wide range for audience speculation on other details, rather than pre-occupy the viewer with logic problems throughout the film. Many have been left unsatisfied but I absolutely loved it and it's a strong contender for sci-fi film of the decade.<br/><br/>9/10"
"BaiNst","8","0","5","12 October 2012"," Dick-ish (P.K., that is)
","LOOPER is a fun movie that is very reminiscent of the stories that Philip K. Dick wrote in the 60s and 70s. I can't explain the similarities in too much detail without spoiling anything (see below, if you'd like), but anyone familiar with Dick's oeuvre shouldn't be too put off by my comparison. <br/><br/>This film does something unusual in this day and age, which is to make its theme the primary motivation for the story to exist. Plot elements and character motivations all go to support the ultimate conclusion, which is a fulfillment of the thematic premise (which, again, can't be disclosed without spoiling said ending). <br/><br/>If you are a fan of films that transcend the modern concept of screen writing, which holds genre and ""high-concept"" (doublespeak if I've ever heard it) above all else, then you may find LOOPER a refreshing investigation of meaning and purpose in life. <br/><br/>No, you will not find instructions on building a time machine, nor evidence that time travel may actually exist without paradox. Turn off your science brain, and go in for a good and well told story, with interesting characters, intriguing twists, and a purposeful ending, and I'd bet on you having a good time. <br/><br/>If you enjoyed THE MATRIX, you should be able to enjoy this movie. If, in THE MATRIX, you found yourself concerned about the reality of a person's mind being able to somehow break the operational code of a computerized world while within that world, through sheer force of will (note, that there are no scenes in THE MATRIX in which Neo is being taught to use real computers or their source code properly), then you will probably hate this movie. <br/><br/>**SPOILERS** **SPOILERS** **SPOILERS**<br/><br/>Similarities: <br/><br/>1. Primarily the introduction of a seemingly pointless (and magical) fact of the future that becomes a main point of the plot. The TK abilities in the film were very reminiscent of Dick's use of synthetic animals, aliens, changeling suits, etc. (that last example always having bothered me as too much of a necessity for the telling of that story). <br/><br/>2. A near future that's really not very different from our own, but has contact with a race of people (those 30 years in the future of the time the main action takes place) that are nearly alien (if not completely alien). <br/><br/>3. Primary concern is with thematic exploration. See THE MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE. <br/><br/>Not a lot to hang my hat on, but since they were such hallmarks of Dick's novels, when used in an s.f. trope, it's difficult to escape comparison."

But this film gave something new to cinemas that I hope others will follow suit! <br/><br/>The character of young Joe (Joseph Gordon Levitt) was portrayed excellently as we followed him through the events of the main storyline, I was only left wandering at the end of the film where old Joe (Bruce Willis) was? for the majority of the film he was out somewhere that the viewer didn't know apparently killing children (SPOILERS), and how unrealistic that the last child who he happens to come to has to be the 'rain maker' it is something that is completely unrealistic and only presented in the media. <br/><br/>The fact that one of the children was the child of the prostitute from the beginning also just to much of a coincidence, the story puts essentially Old Joe against his past and everything he believed in at the time, and all apparently because his wife was killed unjustly.<br/><br/>Another fundamental plot twist, was where the hell was the rainmaker in the future as Old Joe never came in to contact with him and so how did he know, some would say it was the man who called him on the phone which is fair play, but yet he didn't seem fussed until his wife was killed, these minor plot holes are the only thing that stand between this movie being a five star to me as it really was amazing.<br/><br/>Brilliant twisted views as well as loops in your own mind, as well as the film."
"heavymetalmouth91","8","0","5","10 October 2012"," Looper Review by Heavy Metal Mouth
","Looper is the third release from director Rian Johnson, known to audiences previously as the man behind Brick (in which he first collaborated with Joseph Gordon Levitt) and The Brothers Bloom. Both of Johnson's previous films had warm receptions, but Looper comes on the back of particular hype in the film world, the reasons for this likely being the general acclaim Looper has received following advance screenings, Levitt's recently increased status following The Dark Knight Rises and also the fact that Summer 2012 noticeably failed to produce a standout Science Fiction thriller- or at least one that audiences could agree on, with movies like Prometheus receiving mixed reviews and Totall Recall falling flat on it's face. So the timing of Looper seems excellent, but does it live up to the anticipation?<br/><br/>Well, fortunately the hype is very much to believed as Looper is without a doubt the best sci-fi film of the year and a real treat for fans of the genre. The story follows Gordon Levitt as Joe Simmons, an assassin or 'looper' who is paid by criminal organisations from the future to murder and dispose of bodies. This is all made possible by the invention of time travel in 2074, and so victims are sent thirty years into the past where they are taken out by loopers such as Joe. When Joe is confronted by his future self (Bruce Willis), he fails to prevent him from escaping. Old Joe is hellbent on destroying the loop and keeping himself in the present, and attempts to warn Young Joe of a destructive leader in 2074 who rules the city, but Young Joe is only concerned with killing his future self, as failure to do so will result in death by his current employers who are hunting Joe as he chases his older form.<br/><br/>While this may sound like a lot to take in, the film is relatively straight-forward and will not pose any problems for audiences who are in fear of getting lost in the plot. In fact, Johnson chooses to focus more on emotional depth and character development over a complicated plot structure, in contrast to recent sci-fi classics, and Looper benefits hugely from this. Old Joe has cleaned up his act and is desperate to explain to Young Joe that he is deeply in love with his future wife, and while at first Young Joe refuses to comprehend this idea, hi mind is soon changed following his encounter with lonely wife Sara (Emily Blut) and her troubled, yet strangely gifted son Cid (Pierce Gagnon), as he hides out at their barn while attempting to escape the mob.<br/><br/>The romantic angle of the story is unusual for this type of film, and yet it works perfectly, tying in well with the pace of the 118 minute running time, and it never feels as though it is interrupting the overall plot. There are also some fun comedic moments which help to lighten the tone, but make no mistake, this is an action film and there are plenty of explosive scenes to take from this that ensure it stands up to comparisons to films such as The Matrix and Inception. Another huge strength that Looper boasts is in it's excellent casting, and while the leading duo of Gordon Levitt and Willis are their reliable selves, the standout performance of the film is Pierce Gagnon as a young, confused child, who possesses powers he does not understand and cannot control. Gagnon effortlessly steals every scene he is in with an exceptionally creepy performance that will be remembered for years to come. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Looper delivers on it's promise with it's intelligent, thought-provoking script and stylish direction. The comparisons have been justified; Looper is a stone cold sci-fi classic and demands to be seen. A serious contender for film of the year."

","I loved everything about this movie with the exception of the ending. While it wasn't completely predictable -- as I thought there were only two outcomes: JGL wins or Bruce wins -- so for that I respect the ending. However, this was pretty cliché and, for me, almost ruined the experience and made me feel that, in only 5 minutes, the entire 95 prior to that were negated and just undermined. That being said, I still love the movie and think you should see it, but I'm also hoping that in three months when the DVD comes out, there will be a ""director's cut"" or alternate ending. I would also like to see maybe a sequel -- or even better: a PREquel -- explaining more in dept how loopers came to be and how the TK's found and began to use their powers. They should also try to explore how the kid at the end will take this event's happening and, how this parallel reality will pan out."

","This film is by no means perfect, but its not even nearly as bad as some would have you believe. <br/><br/>We currently live in a world where every nerd/geek thinks that every movie has to stick to what we know about ""Real"" science, Where is the fun in that? Sometimes its OK to have a movie that slightly contradicts real world ""logic"" as long as its in movie ""logic"" is consistent. This movie is consistent within its own universe, a universe where the past can be changed, with no effect on some peoples memories. Therein lies the problem with Time-Travel ""Experts"" that claim going back in time and changing things is either not possible or would result in a branching off into a parallel universe.

"matthew-landry","8","0","5","10 October 2012"," It's not a documentary about the space-time continuum. But that's okay.
","For a slick, well-paced, sci-fi action film with some comedy/horror elements thrown in there, I thought it had some substance.<br/><br/>If it were a film solely wrapped up in time travel and its practicalities, I could see some valid arguments arising about the ""loop""-holes. But it's not about time travel. And if the fact that people aren't sent into the prehistoric era (where they COULD potentially survive and thus change all of history) instead of 30 years into the past (where they're ""guaranteed"" to die) is so bothersome that you can't focus on the rest of the film, I don't know how you get through anything but the News.<br/><br/>And I certainly can't deal with people not being able to ""suspend their disbelief"" ONLY once the telekinesis aspect is introduced. You've already bought into time-travel. Get over it.<br/><br/>Technically, I thought it was pretty great. The timing is on point, it has some decent acting (especially the boy), sharp writing, some pretty wicked visuals (minus only a couple cheap CG effects), and I thought the aesthetic of ""the future"" was quite believable.<br/><br/>With all of this being said, I also actually cared about the characters, which is a rarity in any sort of action film right now. You can understand them. They're all motivated by something - so that at least when it comes to ""suspending your disbelief,"" it's with the fantastical elements, and not with the characters. The story actually poses a lot of interesting questions and ideas about power and morality and love and maternal relationships that actually go beyond the events in the film, if you choose to dig a little.<br/><br/>So although, I agree, it's a stretch calling it a masterpiece, let's not be knocking a film that has an abundance of redeeming qualities because it didn't give a full-on account of the space-time continuum.<br/><br/>Hope this makes sense. It be 3am.<br/><br/>AND ALLLSSSSSOOO: It's not Children of Men. It's also not for the same people as Children of Men. I thought that for a film that's mostly geared toward - I would assume - male teens, it has filled a lot of gaps that other films in that category have left out."
"dharmendrasingh","6","0","3","9 October 2012"," A time-travelling loop-the-loop
","Writer-director Rian Johnson's sci-fi action film is complex and original but not necessarily clever, and only marginally entertaining. Upholding the script's integrity is discarded in favour of maintaining its crowd-pleaser status. <br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Joe, a mob killer known as a 'Looper', who takes out the trash from the future by shooting them in the present (2044). Time-travel rules have to be broken when his latest target – his future self – escapes at the point of execution. Bruce Willis plays the older Joe. He evades his younger self every time Execution day arrives, as he intends to find The Rainmaker, a mythical Looper who kills his wife in the future.<br/><br/>Instead of explaining his impressive concepts, Johnson resorts to the easy cliché of making his characters ignorant of their own world. The closest we come to time-travel exposition is a line by Looper manager Jeff Daniels, 'It fries your brain like an egg', or better still Willis's line, 'I don't wanna talk all that time travel crap; we'll be here all day making diagrams with straws'. Those are funny lines, but when you stop chuckling you know you've been had. <br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt is easily upstaged by the doyen of action cinema. With intense make-up he looks nothing like a younger Willis, and his characterisation is even less convincing. He doesn't have the presence of prolific actor, and yet he is one. Paul Dano has a small role as a fellow Looper, which he quivers through as is his custom. Emily Blunt convinces as the independent farm girl whose precocious toddler, Cid is key to the plot. <br/><br/>I figured out the twist long before the reveal. It is so obvious, that I thought it was dramatic irony, where the audience is intentionally privy to something the characters aren't. I can't prove this of course, but be in no hurry to find out for yourself."
"The-Sarkologist","9","0","3","9 October 2012"," One wild ride right to the end.
","Looper is, in my opinion, the best movie of 2012. This is the type of movie that people should be making, one that keeps us intrigued and on the edge of our seat right up until the end, at which point we are left breathless. Not only is this such a good movie, there is so little that we know about this film as we go into the cinema, that to almost say anything about it is likely to ruin it for somebody, particularly since we are left guessing right up unto the end.<br/><br/>Looper is a movie with no real bad guy, since it becomes clear that everybody in the film is pretty much connected with the criminal underworld, and in fact it becomes pretty clear that in this futuristic world the criminal underworld pretty much rules everything. There are scenes in the movie where one of the character is being chased by the underworld, and we hear the sounds of the sirens of police cars which are out looking for him.<br/><br/>I will simply outline the film in the way they outline it at the beginning. Time travel does not exist yet, but in thirty years time it will, and it will be instantly outlawed. However the criminal underworld will take advantage of it, and use it to get rid of people and send them back in time, since it is impossible to dispose of a body then. They are sent to appear before executioners known as Loopers, whose job is to execute the person and dispose of his body, and are rewarded appropriately.<br/><br/>The only thing that seems to drag the film down is what I call the time travel paradox, but if we suspend our disbelief enough we can let is slide. The paradox is simply something that pretty much infects most movies about time travel. For instance, in Back to the Future, we have Marty McFly go back in time, meet his parents, muck something up but fix it up again, and then return. However, one thing that is left out is the suspicion as to why Marty McFly looks so much like his mum's ex-boyfriend from the fifties.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the paradox is almost impossible to escape from, and will pretty much undermine most movies. It generally isn't the case in a TV series (such as Dr Who), though it will always rear its ugly head. In the end, the best thing to consider is that this is a movie, and it exists only for entertainment purposes, so my suggestion is to be entertained."
"ivern-326-711636","6","0","3","8 October 2012"," This Is Going to Take a Long Time
","Looper is about how in the future, time travel has been invented, but is illegal. At the same time (literally), getting rid of bodies in the future is very hard. So they send the (alive) victims 30 years into the past, where a specialized assassin (called a Looper) is waiting to shoot him down and burn the body. I won't go into too much detail in this summary, because I will just be hurting my psyche.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to Looper. I thought it looked interesting from the trailers. And when everyone said it was great, I was looking forward to it even more. But when I saw it, I was disappointed. Where do I start? I guess I'm gonna have to analyze the movie a bit.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with the main character (who is a Looper). He does the things he does. He shoots down a body from the future, burns it, goes home, gets drunk and wakes up for another day of doing the exact same thing. This part of the movie is interesting, I guess. It gives us a good idea of the depressing and boring every-day life of a Looper.<br/><br/>We are introduced to our main character's friend, who is also a Looper. A few scenes after this, we will learn that someone has sent his older self to him at work so he can kill himself ... yeah, I know. Apparently, this is called ""closing the loop"". It means that the Looper is free from the contract and ... well, the movie doesn't really do a good job on explaining what happens next. Realistically, it would just result in a time paradox.<br/><br/>Later, the same thing happens to our main character, but his older self escapes and the main character has to hunt down himself. He ends up in a farm where a pretty lady and her son live. It turns out the main character's future self is out for the boy because if the boy grows up, he will be responsible for the bleak and unfair future that the main character's older-self lives in.<br/><br/>While it does contain many plot holes, the story is overall interesting and original. But it's the way that it's told that is disappointing. The movie decides to tell us what's going on, instead of showing, most of the time. This not only makes it cryptic, but also boring and it shows lack of effort.<br/><br/>The movie mostly takes place on the lady and her son's farm. The setting looks like it was taken directly from Signs (2002), filled with colorless cornfields and everything. But that's the problem: The movie doesn't show us how the future is bleak (except for the main character's old self's wife getting killed there). It doesn't show us what happens to the main character's friend. It just shows us a farm, where we have to HEAR what happens.<br/><br/>I feel that Looper is an interesting movie, but could have been better if it was done with more showing and less telling. I don't see why so many people love it. The actual movie is kind of lazy."

","Two problems with the level of violence in this film: First, in the UK, it's been rated as suitable for viewers aged 15, 16 and 17 by the BBFC which it definitely should NOT be; and second, it's completely unnecessary because, otherwise, this is an interesting film with great possibilities well explored.<br/><br/>The acting for Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis is really good and keeps the realism going even when some of the characters don't appear to have a complete justification for their behaviour as one may wish.<br/><br/>I didn't imagine where the story was going to go, and, were it not for the unnecessary nastiness, that would make this an outstanding film -- I always like to be surprised!<br/><br/>Overall, only recommended for those who like their sci-fi a bit unnecessarily violent (teenage boys, then)."
"jboothmillard","8","0","7","7 October 2012"," Looper
","I saw the trailer for this film and thought it didn't really look like something I would necessarily see in the cinema and could wait until DVD, but then I heard more good reviews, including a five star out of five rating by critics, so I had to see whether it deserved it and would indeed by a good film. Basically it is the year 2044 in the economically collapsed United States, organised crime has increased and mutation has occurred in 10% of the population, giving people telekinetic powers, and thirty years in the future, 2074, time travel has been invented but immediately outlawed, and with tracking devices in people mean it is near impossible to dispose of bodies secretly. Crime bosses in the future therefore leave instructions for organised assassins known as ""loopers"" in the past; a person the crime bosses want dead in sent by time travel back to 2044 and the looper kills them and takes the silver bars strapped to the victim as payment, and the body is easily disposed, and when looper's have their contract ended the crime bosses send their future self to be killed by their younger self, this is ""closing the loop"", not doing this they will be killed. Joe Simmons (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) works for a mafia company in 2044 as a looper, with Abe (Jeff Daniels) from the future as his boss and the owner of a club that Joe often visits showgirl Suzie (Piper Perabo), as well as managing the loopers Abe also runs the hire muscle the ""Gat Men"", one being desperate to prove himself and unstable Kid Blue (Noah Segan). One night Seth (Paul Dano), Joe's friend and fellow looper, admits that he was supposed to close his own loop and kill his future self, but he hesitated and let his future self escape, he also mentions a mastermind in the future called the Rainmaker who has overtaken organised crime and is closing all loops, Joe tried to protect Seth, but changes his mind and betrays him and gives away half of his silver bars to Abe. Joe is sent to kill his next target, but he hesitates when his victim is not wearing a hood to cover his identity and sight, and he recognises it is his future self, he lets Old Joe (Bruce Willis) escape, but the two encounter each other again in a café where Old Joe explains the Rainmaker sent him back in time to be killed and that his wife was killed and he wants revenge. Old Joe killed his captors and purposely travelled back in time to kill the Rainmaker while he is still a child, but of course killing someone in the past instead of from the future could have severe consequences in the world, so Joe does try to stop and kill his future self, but they are attacked by the Gat Men, but Joe manage to tear off a crucial piece off of a map in Old Joe's possessions, marking locations and digits. Joe follows this map to the location he tore off, and he ends up at a farmhouse where single mother Sara (Emily Blunt) lives with her son Cid (Pierce Gagnon), he shows her the map and she is shocked to recognise the digits as the birthday and serial number of the hospital where Cid was born, he explains about being a looper and about the Rainmaker, and Old Joe meanwhile is following the digits for two other children born one the same day and in the same hospital so he can kill them. As Joe stays with the mother and child, he and Sara, who he learns is telekinetic, and that Cid was raised by her sister most of his life until she died, and because of this he does not believe she is his mother, and worse is when he shows his extraordinary power when they are attacked by Gat Man Jesse (Garret Dillahunt) and lets out a telekinetic blast in a moment of pain and anger. Joe is sure that Cid is the Rainmaker, and Sara explains that the boy lost control of his power and killed her sister, meanwhile Old Joe is caught by Kid Blue, but he manages to break free, killing Abe and all the Gat Men apart from Kid Blue, and he starts making his way to last of the children he located on the map. Joe urges Sara and Cid to flee, he is sure that Old Joe or his employers will find them, and soon enough the two Joes confront each other again near the farmhouse, where Kid Blue also shows up to attack Old Joe, only to end up killed by the vengeful future man. Cid lets out another powerful telekinetic blast when Old Joe tries to catch and kill him, Sara calms him down and finally convinces him she is his real mother, Old Joe approaches them again to kill the boy, but she stands in his way, Joe realises that if he kills Sara it will cause Cid to indeed become the Rainmaker and create a closed time loop, so in the end he sacrifices himself, saving Sara and Cid and erasing both Joe and Old Joe from existence. Also starring Summer Qing as Old Joe's Wife and Frank Brennan as Old Seth. The stars of this film are definitely Gordon-Levitt and Willis playing the same character from the past and the future with gusto and grit, and Blunt does well with an American accent and being feisty, the story is clever mixing the ""time continuum"" concept, making you think about how changes in history will effect things to come, it is only a little complex at times, but it is a refreshing science-fiction action film. Very good!"
"mike-hejja","6","0","4","7 October 2012"," Not terrible, but not as good as reviews will lead you to believe
","The only way I can explain the overwhelming reviews for this movie is that critics want to back an up and coming director, or that this year is so dismal for film that they are desperate to crown a new ""Inception"". While it wasn't completely horrible, this is definitely not a movie in the 8.4 - 9.4 range.<br/><br/>Labels like ""inventive"" and ""thought provoking"" are appropriate for a movie like Inception, but do not apply at all to Looper. I believe Rian Johnson is talented, but he has not yet made a movie that is anything close to Christopher Nolan's better films.<br/><br/>Review after review stated that this movie brought ""something new"" to the time travel genre, but what? Encountering your past/future self has been done a million times, as has trying to change the future by altering the past. OK, so what else? The telekinetic angle has been done into the ground, as has the super child with the ability to change the world for good or evil.<br/><br/>The only real original concept here is one that doesn't really make any sense in the first place. This is the idea that the mob would send people to the past when they wanted to kill them. While that is an interesting way to whack somebody, doesn't it seem just a bit risky to send people, who you want to kill, alive to the past where they can potentially be a risk to your entire existence. And not only that, but you also have a deal with the hit men that one day, they too will be disposed of this way? Why wouldn't you simply kill them and THEN just send a dead body back to prehistoric times to get rid of the evidence?<br/><br/>But then again, those are the kinds of questions that Looper conveniently doesn't have to answer, with clever lines such as, ""I don't want to talk about all that time travel crap."""

The one's that eliminate them, called ""LOOPERS"". The ""LOOPERS"" eliminate their target, gets silver or gold for it, dispose the body, and then, in the future, no one knows that the victim is dead. No evidence. So far with the prologue. The movie is one that is hard to watch with lots of violent and with some holes in the plot and the logic of the time travel itself. You may now ask, what's with the high grade? A very good question... The high grade comes for the smoothness of the movie, the excellent photo-shoot, the good play by the main characters, the idea of the movie, and most of all for the surprising end (won't tell ya) that shows us that even in a world that going one way down, in human relationships, you might find some people that you can count on, relay on and trust.

","Not an ordinary movie, at all. It was far more complicated and sophisticated, than most of the 2010's films or blockbusters. Rian Johnson is definitely a great director, he really reminds me of Duncan Jones. These two director just loves to play with movie stereotypes or the entire sci-fi genre.<br/><br/>The best aspect of the movie, in my opinion, is that you never know what is going to happen. It starts somehow heading to a destination and then *SCRATCH* suddenly the whole story changes, we are heading to another destination. Also, the rhythm of the film is tailored to this experience, so it's fast-slow-fast-slow-extra fast. It is really gripping! Maybe the only problem is that the middle and slow part of the film is a little bit too slow, but it's a necessary atmosphere-building. As for the last and very fast part, it is MINDBLOWING.

","'Looper' is a sci-fi time-travel film which follows an assassin on the run after failing to kill his future self. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) tries to kill his future self (Bruce Willis) in order to survive the present. <br/><br/>The acting is great overall; no one lets down the film here. Willis is good enough here but I wouldn't say it is his best performance; he still suits the role however and was a good choice. Gordon-Levitt was fantastic and has proved with this and 'The Dark Knight Rises' that he can perform well in action roles. However, the prosthetics on his face made it a bit difficult to judge his performance as they cover half of his face. There have been plenty of films where people have played the younger version of the same character in the same movie and have not had the same bone structure. Of course basic aspects of appearance such as eye colour have to be sorted but Gordon-Levitt's make-up was distracting throughout the first half of the film, so much so that the plot was nearly overshadowed!<br/><br/>The plot is really clever; it's a bit tricky to get your head around but it has been explained well. Of course, you will spend the next few days trying to figure out whether or not everything does indeed tie together in the end but they do explain it well and there are no massive plot holes. Supporting characters such as those played by Emily Blunt and Jeff Daniels were written really well and performed by great actors. Even Paul Dano's small character was a great inclusion in the film despite only being there for ten minutes. There are some really shocking moments in this film and some grizzly scenes too but nothing unnecessary and they do not have a negative impact on the plot or the picture as a whole.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a really great film which will hopefully be regarded as a classic one day amongst sci-fi and film lovers alike."
"muthink","5","0","3","6 October 2012"," Good, but with problems
","Like everyone, tastes vary. I am a scifi fan and generally enjoy most films of the genre which I finally decide to see, however I also expect that these films bring in a semblance of believability into the plot. Time travel movies are inherently problematic: You have the difficulties of time lines, multiverse theory, the grandfather paradox and so on. In my mind it doesn't even matter sometimes if every lose end is tied up. I even enjoyed the back to future trilogy, simply because the film didn't try to be serious: We obviously knew it wasn't possible to disappear slowly from a picture and simply come back because your dad kisses you mom.<br/><br/>Although I agree there are many things about the film worthy of praise: the acting, the dialog, special effects and directing, somehow the film left me in the realm of incredulity, because it tried to be serious, yet failed miserably on believability; the dynamics of time travel was never really explained, and even if we assumed one of the paradigms which are commonly out there, nothing made sense even from one of these points of view. This left us rather confused as to what was really going on. It had the overall effect of making the film seem as though it was going off in arbitrary directions simply to fulfill a plot point or make a dramatic effect.<br/><br/>I left the theater wondering if I could have spent my money on a better film and all-in-all, given how picky I am probably would have opted for a different genre. So, I am saying, although this film is given high ratings, don't go see it necessarily based on these reasons. Tastes vary. If you like serious well crafted dramatic movies with special effects but not much logic, then you will love this movie, if not, it will probably leave you disappointed."

","Looper is a smart, intelligent, mind bending conceptual movie from a fairly unknown director Rian Johnson. This fact alone should inspire many unpublished wannabes to never give up hope. Even though I too had problems navigating the parallel dimensions in this film, 2 viewings did eventually help.<br/><br/>30 years. That marks the end of a loop for a looper. 30 years. However even early on we learn that can go wrong. OK, that was a spoiler I admit, but nothing bends correctly until the end.<br/><br/>Things I had trouble with: Joseph Gordon-Levitt I'm sorry even with tons of make up does not really look like Bruce Willis. The transition between old and new Joe are not so apparent so it confuses the audience. Timelines get confused between what Joe wants to believe and what actually happens. If you have to analyze a film too hard it is frustrating. You really don't want to pay to see it multiple times to figure things out.<br/><br/>Things I really liked: No matter what later time you are living, it is all dependent on the past. If you loose an arm... it is gone in the future. Current time is not forgiving. If you screw up, you are always susceptible of a reprimand that might not be so attractive. Reality verses what you want can be altered in any given moment. Try as much as you can to make the right choice in the present doesn't always work out in the future.<br/><br/>For some reason this felt more akin to BladeRunner for me in tone and execution than many of it's wannabes. No kid will understand it, so don't bother taking them. This is purely an intellectual film that is meant for scifi addicts. I should know. I'm not a true scifi addict.

When Joe fails to end his own future self a tsunami of organised criminality comes after him.<br/><br/>The film is clever and walks the fine line between standard fare and wrapping itself in its own smugness. The performances are touching at times and brutal in others. There are themes that get explored here for the first time in mainstream cinema that had all 6'10"" of me wincing in a way I haven't experienced since Old Boy and the live octopus. The film asks the question 'What would you do to save the one you love?' The answers are extremes that creep up on you and the characters slowly as they are cut free of their own time.<br/><br/>It is genuinely original and there are elements you don't expect at. However fans of the new Sci-Fi wave will recognise a Deus ex Machina when they see one and while it does not flag you down in the first act, it certainly wolf whistles. <br/><br/>The film has more in common with another Willis vehicle, the trippy and ultimately circular 12 Monkeys than it does with the other summer Sci-Fi fare (please avoid Total Recall I beg you!). While it works and works well it could have been more. The bite of the Looper's cruelty is panned away from too often and the potential horrors of the future are only referenced in passing. This denies the audience the chance to really connect with the choice that has to be made.<br/><br/>In all a cerebral film that will certainly keep the conversation going past the starter on date night.<br/><br/>If you are still discussing it with your dessert I would respectfully suggest you were not paying close enough attention."

","I know I really liked this film, because all I can think of right now is seeing it again. I love movies with intricate plots that make you think, movies that you have to pay attention to them to ensure that you don't miss anything. I know on a second viewing of this film, I would see so much more of the film that I missed on my initial viewing. And for this reason alone, I have to highly recommend seeing this film!!!<br/><br/>The ""simple""...plotline for this is film as follows: If the mob wants you dead in 2072, they send you back in time to 2042 where a hired hit-man, a Looper, awaits for you to materialize, then shoots you pointblank with a ""blundergun,"" a sawed-off double shotgun. The body is then incinerated, and the mob's problem is solved. If you are lucky enough to survive thirty (30) years of service, your ""loop is closed"", and your future self is sent back to your younger self for execution. As your reward, you get to live your next 30 years of life ""buck wild"". However in the future, a new mob boss, the Reign-Man, has taken over the five (5) major crime cities in 2072, and is systematically killing off all the Loopers in the future. Old Joe (Bruce Willis) has a plan to find a kill ""The Reign-Man"" as a child when he's ""looped"" to the past for execution, that is if his younger self (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) doesn't kill him off first.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Rian Johnson, this film/script is fresh, vibrant, and a Sci-Fi geek's wet dream; and I just loved everything about this film. Every second that Willis (Old Joe) stays alive in the past has potentially catastrophic to the future, not to mention that every new experience younger Joe (Gordon-Levitt) experiences from the mishap execution, instantaneously becomes a new memory for Old Joe (Willis). Yes, it's that kind of movie.... :) <br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt embodies the persona of Willis much like Josh Brolin did in MiB3 as young Tommy Lee Jones. Levitt has Willis' facial expressions, head tilt, body posture; it's all there. While Willis still plays Willis with blatant disregard and reckless abandonment. My only complaint to this film would be the 2042 ""time-warp murder site"". We are supposedly in a future where mob crime rules supreme, wide spread poverty, but there just happens to be a sugar cane farm circa 1940 sitting just outside the city complete with 1940 diner. It's just a little to ""Norman Rockwell"" for me!!!! <br/><br/>Anyways, I do highly recommend seeing this film I enjoyed it immensely!! However, I am a sucker for Sci-Fi, time travel, and all things Bruce Willis!! Joseph Gordon-Levitt is coming into his own as well a fine performance, well done!! So if you are jonesing for a really nice Sci-fi, time traveler, mob-infested thriller, boy do I have a movie for you!!!! <br/><br/>SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON FB @ ""THE FARIS REEL"""

","This clever and intricate movie borrows a theme from TERMINATOR and gives it an inventive twist. It's set in 2042 USA, which looks just as depressed as 2012 USA - apart from a few new not-too-futuristic flying machines. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Joe, one of a group of secret hit men whose job it is to dispatch people sent back from 2072 where killing has been outlawed (o brave new world!). Joe's mission takes a curious turn when his future self (Bruce Willis) is sent back for 'processing'. Old Joe sets out to find - and eliminate - the Rainmaker, his future nemesis. Young Joe has to try and protect both the present and the future.<br/><br/>The quest of the Joes brings them to a remote farm where Sara (Emily Blunt) is raising mysterious kid Cid who has some spooky telekinetic skills. A bunch of thugs are also in pursuit make sure the mission is accomplished - if it was made clear which future these guys were from, I missed it!<br/><br/>I'm not sure the time-play in this storyline completely holds together. It's as intricate as, say, INCEPTION or even MEMENTO. But there's great pace and tension, the CGI is clever without being overdone, and the actors treat this far-fetched scenario with a seriousness it may not merit. And it has a very satisfying climax.<br/><br/>LOOPER is a lot better than most of this summer's mega-budget blockbusters."
"mrcafemuse","Null","0","3","4 October 2012"," The Looper in You
","Would you kill yourself? For a Looper this is not a theoretical question nor is it a consideration of suicide. Rather, it's a decision that comes with the job. Will you kill your future self? If a Looper chooses to answer no, there are dire consequences, both personally and for the integrity of the causal relationship between the past, present and future. For audiences, the central question of the film might provide deeper contemplation: Would you kill your future self? And then by extension: Are we already doing so? Abe, the crime boss sent from the future says, ""This time-travel $*** fries your brain like an egg."" Indeed! The pretzel logic of time-travel plays a key role in the various plot twists.<br/><br/>In 2044, in an unnamed city in Kansas, there are skyscrapers as high as NYC, motorbikes that fly and cars that appear retrofitted to run on something other than gasoline. The transactional currency of choice: silver and gold bullion.<br/><br/>Organized crime controls the city, which is filled with poor, desperate people. There are also rich junkies who get their narcotic fix by putting a few droplets into their eyes. Such people protect themselves, and their property, from the hordes of vagrant poor by shooting them, apparently without consequence.<br/><br/>This fictionalized version of the future might give pause and allow other thoughts and questions to surface. What might the consequences of our actions, in current reality, be on our future? In 2074 time-travel has been invented and outlawed. The mafia uses it to send their marks into the past to be executed by Loopers. Organized crime has been mysteriously and single handedly consolidated, on a worldwide scale, by someone called, Rainmaker. And the order has been given to ""close the loop"" by sending all Loopers back in time to be killed by their past selves.<br/><br/>Joe, a Looper, is the main character of the film. His future self, old Joe is sent back, thirty years from 2074, to be assassinated by his younger self. However, old Joe out foxes the younger Joe and escapes. This puts the integrity of the timeline in jeopardy and the rules are clear on this. If old Joe isn't found and killed, then Joe must be killed and his silver confiscated.<br/><br/>In Rainmaker's attempt to close the loop on old Joe, his henchman kill old Joe's wife, the love of his life. To keep his peaceful, serene and cherished lifestyle, in rural China, in tact, old Joe plans to return to 2044 and kill the Rainmaker, who, at this time, is a child.<br/><br/>Old Joe has information narrowing the Rainmaker to one of three boys. When the Joes finally meet face-to-face, the older one tries to convince his younger self that killing the boy Rainmaker is a necessity. As Abe's posse closes in, old Joe provides Joe with information as to the whereabouts of one of the boys—escaping, again, to take care of the other two.<br/><br/>In each of the scenes where old Joe murders the young boys, the audience gasps in horror. Might these gasps also represent the horror upon realizing the consequences of our own current actions? Things we do everyday without consideration that these actions have on the lives of children around the world. Like old Joe, our prime importance is to preserve our cherished and comfortable lifestyle.<br/><br/>By 2044 some humans have developed telekinesis, the ability to move small objects with the mind. The information that Joe has been given leads him to a boy that possesses an evolutionary leap in these abilities. When this young boy gets frightened or angry, in the wake of his uncontrolled telekinesis, people might accidentally be killed.<br/><br/>The young boy believes that his mother died in such an incident and that the woman whom he calls Sara only pretends to be his mother. Sara is actually his mother but abandoned her son by giving her newborn to her sister so that she could continue to live in the city and work as Looper call girl. When her sister died, Sara came home to the farm to raise her son.<br/><br/>For a short while, Joe ends up living with Sara and her son on the farm and comes to know their story. He doesn't buy into old Joe's plan. In fact quite the opposite, he becomes their protectorate. This sets up a showdown, completing the loop, so to speak.<br/><br/>The payoff is at once surprising and satisfying and delivers a deeper message.<br/><br/>By 2074, the Rainmaker has gained control of his abilities. It's his childhood experiences that enable him to unleash terror onto the world without a guilty conscious. Might the young boy, and future Rainmaker, represent all the world's frightened and angry children? Might his telekinesis represent our ever-expanding technology? Frightened and angry children become frightened and angry adults while, at the same time, possessing technology with vast destructive capabilities.<br/><br/>Such perspectives give deeper meaning to Looper's ending. There are actions to be taken that try and preserve a comfortable future, for us personally, while disregarding the wider consequences for the collective—actions of old Joe. There are actions that attempt to provide a better future for all the children of the world, which potentially avoids creating a future Rainmakers. Such actions might require the annihilation of our present way of being in the world, represented in the film by Joe's actions to close the loop.<br/><br/>Looper provides an opportunity to understand, and to reflect upon, the direct causal relationship between the past, present and our role in creating the future. The choices that we make and the actions that we take, presently, even without time-travel, inherently turns each one of us into a Looper. Will you kill your future self? Are you already doing so?"

","In a world where no one can be illegally killed and time travel exists the mob is sending back targets to be disposed of by Loopers. This is until the Loopers have to dispose of their future selves.<br/><br/>Enjoyed this one, we had all-out gun battles that Bruce does very well, we had slow ploddy bits giving time for character development, story and plot and an interesting story to boot - a nice mix of everything.<br/><br/>The whole story is based around time travel, but it didn't linger on this too long. In fact we are given so little in terms of how the time travel works that the film avoids backing itself into corners. This is a good thing at it triggers much Frankie and Bennys Sticky Pasta and pepperoni pizza debating.<br/><br/>We see enough of the future world to hint at how things have developed, but also how some things are identical. The gap between rich and poor has widened and how the cost-of-life has decreased.<br/><br/>All the characters held their own, even the kid put in a good performance. Child actors can either go one of two ways, from Sixth Sense to Wesley Crusher.<br/><br/>There are plenty of nods to other films such as Terminator, 12 Monkeys, Source Code and Primer. In fact at one point it started to get very Terminator-ish and I expected a scared Sarah Connor to make an appearance.<br/><br/>A worthy watch. It's certainly has promoted a great deal of discussion, so in that sense it's serves its purpose very well as a great bit of cinema.<br/><br/>*** Rants *** Spoilers *** Questions *** Rants *** Spoilers *** Questions *** There is little point questioning the time travel mechanics. Since we have nothing to compare against in the real world, script writers are free to make their own rules and abuse them as they see fit. However, there are some bits that don't make much sense...<br/><br/>Why bother with the Loopers? Why not zap someone back into the furnace or a volcano? Job done, no messy shooting yourself or anyone else? Yes, without this we wouldn't have a story to tell, but still...<br/><br/>Why does the kid believe his mum is not his mum, assuming the story we hear from his mum is true? I'm assuming we are dealing with multiple timelines here instead of one big timeloop, as that seems to fit the best. In the original timeline what makes the kid into the Rainmaker? We assume in that timeline Bruce didn't kill mom, because he did this later.<br/><br/>What happens in the timeline where Bruce DOES kill mom? So the kid becomes the Rainmaker but we still have Bruce and young Bruce existing at the same time. Does young Bruce then meet his wife and become old Bruce? Does old Bruce become older Bruce? If so, does older Bruce not track down the kid before he becomes the Rainmaker? Why do the Loopers need to be sent back and killed? There was some explanation on this, but can't remember the reason. Can't they pay them off and they just live out their days? Did Abe create the events to NOT turn the kid into the Rainmaker? So... young Bruce was learning French and wanted to go to France. Abe suggested he go to China instead, which he clearly did. In China Bruce met his wife who then gets killed. Thus giving Bruce the motivation to zap himself back to hunt down the young Rainmaker. Then young Bruce makes sure the mom doesn't get shot by the whole self-sacrifice thing. No dead mom, therefore no Rainmaker."
"moou52","9","0","6","3 October 2012"," Solid Film
","Looper is not your run-of-the-mill action flick. It sports some great cinematography, acting, action scenes, and a great plot. Yes they invent their own time travel rules, but since time travel is just a theory, who cares? It works within the confines of the film and does a fair job of explaining things without over explaining.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt play their parts well. JGL even goes so far as to copy Willis' mannerisms. Emily Blunt hides her accent well enough, but-as with any foreign accent-can't quite hide it entirely. This isn't a deal breaker; she performs as good as she has in other films. Surprisingly, the child is a very competent actor for his age.<br/><br/>The world that has been created is one of subtlety. The director and writers present a dying, miserable world without over explaining it. There is some needless exposition, but not enough to ruin the overall feel.<br/><br/>Time travel is a moderate part of the plot. It works well within the film's established world and isn't over explained. This shouldn't be a problem for most people, but if you start comparing their time travel to others, or try to work out the minutiae, you'll find some holes. No time travel plot line is perfect.<br/><br/>Looper is well worth the hype and critical adoration it has received. If action films with a great plot are your thing, then I highly recommend it."
"a-ozornin","9","0","9","3 October 2012"," New standard in action movie storytelling
","There are two easy ways to tell whether the movie is good or not. Firstly, you should ask how many times during the showing you have been distracted from the storyline and the action. Good movie, quite obviously, will easily manage to grasp your attention from the start to the very end. Secondly, after watching a good movie one always realizes how crappy the other movies recently watched were.<br/><br/>Looper passes both tests so easily, that you start to wonder what other people in the industry are doing at the moment. The storyline is absolutely impeccable in terms of the interest it generates. Tens of questions and unknowns thrown at you every five minutes; action unfolds unbelievably quickly and seemingly spirals out of the control, yet taken under control so beautifully and gracefully that Inception plot will look like an amateur's work. Smart game about one-way time travel paid off, numerous tricks and treats are hidden inside the plot, and the final logical loop closes only with the final frames of the movie.<br/><br/>And, as per the second test, the movie does indeed make you wonder why this quality of plot is so rare these days. Go back to other action movies of the season: Spider Man had glossy NY but did not have story line; The Dark Knight was hellishly boring first hour and a half; Bourne lacked turns and felt like unsalted butter; Expendables were second-hand. Looper, as any good movie, raised the standards. It feels embarrassing to talk about other action movies mentioned in light of the new evidence: action movie as a genre is alive and well, and I can only say ""More of that, please"". This kind of excitement about the tightly twisted storyline occurred to me last time only after Inception, yet this is far more superior and smarter. It forces you to try to find answers yourself, rather than sit and wait for them to get delivered.<br/><br/>The storyline is not good enough alone, of course – the cast made this film happen. Bruce Willis, by the way, does not make much of the magic this time, he just smiles with his trademark smile and looks with his trademark look, which is of course awesome on its own. But it is Joseph Gordon-Levitt who shines. He is absolutely brilliant; he delivers fantastic performance with ease and enjoyment. He manages to eclipse the performance of Bruce Willis, and that says a lot.<br/><br/>This movie is a breath of fresh air after the immense mediocrity of recent showings. It plays with you, it challenges, it inspires. There are several action movies to follow this year, but they better learn from Looper as how things should be done. Totally brilliant, easily one of the best movies this year. Must see.<br/><br/>m-picturegoer.blogspot.com"
"scifilucy","8","0","9","3 October 2012"," Entertaining enough
","The thing that really amuses me about a lot of the negative reviews on here is the reviewer's issues with the writers 'lack of proper understanding about the mechanics of time travel' May I remind everyone that time travel is in fact not a known science, so expecting anyone to have a complete grasp of such is in fact, impossible.<br/><br/>This film was entertaining enough for me to spend the money and 2 hours in a cinema, I didn't leave feeling robbed like I did with Prometheus.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt was good, but I didn't expect anything less. The makeup to give him more of a resemblance to Bruce Willis was actually quite good and allowed him to embody Willis' facial gestures quite well. The guy's obviously done his homework, but it was not a direct copy which was nice.<br/><br/>Willis was what he always is, a hardened guy who's got a score to settle, made bitter by a loss of some sorts, a classic role in which he does well and what we all expect.<br/><br/>Don't go expecting a full on science fiction time travel spectacular, because that isn't what this is, its a hybrid, part science fiction, part action thriller part drama. and to be honest its nice to have a change of pace and a bit of humanity. The kid who plays Cid is excellent."

","In the near future, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, suspiciously made up to resemble a young Bruce Willis, is living a grimy, hollow life as a low- grade hit man, offing mob targets pushed under his trigger from a further, time-travel enabled future, when who should show up at the wrong end of his cannon than... bugger me, it's Bruce Willis!<br/><br/>Take one dollop of Source Code, mix in some 12 Monkeys, add a dash of Terminator, and then serve with a somewhat unexpected side order of Stephen King-style paranormal chills, and you're some way towards concocting Rian Johnson's pacey and highly entertaining science-fiction adventure. JG-L is pretty impressive in the lead role, channelling a young John McClane in a leather jacket and ending up more than half-way James Dean, which is just about right for the noirish '50s undertones of the heavily narrated first act. What follows doesn't stand up to too much close analysis, but this really doesn't matter once the chase kicks off. Looper delivers solid thrills, without going overblown and losing focus on its engaging central characters. Not the smartest temporal tale out there, but terrific fun while it lasts. Note: Also features Jeff Daniels in beard."
"SepiT","8","0","10","2 October 2012"," Will throw you for a loop!
","First, let's get something straight right off the bat; this is no Back to the Future family fantasy, or a doomsday machine ruled Terminator type of movie. This time-travelling mind bender written and directed by the imaginative Rian Johnson is one of the best and most creative sci-fi movies I have ever seen, and I don't even like sci-fi. Not for any reason other than the fact that I prefer movies I can connect with and understand, rather than make-believe science and spaceship laden what-ifs that normally lose my interest and attention early on. Yes, I am part of the minority that doesn't get what all the fuss is about Stars Wars. And that's why I really like that Johnson concentrated more on the premise, moral and story behind Looper than he did on the science of time travel or technicalities of the future. Though there are parts where he didn't go far enough on the latter, and I will touch on that further on.<br/><br/>Set in the year 2042, the story begins outside of a corn field (this is what I mean, we still grow stuff in the future and don't live in elevated metal cities. Thank you Rian!) where we are introduced to our main character Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who is a 'Looper', which are a group of hit men hired by the mob living in the future. A future where time travel is invented and immediately made illegal, and where people are tagged such that killing and disposing of them is not so easy and therefore the mob sends their hits 30 years back in time to 2042 where they are immediately disposed of by these Loopers. When the mob decides to 'close the loop' with Joe, in other words release him from his contract, by transporting his older future self (Bruce Willis) back in time for Joe to take care of only to have him get away, that is when things get interesting.<br/><br/>While most of the actors deliver solid performances, with Willis channelling an older John McClane, it's Gordon-Levitt that really shines. What impressed me the most was how well he imitated Willis' every quirk and mannerism; from his cool soft spoken style to his sly smirk. As you'd expect with most movies about the future, the cinematography is grey and bleak and really nothing to write about so as to focus on the premise and storyline. Still, I think Johnson could have paid a little more attention to the technical details of the future. Other than a 1980s looking hover bike, and some futuristic buildings, it looks like 30 years from now people are still using 2012 model cars, furniture and even appliances. A little more effort could have been made in that regard while still staying focused on the story.<br/><br/>Still, Looper is a fantastic, action-packed sci-fi that never bores and keeps you engaged while trying to connect the dots and follow along. Johnson's directing ensures he never loses the audience and keeps you guessing the outcome until the very end where everything comes together with great suspense. I highly recommend Looper whether you like sci-fi or not."

","""Looper"" looked like an exciting film too me. There's time travelling (Love a bit off that when its done right) Bruce Willis, Joseph Gordon-levitt, Emily Blunt. What's not too like? The answer. Not much.<br/><br/>Don't go expecting a lot off action because Bruce Willis is in this though. This is truly Joseph Gordon-levitt's Show, and he once again proves himself too be a tremendous actor. When I first heard he'd be playing a young Willis I thought this just wouldn't work. But he pulls it off. Through his facial expressions and make up you do believe him too be a young Bruce Willis. He nails some off Willis' mannerisms in a way that was sometimes even funny too me.<br/><br/>Gordon-levitt's performance is not the best part off ""Looper"" though. That would be its story. ""Loopers"" out-there plot is original, intriguing and almost ingenious. I was wanting too see it all the way through too the end, and (Unlike most movies) had no idea what was coming next. I don't know if ""Looper"" is everyone's cup of tea. Some might find it a bit bla bla bla, and it starts getting a bit too silly toward the end. But if your looking for a complicated, interesting plot that'll get you thinking, and at least makes some sort off sense. Look no further."
"basilisksamuk","8","0","10","2 October 2012"," Bruce Willis is in it - what could possibly go wrong?
","Absolutely not what I expected and all the better for it. All the comparisons with Blade Runner, Star Wars etc make no sense at all. I went in expecting lots of CGI, vehicle chases and so and thankfully I got only a modicum of each. No one whacked me over the head with a set piece that was so loud and filmed so close up and in blur-o-vision that it made no sense whatsoever. No one told me there was a 3D version and I had to see that. No one told me I had to see three and a half prequels to fully understand it.<br/><br/>Instead I got a good old-fashioned film with a story, dialogue and not everything explained to me in scene one for fear that I might be an idiot. That is not to say that the story itself, the science or the time travel made any sense whatsoever. You just have to go with it. If you can't buy it then don't bother going. We all think we know how time travel works, paradoxes, altering a tiny bit of the past changing a huge chunk of the future blah, blah, blah. In truth we don't know – half of what we know we've learned from other books and films and the other half is based on our limited understanding of physics. I'm pretty sure the ""science"" in this film is wrong but your guess is as good as mine. I like the approach which says – we really don't know so we'll do it this way and not worry about complex explanations.<br/><br/>It's not going to change your life and I really don't believe you'll be remembering this 20 years in the future like you remember the old classics like Blade Runner. (Unless and until the studios find a way travelling back in time and changing your memories of what you saw – they could wipe out all the classics and just leave you thinking their usual product was genius. I digress, but I do have an idea for a screenplay!) It's fun and you'll probably enjoy it unless you are a physics maven or unless your expectation of the ratio of explosions to story have been irretrievably warped by recent films"
"rivertam26","6","0","11","1 October 2012"," Something new
","There was this little genre film I saw fairly recently called The Caller. It centered on a young woman who moves into a new apartment and begins receiving frightening phone calls from a woman searching for someone. As the film builds towards a truly unique and shocking conclusion you discover that the film is dabbling in the whole time travel sub genre although very different films Looper reminded me of that film. This film centers on a group of specialized assassins living in the year 2044. Like the most believable films set in the future not much differentiates the times accept some nice touches here and there futuristic architecture, flying motorcycles, new laws etc. Getting back to the assassins they specialize in assassinating people delivered to them from a criminal futuristic organization so they can dispose of the body. Soon after we learn that eventually their future selves are sent back to them to erase evidence of what they've done and they are paid a large wage and given 30 years. But when a young man played by the ever so talented Joseph Gordon Levitt runs into his future self he hesitates for a moment and his future self played by Bruce Willis escapes. Thus setting the stage for a barrage of unexpected twists and a surprisingly emotionally resonant storyline. What's great about this film is how unique the feel of it is. It's hard to really describe it but it really feels like something new altogether. Unfortunately the film isn't flawless there are some questionable directorial choices although some great questions are brought up not all of them are answered effectively. There is a load of unnecessary characters that aren't fully developed and the film is a little cheesy in its action sequences. It is most successful in it's smaller moments like the one in which the two versions share a conversation over breakfast, a soft love story is explored as well as the relationship between a mother and her child. Levitt is solid in the lead and Emily Blunt is an unexpected surprise delivering a character i never though she would take on. Bruce Willis is less successful as the older version of Joe and the usually likable Piper Perabo is given so little to do besides an awkward topless scene it makes you wonder why she signed on for it. Still all in all the film is pretty solid and most of all it just feels really fresh a blessing in a cinematic market saturated with countless remakes and sequels. It may not be perfect but there is more than enough here to merit a more than solid recommendation.Plus the whole tk subplot although hammy had some really cool culminations. Good stuff. 3.5/5"
"mat-mcnaughton-254-33257","7","0","8","30 September 2012"," Time travel still needs some work.
","Rian Johnson is a good director, but a little too ambitious. ""Looper"" had a ludicrous amount of hype (probably on par with ""Inception""), and I can't say it lived up to it. First off, the whole arm-carving thing was stupid. It's not like tattoos don't exist in the future; Bruce Willis visibly has some Chinese characters on his neck. Second, there was no reason for them to hunt down Paul Dano's 'notyet' when they could have just killed Dano (which they ended up doing). I also thought that the whole concept of ""dropping"" was hilariously dumb. (Remember the eyeballing vodka trend? It's worse than that.) <br/><br/>As for Johnson's cinematic style, it has its ups and downs. There's a shot I love where the camera rotates around Joseph Gordon-Levitt's face in the club, but throughout the movie there were about half a dozen quick dark-to-bright shots that really weren't helpful. The distance shot of Old Joe knocking out Joe was priceless, however. And Johnson really downplayed the importance of TK. I didn't see any mention of that in the trailers. (Unless you count Emily Blunt floating the lighter in midair, inexplicably.) <br/><br/>Time travel is well-presented here, but it's not that inventive and the movie wasn't perfect."

","I thought the movie was fine. I thought it borrowed often from several other movies, and at the end reminded me of The Butterfly Effect. My sticking point-Remember when Bruce Willis says Reignmaker because ""he"" has created a REIGN of terror? Why then is everyone referring to a Rainmaker? Almost everyone over the age of 12 will like this movie. I said almost everyone, because of course some will not. But if you want to watch a half decent movie with okay acting and a story line that seems familiar but has been changed and tweaked, then see this movie. You will not feel as though you wasted your money, you can see it with your 16 yr old son when you need a parent-older teen night out, and it is OK for date night too. There are enough special effects for those movie goers, and a bit of romance for women, and seeing what our world could be in 2044 is actually the best part."

While the action and the suspense were excellent it took me some time to buy into Joseph Gordon Levitt's character perhaps because there was little to like about a party guy who's sole focus was his own survival. The story's core however is philosophical and reminded me of an excellent book that came out several years ago called The Secret Lives of Boys.

","Johnson made the Back to the Future series look like a joke. What was great about this film is that it didn't glorify the future, it joked about it. Johnson keeps you on the edge of your seat, glued to the screen with quick dialog, deep thinking, and has you reflect how you will change when the future comes.<br/><br/>Willis was great. He brought back that hard ass attitude that's subtle and addictive. What I didn't like was the screen time amount between him and Gordon-Levitt, they could have added a few minutes to keep these two stars glowing. The end massacre goes off a little too big, but it's something you'd like to see from Willis (I won't spoil it from you).<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt's makeup was top notch. He brought on Willis' scowl and his brows really defined his youthful attitude. It's definitely Johnson's influence that keeps Gordon-Levitt a lovable face on the screen because he provides a sense of innocence, logical attitude, and human emotions.<br/><br/>The simplicity of futuristic gadgets, human evolutionary changes, and citizenship really lets you think where our modern society is going. Everyone carries a shotgun around and crime is second nature deep in the city.<br/><br/>If you're looking for something to enjoy and not waste your money, this movie is it.

","Time travel is confusing. Once you think you may have a grasp on it and have ironed out the 'what-ifs', a new paradox will pop up and collapse your argument which was a house of cards anyways. There are too many holes, and especially plot holes, when you try to rationally reason through what it means to travel through time and change the past. Once time travel is invented, hasn't it always been invented then? If you go back in time and change something, will you just disappear because your specific future no longer exists?<br/><br/>Looper sidesteps this whole enigma by having old Joe (Bruce Willis) tell his younger self that there is no use trying to figure it all out; it will just confuse you. This one statement immediately smooths out the conversation he is having with young Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the audience's mental gymnastics, and while still leaving them right there in front of you, chooses to ignore the Grand Canyon sized plot holes. If you spend enough time with a pen and a sheet of paper, you will most likely identify a dozen or so glaring issues with jumping back through time, but where is the fun in that? With Looper, it is enough to recognize you have a creative story to watch and gifted actors to watch carry it out.<br/><br/>The year is 2044, not so far in the future to imagine teleportation and interstellar flight, but far enough to dream up new technology, weapons, and illicit drugs. 2044 is quite similar to today's reality, but its every day norms and today's extreme edges magnified by 1000. There are hover motorcycles, currency is literally based on gold and silver, and the drug all the kids are using is administered through eyedrops and appears to have the effects as cocaine. There is also some glaring income inequality, you either have money or you do not; there is no middle class. The city landscape shows thousands of people living on the sidewalks and sometimes in the middle of the street. If someone steals from you, it looks like you are allowed to pull out your personal shotgun and teach them a severe lesson. <br/><br/>Young Joe is a looper. At a specific time and always in the same place, the edge of a corn field, a hooded person will appear out of nowhere and all Joe has to do is immediately pull the trigger on his weapon and get rid of the body. These unfortunate souls are being sent back through time from 30 years in the future where time travel is illegal; therefore, it has morphed into a black market time travel system run by the mob. Young Joe is paid handsomely to do these simple tasks and spends the rest of his day and most of the night going to a club to drink, dance, take drugs, and spend time with Suzie (Piper Perabo), his favorite lady of the evening. <br/><br/>There are rules to follow though. Since the system is run by the mob, breaking the rules is frowned upon. I will not go into the rules because young Joe does a good job explaining to you what they are. In his film noir, gravelly voice, which is trying to match a young Bruce Willis in style, Joe opens the movie and brings you up to speed on what has been happening with the time travel business and his specific spot on the food chain. He has looper friends with Seth (Paul Dano) as his closest one and he gets called in to see the boss, Abe (Jeff Daniels), from time to time. Other than that, young Joe is really running his own loop with his day job and his nightly activities.<br/><br/>Old Joe effectively ends that routine as soon as he pops into the corn field out of thin air. One would think that young Joe would have some questions or would want to cut his older self some slack, but no such luck. Young Joe enjoys his current situation and is in no frame of mind to have it messed with, even if it is a version of him doing the interrupting. Old Joe is on a quest to change the past and does not seem too pleased to run into his former self either. These two are the same man, but they certainly are different people. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is really the leading man here because Willis is in more of a supporting role and has noticeably less screen time; however, Bruce still gets top billing on the poster and in the credits. I wonder if that chafes Gordon-Levitt? <br/><br/>Both Gordon-Levitt and Willis are very good here. On one hand, they are playing the same person and must try and match each other's facial ticks and mannerisms, but on the other hand, Gordon-Levitt is playing a kid against Willis's older and yes, wiser, character. Another supporting character is Sara (Emily Blunt) but I leave it to you to discover her role. Sara is saddled with most of the slower scenes in the middle which drag on a bit, but it's good to take a break from Joe, both young and old, after awhile. Looper was written and directed by Rian Johnson (Brick, The Brothers Bloom) who should be commended for sitting down and puzzling through what must have been a very arduous screenplay. <br/><br/>You will not understand the physics of how everything works in Looper (probably because the physics actually don't work), but you don't have to. Let young and old Joe worry about that. You just get the pleasure of sitting back and enjoying an original, thought-provoking, and well made sci-fi, action thriller."
