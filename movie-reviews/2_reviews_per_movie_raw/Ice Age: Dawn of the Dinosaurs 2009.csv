","Ice age 3 was really funny and it stays true to the series. Same old characters, a whole new adventure that everyone at any age can enjoy.<br/><br/>I saw the critics and I thought to my self that it would be good, but I didn't expect much, but I really did enjoy it more than I thought. It may not be the best compared to the other Ice Age films, but it still a great thrill ride that the audience can enjoy.<br/><br/>And if you find a theater near you that has it in digital 3D, go and watch it in 3D, because the action and adventure will excite you even more than it actually does.<br/><br/>Normally people think since it's a third part, then the movie won't be that great, but hear me when I say that keep that thought out of your mind and parents, take your kids with you, they are sure to leave with a smile and a long lasting excitement for more.<br/><br/>100% enjoyable, its a 10!"
"RichardSRussell-1","8","80","116","1 July 2009"," A Joyous Delight
","I haven't had so many laff-out-loud moments in a movie for a long time. There's about an even mix of verbal and visual gags in this 3rd installment of the Ice Age family saga, they're all fresh instead of hackneyed, and they all work. You wouldn't think a film set in the age of mammoths would be able to run a parody of the old ""red wire vs. blue wire"" time-bomb scenario, but they find an ingenious way to do it.<br/><br/>Now those among you who haven't fallen prey to creationism are well aware that mammoths are very large mammals (and hence quite recent in geological time), while the last of the dinosaurs went extinct 65,000,000 years ago. So how does the plot explain their coexistence? Well, it seems that there's this entire hidden tropical world underneath the eponymous ice, and our heroes literally fall into it. (Don't overthink it.)<br/><br/>Suddenly Manny the mammoth and his pregnant mate Ellie discover that they're not only not the largest creatures on Earth, as they'd thot, but actually pretty petite compared to the Mama T. Rex, who in turn has to look up to Dad. It's a classic tale of nature red in tooth and claw, except for nobody actually getting eaten. (Well, several critters are swallowed whole but subsequently disgorged, slimy with saliva but basically unhurt; family film, y'know.)<br/><br/>The animation is terrific. Judging from the end credits, apparently the Astor beaver trade, long thot to be extinct, has experienced a renaissance in the animated-fur factories of California. Dino babies and mammal kids are ridiculously endearing. The 3-D is likewise terrific, well used where appropriate (especially in conveying a sense of scale for the underworld) but not overdone. The one carp I have is that 3-D simply does not lend itself to dissolves between scenes; I'm guessing the filmmakers figured this out themselves, as most of the time they used cuts.<br/><br/>The characters, familiar now from the 2 previous films, are well acted with distinctive personalities, and the comic-relief possums have an expanded role. New to the cast is Scratte, a long-lashed female squirrel who, in a running subplot (including mini-cartoons to both start and end the flik), vies with the iconic acorn for the undying devotion of Scrat. As a devotee of the tango, I particularly appreciated their version of it. Also new is Buck, a bold, intrepid, 1-eyed buccaneer of a weasel, voiced by Simon Pegg with British accent in full flower.<br/><br/>Really, it's amazing to realize how much stuff they managed to cram into barely an hour and a half. Never a dull moment, never a missed step. Why, then, does it not get my top rating? Not at all because, as a comedy, it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously. After all, Dogma was a comedy, and it maxed out on my rating scale. But Ice Age 3 wasn't quite an entire story, more a collection of loosely related parts. Every one of those parts was well done, tho; indeed, I'd gladly take any of them over the entire 2.5 hours of the noxious Transformers; sadly, this much better film probably won't do nearly as well at the box office. Too bad."

","My wife and I attended an early press screening for the third Ice Age installment two weeks ago and had a wonderful time. The film easily tops the second outing of the series, and is right on par with the first - with just the right mixture of new characters and settings vs. the older ones we've all grown to love (especially Scrat. I can watch a whole movie with this guy).<br/><br/>This time around, Manny and Ellie are expecting a baby mammoth, something that leads to unexpected responds from Diego and Sid. When Sid decides to become a parent himself in return, he steals three giant eggs he accidentally bumps into, only to later realize they're dinosaur eggs that belong to a pretty angry mother. When mother-dinosaur kidnaps Sid, it's up to Manny and friends to return him home safely. Adventures ensue as they find out that underneath their icy world lives a land filled with enormous and sometimes menacing dinosaurs, one which our friends would need to cross in order to rescue Sid.<br/><br/>Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is cute but not insulting, the visuals are stunning and if you forgive the obvious historical loophole (there were no dinosaurs during the Ice Age) you can actually have quite a good time. The dinosaurs add a lot to the plot, and there's actually a very cool, nice sense of adventure throughout the film, one that was somewhat missing (in my opinion) from the previous installment. All this adds to a fun and thrilling experience - alongside the visuals, jokes and general good atmosphere.<br/><br/>To sum things up - Ice Age 3 is an above average animated film, that'll appeal to grown-ups and kids alike. I gave it 9 out of 10."
"simonwest80","9","83","128","27 June 2009"," Cool as Ice...................again
","OK big plus here - this film is better than the 2nd which i didn't particularly like and if you can go and see it in 3D (For the people who criticise this ""gimmick"" go and try it 1st rather than base your opinion on other ""critics"" opinions) do so as it is excellent and really beats the years earlier examples of 3D films (although i didn't see Coraline at the cinema so cant comment on a comparison).<br/><br/>The person who didn't laugh - go on ebay and find a sense of humor - the whole cinema was laughing through out the film and i really enjoyed the jokes - yes you saw most of them coming but hey its a kids cartoon.<br/><br/>The story is easy to follow and again those people moaning its not real jeez ITS A KIDS CARTOON - when do they need to make sense or be realistic..............???<br/><br/>Every kid i have spoken to loves it.<br/><br/>It does have one problem that it is pretty much instantly forgettable along with most the other sequels out at the moment but for the 1hr30mins it was all good fun and a nice way to spend a sat/Friday evening with the Mrs and kids. <br/><br/>Not gonna win any Oscars for originality but could take the gong for best CGI very very good job if you also consider the back drop and how well it works in 3D.<br/><br/>Ah and how can i forget Scrat - in typical Mr Bean style he returns and does not disappoint, come on guys give the mouse/rat thing his own movie!"
"fred-kolb","7","14","18","16 September 2009"," Enjoyable for kids and adults, but the concept starts to become old
","--Some minor spoilers, skip the part that describes the plot if you don't want to know anything about it--<br/><br/>Personally, I didn't like the second ""Ice Age"" movie that much. I thought it just wasn't original enough, and couldn't make an impact compared to the great original. So, since movies franchises often have the tendency to get worse with each sequel, I wasn't expecting very much of the third Ice Age movie ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"". But, I have to admit, it was quite entertaining and funny, with many jokes and funny situations. The change of location from the white ice world, the main characters inhabited in the first two films, to the lush and green jungle, also did the movie some good, because the optic is just different and more exciting. While the first Ice Age movie still remains unreached by either of the sequels, the third one considerably improves on the second one, with more humor, better action and interesting ideas.        <br/><br/>Manfred and Ellie, the two mammoths, are expecting a baby, and Manfred, who is really happy to become a father tries everything to make his wife more comfortable and happy. Meanwhile, the saber-toothed tiger Diego, has to deal with the fact, that he is not the youngest anymore, and that his instincts and reflexes are getting worse. He decides to leave his herd, because he feels his life is coming to an end. Sid, the sloth, wants to have children of his own, and when he discovers three abandoned eggs in a cave, he decides to take them with him. One morning, he realizes that three dinosaurs have hatched from the eggs, and to make matters worse their mother is already looking for them. She attacks Sid and her three babies and abducts them to her world, a large, lush and green jungle, that is located directly under the thick layer of ice. Manfred, Ellie, the two opossums Crash and Eddie, decide to save Sid and eventually meet up with Diego on the way again. They are then joined by the mad wannabe pirate Buck, a weasel, who lost his eye to a gigantic monster, named Rudy, that lives somewhere deep in the jungle. Sid, meanwhile, tries to convince the dinosaurs' mother, that he can provide more for the children than her, but eventually has to accept that children belong to their real mother. The squirrel Scrat, once again reunited with his precious nut, has to deal with an entirely new problem. A femme fatal squirrel, who uses her charm to take Scrat's nut away from him. Being a lot smarter and trickier than him, she gets to keep the nut for most of the time, but eventually falls in love with Scrat, after he saves her from deadly lava. But what is more important to Scrat, his nut or his new girlfriend?<br/><br/>With so many animated movies flooding the market these days, it becomes quite hard to come up with new ideas. Talking animals certainly isn't one, but if the characters have enough history and emotion, it really doesn't matter. ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" really profits from a slightly new approach to the material, which includes some very obvious parodies. The new character of Buck was most definitely inspired by Jack Sparrow from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and the final battle could have directly come from one of the ""Star Wars"" movies. Then we have the dinosaurs, who are, of course, extremely evil and always hunt down the main characters. All in all, the movies appears slightly stretched and has some relatively slow bits, for which the beginning and ending compensate, though. Especially the first 20-25 minutes, are some of the funniest in any Ice Age movie. And the scenes involving Scrat and his new girlfriend are just as funny as they have always been.<br/><br/>Then we have once again, the actors who give the characters their voices. Ray Romano, who has such a unique voice, speaks Manfred, Denis Leary is Diego, John Leguizamo is Sid and Queen Latifah is Ellie. Buck, the pirate, is voiced by British actor Simon Pegg. Animated movies can never be judged according to acting, because the true leading actors here are the animators. But just as we are used to, the previously mentioned actors put their best effort into providing their character's voice.<br/><br/>So, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is entertaining and enjoyable, but certainly not the best animated movie of the year. Still it is a good 90 minute time filler, and those who enjoyed the previous Ice Age films, will definitely also like this one. (3.5/5)<br/><br/>The third installment in the Ice Age movie franchise is funny and entertaining, with some very original ideas, but certain lengths throughout the entire film."
"ccthemovieman-1","10","27","39","18 December 2009"," 'Ice Age' Getting Better & Better
","Frankly, I was shocked this movie was so good. I mean, sequels aren't supposed to this entertaining, are they? This Ice Age series - three films, so far - just keeps getting better and better, funnier and funnier.<br/><br/>I think the key to their success is discovering what the movie's fans liked and putting those two characters in larger roles. I am speaking of ""Sid The Sloth,"" who is always hilarious and voiced magnificently by John Leguizamo. ""Sid"" has more lines in this movie than the other two, I would venture to say.....and that's fine with me and most other folks.<br/><br/>The other ""character"" is ""Skrat,"" the squirrel, who is joined by a female squirrel. ""Skrat"" has the hots for her, but she's still no competition when it comes to the elusive acorn. Nothing is more important than holding onto one of those and both squirrels are very funny in their battles for possession of that acorn.<br/><br/>As for the story, just picture Sid pretending to be a mom to a threesome of baby dinosaurs. That's all you need to know - it's pretty wild. In all, this is an extremely funny film which also looks, as the other two did, fabulous on Blu-Ray."
"shanpanjwani","9","33","49","21 June 2009"," An excellent and welcome addition to the Ice Age franchise
","I saw this film earlier today, since it was a sneak preview, and I must say, it was fabulous! When I first heard about the sneak preview, I actually had some doubts about whether to go or not. I recently went to a sneak preview of the proposal, which wasn't half bad, but the theater wasn't even half full!!! when i got into this one, all but the fist two rows were completely full! Still i got a great seat. As for the movie, it was great. All the characters had their fair share of laughs, and they all were equally great! The story revolves around change: Manny and Ellie are together, she is pregnant, Diego wants to move on, and Sid wants to belong and have a family. In order to attain his goal, he goes to look for some friends, but falls through a sheet of ice in the process. He then sees three eggs which turn out to be dinosaur eggs, and believes that they were abandoned. He takes them, and chaos ensues. I would reveal more of the plot, but that could take hours! It may seem like a thin plot if you haven't seen the movie or read the script, but once you do, you will realize just how dense the storyline really is. The cinematography is spectacular, the pop culture references(past and present) are very creative, and the addition of real d 3D just adds more to the film: it is perhaps the best 3D I've seen! Also, all the characters, as said earlier, are also great, but new additions, such as the dinosaurs, and of course Simon Pegg as Buck, are also very funny. There is also times where some of the jokes from Manny seem like the material that made Ray Romano a household name! However, the tie that binds the movie together is the emphasis on the main theme-family and friendship. There are some very dramatic scenarios that display them throughout the movie, and even allow you to feel like you can relate. Since most triquels like Shrek the Third and Spiderman 3 are considered to be clunkers, this will surely be a breath of fresh air to the sub-genre, and is definitely worthy of being an addition to the Ice Age trilogy. A must see in 3D!!! 9/10"
"claudio_carvalho","9","9","11","9 July 2011"," A Wonderful and Entertaining Tale of Love and Friendship
","Manny is anxious with the pregnancy of Ellie and builds a playground for the offspring. Meanwhile, Scrat disputes an acorn with the female Scratte and they fall in love with each other while Diego feels old since he is unable to catch a gazelle. The lonely Sid feels jealous of Manny and Ellie and when he finds three dinosaur eggs in an underground cave, he steals and brings them to the surface. He hatches the eggs during the night and on the next morning, three dinosaur babies believe that Sid is their mother and follow him everywhere. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the real dinosaur mammy seeks their offspring out and when she finds the trio, she brings them back with Sid to her underground world. Manny, Ellie, Diego, Crash and Eddie pursue the dinosaur to rescue their friend and stumble with a dangerous underground world. But they are helped by the smart and talkative one-eyed weasel known as Buck that wears a patch and chases the dangerous Rudy, who was the responsible for the loss of his eye.<br/><br/>""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is a wonderful and entertaining tale of love and friendship, with adorable characters and witty situations. The love of Manny with Ellie is very beautiful; the triangle of love among Scrat, the acorn and Scratte is hilarious; the love of Sid with the three dinosaurs is funny and also heartbreaking. For me, the best scene in the story is when mammy dinosaur brings the three babies to the top of a tree and Sid is unable to climb it and says goodnight to the children. But maybe the most important is the friendship Manny, Ellie, Diego, Crash and Eddie with Sid, risking their lives to save their friend. My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): A Era do Gelo 3"" (""The Ice Age 3"")"
"troykleasner","7","60","99","21 June 2009"," Surprised that I enjoyed it.
","Not a bad flick. I don't remember liking the first one, skipped the second one and the only reason I went to see this one was because it was a ""sneak preview"" that started right after the movie I had gone to see and it was in 3D. I recommend seeing this one in 3D as it was worth the extra couple dollars. I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The story was really stupid and didn't make any sense (dinosaurs living under the ice???), but it kept me interested the entire movie, partly because of the hilarious side story with the acorn loving animal and an excellent job by Simon Pegg as Buck the weasel(I just got done watching his TV show ""Spaced"" so maybe I am a little partial), who I had no idea was going to be in the movie. This movie also did a wonderful job of keeping everyone in the audience interested. The theater was packed and the only things you heard besides the movie was popcorn chomping and laughter, lots of laughter. Definitely worth seeing at the theater."
"popcornposse","8","52","87","29 June 2009"," A simple story executed to near perfection.
","Its all about family in essence. Starting one, keeping one, becoming one, protecting one. A family film about family is always going to ring the right bells (unless Eddie Murphys in it), and this is no exception! It's funny, its sharp, it's clever, and when it wants too will tug on your heart strings. It's everything a great family film should be. It has just as much humour to keep the grown ups happy as it does the kids.<br/><br/>It's not perfect; it starts fairly slowly with scenes we've already scene twenty times in the trailer, but the further you go into this adventure the more fun you will have.<br/><br/>A fantastic new addition to the franchise is ""Buck"" (Simon Pegg) a looney tune hermit possum who joins the herd around half way through. When he enters the scene, the whole movie shifts up a gear! Some of the stuff he comes out with will have you rolling in the isle! If you have the chance, you must see it in 3D! It's amazing how this new version of such an old and dated technology can suck you even deeper into a film! The chases are more exciting, the locations more real, it works so well! And it doesn't give you a migraine!<br/><br/>Overall - Like a franchise should, Ice Age gets better and better and better! If you liked the first, you'll love the second! If you loved the second, you'll go crazy for the third! 2D - 8/10 3D - 9/10"

"halljust49","9","3","3","17 March 2013"," Best Ice Age movie out there!
","I really loved Ice Age 3, I find dinosaurs very cool and that is was makes this a 4, then the movie grasps the concept of family, having one, losing one and sharing one, then making one that pushes it to a 7. The movie also felt more well done than the first second and fourth, fourth was the worst.<br/><br/>Modeling of mommy dinosaur or Momzilla and the babies was very well done, the movie has the best adult humor in it out of the whole series and Ice Age 3 would be a movie for even adults to watch.<br/><br/>Buck was the best ""new"" addition to the herd, until he left for Rudy at the end. He was hilarious like this:<br/><br/>Manny: Look when exactly did you loose your mind? Buck: Hmm, three months ago, I woke up one morning married to a pineapple... AN UGLY PINEAPPLE... *sigh* But I loved her.<br/><br/>That was funny as hell, and the Chasm of Death part was funny. Buck pushed it to a 8.<br/><br/>And some of the scenes were kind of sad, like the farewell of the Dino-babies and Momzilla and the scene just before the eggs hatched. (You can see the babies in the eggs from the sunlight and Sid holding them and his shadow looks like a woman rubbing here tummy when she was pregnant) That pushes it to a 9.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was EXCELLENT, in my top 10, it grasped the concept of family, had cute baby dinosaurs, had dinosaurs in it, had a beautiful jungle under all of that ice.<br/><br/>Good job Mike Thurmeier, I hope you direct Ice Age 5 yourself and bring the Momzilla back and the babies and Buck, it will be the either the new first best or second best Ice Age Movie!"
"shivam_s88","6","6","8","8 October 2009"," Ice Age 3: Age of Disappointment
","Again, please watch the first two parts of the series, Ice Age and Ice Age: The Meltdown. For two reasons: 1. It's just not justified watching a sequel if you haven't seen the earlier parts. 2. This part is not as great as the first two. -- Okay, now Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs. First of all, don't go for the 3D version, pure waste of money. As for the movie, one word: disappointment. I have got to stop expecting more from the sequels from now, but can't help it; promos they make, raise your hopes! Ice Age 1 and 2 were these super hilarious, and no exaggeration there, movies that made you laugh your lungs out! I hope I could say the same for Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs. I feel the recent trend is to add an unnecessary Emotional-Angle to the sequels, despite what genre the prequels belonged to. I'm talking about something what you got to see in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Terminator Salvation, Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa and now, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs. Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs did not have more than two or three laugh-out-loud moments. The makers of the movie should keep this thing in mind, why the prequels became hit? Ice Age series was supposed to be an out-and-out comedy series, but thanks to this sequel, it isn't anymore. I can't remember one exceptional scene or moment in the movie that I should mention here. But if we take into account the first two parts, I can make a whole list of awesome scenes. Rest, you can look forward to some good wit from Diego and Manfred, and yeah, Sid, Crash and Eddie are awesome as usual. Anyway, I'd suggest you watch it at a not-so-expensive theater, since going at an upscale one or buying DVD will not be worth it. Or you can just wait for the DVDrip torrent to come out. Honestly, I felt bad writing about Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs like this."
"dobbin-4","5","17","29","5 July 2009"," Sometimes funny, sometimes not
","This is the third movie in the highly enjoyed Ice Age trilogy and after the fantastic first one and sadly slightly lackluster second movie, my reactions when I heard of this movie was that of not caring. But when I had seen everything else at the cinema I went, and I must say this movie was pretty entertaining. Its plot, while predictable kept me entertained and the character's were kept true to their usual self's.<br/><br/>Some negative movies though is the humour it resorts to if a scene starts to drag on a little and this film we saw a lot of the same humour used in 100 films before it but only a small fraction of the films jokes were taken up with this and mostly the film kept original.<br/><br/>Overall, I think I enjoyed the movie more then the second one, but the second one had this bit for style and grace. I will give this movie 52%."
"C-Younkin","5","21","38","29 June 2009"," Mediocre third flick
","A meltdown couldn't stop the ""Ice Age"" crew the last time so now the filmmakers are upping the ante with dinosaurs. Does it make sense? No. If this third film in the series does as well as the first two, will Manny, Sid, and Diego next contend with aliens? I wouldn't put it past them. Heck, the only thing that's really supposed to make sense here is that these movies are trying to capitalize on a hit franchise. (""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" even more so as it rolls into theaters in not just 2-D but 3-D as well.) Just much like the third ""Shrek"", this is a forgettable and hollow installment, fine for kids but sure to have older fans of the series checking their watches.<br/><br/>The characters are all back. Manny Mammoth (Ray Romano) anxiously awaits the birth of his first child with Ellie (Queen Latifah). Diego the saber-tooth tiger (Denis Leary) sees his skills as a hunter being diminished and ponders leaving the herd. And Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo) feels like the odd man out and wishes for a family of his own. When he finds dinosaur eggs, Sid is determined to raise them as his own, not thinking that mama dinosaur is close by. She tracks Sid down and takes her eggs and him back to her underground valley habitat where dinosaurs and other animals live. One of them is a one-eyed, dinosaur-hunting weasel named Buck (Simon Pegg), who helps Manny, Diego, Ellie, and Ellie's possum brothers (Sean William Scott, Josh Peck) when they go looking for Sid.<br/><br/>Scrat the squirrel stars too, still trying to obtain that acorn. Usually his slapstick segments are some of the best parts of the film but even he is little more than lightly amusing. Scratte, a female squirrel, hinders his efforts this time and also serves as romantic counterpart but since neither talk and both seem to like the acorn more than each other, who cares. The same goes for the rest of the movie. The physical comedy gags are too far between and all that's left is a lot of outlandish personalities, most of which are more annoying than funny.<br/><br/>Plotting is limited, stretching the importance of family while at the same time doing nothing of any interest. Splitting the team up takes away from the fun, too many secondary characters only serve as a distraction, and the perils, which include plants, a large dino named Rudy, and floating lava will thrill the kids but be too dull for parents. This puts a damper on the 3-D animation as well, which has some nice snow and forest-filled landscapes but nothing that, figuratively, jumps off the screen about the characters or action.<br/><br/>The vocal actors are still matched up well, just they get very few actual funny things to say. Leguizamo's slurring, goofy performance as Sid is the most fun. Romano is well matched with the cautious, nasally Manny, as is Leary to the vicious Diego. And Latifah is sassy as Ellie. Simon Pegg gives the movie some life as Buck, a nutty safari-hunter who loves the thrill of the chase.<br/><br/>But we're a long way from the visual feast and energetic fun of ""Up"". I'm sure the kids won't seem to mind though. ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" exists for them. It's just too bad parents are forced to shell out big bucks for something that would have been just as good for cheap had it gone directly to DVD.<br/><br/>For more reviews, check out Leesmovieinfo.com"

","Many reviewers have stated that if you liked the first one, you'll love the second one and worship the third one. Not so. The original Ice Age told a genuine and well-crafted tale, and remains the only compelling film of the trilogy. The sequel, Meltdown, delved into nonsensical antics with little to no plot support. Alas, the third film follows a predictable storyline (mammoth has baby during critical moment; mother dinosaur arrives on cue) but manages to surmount the tired babble by way of a subterranean twist. Oh, yes, beneath the icy tundra is a hidden tropical paradise, home to prehistoric beasts long thought to be extinct. Twilight of the Dinosaurs would be more accurate. If you're looking for alliteration, then perhaps Twilight of the Pterodactyls would work.<br/><br/>This change of scenery opens up a whole new can of worms. Dawn of the Dinosaurs benefits from impressive cinematic sequences not witnessed in previous installments. The coolest sequence involves Buck, the legendary weasel, and Rudy, an albino baryonyx. The two warriors engage in an epic battle on the 'edge of oblivion' (during a storm above the jungle canopy). This provides an explanation for Buck's eye patch, which I initially thought may have been a phony garb. The fighter jet pterodactyls were also impressive.<br/><br/>Buck (short for Buckminster) is a compelling figure that stands out amongst an increasingly banal cast. Diego yearns for his previous life of predation and feels he's losing his edge. Manny has transformed into a cuddly giant, much the same as Shrek did. And Scrat is having trouble choosing between his love for the acorn and his love for an infuriating red squirrel-rat named Scratte. Sid the sloth and the possum twins are the only characters who retain their personality.<br/><br/>I think I'll take a break from animation for a while."

Jaws 3 did the same thing, except I cared enough to see the next person get eaten. This didn't make me care in the slightest.<br/><br/>There is an overabundance of Scrat in this movie as well. Out of the 90ish minutes, I figure a good 45 of it showed Scrat in some fashion. To me, Scrat should be an amusing side show, not a centerpiece.<br/><br/>In hindsight, I'm not sure why I bothered to go see this. At least I know now this will be my last foray into the ""Ice Age."" Skip this terrible movie entirely and save your money and your time."

","This movie agitated me. Yes, I know its for young kids, but the script was annoying. The Ice Age series should be extinct now. Yes the first one was good, but they have stretched this concept too far. Queen Latifah's character was annoying and the lines were so cliché of kids movies.<br/><br/>There's not much more to say about it. The movie was definitely the worst out of the three. The movie is boring and story line is predictable and is quite lame. Watch Wall-E and compare, this Ice Age isn't even close.<br/><br/>Ice Age needs to be extinct."

But that is too little to present it as a movie. <br/><br/>Mainly because...<br/><br/>The script is retarded! I felt like Sylvester Stallone was writing it! The movie seems like a sequence of random scenes a events - this may work great for Family Guy, but it does not for IA3.

What was happening after knows only God and a few millions people who actually sit through whole movie.<br/><br/>Jokes were too forced and rare. Feels like 10 ""creative"" marketing guys were sitting together and everyone had to felt the obligation to actually contribute something to the movie. You just do not feel the passion and enthusiasm that was put into the first Ice Age.

"TheUnknown837-1","5","8","13","17 November 2009"," all the charm and wit that made the first two ""Ice Age"" pictures so wonderful has withered away and what we're left with is an entirely forgettable third installment
","Isn't it quite amusing that seven years ago, the creators of ""Ice Age"" declared that there would be no dinosaurs in their saga? In a way, that was false right from the start. Remember, there was a dinosaur frozen in ice in the first movie, two prehistoric marine animals let loose in the second, and now here we are, and a tyrannosaurus rex is stomping around having left a subterranean underground prehistoric world in search of her eggs. The idea of reusing the old underground prehistoric world and incorporating it with the Ice Age saga is enough evidence to tell that the filmmakers are running out of ideas. The animation is still top-notch, the voice-acting is great, and the intentions are still good, but the charm and wit and magic that made the first two movies so much fun has withered away and what we are left with is a cheap thirty-minute cartoon expanded into a feature-length movie. ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is a movie made strictly for profit and not for entertainment. It's not really a bad movie, but unlike its two predecessors, it's completely forgettable.<br/><br/>In the third installment in this once wonderful series, Manny (Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) are expecting a baby. Sid, a little jealous and feeling left out, stumbles upon three dinosaurs eggs in a frozen underground cave and, being Sid, thinks he has what it takes to raise them. The eggs hatch into three baby dinosaurs and then, just as you'd expect, mama arrives, takes her brood and snatches up Sid as well. And then its up to Manny, Ellie, her possum brothers, and Diego to go and rescue him in an underground world where dinosaurs still live. As they search, they are guided by a cocky and pretentiously goofy possum who is like a cross between Captain Ahab and the explorer Frank Buck.<br/><br/>There is nothing wrong with the movie visually. But where it really counts, in the story and characters, it's crippled. The movie is composed of dialogue that is one hundred percent deliberately chirpy and ostentatious, with the filmmakers expecting you to believe that just because they're telling a joke, that you will laugh. The humor in this movie is the same kind you will find in any half-hour cartoon and maybe even a little less profound. Only the character of Buck, the possum, really contains the magic and wit that made the first two movies so much fun.<br/><br/>As for everybody else, they are either watered down or pushed a few too many steps ahead. For instance, I liked Manny when he was a moody mammoth, but I don't like him so much now that he's a happy, jolly guy like Santa Claus with fur and a trunk. The whole pregnancy subplot was just publicity and serves no purpose in the story. Crash and Eddie the possums are no longer funny—Buck has all the humorous moments. And Diego's place in the film has completely watered down into basically cameo quality. He has a lot of screen time, but very little character and impact. Again, he has a problem that's eating away at him, but unlike in the first two movies, where the subplot was worked into making sense, here it really just flickers up now and again and never is fully encompassed upon. And worst of all, Sid the sloth, who always acted stupid but was once very funny, has become so ostentatiously dumb that he condescends into becoming irritating for the audience as well as the other characters.<br/><br/>And what about Scrat, the saber-toothed squirrel after his acorn? Well, guess what? He's boring now as well. Because the filmmakers came up with the incredibly dreadful idea of having him only chasing his acorn half the time and spending the rest of his time ogling at a female squirrel.<br/><br/>Now the movie is saved from being a total disaster by the character of Buck, who was enthusiastically voiced and animated, but he's just a supporting character. What made the first two movies so much fun? Whole casts of good characters, effective moments of humor and wit, developed stories, and a certain level of charm. All of that is gone in ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs."" This time the filmmakers decided to focus appeal strictly upon the very young members of the audience and forget all the techniques and imaginative works that made the first two films so enjoyable. In the end, ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is, in a single word, forgettable. This should have been a straight-to-DVD production. It's not worth a theater ticket."

","This is second film series that I did a personal research on and there are many negative reviews. I don't understand why most film critics and movie reviewers don't like this film. It is understandable for the first two films as there are plenty of shortcomings but this film is certainly so much better than predecessors. Not to mention, this film series is also rightfully children films; you can't expect it not to be lovable and be more appealing to children. There are already thousands of films out there that are more appealing to adults more than children and while their opinions may not affect all the audience worldwide... Come on, don't be harsh! D;<br/><br/>Anyway, kudos to Blue Sky Studios. Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (2009) is a delightful sequel and a very pleasant one. I love how the characters has been improved and developed since the last film and I liked this version of them, especially Manny and Ellie! There are also even more prehistoric baby animals in this film, I loved the baby mammoth and baby dinosaurs so much; they are so cute! How not to become a fan of Ice Age after watching this? T-T <br/><br/>Okay, moving away from commenting based personal likings, this film has beautiful visuals and an interesting world inspired by prehistoric times. Each film they introduce more distinct characters and add more spice to it; the plot is simple but fun to watch. It is truly a great pleasure to watch them again many days ago just to write on this!<br/><br/>On who will like this... If you liked their first and second film, you'll find yourself liking this film. Majority of people can never have enough of Scrat so people who loved him and prehistoric lovers will love this film too!<br/><br/>If you have never watched the Ice Age films, I would recommend you to watch this first as the first two films may be dead boring for you mature movie lovers."

","I have walked out on a handful of movies in my life. Ice Age 3 joins that handful. For the first 45 minutes of the film the plot meanders along aimlessly. The characters all act like self-centered boneheads, and un-comedic shenanigans feebly result.<br/><br/>I'm serious. I love digital animation. I love 3-d. But I realized while watching this movie that neither of those things can save a rancid stinker of a script. The only interesting aspect at all of the movie was the sabre-toothed squirrel and his acorn gag, which by the way can be seen in its entirety in the preview and was not new in any way.<br/><br/>My fiancée turned to me at one point during the movie and said ""it's in 3-d, isn't it?"" The effect was so watered-down that we could no longer tell. Plus, there was no aspect of the story which caught our interest whatsoever.<br/><br/>Good animated comedies are funny to the adults in their audience as well as their kids. Dozens of digitally-animated movies succeed wildly in that respect.

And this pile of garbage holds true to that mushy ""American family"" feel they try to regurgitate over and over and over again. Making way too many direct and obvious references to the lives humans lead. Now yes it may be a movie ultimately aimed at children but I for one really enjoyed the 1st and 2nd movies. They were well written, incredibly funny and top-notch on design. This however, is just cheesy punchline after cheesy moment after cheesy character. There were far too many jokes referenced to snot and other 'gruesome' mucus-y type fluids, which were way over-used and overrated as a gag. Also, some of the dialogue was just plain mean and questionably perverse. Like the lines ""Why are we saving Sid? I don't even like Sid, no one does, hes an idiot hahahaha"" and ""I dunno why everyone says 'I've got your back', all the best bits are in the front"".<br/><br/>All in all, the movie lacked any real substance, the characters were old and bland and the whole thing just ended up being yet another Hollywood movie out to make a quick buck, which will be forgotten in the weeks after its taken off cinema.<br/><br/>What a waste of talent on the animators' parts..."
"DICK STEEL","6","8","15","4 July 2009"," A Nutshell Review: Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs
","I think Ice Age has already established a strong franchise, and if it sticks to its own narrative formula, it should still find some legs to carry on the laughs with more movies to come, since the character base keeps on expanding, and unless the box office receipts tells the filmmakers otherwise. Like the adage goes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.<br/><br/>As always, the film opens with the adventures of Scrat from what you would already have seen from the trailer, where he encounters Scratte and has to decide which to give up, a potential relationship with a lover who sometimes prove to be manipulating his feelings, or that perennial piece of acorn that is always just as elusive. That'll bring you to the opening credits, before you're introduced to the all too familiar characters in Manny (Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) the Mammoths, Sid (John Leguizamo), Eddie (Josh Peck) and Crash (Seann WIlliam Scott) the possums, and Diego (Denis Leary) the sabre-tooth tiger, that rag- tag team of a makeshift herd who have stuck together through thick and thin, ready for one more adventure.<br/><br/>The story's somewhat scattered this time round, with each character being pre-occupied with their respective concerns. Many and Ellie having to face some jitters with the looming expectations in being new parents, and in so this threatens the dynamics of their herd, with the aging Diego having his morale low due to his physical deterioration and decision to leave the herd, and Sid being a little more idiotic than before, this time adopting some three baby dinosaurs as his own kids.<br/><br/>And because this surrogate parent role was especially not welcomed by the baby dinosaurs parent, which turns out to be of the T-Rex species, Sid's failure to give them back meant they all had to be forcefully taken to the dino's natural habitat, in a lost world still filled with lush greenery and plenty of other roaming prehistoric, and supposedly extinct creatures. In other words, with the action taking place in this part of the world, the title ""Ice Age"" did somewhat seem like a misnomer, as gone are the usual white, snow covered environment, that made way for thick forests and undergrowth.<br/><br/>Which somewhat took the polish off the film, and I felt that both the characterization and the plot and subplots suffered. The usual themes which has been beaten to death in the earlier films, like trust, sacrifice and friendship get repeated again here, and the first half of the film really looked tired despite the 3D enhancement that I've opted for, with only depth of field, and as far as I can tell, no specific set action sequence to milk the potential of a 3D presentation. The story became bogged down with trying to handle too many different character motivations at the same time that it only managed to give each some cursory attention. <br/><br/>Thankfully the slack was picked up in time for quite an exciting finale. This was in fact like a culmination of what the new character, voiced by Simon Pegg, could do, as Buck the possum which had gone bonkers. The filmmakers here seemed totally satisfied with allowing Buck to steal the show, and stole the film it did, with his Jack Sparrow-like swagger for that sense of adventure, coupled with an unsound mind, a fearless and gung-ho attitude, and plenty of wonderfully crafted dialogues and comedic instances. Comedy, a staple in the Ice Age movies, seemed to be stuck at a low with the usual name-dropping references to pop culture that Buck actually arrived at the right time to save the day.<br/><br/>What could be a problem was of course the lack of a strong antagonist to shake things up a little. In the first installment we got the sabre-tooth tigers, and the second being a fight against the nature's wrath. This one had a tough cookie dinosaur in a T-Rex, but seriously, do we need another Rex as a bad character? Otherwise the ""villains"" just pop up whenever the situation calls for it, or became a sort of an enigma before finally appearing for some 2-3 minutes worth of screen-time. This made the film lose that sense of urgency in developing its narrative, and looked for the most parts that it was just coasting along, waiting for something major to happen.<br/><br/>Given the way it bade farewell, I think there is still enough fuel for a couple more Ice Age movies, but the next time, I'm hoping for a lot more focus, a lot more genuine comedy, and for the animation to remain as flawless as it currently already is, if not better. Amongst the three, my least liked, story-wise, but it surely had the most memorable character of the lot in Buck."

","I'm really shocked at all of the raving comments for this movie. It was an utterly bland, humorless, and predictable film. I wasn't expecting much based on the trailers, and I wasn't disappointed in that respect. This was the same sort of bland that Shrek 3 was; not a bad or terrible film, but just obviously stretching for laughs (and falling short), and completely rote and predictable dialog and situations. The actors sounded tired recording their parts. I said to my wife during the film ""this should have been released directly to video, like one of the Land Before Time sequels"". That all said, the animation is fantastic, for what it's worth. This film is nowhere near as funny as the original Ice Age, but then the kids enjoyed it and that's the main point, I suppose."
"steve-bailey-1","5","26","64","21 June 2009"," Iced-over storyline and action
","James Bond, Harry Potter, and Star Wars notwithstanding, there are not too many movie franchises that aren't gasping for breath by the third entry. The latest evidence is the animated comedy ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs."" <br/><br/>Like the ""Shrek"" movies, the ""Ice Age"" stories began modestly but have now caved under the weight of too many characters. No. 3 brings back the wooly mammoth Manny (voiced by Ray Romano); his significant other Ellie (Queen Latifah); Diego (Denis Leary), the macho tiger; the hapless sloth Sid (John Leguizamo); and the wordless squirrel Scrat (Chris Wedge).<br/><br/>The first few scenes are ominously discouraging. Ellie's is shown to be ""with child,"" and Diego is starting to feel his age. So we get a lot of touchy-feely dialogue about mortality and sharing your emotions â€“ not the kind of talk you're eager to receive from a couple of wooly mammoths.<br/><br/>These characters have worn their more endearing traits down to a nub. Sid was always meant to irritate his on-screen friends, but now he gets under our skin as well. Ray Romano, in what was once his only credible movie role, makes Manny as grating as his ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" persona was. And if you've seen Denis Leary on his TV series ""Rescue Me,"" you know that the last emotion he should be asked to display is sensitivity.<br/><br/>As if just giving enough screen time to each returnee wasn't enough to intimidate the movie makers, they added an underground world of dinosaurs, so the whole gang can get chased around and scream as if they're in Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>Then they get a travel guide, in the form of a macho weasel named Buck (Simon Pegg), so that the movie can score a few ""Apocalypse Now"" jokes.<br/><br/>Who's supposed to care about any of this guff? Cartoony as they were, the first two movies made you feel as though something was as stake for these creatures. Now they've turned into stand-up comics, delivering little zingers before they lumber off-screen. The movie alternates between these puny jokes and drawn-out scenes of frantic action, neither of which adequately carry the story or its many subplots.<br/><br/>Finally, it must be noted that the movie is in 3D, with the usual cheesy glasses provided at each screening. If you're a fan of this format, ignore my carping. But I share critic Roger Ebert's view that if animation is done plausibly enough, a viewer shouldn't require special glasses to be dazzled by it. Here, 3D is just another prominent distraction."

","Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs - what i like in the movie is the new character Buck (voice by Simon Pegg), slightly crazed weasel. He is like this small creature who is going to take over the largest dinosaur called Rudy, (a white Baryonyx that is the world's biggest carnivorous dinosaur),oh yes bigger than Tyrannosaurus Rex. He is this miniature Rambo fighting in the jungle who knows hot to protect himself and the people around him. The characters' attitude is again awesome and he says that you have rules in the jungle, and the first rule is to ""Listen to Buck"".<br/><br/>The story of Ice Age 3 is about being a part of the family, in their case is being part of a herd that stays together, lives together and then has a brilliant adventure together in protecting each other. Ellie (voice by Queen Latifah) and Manny (voice by Ray Romano) are having a baby and Manny has baby proofed nature. There is this potion of jungle where he has removed all the pointy objects, covered all the twigs with snow balls that it does not hurt the baby. At the same time, Sid (voice by John Leguizamo) and Deigo (voice by Denis Leary) are feeling left out from the herd, that is normal.<br/><br/>The adventures start when Sid finds the dinosaur eggs and the hatch to know that they are the eggs of T-Rex, Sid tries to make the hardcore carnivores get converted to become vegetarian, but in vain. Then, one the Mom T-Rex arrives, she takes the three babies and Sid to whole new world where the Dinosaurs are still not completely extinct. This where they meet Buck.<br/><br/>My favorite sequence from the movie is the chase when Buck is flying one of the bird like dinosaurs to save Sid from falling into the lava waterfall and is being chased by even more vicious bird like dinosaurs who are trying to attack them (Buck, Crash, Eddy) in an aerial combat. You need to watch it to believe it. This is the favorite animation sequence.<br/><br/>Scrat, has new thing to seek other than the Acorn, this time it is Scratteeeee. She is seductive, beautiful, battering her eyelids to gain attention of Scrat only to get to the acorn. In the end, they play this song with the credits which was again, super awesome and there is Sid in a very funny dance moves.<br/><br/>Sid, Manny, Ellie, Deigo, Crash and Eddie are their usual self.

","This film is about the Sid bringing home three dinosaur eggs in order to start his own family that he longs for.<br/><br/>The animation in ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is very good. The initial scenes which Sid finds the eggs are impressive, as the shadows and the amount of light on the eggs changes when Sid moves. The scene where an animal falls into water looks actually perfectly real and not animated.<br/><br/>However, the content of the film was a major bore. The same supposedly funny material keep coming up, as if the filmmakers ran out of jokes. I got so tired of squirrels chasing nuts and animals falling from height. The jokes may be entertaining if you do it once, but not when repeated thirty times. In addition, most of the entertainment is geared towards young children, which means there is not enough material to keep adults interested.<br/><br/>I find ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" tiresome and boring. I was waiting for it to end about half way through already."

I expect this movie would be really funny to a 5-8 year old, but for anyone much older than that, I think the constant poopoo humor will just be a letdown. The last two movies did a good job of entertaining little kids and adults alike, but this one is really only for the little kids, with all the jokes being about butts and farts and other bad smells.<br/><br/>In short, I would absolutely encourage you to spend your money on Up! or some other kids movie, as I was sorely disappointed with this one.

","To be perfectly honest, I wasn't a big fan of the first two Ice Age movies. The first one has a couple of solid jokes back-up with uninspired storytelling and cheap CGI. The seconds fixed any complaints I had with the animation but once again the laughs were futile and ineffective. Here we have Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs and with the prospect of 3-D to tantalise our taste buds it's hard not to get excited. But is this fossil becoming extinct? After the events of ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"", life begins to change for Manny and his friends: Scrat is still on the hunt to hold onto his beloved acorn, while finding a possible romance in a female sabre-toothed squirrel named Scratte. Manny and Ellie, having since become an item, are expecting a baby, which leaves Manny anxious to ensure that everything is perfect for when his baby arrives. Diego is fed up with being treated like a house-cat and ponders the notion that he is becoming too laid-back. Sid begins to wish for a family of his own, and so steals some dinosaur eggs which leads to Sid ending up in a strange underground world where his herd must rescue him, while dodging dinosaurs and facing danger left and right, and meeting up with a one-eyed weasel known as Buck who hunts dinosaurs intently.<br/><br/>Dawn of the Dinosaurs sports some great visuals, sweeping landscapes and phenomenal character design. Everything looks and sounds just as it should. The film spots some fantastic voice acting most prominently from Simon Pegg as Buck, what's trips them up is the lazy dialogue, as much as the trailer tried to deviate away from it, Buck is the focal point of the movie, he's in 80% of it and does a great job in every scene he is in. It's just a shame that by doing this they pushed the rest of the cast forcibly into the background. Dennis Leary who plays Diego has a prominently smaller role than in the previous film and acts as nothing more than a springboard for other characters. Here in lies the problem. The creators on Ice Age 3 have done a great job at capturing the look and feel of the era but have skipped over some serious character arch's, they resolve the main characters efforts but the supporting cast is criminally underused.<br/><br/>The wrighting, unfortunately, is no sharper than that of the first two films. Which is to say it's rather blunt? Characters peak in monotonous one liners, there are fart gags left right and centre and while the audience who feel in love with this series back in 2002 have grown up, the series is still playing catch up. It's a futuristic looking film that feels like it was written way back in 2002. It feels uncomfortably convoluted at times with each character having their own primary motives and suffers from what a lot of threequel suffer from. T.M.S.G.O. Which stands for too much sh*t going on. It's confusing especially for younger audience members. The most disappointing aspect is the 3-D which at times is utterly phenomenal, but there such a rare occasion that if it weren't for the glasses perched on your face you would forget you were watching a 3-D film.<br/><br/>Verdict: Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs looks years ahead of its time, it sports great visuals and an impressive vocal cast. The wrighting on the other hand are such in the Jurassic Era with a script stolen from""Animation for Dummies"" it's a admirable attempt, but a one that feels older than the fossils it encompasses. Compared to animation giant ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"" the 3-D is admirable but far from jaw-dropping. 2/5."

If the first two films were not particularly noteworthy but can be minimally enjoyed, this film was not capable of it. The idea that dinosaurs survived in a hole under the ice is absolutely stupid and shouldn't have been carried forward. It totally ruins the script! The characters are also not particularly interesting or worthy of positive note. Sid remains the most detestable character, for the reasons given in the criticism the previous films, and even Scrat has lost some charm. The pair of possums is, ultimately, who will escape the list of less positive moments of the film.

","I'm a fan of the Ice Age movies and I think they're quite funny to watch and it's one for kids and adults but is a trilogy always a good idea? After Ice Age 2: The Meltdown, a lot has happened for these lovable characters. Now that Ellie and Manny are together, they are going to have a baby which leaves Manny wanting everything to be perfect for when the addition arrives. Diego is bored and takes a look at his attitude and wonders if he's too laid-back about everything. Ice Age wouldn't be Ice Age without Scrat who is still trying to catch that acorn but has met his match when female sabre-tooth squirrel, Scratte, wants the acorn too. After Sid sees how happy Manny and Ellie are, he wants a family of his own so he steals three dinosaur eggs which leads to Sid being kidnapped to a weird underground world where his friends have to save him.<br/><br/>The animation is simply brilliant and very well done and the characters are funnier too, especially the little clips of Scrat and Scratte fighting over the acorn. The story in the movie was very good for a kids' movie and adults can be assured that they will like it too. The jokes were quite funny and there were some sneaky jokes in there for adults but children wouldn't probably see it. Also the one-liners in the movie are pretty funny too, such as when Manny says to Sid, ""Don't worry, you'll meet a nice girl with low standards"".

","All our favorite characters - including the new ones introduced in 'Ice Age 2' - are back for yet another adventure. It was delightful to see the new characters were not as annoying as in 'Ice Age 2'.<br/><br/>This installment plays like an 'Ice Age' vs 'Journey to the center of the Earth' meets 'Jurassic Park' - and its stunning! The element of danger is back, and - just like the first film - this one includes various genres including action, adventure, suspense, and humor that is actually funny - all at the appropriate time. The animation is stunning.<br/><br/>Scrat once again serves up a generous portion of fun and humor. The Tango scene is simply awesome!! (wonder how many times I watched this scene...). While other characters fall in love, Scrat still only has eyes for his beloved acorn. So funny! And then there's Sid, who discovers his Mother's instincts in this film... oh dear, oh dear, oh dear...<br/><br/>This was an amazing action adventure thrill ride that will appeal to young and old. Who doesn't like dinosaurs, and an unconventional rescue party...!"

","Passable adventure that departs from the Ice age aesthetic and tries to be a bit more Jurassical and Vernesian.<br/><br/>It works, it feels fresh, Manny's family drama doesn't improve it but this is a likeable adventure that never gets to any emotional intensity but for a very long saturday morning cartoon, it's not half bad."

","While I did enjoy Ice Age: The Meltdown, I would say this is a tad better and would be the second best Ice Age movie in the series.<br/><br/>Manny and Ellie are having a baby, while Sid wants to make his own family. He finds 3 eggs underneath the ground and they hatch and are revealed to be baby dinosaurs. Later on, a big dinosaur comes to take back her babies, along with Sid. Manny, Ellie, Diego, and Crash & Eddie go underground only see that an entire dinosaur world was underneath them. They meet up with a one-eyed, adventurously savage weasel, Buck (played by Simon Pegg) and he volunteers to help the herd to rescue Sid. While all of this is going on, Scrat meets a female squirrel named Scratte, and together they fight over an acorn, but become in love.<br/><br/>This sequel has a pretty good story. The fact that they had a Jurassic Park vibe going on made it very appealing for kids and adults. I remember I saw this in theaters, and I really enjoyed it. Even today, after rewatching it, it was still a solid sequel.<br/><br/>The animation is very good, the voice acting is great, the comedy works very well, and has some good dinosaur action going on.<br/><br/>Overall, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is a great sequel with a good heart to it."

","The Ice Age films have never achieved (or aspired to) the greatness of Pixar or the better films in Dreamworks' canon. That said, they've always had a light and easy charm that adults can enjoy right along with their kids. By now audiences know exactly what they're getting from an Ice Age film, and the best compliment one can pay this third film is that it maintains the quality of previous entries. What it lacks in originality it more than makes up for in improved visuals (a pterodactyl chase in particular is stunning), a fun turn by Simon Pegg as a wilderness warrior, and the simple fact that after three films they still keep coming up with innovative mini-stories about Scrat and that acorn."

"CinemaClown","Null","1","1","16 April 2016"," An Absolute Riot That's Well-Aware Of Its Limits.
","Although Ice Age never needed a sequel to begin with, the success of the second chapter did give its studio another franchise to milk for all its worth. The third instalment in the Ice Age series once again fails to offer a compelling story but for me it is the most enjoyable chapter in the saga so far, thanks in particular to its energetic pace & vibrant slapstick humour.<br/><br/>The story of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs finds Manny & Ellie venturing into parenthood as they are expecting a baby. Diego plans to leave the herd after suspecting that he's losing his predatory nature. And Sid comes across three seemingly-abandoned dinosaur eggs, deciding to adopt them, but is abducted by their real mother and is taken underground where an entire lost world exists.<br/><br/>Directed by Carlos Saldanha, Dawn of the Dinosaurs packs in plenty of hilarious moments even if it doesn't offer anything rewarding in the storytelling department. Scrat's misadventures continue to be the series' highlight moments but the story's adventurous vibe is finely maintained. Manny gets an interesting arc to work with but the rest simply tag along. And the manic one-eyed weasel owns his moments.<br/><br/>The fluid operation of the camera in addition to its vivid use of colour palette & fab implementation of the third dimension gives its images a rich texture & feel, new characters fit in with relative ease, Editing swiftly paces the narrative & there is attempt at humour in nearly every segment although not all of them work out. John Powell's score is in tune with unfolding set of events while the voice cast ably chip in with required inputs.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is a delightfully amusing, wildly entertaining & thoroughly mesmerising sequel that shouldn't even work but it does. It may not impress those who were expecting an emotionally rewarding tale with sensible characterisation but for those who are looking for a simple, relaxing & lighthearted extravaganza, it checkmarks all the required boxes. A romp ride that's well-aware of its limits, Dawn of the Dinosaurs is an absolute riot."

"johnnyboyz","6","1","1","5 March 2013"," It would appear moving away from the ice, on top of actually providing us with a little bit of adventure, was the answer all along.
","Can a film still be called ""Ice Age"" when it takes place somewhere that resembles the tropics? For two whole films now, we've followed the adventures of a mammoth; a sloth and a sabre tooth tiger across the barren, icy lands at a time when land and continents intercepted with one another as one great big piece of terrain. There we sight gags to do with fossils and about evolution; second unit sequences involving icicles and would-be water flumes in a state of being frozen solid as well as meek tracts on global warming threatening to burn up all the frost and ice. Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is a refreshing shift away from such things, the entry that moves things away from the above and into the locale of a jungle, a thriving; bustling zone wherein the crew are dwarfed by trees and shrubbery rather than glaciers and where the threat arrives in the form of dinosaurs. The sense of adventure is more omnipresent than usual, that sense of a space being alien or unfamiliar much more apparent. The answer, then, to the question is ""No"", but the film is all the more better because of it.<br/><br/>This sense of stark change is actually synonymous throughout the film, and things are genuinely better as a result. Not only has location changed, director of this edition Carlos Saldanha, with the more recurrent Mike Thurmeier, have started pairing the central characters off on top of having one of them face imminent fatherhood. All of this is before the distinct shift in filmic tone and narrative arc – an entry resisting depicting these animals trekking on a one way route across anonymous snowy plains trying to get somewhere, or deliver someone to someone else. Moreover, we're taking a leaf out of one of those old 60's monster movies wherein a bunch of people are stuck in a place time has forgotten; a place wherein strange creatures and dinosaurs rule the jungle dominated roost and the likes of Jackson's King Kong remake as well as 2001's second Jurassic Park sequel have much more recently dared to exploit on grander, bigger budgeted scales.<br/><br/>Gone too is the sardonic wit and general cynicism attributed to Manfred and Mammoth, replaced with a sort of 'goofy impending father' routine as he carries on with where he left off beside partner Ellie at the end of Ice Age 2. He is, of course, part of a group of three including Diego (Leary) and Sid (Leguizamo), the respective sabre toothed tiger and sloth; Diego of whom sees little future in his current predicament with these guys (facing an impending child on the scene/Sid's slapstick antics), and longs for an adventure as gags about old age and domestic suffocation rear up. Wouldn't you know it, Sid goes missing on account of a Tyrannosaurus Rex taking him after he stole, and then observed hatch, her eggs – thus, it's up to these remaining characters as well as the Seann William Scott and Josh Peck voiced quick-fire critters we were introduced to in the second film to tag along and save him. Upon stumbling upon a previously unaccounted jungle dominated world below the surface, they hook up with Simon Pegg's survivalist weasel Buck, who acts as their guide through the terrain. Interestingly, when we first encounter him, it is a recreation of the very instance Sam Neill's Dr. Grant character is rescued from all manner of prehistoric beats by the very boy he is involuntarily searching for in Jurassic Park III. As soon as those gas canisters go off, it is revealed to us right where we are in relation to this new addition and we ease into it in that sense.<br/><br/>It comes as a relief that we can slog through this sort of film once again after the tedious disaster that was Ice Age 2. This is funnier and more exciting, with a lot of adventure to be had out of it. There is an urgency to things this time, a huge dinosaur akin to Jurassic Park III's Spinosaurus is on their tail and that element of chase works better here than it did in number two, when flesh-hungry fish were gobbling up anything foolish enough not to respect the fact there was a massive thaw swallowing everything up behind them. Where things break down in this sense of children and adults liking the same content, however, are in the scenes when Manfred mulls over potential fatherhood; while few people below a certain age will get quite the desired kick out of seeing Buck emerge from a muddy swamp alá Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>Few people would argue against the recurring squirrel character Scrat being the funniest thing in any of the films, but where it is often advised in any walk of life not to try and mend things that are not broken, the film decides to revamp his own on-going crusade to finally snare an acorn he's been forever been attempting to obtain. The overlying joke inherent with this skit was always the cruel denial after the apparent security one would obtain what one wants, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs vamping up the core of the gag in their introducing of a female foil for Scrat; a sort of odd mesh of the Cadbury's Caramel Bunny with the jagged, brisk animations that came with the central characters from Disney's 1963 film The Sword in the Stone upon transformation into squirrels. Thus, these sequences have mutated into an odd, borderline bawdy, tease-and-denial routine wherein the laughs come hearty and somewhat regular, but with that nagging sensation at the back of one's mind as one realises this is a kids film. Regardless, the film is so much fun and is so immune to doing any wrong, that they've managed to mess around with the franchise's best and most popular item and still just about get it right."
"joben-525-633946","6","1","1","26 December 2012"," Desperate nonsense...but excellent desperate nonsense!
","'Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs' certainly makes the crew at Blue Sky Studios look desperate and deprived of ideas as they render straight off the ice age script (what the film is supposed to revolve around) and head under the ice to tackle dinosaurs. <br/><br/>Crazy? Certainly. <br/><br/>Ridiculous? Of course. <br/><br/>Is it good? Incredibly!<br/><br/>Though it may be what I have stated in the first paragraph, 'Dawn of the Dinosaurs' is a hilarious and visually fabulous tale of how Sid the Sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo) is taken hostage by a Tyrannosaurus-Rex and Manny (voiced Ray Romano), Diego (voiced by Denis Leary), Ellie (voiced by Queen Latifah) join forces with the hysterical one-eyed weasel named Buck (voiced by Simon Pegg).<br/><br/>Again, you may imply from the above the narrative is rather similar to 'The Meltdown' and the original. Yes this is true despite the completely different scenarios. The basic plot is very familiar and not much fresh ground is covered; the change of environments and villains means though it is far less noticeable.<br/><br/>The film's main highlight is Simon Pegg's weasel Buck who is outrageously funny from almost every line of dialogue. Pegg voiced the troublemaker perfectly like a can't-be-bothered-teenager and he is able to give him a distinctive cheeky attitude with effortless ease.<br/><br/>'Dawn of the Dinosaurs' is certainly ridiculous and mental in the fact it has nothing to do with ice age's and teaches you nothing about dinosaurs. However, it keeps the spark alive in the 'Ice Age' franchise with another consistent source of entertainment for all ages."
"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","6","1","1","2 December 2012"," Excellent visuals, funny gags and characters overshadow it's lackluster story and it's lack of heart & antagonist
","After the success of Ice Age 2: The Meltdown, another sequel is inevitable, but only this time, it became the start of a franchise that has completely gone downhill due to it's lackluster reviews despite it's success at the box office much like the previous film. One of our three friends named Sid gets captured by a T-Rex after he finds three of it's babies and it's up to Manny, Ellie, her possum brothers, Diego, and a new character named Buck to save him as they encounter some of the dangers that lie withing the dinosaur world.<br/><br/>Just a brief note, I like the first Ice Age. It was a classic and a great start for Blue Sky Studios. I also liked the first sequel as well. It wasn't as excellent as the original, but it was well executed due to one of the character's back-story. This one isn't as terrible as some say it is, but when it comes to a complex story, this one seemed to be lacking not only in it's heart, but it's antagonist and I completely understand why it got seriously panned by the critics.<br/><br/>To be fair, it does have a nice premise about our heroes meeting the dinosaurs for the very first time, but even that doesn't save the story itself from being too thin by using a lot of subplots (trying to save Sid from a mother T-Rex or volcano, encounter three dangerous courses with Buck, you name it) and the dialog, much like the second film, lacks the wit and irrelevance of the first Ice Age. The second half does get dragged a bit especially towards the end and the script isn't that good.<br/><br/>Flaws aside, I think I like the characters and their nice moments throughout the film especially Scrat who steals every scene along with a beautifully attractive new saber tooth squirrel named Scratte and the romance between is both funny and cute. The best character who steals the show the most goes to Buck voiced by Simon Pegg with his funny gags. In fact, the voice acting isn't that bad after all thanks to Ray Romano, Queen Latifah, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary and others. The music from John Powell isn't the strongest, but it's pretty decent, there are some gags that got a chuckle out of me and the pacing moves along very nicely. The strongest aspect goes to the visuals especially the look of the dinosaur world which is in my opinion the best aspect of the animation.<br/><br/>Overall, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs isn't a terrible entry to the franchise, but with a better story and a better script, it would've so much better. I understand that lots of people also hated it as much as the previous one, but I think that this is a decent third entry."
"kiddcarl-cornell","10","1","1","9 September 2012"," May be crazy, but overall hilarious with a capital ""H""!
","Following our love of the first two Ice Age films, my entire family and I expected a third one. It's just as hilarious (if not more) than the first two! As with ""The Meltdown"", ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" introduced us to new characters, Scratte, Scrat's love interest, and Buck, a weasel who bears traits similar to Crocodile Dundee (played by Simon Pegg of ""Shaun on the Dead"" and ""Spaced"" fame). It was a breathtaking experience (with outstanding colors) to see our favorite herd in a new dimension: the Dinosaur world! What more could you ask for? Seeing as Ice Age is a popular movie franchise like Toy Story, we can all relate to the characters at one point or another in our lives. The experience that Ellie and Manny share, Ellie giving birth to her first born child, is something that a lot of parents get excited about and Scrat and Scratte (pronounced Skrat-tay)'s story which regards love is something that we can all relate to.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you are a fan of Ice Age and enjoyed 1 and 2, I suggest that you watch ""Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"", you and your family will enjoy it dearly, and will want to watch it even more than once!"

","With Mannie (Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) shortly expecting their first child, Sid (John Leguizamo) fears for the future of the herd. Soon enough, Diego (Denis Leary) decides to leave after failing to catch a gazelle, fearing he has gone soft. Sid finds three eggs in an isolated underground grave which he excitedly adopts, only for them to hatch the next day into tyrannosaurus rex's. When their angry mother attacks the herd and takes her babies back with Sid with them, Mannie, Ellie, Diego, Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck) go off in search of rescue only to discover an underground lost world still inhabited by dinosaurs. It is a hostile environment and the group are soon under attack, but they are rescued by a demented one-eyed weasel named Buck (Simon Pegg) who becomes their guide through the treacherous jungle.<br/><br/>There seems to be continuing theme throughout the Ice Age films. It could be said the first film dealt with childhood, with the three hapless creatures dealing with a delicate baby, and the second film dealing with adolescence, with Mannie finally discovering a female mammoth and falling in love. Naturally, the third film has Mannie and Ellie having their own baby, and therefore focusing on adulthood. Even the sabre-toothed squirrel Scrat is growing up, finding a possible mate in Scratte, and giving all his attention to her rather than his beloved acorn (which seems to be lonely in an inspired yet quite bizarre love montage between the two). Although, in my opinion, the first sequel The Meltdown (2006) was a step back compared to the first film, the third is the best of the bunch, and it's nice to know that the films are growing just as their characters are.<br/><br/>The 'underground lost world' is admittedly a bit of a cheap way to throw in some dinosaurs, but I found it hard to care with animation this beautiful. The opening shot amongst the tree tops of the jungle, with dinosaurs slowly moving and eating from trees, is truly stunning, and a real improvement of the slightly blocky animation of the first film. Sadly, Diego is again given little to nothing to do, and seems a waste of Leary's talents, but the introduction of Buck was certainly a smart one. With Buck as our insane tour guide, it becomes easier to put up with Mannie and Ellie's slightly dull moral heart of the story and enjoy lines such as ""about three months ago I woke up married to a pineapple. An ugly pineapple! But I loved her so..."". In Pegg's hands his sheer randomness is hilarious. Directors Carlos Saldanha and Mike Thurmeier have stepped up their game rather than relying on the Ice Age franchise to bring in the punters, and given the series the kick up the arse it needed.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","Dawn of the Dinosaurs is the third movie in the epic Ice Age saga, and by far is one of the best. Great, new realistic graphics also play in a key factor here. The idea and concept is fresh and new, and not only puts in the usual Ice Age theme, but a whole new world,set in the jungle and inhabited by dinosaurs. And, yes, the amazing Scrat returns!!!<br/><br/>The story begins with Ellie expecting a new baby, and Manny trying to create a calm utopia for his new family. Diego believes he has lost his tiger nature, and wishes to leave the herd. Sid finds 3 eggs and they soon hatch in baby T-Rex's. But soon, he is dragged off to an underground world by the mother, full of thought-to-be-extinct dinosaurs. The herd are now in pursuit of Sid, when they are threatened by a dinosaur, but they are saved by a one eyed weasel named Buck. The Crocodile Dundee based Buck helps them find Sid, but they must pass through the Chasm of Death, The Plates of Woe, and into Lava Falls. Buck tells them of the giant Dino Rudy, whom he still fights to that day. After passing through, Ellie goes into labor in the Plates of Woe, and Diego protects her from the attacking rap tors. Buck, Crash, and Eddie rescue Sid. Ellie gives birth to a baby mammoth named Peaches. Rudy catches up, but Momma T-Rex pushes him off a cliff. As they are heading to the Ice Age, Buck hears Rudy is still alive, and he decides to go back to the jungle, and he does. The family then settles to the Ice Age again. Also, during the movie, Scrat falls in love with Scratte, a female squirrelly.<br/><br/>This is an amazing movie!!!"

Diego is losing his ability prey on animals and is getting older and he decides that he wants to leave the herd but he doesn't. Also we see the soft side of Sid (of course he always has been soft) as he fosters three dinosaur eggs he encounters. Later on we discover he has been taking care of babies that belong to a sort of ferocious T-Rex.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best parts of Dawn of the Dinosaurs is the new and vibrant character Bucky. A weasel looking animal he takes them through a land of new creatures that the clan have never seen before. They are walking through a plethora of dinosaurs that rule this land unlike their own. They eventually will find Sid who has become lost.<br/><br/>Bucky is hilarious as the nutty weasel he is. His jokes are funny. But some of them may be a little too adult like in humor to the point where it's downright filthy. But on a whole he is a great addition to the Ice Age series. Another funny part of the film follows our favorite prehistoric squirrel Scratt who while chasing his beloved acorn comes across a gorgeous female squirrel who tries to take his acorn away. The humor between these two comes down to the wire where they will end up falling in love. Has Scratt lost his mind giving up his prized acorn over a girl? Just watch and see.<br/><br/>I am also looking forward to Continental Drift."

"FairlyAnonymous","5","1","1","12 August 2011"," Not as good as the first, but better than the second... by a little bit
","I decided to review this movie again after watching it again. Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs could've easily have been the best Ice Age yet, or at least dramatically better than the second movie. But it fails at being overly impressive as far as plot goes. Though it does have some nice things in it which are enjoyable to see. <br/><br/>Visually Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is fantastic... at times. The animation is very good during some certain scenes especially during the first appearance of the T-Rex mother. Out of all of the scenes in the movie, the appearance of the T-Rex at the beginning was probably the best. However the rest of the movie fails to really make the dinosaurs as threatening or dramatic as the beginning. Since the majority of the plot takes place in an under-ice dinosaur world, you would expect it to look really nice... but sadly most of the dinosaurs seemed to have been designed very quickly and look very simplistic/generic. Even the landscape in the dinosaur world is kind of boring... not enough depth to it. <br/><br/>The plot is actually shockingly simple. Actually really really simple. It is the classic gang trying to save Sid when he was captured by a T- Rex. There are some dangers along the way but that is the plot in a nut shell. The problem I have with this movie is that the characters seem stale and not as deep as the first movie. The first movie had character development and some actual deep and interesting topics. This movie, however, does not. The jokes aren't too bad, but most of them come from Buck... the new guy. Thank goodness the Opossum twins don't have as much screen time yet they still make pop-culture references which ruins the mood. Buck is better than the Opossum twins as far as being an interesting side character who is crazy, though sometimes Buck gets a bit annoying.<br/><br/>Overall Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs isn't a terrible movie, but it doesn't really improve the series at all which is disappointing. The first movie is still the best and most interesting. If only this movie were a little bit darker and had a bit more of a plot. This movie is arguably the goofiest of the three films and is the least serious."

","Great for kids and not really adults (unless you like talking mammoths, sloths and saber-tooth tigers!) I think the producers of Ice Age have really reached the limit of sequels you can make out of the materials they had (the weird miss-matched group of Manny, Ellie Sid, Scrat and now Scratte (plus the eggs). Ice age 1: Fantastic! Ice Age 2: Good but getting a little old. Ice Age 3: Yeah, OK enough now! Some movies aren't meant to have tonnes of sequels, and I think that they've reached their limit. I can't even remember what number 2 was about for crying out loud! My suggestion: Watch number one and leave it there! If you want to watch the rest go for it - but don't be disappointed if they're not what you expect."

","The concept of a ""trilogy"" is usually best suited only to the genres of action, fantasy and sci-fi. Though in the last few years it has been tried with animated films, once with 'Shrek' (2001-2007) and now with Ice Age, and both of them have followed a remarkably similar path. In both cases: the filmmakers' entire heart, soul and creativity were poured into the first film, which was wonderfully fun, with a very meaningful centre; the second film was also quite enjoyable and exciting, with a script that showed an admirable yet failed attempt to again attain some depth; and the third has been utterly disgraceful and unbearably shallow with a slapdash script full of countless desperate attempts at witty humour that are mostly in vain, with only very few being successful.<br/><br/>Amidst all the nigh intolerable madness, there is something of a plot, into which the writers have inelegantly implanted the theme of parenthood. <br/><br/>Manny (voiced by Ray Romano) becomes anxious after hearing that his wife Ellie (voiced by Queen Latifah) is about to give birth, and starts to hurriedly prepare himself for being a father. Sid (voiced by John Leguizamo) has stumbled upon a clutch of unguarded and seemingly abandoned eggs and decides to take them into his care. When they hatch, he proceeds to raise the hatchlings as if they were his own despite having no idea what species they are.<br/><br/>It is perfectly clear to the audience, however, that they are Tyrannosaurus Rex chicks, and after the angry mother takes both her chicks and Sid to her nest, the Manny, Ellie, and the others go after him into a very different world beneath the ice. They are lead by the new character, Buck (voiced by Simon Pegg).<br/><br/>It is rather refreshing and exciting to have a change in setting from cold and wintry to warm, colourful and tropical. Though as it is so obviously ""inspired"" by Journey to the Centre of the Earth we cannot give this film's creators any credit for that.<br/><br/>Though the invention of our tough, fearless and delightful guide is, however, noteworthy. At least one fresh face was clearly needed here as the old characters have lost much of their charm. The annoying, bumbling daggy sloth is no longer amusing. The rickety relationship we saw between the two mammoths in the previous installment was much more interesting and believable than the sappy romance we see here. The possum brothers Crash (voiced by Sean William Scott) and Eddie (voiced by Josh Peck) are no longer mischievous and delightful, they are instead tiresomely idiotic. The character of Diego (voiced by Denis Leary) is at its least dynamic and he has very little to do in this film. Even Scrat (voiced by Chris Wedge) the always reliable comic relief has every one of his scenes ruined by the presence of the less welcome newcomer Scratte (voiced by Karen Disher), though these writers are not the first to mistakenly try to assign a girlfriend to as many of the characters as possible.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that a handful of the new characters (the chicks, their mother, and Buck's rival Rudy included) do not talk, they still manage to let be a letdown. The Tyrannosaurus family may be entertaining, but Rudy was one we, for most of the film, only heard the deafening roar of, heard stories about and saw the shadow of. This built up incredible suspense, as well as our expectations for a truly terrifying and nigh invincible monster. Though in the end, the beast was disappointingly easily beaten in an extremely short ""climax"".<br/><br/>What had worked initially has obviously been forgone or overused now. If this is the last entry of the series and this is truly a sad end for Ice Age. Though better tragedy than bankruptcy, which is most likely what a fourth film would result in. Shrek Goes Fourth is now in the works, and this cannot end well for DreamWorks."

","My Take: It's not the best animated movies have to offer, but with all the charms and laughs of a likable one.<br/><br/>Third time's the charm, occasionally. As I loved the first two ICE AGE movies, I admired ICE AGE: DAWN OF THE DINOSAURS solely on its own terms; as pure family fun. Unlike TRANSFORMERS 2, which guises itself as a ""family movie"" while gearing itself for an older audience, ICE AGE 3 is a more harmless (not to mention trimmer) family affair, and in my opinion a better diversion if you plan to bring a lot of younger kids along for the ride. That saying a lot for a movie about an inter-species herd of Pleistocene mammals in a ridiculous adventure that has them crossing paths with dinosaurs in a lost underground jungle! <br/><br/>If I was 8 years-old right now, I would have absolutely loved ICE AGE 3! The title couldn't be more straight-forward: Our sub-zero heroes get tangled up with an adventure that breaks all plausibility when they find an underground forest inhabited by dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes. As the ""DAWN OF THE DINOSAURS"" of its title kicks in, I felt the the 8 year-old in my head bouncing with joy. I don't know, maybe it's been a while when I saw a dinosaur movie (I don't know if the new LAND OF THE LOST, which I haven't seen yet, would be able to give me that same feeling). The animation doesn't break new ground, but for what it wanted to offer, it's colorful and lively, even better perhaps than in the first two movies. If good looks are not good enough ,the movie also offers some exciting action scenes filled with nearly endless visual inventiveness. I should have seen this on 3-D as it was intended to be. This is probably the most visually elaborate of the three.<br/><br/>Still, outside the visual astonishment to be had, it does suffer in comparison with its superior predecessors, as any sequel (or more specifically trequel) might. First, which probably deserves a lot of discussion, is the return of the character Scrat. I thought Scrat is one of the most brilliant creations ever in an animated movie since his debut in the first ICE AGE movie (the opening scene was classic!), but during his return in this sequel, he is not given much more to do. I guess the folks at Blue Sky Animation is contended with giving Scrat a love interest, which is none other than Scratte, a female flying squirrel. Perhaps when the DVD comes, Blue Sky will redeem themselves with their priced creation with yet another lovable short feature. The laughs also come in short. While it's s usual complaint that too much cultural references are gratuitous in a kid-friendly animated feature, this film gears itself more on making the kids laugh that adults will probably be left smiling, giggling at best. Still, there are a few gags to be had with Simon Pegg lending his voice to the tenacious Ahab-like weasel named Buck, as well as the familiar voice cast of Ray Romano, Denis Leary, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, Queen Latifah, Sean William Scott and Josh Peck providing the voices to their respective characters.<br/><br/>ICE AGE: DAWN OF THE DINOSAURS is not the best of the three films, and it's not the best animated film either. Superb entries like WALL-E and the recent UP changed the way we look at animated movies, but that doesn't mean the ol' Looney Tunes way is out of fashion. While I did leave a bit underwhelmed, I still say this is what family movies are all about: Tongue-in-cheek fun. If family entertainment is what you're looking for, I recommend that this is the one to see.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."

","The show starts rather lamely and boring, predictable without the same sense the show had with the second installment. I actually anticipated highly with this one but almost disappointingly unappreciated it, I still remained in my seat because I paid for it.<br/><br/>Indeed, it progressed to a real show and the same theme with kiddie shows shed – adventure and fun and funny. The jokes were actually still funny and quite original, the introduction of some characters were effective and sensible they were not some just-arts to add up to the entourage. Still, the characters were consistent with their beings.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, there were some richly entertaining actions packed with visual stimulations to keep me stuck on my seat. Although it failed to entertain me intellectually, I enjoyed the most of it because it simply was fun.<br/><br/>I was just annoyed with the kids at my back who were voicing their predictions about what was going to happen and their parents nagging that they should leave the cinema because they already watched the movie for the third time."

","Ice Age 3:Dawn of the Dinosaurs isn't a bad film, far from it, but it is my least favourite of the Ice Age films. Granted, the animation is absolutely wonderful as it was with the first two, and the music is nicely composed. The characters are likable enough, I have always love Scrat he is so funny, and the voice acting is very good. However, the script and jokes aren't quite as good this time around. There are some good moments, but some of the writing is lacking and there is the odd lame visual gag. Also this is the Ice Age film with the I feel most predictable and most unevenly paced story. There are some scenes that are rather derivative and the pacing either feels rushed and lagging, it never quite feels just right. All in all, it was okay, but it never wowed me as such. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

","After three films, we have come to what is hopefully the final Ice age film. With Ice age 3, they squeeze out every last bit of juice that is keeping this series still going. Money. Now, if looks were everything, Ice age: Dawn of the dinosaurs would be perfection. Well, you know what, looks aren't everything. So on the whole, Ice age:Dawn of the dinosaurs is a mess. <br/><br/>I am sad to say this too. What has happened over the past couple of years. Like I said in my review for the first one, compared to the other animated achievements in the past, Ice age doesn't come close. That couldn't be further from the truth the third time around. <br/><br/>I barely laughed when I was supposed to. A lot of the laughs miss the mark. There really isn't too much to the plot itself. Really, was there one to the first one? Surely kids will eat this crap up. That is because kids are stupid. I sure wouldn't. I'd spit it out. I never really wanted to see it. But I watched it cause I had nothing else to do. I should've stayed bored. <br/><br/>The film of course continues from Ice Age: The Meltdown. I didn't like that one either. It's about as memorable as, well, it isn't memorable. It's a forgettable film. If it wasn't for the fact that I just watched this one, I would forget about it too.<br/><br/>Now to the plot. Ice age 3 continues the lives of Manny(voiced by Ray Ramano), Sid(voiced by John Leguizamo), and Deigo, I think(voiced by Dennis Leary).Manny is going to have a baby with Ellie(voiced by Queen Latifa). Funny, the same thing happened in Shrek 3. <br/><br/>Sid is jealous and wants children himself. And Deigo, well, you never really got anything from him unfortunately. So one day Sid finds these eggs. And when they hatch, he realizes that they are dinosaur eggs. Sid wants to keep them. And he does until a dinosaur rains on his parade and tries to take them back. <br/><br/>So Sid goes on the run. Or is kidnapped or something. And all of his friends search for him. The film tries as hard as Sid does to to keep his babies. But they try to keep our attention. With gags like the squirrel or whatever trying to get the walnut. I enjoyed them in the first two. Now I am tired of them. Like I am tired of the trilogy.<br/><br/>My interest for the Ice age trilogy is extinct. The only reason why I think it's worth a five is because of the visuals and perhaps the effort. But really, after seeing the third film ,and if they make a fourth, I am tired of them. I'll probably stick around for Shrek four out next year.

","This third installment to the ice age series was fabulous. The same cast which always makes me smile gave it such a lift up throughout the film. What made it more interesting was to see the ex-extinct dinosaurs under ground living out their lives. This kind of look of living underground was a good substitute to tell the kids that hey, since they lived underground how do you think we get our oil today? The animation was as always top notch, and the use of oldie classic music mixed with the ancient world of dinosaurs, gave it that perfect generation gap feel to it. I loved this film, and the humor did not stop with the new addition of buck who is a thrill seeking warrior weasel who left the top end of the world to live with the dinosaurs. And the funniest part was when the hero's end up in the toxic laughing gas. I myself could not stop laughing, very original to that part. All in all this was quite an addition to the films as well as an addition to Elle and Manny with their new child.

","I was pretty much a fan of the first Ice Age, right now I have one adjective to describe each: for the first one (released in 2002) the adjective is great and for the first sequel (released in 2006 and called The Meltdown) the adjective is boring. I don't really remember much of those both movies but certainly the feeling of being very disappointed back in 2006 is still present. Now comes for this summer the new and third Ice Age movie, Dawn of the Dinosaurs, and frankly I wasn't interested at all in seeing it however over the past few days I began to have a certain expectation, maybe it was just because Ebert who called it the best of the three Ice Age movies, said that ""it involves some of the best use of 3-D I've seen in an animated feature"" and well gave it 3.5/4. I just saw Dawn of the Dinosaurs today in 3D and well this more like The Meltdown, weak storytelling and about the 3D version, well it's certainly a nice-looking movie but with few exceptions (for instance the first appearance of the character Diego) there's nothing really impressive, it's certainly a better choice to save your money and pay for the standard version, actually it's a better choice to save your money (it doesn't even need you now with its gross revue, so far according to wikipedia, of $215, 506, 000!) and wait for a rental. <br/><br/>That squirrel is unfunny most of the times here (not really when the squirrel has now to satisfy the orders of its partner!). For me the baby dinosaurs were funnier but only at the beginning of the movie since the plot is about the character Sid getting in real troubles, he felt the loneliness then he stole three dinosaur eggs, the dinosaurs born and they loved their mom! So you can imagine when the real mom comes for her babies, Sid is in troubles so the gang, Manny, Ellie, Diego, Crash and Eddie, comes to rescue him. <br/><br/>I'm a fan of Simon Pegg, not quite because of his good performance in the recent Star Trek but certainly because of his stuff under the direction of Edgar Wright. Unfortunately I saw Dawn of the Dinosaurs dubbed in Spanish so I missed Simon Pegg's voice performance as the new character Buck but obviously I didn't missed the great stuff that Buck delivers. This character is one of the good things of the third Ice Age but still maybe next time not even lots and lots of good comments and a four star review of Ebert will make me go to the theater. I guess for this one a rental is just fine6/10, being generous."

The storyline is terrible and lacks verisimilitude - I still don't understand how ice age mammals ended up battling dinosaurs.<br/><br/>The addition of new characters drug down the acting in this sequel. The original characters are still okay and have a few (just a few) comedic lines and some good comedic timing, but Ellie is the most dull and lifeless character imaginable. She adds nothing to the movie. And Queen Latifah's acting is cringeworthy in its blandness and total lack of emotion. The new character, Buck, is equally irritating.

","Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (2009): Dir: Carlos Saldanha / Voices: Ray Romano, Queen Latifah, Denis Leary, John Leguizamo, Chris Wedge: Third in the lackluster Ice Age animated series and hardly an improvement. An introduction to danger as Manny, Ellie and Diego venture to a warmer climate to rescue Sid. Simple setup aided by colourful animated characters and a variety of dinosaurs. Never mind the fact that these creatures would naturally attempt to consume one another. Directed by Carlos Saldanha who is assisted greatly with colourful animated characters but no story worth mentioning. Ray Romano voices Manny who anticipates fatherhood but the screenplay has him following the same cross country drill he has followed before. Queen Latifah provides a voice of reason to Ellie who will, to no surprise, give birth during the hectic climax. Denis Leary voices Diego whose sight is fading worse than the screenplays he is written into. John Leguizamo voices Sid who comes across dinosaur eggs. His urge for friendship and companionship is understandable but his yearning for parenthood is a crime all its own when considering what an idiot he is. Once again Chris Wedge as the sound of Scrat, the prehistoric squirrel is the only character worth watching. Where they all end up will surprise nobody. Perhaps it should be the dawn of new ideas.

","I have really enjoyed the Ice Age series so far (with The Meltdown being my favorite). I was hoping Ice Age 3 would continue it's charm with it's colorful setting and characters. Unfortunately, I got put off watching it in theaters due to the negative reviews so this was only a DVD rental for me. This second sequel left me disappointed thanks to the atrocious dinosaur setting and a lame story.<br/><br/>In this third entry, Manny and his new partner Ellie are expecting their first child and Diego gets tired of being treated like a house cat. Sid however, gets jealous with Manny and Ellie and adopts three unhatched eggs which turn out to be baby dinosaurs. When the angry mother comes to take her children (and Sid too), the pack go on an adventure to rescue him in a underground ""dinosaur"" world with the help of one-eyed weasel Buck. Scrat the saber tooth squirrel is still after his acorn but can't choose between it and his love interest Scratte.<br/><br/>What made this movie such a letdown to me was the addition of dinosaurs. Kids really like dinosaurs and I don't understand why, but why did they add them to an Ice Age movie? Even though the movie is called ""Ice Age"", most of the movie is spent in the dinosaur world and thats a pretty bad thing to do if the first movie was committed on the Ice Age period. It seemed like Fox wanted to get greedy and grab money from dino-loving kids. The movie is also filled with references and adult jokes (such as Sid milking a male ox) which is very inappropriate for a kids movie. It's a shame how Blue Sky could waste a sequel on such an abominating dinosaur world and a paper-thin plot.<br/><br/>Despite this dinosaur setting, the movie was still enjoyable to watch. In addition to the impressive animation, the dinosaurs looked pretty good (despite size inaccuracies) and they sound authentic too. Crash and Eddie, the twin possums provided me most of the laughs with their witty one-liners and Buck's back story was quite interesting. I thought Scratte was a nice addition too but I would prefer Scrat chasing the acorn on his own.<br/><br/>Finishing off, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs isn't a terrible movie. It just takes the franchise in the wrong direction. Being a movie that you can either love or hate, it has the characters you love and the thrilling action sequences, but it all goes down with an appalling dinosaur concept.<br/><br/>I am hoping they fix these problems for the fourth installment and make it the last.

","This film is terrific! The unusual prehistoric herd is back, and of course, Scrat. But Scrat isn't the only one who's trying to get the acorn, he got himself a rival and at the same time, a lover. For the herd, Manny and Elle are expecting their first child. Diego's losing his capability of being a predator since he's not active at hunting anymore, then wondering if he should leave the herd. While Sid stole some babies that he will take care for himself. But these babies are not just like any other babies, they're babies of Tyrannosaurus and their mother's looking for them. How fun is that? Plus they have a new companion along their journey, Buck, and he rocks too! IMO, It's as funny as Shrek, or even funnier, depends on parts. You'll have to step down a little level for you to fully enjoy this. I've watched this film along with my 7 year old cousin, And I LMAO, you don't want to watch this film along with all the adults, this is a kid's comedy. It's too immature for adults who enjoy films that's almost 100% realistic. Don't let them watch this so you can't hear them moan."

","I have watched and enjoyed all of the 'Ice Age' movies, they are good family fun. The third instalment is no exception. Very enjoyable from start to finish with plenty of 'laugh out loud' moments.<br/><br/>Scrat, the sabre toothed squirrel, has a rival for the acorn he craves so much, a female called Scratte. As they battle for possession of the sacred acorn, to much comic effect I might add, Manny and Ellie are expecting their first child. Diego feels he's losing his edge and decides he wants to leave the herd and Sid is jealous of Ellie and Manny and adopts three seemingly abandoned eggs. Manny tells Sid to take them back but he doesn't and finds three hungry baby dinosaurs the following morning. Sid tries to entertain the youngsters by taking them to the playground Manny built, but the babies only end up scaring all the other children away. The real mother then turns up and, having caused some havoc, takes the babies away, along with Sid. Manny, Ellie, Crash and Eddie all follow and Diego ends up chasing after Sid as well. They find themselves in a mysterious underground world populated by dinosaurs and one crazy weasel called Buck. This is where the fun really starts and this is where I'll leave my little summary. You don't want me to give the entire plot away do you? <br/><br/>As I said at the beginning, this is a most enjoyable film with plenty of 'laugh out loud' moments. I counted six (from me) which makes this a really good comedy in my book. Either that or it pressed all of my laughter buttons! Nice performances from the voice talents of, Ray Romano as Manny, Queen Latifah as Ellie, John Leguizamo as Sid, Denis Leary as Diego, Seann William Scott as Crash, Josh Peck as Eddie and Simon Pegg as Buck.<br/><br/>Over all, it's a great family adventure with plenty of laughs along the way. As an adult I found the plot a bit simple, but the 'laugh out loud' moments made up for that. So, young or old this one's definitely recommended! My score: 7.3/10"

","Recap: Manny and Ellie is having a kid, something that puts the herd to the test. Manny is freaking out, Diego is feeling old and is leaving for new adventures and the coming kid is waking up the mother feelings in Sid. Unfortunately, the only kids Sid can find is three large eggs he found in a cave nearby. And when the eggs hatch Sid is suddenly the mother of three little adorable dinosaur babies. However, one T-Rex mother is now missing her three kids, and are not entirely happy about it.<br/><br/>Comments: The third installment in the Ice Age series, one knows what to expect now. And it doesn't disappoint. Like all Ice age movies it got a good story and a special eye for the small, but hilarious details. Those details are the real gems in an otherwise good story.<br/><br/>But a few things seem to have changed, or developed. For instance, the animation has risen to another level. They were not bad at all before, but a few scenes, Diego's chase in the beginning for example, are actually really impressive. But the extra attention to the visual have taking a small toll out of the story-telling. Not as fresh and inventive as the originals anymore, and the story seem to direct itself a tad more to older audience's. Not that I complain, being adult, and not that I doubt that kids will enjoy this, but I did note a small shift, both in language and story.<br/><br/>A few small scenes and moments are truly gems though, so it pays to pay attention. Probably the best scene of the entire movie is just a minor detail, just a few seconds long, at the beginning. And then those details just keep coming.<br/><br/>Sit back and keep your eyes open, and you will surely enjoy this animated comedy. And I hope that 20 Century Fox keeps them coming as long as they are as good as this.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I hope they keep on making Ice Age sequels because they're pretty darn good. I loved the second movie and this movie is almost as good as that one. I'm glad that all the original characters returned especially Scrat. I liked the new characters in Scrat's girlfriend and Buck.<br/><br/>This time around, Sid is kidnapped by a Tyrannosaurus Rex because he stole her eggs. Now Manny, Diego, Crash, Eddie, and the pregnant Ellie must join forces with the wild Buck to rescue Sid.<br/><br/>The animation is great.

"MartianOctocretr5","7","1","3","11 October 2009"," ""I liked you guys better when you were extinct!""
","The mammoths have a baby on the way. Diego feels like a fifth wheel. Scrat finds his perfect match (too perfect--she wants the beloved acorn too), and Sid adopts eggs. Oops, they belong to a dinosaur. And she's not extinct. Mommy wants her young back, seizes their kidnapper Sid, and drags him off back to a subterranean Lost World.<br/><br/>So it's Ice Agers to the rescue of their friend in Jurassic Park. Rumors of them bringing in the big reptiles as a desperate attempt to revitalize the Ice Age series have been greatly exaggerated. Ice Age is still cool, and all the stuff that's made it fun up to now is still fresh. New characters establish themselves as valuable parts of the crazy silliness almost immediately. There's a great soldier of fortune guy who comes across as a Capt. Jack Sparrow/Paul Hogan mix. The mommy T-Rex is genuine and likable. All of the baby animals are cute. Pterodactyls, horn-backed creatures, stegosauruses, and more all drop by. Then there's a great villain, the king of them all, a rampaging Gigantisaurus who makes Lady T-Rex look petite. It's a sure bet some of these guys will be back for future Ice Age episodes.<br/><br/>While all this goes on, the ongoing Scrat saga continues, but now he has competition for his prized acorn. A pretty female Scrat. You can guess where this is heading, and the film utilizes the conflict/romantic tension routine for hilarious results. There are also some key lines extracted from Jurassic Park that are dealt out for great one liner/sight gags, as well as a few cultural reference jokes.<br/><br/>It helps to enjoy this if you've seen the first two Ice Age movies. It's a nice addition to the ongoing character story lines, although its high octane zany approach contrasts with the low key atmosphere of the first one. A fun watch for both kids and adults."
"jdkraus","8","1","3","2 August 2009"," Each Ice Age seems to be getting better and better...
","The first ""Ice Age"" was good but a bit depressing. The second one made me laugh so hard that I almost fell out of my seat. This one did not only supply witty humor but has some brilliant, awe-inspiring action sequences for a feature-length animated film. They are every bit as good as ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" and that's saying a lot. Watching this film on the big screen is a real treat. <br/><br/>The voice cast did an exceptional job but the real genius was Simon Pegg as the adventurous, and somewhat crazy Buck. Though he makes some good Johnny Depp impersonations of Captain Jack Sparrow with his voice, he still makes a character in it of himself. He made more of the film than any of the other characters. <br/><br/>I'll admit though that Scrat, the squirrel who can't get his nut, has his moments, constantly pursing his new competition Scratte. Surprisingly, the two squirrels fall in love, but their love affair has a predictable ending. Now having seen this film, it makes me wonder if a male and a female squirrel would fight each other over a nut like Scrat and Scratte do. Mmm? <br/><br/>Each ""Ice Age"" seems to be getting better and better with each new release. ""Ice Age: Dawn of Dinosaurs"" is an animated film that I think the whole family could enjoy, but it seems more aimed toward the adult audience in some of its humor, which is wasted on the kids since they don't understand it."

","I was fortunate enough that my local theatre was not showing Ice Age 3 in 3-D. It is a technology that I thoroughly despise, and it is one of the most distracting gimmicks ever created for film. I was able to enjoy Ice Age 3 without getting relentlessly pummelled by 3-D (although, to be honest, I am slightly interested how 3-D was pulled off here).<br/><br/>Hopefully, Ice Age 3 will be the final instalment in the series. After the extremely disappointing Ice Age 2, I was expecting next to nothing from this movie. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, which is the best of the series.<br/><br/>Ice Age 3 finally solves the problem of the ""Scrat"" sequences. As much fun as the original was, the scenes involving Scrat felt random, awkwardly placed, and irrelevant. Scrat now has a role more tied in with the plot, and enhanced thanks to the introduction of a romantic interest/rival. Not only do these sequences remain hilarious, they feel more like part of the movie.<br/><br/>One of the great things about this movie is all the references. Ice Age 3 gloriously lampoons so many genres and films. It spoofs romance films wonderfully: when Scrat and Scratte kiss for the first time, lava shoots up behind them, bringing to mind the classic image of waves crashing high as lovers embrace. The interactions between the two bring countless romantic comedies to mind. Jurassic Park is often spoofed, such as one shot near the beginning that reminds one of the ""raptors in the kitchen"" scene. The familiar group of animals meet an insane survivalist, Buck (gloriously voiced by Simon Pegg), whose role not only serves the story, but also spoofs ""stranded-in-the-middle-of-nowhere"" movies. Pegg comes across as hilarious; Buck made me laugh the most. (Yes, I actually *laughed* during this movie.) There's even a fantastic spoof of action films, where the hero so often must decide whether he must cut the blue wire or the red.<br/><br/>The Verdict: Ice Age 3 is a pleasant surprise. The first film was fun. The second was a disappointment. Ice Age 3 is the best movie in the series, and the funniest. Although geared for kids, I too enjoyed it. It was loads of fun.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 10/10 (Now don't get me wrong: the movie isn't flawless. But I'm giving this rating simply because it was that much fun.)"
"honorhorror","8","1","3","1 August 2009"," Brought me back to the golden age of Tom and Jerry.
","I had a struggle as to give it a 7 or 8 'cause I gave Up an 8. So how to justify the difference or the distance they had was quite hard to decide. I finally gave it an equal 8.<br/><br/>Frankly, Ice Age 3 is a good movie that doesn't really need a review. People went to see it expecting what exactly it will come out. Yet it's free of foul language, inappropriate information that other blockbusters may have. And they got exactly what they want and came back smiling with the whole family. End of story? Not exactly. The cartoon context is so unique in that you can invent your whole environment and creatures to ensure the technical eligibility, while throwing in your real-life friends for fun and for differentiation. For those HD quality fanatics, they would buy the Blu-ray with no doubt, while for most families they just want to laugh and laugh again with an ironical feeling. This kind of subtlety and awareness are not scarce in recent animations, but fits into the context of Ice Age 3 perfectly. Just like Tom & Jerry, the characters may really fight/kill their butts off, yet they still know it's a cartoon. So when a teenager sees the interactions between Scrat and Scrate, he laughs his teeth off every time. But when a middle-aged couple see the scenes, they laugh at first but had a mixed feeling later.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie is that it knows what it is, and surely it doesn't want to compete with Up in terms of sentimental value and life philosophy. In some way, it's even more honest and pure. However it succeeded with a much simpler formula but offered equal fun and maturity. So why not giving it a chance? P.S. Scrat and Scrate made a cinema gem with their Tom and Jerry charm."

","Ice Age III was the long awaited sequel to the second Ice Age-movie. Long awaited at least by one of my dearest friends, who just gets a kick out of these kind of CG-animated movies. Due to time limits, we didn't get to see the movie until a few days ago, and I must say it kinda disappointed me. <br/><br/>I was unable to laugh the entire movie, the characters had all their best jokes in the first two movies I think, and they leave little entertainment value to me. Now, it is probably my problem, since these movies are not for me. However, my friend also told me, she had only smiled a few times during the movie, and usually she's belly laughing throughout these cartoons. Another thing we both agree on was that there was that Scrat appeared too often in this movie. He was best in the first movie where he got a little scene in the opening and ending of the movie, but in this movie, he appears in short scenes throughout the movie, and this is overkill in our opinion.<br/><br/>The plot in these movies is also painfully obvious after you've seen the first 15 minutes, at least to the adult eye.<br/><br/>My personal experience was not that positive but this does not mean it is a bad movie at all. I can appreciate the stunning graphics this movie offers, along with the nice voice acting, especially by Sid and Buck. Buck is also a new character that will be a favourite to many, but for me he did not work. This tough ""jungle pirate"" that believes fear is just a four letter word, has grown completely paranoia and has multiple personalities, much to the delight of other people in the theater.<br/><br/>The humour in this movie is described as being for kids and adults, but quite frankly, I don't think too many adults will enjoy this movie for the humour, most parents will be dragged to this movie by their children and have a nice time, but nothing more. However, this is an ideal movie to take your kids too, and give them a delightful afternoon for a relatively cheap buck in these times of economical crisis.<br/><br/>It was not for me, they could have quit after the second movie, but still 8/10"

","There is an old saying that goes, ""Three is the magic number."" But, it becomes a cursed number when it is put in a title as in a film franchise. Let me show you some examples:<br/><br/>Back to the Future III (1990) Rocky III (1982) Jaws 3D (1983) High School Musical 3 (2008) Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) Spiderman 3 (2007) Superman 3 (1983) Shrek the Third (2007) Scream 3 (2000) Godfather Part 3 (1990) Home Alone 3 (1997) Alien 3 (1991) Rush Hour 3 (2007) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3 (1993) Jurassic Park 3 (2001) Spy-Kids 3D (2003) Nightmare on Elm Street 3 (1987) Friday the 13th Part III (1982)<br/><br/>I can go on.<br/><br/>So any way, after watching this in 3D, I found out that this movie has some scenes that are imitating the SHREK films (specifically the third). Sid with the dinosaur family, all this hoopla over Mannie and Ellie's new baby. Tell me that Blue-Sky and Dreamworks are rivaling each other. Also the movie goes in the category of ""Dinosaur-infested Lost World that happens to be living in our time."" (Wow that was random.) Here are some examples:<br/><br/>The Lost World (1925) King Kong (1933) Unknown Island (1948) Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959) Journey to the Beginning of Time (1967) Land that Time Forgot (1975) baby: Secret of the Lost Legend (1985) Dinosaur Valley Girls (1996)<br/><br/>Over the past year or so, I have been watching 3D movies, it looks like that my eyes are touching stuffed animals, except that they came to life. When I saw their world, in 3D, I felt like as if I was freezing, because it is like winter time all over again. But thanks to the warm building at my movie theater, it wasn't. In a nutshell, I felt like as if I was in a cartoon world. <br/><br/>Once again, we get introduced to more characters, like Buck (a weasel with an Austrailian accent), Peaches (Manny and Ellie's new daughter). Also, it stinks to be the Scrat. With a female Scrat playing femme fatal with him. He knows that he's going to loose it. He's never going to get it, even if he tries. Just like the Trix rabbit trying to get his cereal, but fails due to some meddling kids. As the saying goes, ""Silly Rabbit! Trix are for kids."" Back on topic, why is Scrat treated like crap? He just wants his acorn in order to survive, that's all. What's wrong with survival?<br/><br/>Bottom line: This is a good movie, I highly recommend it, so it is good to watch it.<br/><br/>Rated PG for the usual peril and crude humor."

Although sometimes there was forced laughter in the cinema hall, it was still an enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>What is really exciting is that the Ice Age animals lived under the dinosaurs the whole time. I loved the scenes where Sid was trying to take care of the baby dinosaurs. The introduction of Buck was awesome, considering the things he did.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is where Sid has to feed the newly-hatched babies. So, he sneaks over to a sleeping bull and pulls the thing where milk comes. Turns out the bull was a male.<br/><br/>The movie being in 3-D only added to the excitement. I think that the movie had too much mushy stuff when it came to the baby dinosaurs and Ellie's baby. But still, this is one of the best movies I have ever watched."

","I instantly regretted having gone to see this with my nephew. It all seemed to be heading straight to Overlylineardevelopmentsville: the old team of Mannie (the mammoth), Sid (the sloth) and Diego (the sabre-toothed tiger, which are not real tigers, by the way) is split up because Mannie has gone square and founded a family. Sid then decides to do likewise and adopts three eggs, which gets him into all sorts of hilariously predictable scrapes ... but after about 10 minutes the story picks up speed, stops being anal about plot development and promoting family values, and just delivers punch after punch. You see, underneath the ice, our three friends discover a lost world where slapstick and fart jokes reign king! Overall, a very successful third episode from the Ice Age venture (and the umpteenth instalment of Arthur Conan Doyle's Lost World plot). The lost world is beautifully done, and I especially liked the new character of Buck (voiced by Simon Pegg), a hyperactive weasel who compliments the often very staid characters of Manni, Diego and Sid nicely.<br/><br/>And Scrat the nut-fancying rodent finally finds happiness -- and loses it again ..."
"dbborroughs","5","1","3","19 July 2009"," Better story, less laughs and seeming borrowed animation make this merely an okay film
","No I did not see this in 3D. Frankly other than depth I didn't see the reason why they bothered other than to get some extra shekels. the plot has Ray Romano and Queen Latifah expecting a baby mammoth, Denis Leary going through a midlife crisis after losing a step in the hunt and John Leguizamo wanting to belong somewhere and feeling left out. Leguizamo happens upon 3 eggs which hatch into baby T-Rex's which he tries to raise until the mother comes and the quartet , babies and Leguizamo end up going back to a lost world of dinosaurs. Latifah , Romano and Leary give chase and end up hooking up with a crazed Simon Pegg. More sound plot wise the film is less funny than the earlier entries and in a world of diminishing returns I liked it even less than the earlier films which I really didn't like. Its a good looking film but at the same time the jungle seems strangely low rent and not up to the background design of the earlier films. I also was disappointed in that several characters design and animation seem to have been lifted from films like Open Season, The Wild and Madagascar to the point I'm wondering if animation department has raided other studios on a large level (worse the ""borrowed animation"" seems to be not as good as the rest of the film, which is why I noticed it) can you tell I have problems? Not my cup of tea. Since it does have moments I think it might be worth a shot if you wait for DVD or cable so lots of people can see it for a small amount of money."

","After the bore fest that was Ice Age 2: The Meltdown I went to the cinema with very low expectations, a lot of popcorn and an intention to bad-mouth the movie throughout the screening. At the same time I was dreading the laughter of young kids and hoping that it would be at least mildly entertaining.<br/><br/>I must admit the movie came by surprise. Sure. It has it faults. Indiana Jones action scenes are overcooked and uninspiring. The new character addition of Buck is just irritating even though he helps move the plot along (the character concept is just poor). The premise of dinosaurs is idiotic (but then again this is a cartoon...). The love affair of our lovable little Scrat is just tiresome and a lot less of the munchkin actually means more.<br/><br/>But all in all the characters suddenly began to click again. To some extent this is thanks to exploring new areas of their relationship, instead of just rehashing the first part, as The Meltdown did. Manny is about to expand his family and is expecting a child with the mammoth/opus Ellie. This disrupts the status quo in the weird little family that has been created. Diego the sabre-tooth has been getting weary of the vegetarian settled down life and is ready to move to new hunting grounds. In the meantime it occurs to Sid that the changes about to come will make Manny more focused on his new baby, whilst with Diego about to leave he will be left to fend for his lone self.<br/><br/>This leads to Sid wanting to create a family of his own... An opportunity occurs when he finds three eggs buried deep in the snow.<br/><br/>Funny, smart, if at times repetitive. Overall the characters are once again lovable and energetic, something sorely missed in the second outing of the team. If this is where Ice Age is heading I can sure handle another serving."

","Scrat the Squirrel is on the dawn of finally hitting the utopia of Squirrelism by capturing the beloved acorn. That is until his whirling squirling hormones get the worst of him and he falls for a sabre-toothed female squirrel named Scratte; who evidently wants a piece of that herself. Piece being Scrat or the Acorn? OK, so that was not the best way to break the ice in my review of ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"". What do you expect? I first wrote it in ""scrat paper"". This third installment of the infamous Ice herd franchise does have numerous comedic dawning moments that come mostly in the form of the aforementioned Scrat adventures. The male procrastinating complexities of choosing love or gratification are in a way symbolized in Scrat's dilemma of deciding between Scatte's love or the tempting acorn. OK, that was way too ""acorny"" and unforgivably deep! Sorry, it is just that I am still living in the Pun Age, and this is the Dawn of the Punasours. OK, I will stop. All punning aside, Scrat once again shows that he is the superstar of the Ice Age installment. Herd, do not misunderstand! Heard me? Not to take anything away from your stellar lineup including the mammoth stars Manny and Ellie, the cerebrally-challenged sloth Sid, the feisty sabre-tooth tiger Diego, and the screwy possums Eddie & Crash. It is just that Scrat rocked the Ice Age House once more! In this Ice Age narrative- Ellie is pregnant carrying Manny's little mammoth baby, Sid wants to be a dad of his own so he steals three dinosaur eggs, and an aging & unmotivated Diego is trying to recapture the ""eye of the tiger"". Through some Sid-witted disasters, the herd end up in a dinosaur underworld chased by a gargantuan Dino mom who wants her triplets back from Sid, and a even more grandiose dinosaur named Rudy who is just plain rude. The herd befriends a one-eye weasel named Buck who lives in the underworld and ends up being their key to escape. But does the herd end up getting a bang out of their Buck? I am going to have to pass the Buck on this one, and let you figure it out yourself. Some critics have given ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" a cold-hearted reception and have ridiculed Co-directors Carlos Saldanha and Mike Thurmeier for not bringing more originality to the story. They do have some valid arguments with those theories, but the hotness of the ""Ice Age"" movies has never been the story, it has been the characters. And I think that these herd of characters were once again marvelous and should not be inserted in the endangered movies franchise list. Chill out til dawn with ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"".

","I don't want to damn with faint praise, but I suspect that's what it's going to sound like.<br/><br/>I liked this film, but I didn't love it. It was fun, but not hysterical. The 3D was good, but not great.<br/><br/>There was absolutely nothing to criticise - everything was done competently at worst, with great skill at best. The voice characterisations were all good, with Simon Pegg chipping in an excellent characterisation as swashbucking weaselly hero-type thing Buck. The baby critters, of whatever species, are all dead cute. The backgrounds are wonderfully well realised. The story is solid and the moral is worthwhile. And yet...<br/><br/>I think my problem is that, by film 3, it's all so familiar. Notwithstanding a change in locale, we know the characters so well that what they get up to is, too me, beginning to become a little limiting (so hooray for the trip to the subterranean world and the change of scenery which goes with it.<br/><br/>Take your kids and go and see it - you'll enjoy it. I did. But..."
"sddavis63","6","1","3","14 July 2009"," Another Fun Adventure
","I haven't seen the second movie of the series, and so can only compare ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" to the first. Aside from the equally superb animation, I thought this story was weaker than the original (as are most sequels) but still was good fun. Here, Sid the Sloth is working with babies again (just as he worked with the human baby in the first movie.) This time, it's a trio of dinosaur babies that he stumbles upon and decides to raise as his own. Yeah, I know, dinosaurs and mammals didn't co-exist - but it's a kid's movie - and the writers got around that by turning this into a kind of ""Journey to the Centre of the Earth"" type adventure. Sid discovers the eggs after crashing through the ice into an underground world where dinosaurs still rule. Unfortunately, Mamma Dinosaur wants her babies back, and Sid ends up being taken along for the ride, which means that Diego, Manfred et. al. have to set out on their own adventure to rescue him.<br/><br/>What I thought was much weaker here than in the original movie was the lack of any real poignancy, such as Manfred's memories of his family or Diego's ""death scene."" This movie simply comes on like an action/adventure with some comedy (and some of it pretty funny) thrown in. Personally, I didn't care that much for the new character of Buck, a one-eyed weasel who's essentially exiled himself in dino-world and who ends up leading the gang in their search. It's a good movie for kids (although some of the dinosaur scenes might be a bit scary for younger ones.) 6/10"

","I saw Journey to the Center of the Earth on 3D. It was so amazing. They came out with the old-fashion 3d-glasses version, you know, the old blue and red. At one time I didn't even think about the headache such technology gave me as well as the ill-fitting floppiness of the glasses. This new 3D technology is out of this world. Today, it was as if they were some cartoonish plush toys you could reach out and grab. Some scenes it was as if they were jumping off the screen into your lap. That was just the 3d, what about the story? I was wondering how they were going to work dinosaurs into an Ice Age. Right now there are a number of people movies exploring comedy and dinosaurs. Some have been good and others should have died with the ice. Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, even without the 'd', is superb. There is humor to satisfy young and old. In fact, in some parts, like Scratte and the record player, kids don't have a clue as to what it is and why it is funny. It is certainly on my to buy list. Oh! As usual Scratte steals the show, he and his lady friend. If you cannot grab a kid as an excuse to go just grab the kid inside you and enjoy!"
"diac228","7","1","3","8 July 2009"," Defying every science book imaginable, the third Ice Age becomes the most surreal of the trilogy.
","The Ice Age franchise is the lone wolf in the computer-animated franchises since its not from Pixar or Dreamworks yet however makes a fantastic amount of money and receives a good amount of praise. As a matter of fact, the original Ice Age remains one of the better non-Pixar efforts since 1995, when Toy Story started it all. Unfortunately, the sequel failed to live up to the original, despite the best efforts from Scrat, the unofficial mascot of the franchise. In the third installment though, the amount of believable material slips to a dangerous low as we have dinosaurs underneath the ice in a totally different atmosphere. Then with more characters introduced, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs was beginning to look like Shrek the Third: too many characters, not enough plot, and too many futile attempts at humor coming from multiple different angles.<br/><br/>Despite my predictions coming true loosely, the movie is surprisingly enjoyable. As a matter of fact, it was a few quips away from topping the original, while surpassing the second installment in every possible way. Scrat is as funny as ever, and some of the unfunny characters from The Meltdown have their shining moments in this film. The animation is beginning to lag behind Pixar though, when before they were getting close quality-wise (especially with Horton Hears a Who).<br/><br/>Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is about the entire crew discovering an entire ecosystem full of dinosaurs underneath the ice. Both worlds collide when Sid (John Leguizamo) accidentally takes some dinosaurs eggs while looking for new ways to entertain himself and find new friends; after seeing Manny (Ray Romano) focusing all his attention to closely being a father, and Diego (Denis Leary) suddenly leaving the pack. Along their travels, they'll meet a hyper and bizarre weasel named Buck (Simon Pegg). The other portion of the movie has to do with the lovable Scrat chasing an acorn along with a female squirrel that may or may not want him.<br/><br/>Dawn of the Dinosaurs is a highly unbelievable movie, and it was crafted in a way that made it obvious that the writers wanted to milk the franchise even more yet couldn't find the proper way of doing it, so they dwelled even deeper in fiction. The first two Ice Ages were at least loosely scientifically realistic. This one breaks all rules covering which animals thrived in which time periods. Luckily for us, the dinosaurs were not the main focus of the film as much as the heavy assortment of main characters. Just like in the second part of the trilogy, the chemistry amongst the cast just wasn't there, and the voice acting yet again isn't to blame. Poor Ray Romano and Denis Leary, they just have no material to work with, and it hinders their voice work. They do deliver more laughs this time (even the opossums), but it's still not as present as the first Ice Age.<br/><br/>The writers ruined and saved the movie. The concept itself was bizarre, surreal, and just didn't mesh well with the rest of the series. But they did craft some clever sequences of peril and did throw in some hilarious obstacles, especially the bit with poisonous gases. We also have a decent amount of modern-day references to Star Wars and even current issues. Then of course, every scene Scrat was in was comic gold. I stated this in my review of The Meltdown, but Scrat (just like the penguins of Madagascar) needs his own movie immediately. His Road Runner-Coyote-like antics just make the film and remain the top reason to ever watch an Ice Age movie.<br/><br/>The director of the original was not present in the second, or in this one. This is probably why the original remains the best. Chris Wedge, the voice of Scrat, proved to mesh emotion and comedy best with his work on the award-winning short Bunny and his lead director duties in Ice Age. The third installment is directed by Carlos Saldanha, the co-director of the first and main director of the sequel. His strengths and weaknesses are the same here, as he doesn't mix emotion with comedy well, and gives the wrong characters too much screen time. Buck's (the main new character) antics themselves were very hit-and-miss, with the misses being quite painful.<br/><br/>Don't let all the bad news bring you down though, the movie is indeed funny, and if you liked the previous efforts, there's no need for you to skip this one. It's just that with the bar in quality being set higher and higher as animation and storytelling is beginning to evolve in a much more mature manner, it's harder and harder to claim that this movie stands out amongst the mediocre ones.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is a grand step forward from the second part with superior humor, superior pacing, and more Scrat hilarity. However, the emotion still doesn't mix well, especially with Up's incredible ability to rip you to your emotional core a few months back. More characters doesn't necessarily mean more humor, and its time that everyone learns this. Madagascar 2, Shrek 2, Shrek 3, Cars, Shark Tale, Ice Age 2, Ice Age 3 all suffered from the same fate of having too many characters, and then cutting back on the characters that we enjoy watching most. Dawn of the Dinosaurs: Surprisingly funny, but not fulfilling and ultimately quite forgettable.<br/><br/>Quote of the Film: ""I don't speak wind"""
"jemps918","7","1","3","5 July 2009"," Decent, entertainment-wise...
","the funny bits were already shown in the trailer so it was a bit of a disappointment. <br/><br/>the graphics were incredible though and the story was earnestly told, even if it sometimes felt stilted. it unsmoothly segues from the main plot line to the side story of the rat and his love triangle w an acorn and an evolved female. <br/><br/>it also felt like it ran on too long so i was surprised to realize that it was only 1.5 hrs in length. <br/><br/>Decent, entertainment-wise but the writing and comic timing could-be-better."

","The Ice Age series is famed for it's physical comedy and heartwarming moments, coupled with incredible animation. Ice Age 3 is certainly no disappointment in this respect and shines through every second.<br/><br/>The plot kicks off with Allie and Manny expecting a child, Sid feeling left out and needing to fulfill his parental potential and Diego growing tired of the domestic life and longing for adventure. Explaining any further would ruin some truly brilliant gags and story lines - I'll just say this, the story is strong throughout and enjoyable to the very end. A new character voiced expertly by Simon Pegg was always enjoyable and perhaps one of the brightest highlights of the film, some lines still making me chuckle as I think about them.<br/><br/>I have very few negative points on this film, probably the only thing that detracted from my enjoyment were the possums (Crash and Eddie I believe) who seemed quite forced at times and some pop culture references seemed nearly unnecessary compared to all the in-situ comedy. <br/><br/>I'd recommend going to the 3D edition as it is a lot more engrossing in the more energetic sequences, all of which are incredible pieces of cinema, animated or not.<br/><br/>All in all, a good film for kids of all ages with some good hearty laughs for the adults, an involving storyline and truly amusing characters. Thoroughly enjoyed every minute."

","I always liked animations like his one, but I just didn't like Ice Age 3. The other Ice Ages were so much funnier, with comic situations, and this one is all about family and kids and stuff like that, what turned it into a boring movie.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there are still good scenes, creative situations and everything, besides that the animation itself is just perfect. Other thing that catches the attention are the ""subliminar sexual jokes"" that, I think, just grown ups understand.<br/><br/>All in all, I really think there are other movies of this gender much better. Finding Nemo is the best example, besides the other Ice Ages, like I said... It is not difficult to find others."

It turns out that they are dinosaur eggs. Soon, the mother comes looking for her babies, and ends up taking Sid back to her 'dinosaur world' Manny, Diego, Ellie, Crash, and Eddie decide to go save him.

","well, i took my little brother, who is 9 to see this film. all was well as we bought our drinks and chips, sat down in the cinema ready to watch another 'highly anticipated' 3d animated film. <br/><br/>well, it was funny, certain parts of it, but it got cliché fairly quickly, with its overused elements that worked with the first film, the second one got away with it, but the 3rd just doesn't touch the bar that the other films set.<br/><br/>certainly the slapstick was amusing, what was actually in the film, but unfortunately Sid the Sloth no longer seems to be a 'major character' , but simply the animal in distress, no longer the slapstick genius that made him a hit in the first film, but more of a 'support' to give the story some sort of depth and objective.<br/><br/>simply put, this is not what I'd call a full 'kiddies' movie as most of its story revolves around adult themes. quite complicated for a child to understand. <br/><br/>certainly quite amusing, but with several scenes showing quite adult dialog that my little brother didn't understand, and rightly so.<br/><br/>half of the comedy that was in Ice Age 3 that was appropriate for the children had already been showcased in the advertisements and shorts that where on the television, so there was no real surprise about some of the comedy, most of the children in the cinema where even reciting it along with the characters in the film.<br/><br/>it seemed the only thing anyone put any effort into was the animation, the action, and some of the voice talent. All of these where quite well done, but a certain amount of dialog was horribly adult, making references to things that would make sense to adults, but children would find hard to grasp, such as a reference of performing crude transsexual surgery on a T-'Rex', making it a T-'Rachel', something that i do not believe anyone below the age of 9 understands or should understand.<br/><br/>now maybe i am old fashioned, but i believe that the parents of the children should be responsible for teaching their kids about these sorts of things, and not leaving it up to the twisted and influential view of the entertainment industry.<br/><br/>to put it in summery, it was not a film that i recommend taking your young child to see, as some of the dialog will be lost on them. in fact, i was asking myself whether the animation was purely for the kids, and the dialog was purely for the adults.<br/><br/>however, the character of Scrat, the little Muskrat, was explored and extended a lot more than previous films, in fact he was more entertaining than the character of Sid, and is featured a lot more.<br/><br/>but despite this, it is just another sequel in my opinion, something that makes money simply because it has the title ICE AGE. it doesn't seem that the film wants to entertain, but instead make money, which is unfortunately disappointing.<br/><br/>so go see this film if you value slightly misdirected dialog, action packed scenes, very cliché slapstick comedy and very cute mammoth babies.<br/><br/>i would have given it a 7 for it's superb, beautiful and crisp animation and it's action-packed scenes, but the dialog and the cliché of some elements brought it down to a 4-5. still amusing though."

","So the third and ""final"" chapter in the Ice Age story, using the term ""final"" loosely because these films always claim to be the last one. But I'm not complaining about Ice Age, it's such a fun story and they are great films with fun characters. So I watched Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs last night and had a good time with this great animated film. I honestly was a little held back because for some reason a few critics had given the movie bad reviews saying it was pretty much the same thing as the other movies. I didn't see that at all, I loved the new character of Buck in the group, he was too cool for words and was very awesome that he was voiced by the very funny Simon Pegg. The animation was absolutely stunning, the whole world of the dinosaurs was just incredible to watch. The story was also a great part of the films, we get a lot of action and great comedy. I just loved the story between Sid and his T-Rex kids and of course Scrat having a girlfriend was too cute for words.<br/><br/>Ellie and Manny are expecting their first child, and Manny is obsessed with making life perfect and safe for the family, since his first experiences as a husband and father went bad when his family was killed by hunters. At the same time, Diego finds himself unable to catch a cocky gazelle he has been stalking and decides to leave the herd, believing that he is losing his predatory nature as a tiger. Sid grows jealous of Manny and Ellie and ""adopts"" three apparently abandoned eggs that he finds in an icy underground cavern. Although Sid tries his best to raise the three dinosaurs, their rambunctious behavior scares away all the other animals' young and ruins a playground Manny built for Ellie's baby. A female Tyrannosaurus, Momma, whose eggs Sid stole, soon returns and carries both Sid and her young underground, with Diego in pursuit. Manny, Ellie, Crash, and Eddie follow as well and discover that the icy cavern leads to a vast jungle where the dinosaurs they thought to be extinct have a beautiful world and are very much alive.<br/><br/>Ice Age was definitely worth the watch, again for all the negative reviews that it got, I won't understand. I know this is not the stand out movie of 2009, but it was a pleasure to watch for me. I think for the whole family this was just a fun movie to watch. It has a lot of fun action scenes, I loved Buck's stories about him and the legend of Rudy, a dinosaur bigger and badder than the T-Rex that was a lot of fun. I know that the ""cutesy"" part of the movie was a little over the top with the babies, but it's all good I think. Once again, it doesn't have to win Oscars, but why not enjoy a movie if it's making you laugh and smile? Now if you love the Scrat story, you will absolutely have a good time with where they take you on his eternal journey to get that acorn, he falls in love with an acorn stealing girlfriend where he has to decide which is more important, the acorn or true love? Between the story, the animation and the new characters of Buck and the baby T-Rex's, I think that Dawn of the Dinosaurs was the best story yet in these movies. I would recommend this movie for anyone who loves animated films or those who just enjoy Ice Age.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I can see why the critics may be questioning whether this film series, here on its third film, is running out of steam, but I doubt they would do many more films anyway. Basically mammoth Manny (Ray Romano) with now pregnant Ellie (Queen Latifah), and their friends sloth Sid (John Leguizamo) and sabre-tooth tiger Diego (Denis Leary) have a peaceful life on the ice. This peace won't last long when Sid is taken away to the land below the ice, after trying to raise three dinosaur eggs, and hatched, as his own, against the real mother T-Rex. So Manny, Ellie, possums Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck), and a fed up with being laid back Diego have to go and rescue him. Their guide to help them find Sid in this baron and danger filled underground world is one-eyed adventurer and crazy weasel Buckminster, or Buck (Simon Pegg), in search of ""Rudy"". So as you would expect, as they go through this land they encounter not just dinosaurs, including the bigger one Rudy, but jungle perils, big lizards and volcanic lava, oh, and Ellie has baby Peaches. But they manage to get Sid back, who says goodbye by to the three dinosaurs and their mother, and Buck returns as well. Meanwhile, in amongst all this, Scrat the sabre-toothed squirrel is trying to get back his beloved acorn, with the biggest problem being second squirrel Scratte, and it is either a love for him, or his acorn she is after. Also starring Chris Wedge as the squeaks of Scrat and Karen Disher doing the same for Scratte. Once again, as with the two predecessors, the characters are fun and lovable, especially hilarious new edition Buck (my favourite bit is him using a rock like a phone), and it is an enjoyable animated comedy adventure for all the family. Worth watching!"
"brandon_lee420","10","0","1","15 January 2010"," Best of the trilogy!
","Ice Age 3: Dawn Of The Dinosaurs is one of the better animations to come out in 2009 and it has proved to be the best. It combines humor, historical facts, adventure, and a weird herd that contains two mammoths, a sloth, a saber-tooth, and two rat-squirrels, to bring you a fun-packed explosive family film. The voice cast is perfect and not one person is out of line or doesn't provide good voice acting. John Leguizamo and Simon Pegg, in my opinion, did the best voice-acting because those two were hilarious throughout the whole film and they sustained their voices to perfection. Simon Pegg voices a Hermit-Possum who is a wannabe Rambo that lives for adventure and the thrill when your being chased by scary creatures. Buck is his name and he helps the odd herd rescue Sid for most of the film. John Leguizamo once again plays the lost Sid who is in fact a weird and funny sloth who belongs to the odd herd. His love for kids starts the adventure and it sure is a good one. Ray Romano, Queen Latifah, and Denis Leary were good but not as good as those two I mentioned earlier. Kids and adults will love it for I guarantee it.<br/><br/>Manny and Ellie are expecting to have a baby, after being paired up, but while they are happy, some are not. Diego doesn't like the life he is living because he is getting slower and older. Sid the sloth is jealous that Manny and Ellie are expecting a baby and once they do he is not going to get the attention, so he decides to have his own children. He eventually finds dinosaur eggs, which he doesn't know, and names them. He wakes up and finds that the eggs are cracked and dinosaurs are hatched. That's is when the adventure starts because he is dragged to another world by the mother dinosaur and his friends have to rescue him. They get help from a possum-hermit who is familiar to the world but can he really help them save Sid and most of all themselves? <br/><br/>There are so many hilarious scenes but I don't know which two are the best. Mmmmmmm!Okay, I know!The laughing gas scenes has to be the best because it is funny how they are laughing and talking in a funny way. The other funny scene has to be when Sid is training his dinosaur babies. The animation is so colorful and vivid that it makes this film stand out from the rest,including Kung Fu Panda, and viewing this film in 3D make sit even better than it is! And who can forget that saber-toothed squirrel,Scrat, who has a appetite for his beloved acorn, but he is not the only one after the acorn anymore because another sabre-toothed squirrel,Scratte, is after it as well. Is she out to steal his heart or his Acorn? The bad thing about this film is the first slow ten minutes which is just boring. If you want to expect laughter then watch it with your family members because I did and it made the film funnier than it already was. The reason you should watch it with someone, is so you can share your laughter with them. My brother was laughing so hard that I had to play some scenes again. The creators of the previous three Ice Age films should make a fourth one and a fifth one to keep everyone happy. This film is wonderful, colorful, funny, adventurous,but most of all: FUN! Everyone will love this film from the start to the end. It will be a movie that will be jammed into your brains. 10/10 - Highly Recommended!"

The story line follows the typical dramatical dynamic with a certain suspense. I liked especially the air battle scene and all the different species of dinosaurs.

"Electrified_Voltage","7","0","1","8 December 2009"," Still not as good as the original ""Ice Age"" from 2002, but a decent second sequel
","This third installment in the ""Ice Age"" trilogy from Blue Sky Studios made it to the silver screen this summer, but I haven't seen many films in the theatre this year, and this was no exception. I hadn't even seen its two predecessors by the time it was released. I saw both the original ""Ice Age"" and the first sequel, ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"", for the first time just last month. Since I was impressed with them both, especially the original (which is unsurprisingly the best of the three), I was bound to end up watching ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" soon afterwards. Yesterday evening, I rented a copy of it on DVD, just like I did with the first two last month. After seeing them all, I can say neither sequel is as good as the first one, but that doesn't mean they're boring.<br/><br/>Manny and Ellie are expecting a baby, and Manny wants everything to be perfect for the arrival of the newborn. Diego believes he is losing his predatory skill, and decides to leave the herd. Sid wants to raise a family of his own, and sees an opportunity to do so after he accidentally falls through ice and finds three dinosaur eggs, which he believes have been abandoned! He takes the eggs back up to the surface, and when Manny sees them, he tells Sid to take them back, but they soon hatch into baby Tyrannosaurus! The sloth thinks it's great to be a parent, but the three young dinosaurs cause a lot of trouble for the other children around. It isn't long before the Tyrannosaurus mother comes up, and when she finds Sid with her young, she takes the sloth and her three offspring back underground with her! Ellie, Manny, Crash, and Eddie go underground to find Sid, and discover an entire jungle down there, with creatures thought to be extinct! They find Diego, who has also come down to rescue Sid, and the five of them find themselves in a lot of danger as they are guided by a one-eyed weasel named Buck!<br/><br/>Just like the two previous ""Ice Age"" movies, this one is often very funny. The humour may sometimes be a little too kiddish for adults (I still don't find Crash and Eddie, who were introduced in the second film, that funny), but many gags in ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" made me laugh, with the usual conflict and such. Also, I found what Sid says when his head is stuck up the mother Tyrannosaurus' nose to be a comic highlight, even though it's very juvenile! Of course, we once again have Scrat the ""saber-toothed squirrel"" constantly trying to protect his acorn, but this time, he has a female competitor named Scratte, which leads to more comical moments. There's also a good amount of action and excitement during the characters' underground adventure, with the man-eating plant, lava, and some ferocious beasts! This underground jungle can easily remind one of the jungles of Skull Island in ""King Kong"". Once again, the animation is great in this third ""Ice Age"" movie, even if it didn't impress me quite as much as the animation in its predecessors did for some reason.<br/><br/>The original ""Ice Age"" was rated PG for mild peril, and the first sequel was given the same rating for its smut. This second sequel has been given the PG rating for both of those reasons. ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" has some sexual innuendos, and I will warn parents that there are even more of those in ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"". These crude jokes, or at least some of them, could easily go over the heads of little kids, which is a good thing, but parents should still be careful. On the other hand, for adult viewers, the sexual innuendos can be really funny. No, ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is not one of the cleanest CGI animated family movies from recent years, even though it came from the same studio that brought us ""Horton Hears a Who!"", the first G-rated full-length adaptation of a Dr. Seuss book, just last year. However, this third installment in the ""Ice Age"" trilogy is still decent family fare for kids who can get over the mild smut and for many adults as well."
"dfranzen70","7","0","1","6 December 2009"," Maintains standard of previous two
","I have to say, straight out, that I enjoyed the third installment in this prehistoric animated series. I can’t get enough of the adventures of Manny and Sid and Diego, even as their “herd” continues to grow. Each of the movies is a lot of fun to watch, with just enough sweet scenes to balance things out.<br/><br/>This time around, Manny and Ellie (Ray Romano and Queen Latifah) are expecting, and of course Manny’s a nervous father to be. But that’s not all – the group dynamic is starting to shift in other ways as well. First, Diego (Denis Leary) is starting to feel old and in the way; second, Sid (John Leguizamo) is actually getting in the way of Manny’s well-laid plans. But like with the first couple of movies, what brings everyone together is a journey. This time around, Sid is accidentally snatched by a giant T-rex, whose eggs he had been, er, watching. And the race is on to find and rescue Sid in what’s apparently a dinocentric world right under our friends’ icy land.<br/><br/>The visuals are stunning. Sweeping vistas of whites and blues when the gang is at home, and vibrant hues of browns, greens, and darker blues in the land of the dinosaurs. Computer animation has gotten to the point where the movies have the same level of quality as the early Disney cel animation films. The Ice Age films are wonderfully rendered, from those stunning backgrounds to the detailed expressions of the characters.<br/><br/>I do hope, though, that the Ice Age films (if more are made) don’t fall into the same rut that befell the Land before Time series. There have now been thirteen LBT movies! Of course, only the first one was in theaters, but you get my drift. Let’s not see Ice Age XX: The Search for the Great Wisdom Tree or some such fluff. Now, each of the Ice Age films has been in theaters, and although none of them has been an instant classic, each has been charming fun, and the quality has not deteriorated over the films.<br/><br/>So in essence, the latest Ice Age film maintains the high fun quotient of its predecessors without lapsing into schmaltz or too-broad physical humor. I mean, it IS a kids’ film, after all, so there’s plenty of physical humor to be found, but the comedy isn’t based solely on pain and suffering."

","Part road movie, part dinosaur actioner, and fully gushing with family values, ICE AGE: DAWN OF THE DINOSAURS is the third and most spectacular in the ICE AGE series - and probably the least interesting.<br/><br/>If you're not as tired of these characters as I am, you'll enjoy Manny the Mammoth (Ray Romano), Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the Sabretooth (Denis Leary) espousing their thinly disguised lectures on how syrupy-sweet it is to be a part of their misfit family. In the original ICE AGE, the family angle was very subtle and touching - but the writers of DAWN OF THE DINOSAURS seem to think we need it said very obviously very many times by as many talking animals as possible. We get it: Family Good, Loneliness Bad.<br/><br/>When Manny and his mammoth ""wife"" Ellie (Queen Latifah) are expecting, Sid and Diego are psychologically affected: Sid finds dinosaur eggs buried in the ice and pretends to be a mother to them (pretty disturbing stuff if it weren't for being a cartoon) and Diego decides to pursue his bachelorhood elsewhere.<br/><br/>The dino eggs hatch little tyrannosaurs, whose mother comes looking for them, taking them - and Sid - back to her underground world. (There is one sensational transition: when a crack in the ice dissolves to a cracked eggshell of the same shape.) Blatantly ripping off Jules Verne's JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH, Manny and friends, in an effort to rescue Sid, track the dino down a hole in the ice to find a subterranean world with an artificial sun where dinosaurs still rule the Earth - or at least, the middle part of it.<br/><br/>They meet Buck (Simon Pegg), a crazed, one-eyed weasel who knows how to survive in this wilder world, who leads them through its dinosaurian dangers. His raison d'être is lifelong battle with Rudy, a mysterious dinosaur that the film reveals only in its last scenes for maximum impact - a giant, scientifically-incorrect dinosaur that is a cross between a crocodile and a Spinosaururs.<br/><br/>The animation and creativity is spectacular, and the film is entertaining, but it just doesn't grab me. Either I'm getting too old, or these animals are. And neither of us is getting any funnier.<br/><br/>And that squirrel Scrat - always an acorn-chaser, never an acorn-eater - is wearing on my nerves. A female Scratte is added to the acorn chase, using her sexual wiles and any other trickery on Scrat to get what she wants - in other words, a typical female.<br/><br/>We sincerely hope that the kids watching this cartoon have already learned that dinosaurs were extinct millions of years before large mammals like mammoths evolved. Yes, we hope. We won't go into the disinformation perpetuated by creationists, fundamentalists, ignoramuses and Republicans.<br/><br/>For every cool detail the animators include - such as velociraptors with shivering feather-spikes or the maternal portrayal of tyrannosaurs - it is tempered by silly aspects like not being allowed to show meat eaters actually eating meat or running down prey. (Blame the characteristically gutless MPAA.) <br/><br/>No wonder I couldn't get my teeth into this film."
"TxMike","Null","0","1","21 November 2009"," This third in the Ice Age series is my favorite, I believe.
","Just to reflect for a few seconds, I grew up in the 1950s when animated ""cartoons"" were part of the attraction at the theater. When you consider that process, and what we have now in the animation like ""Ice Age"", it is amazing how far animation has come in my lifetime.<br/><br/>This ""Ice Age"" story is in a fictional time when the ice age was still upon the Earth, but an vast, lush underground world is discovered, where dinosaurs and other creatures, thought to be extinct, were still thriving. It starts when the sloth breaks through some thin ice and discovers 3 very large eggs. So he brings them to safety, where they hatch while he is napping. They are baby T-Rex dinosaurs, and of course imprint on his as their ""mother."" Trouble comes when the real mother is looking for her babies, and ends up carrying them plus the sloth down into the strange land.<br/><br/>This all happens as the story begins, and most of the movie has the rest of the mixed ice age ""family"" traveling down into this strange world to try to rescue their friend, the sloth.<br/><br/>The animation, of course, is flawless. The story is a lot of fun and very inventive. I laughed often. As with the other two, the silly squirrel, Scrat, provided much of the entertainment. Here he meets an alluring female squirrel, and when they are competing for a plump acorn, then falling into a deep chasm, he finds out she is, in fact, a flying squirrel.<br/><br/>Good movie. I may buy a copy of the DVD."

","There have been quite a few movies in 3-D lately (and there are more to come), but at this moment (Pixars Up is not available to review yet), this is the best of them. It's not the effects, that make this movie wonderful. They are nice, but I'm sure there will be better ones shortly (like in the movie Avatar by James Cameron). It's the movie/the story itself that convinces! <br/><br/>While the second Ice Age (movie), could be considered a bit of a letdown, this one picks right up and takes you along a great ride. There's not that much that you can accuse the movie of (one of the things might be, that you think Diego is underused), because it works nicely. The new main character that is introduced, is spoken by someone very famous in Great Britain .... Everything fits and the movie can be enjoyed by young audiences and older ones. Even Scrat gets something ""new"" ... something he that is very familiar for us ""humans"" in every aspect that he is living through it and therefor very funny.<br/><br/>I can only recommend the movie to everyone! (Story-)Quality-wise it's just one step behind Pixar and that is something great to achieve! :o)"
"StartingAllOver14","8","0","2","24 August 2009"," Don't worry fans, the third ""Ice Age"" movie is a delightful threat for everyone
","I was looking forward to this movie with anticipation and rather listened to my friends and the critics recommendations for the film, despite I also worried that it could turn out to be bad, considering the movie industries are milking of the products for what it's worth. But fortunately my hopes for this movie got pleased.<br/><br/>There are rarely a trilogy where all the movies turn out to be equally good, but that what the Ice Age trilogy proofs. I felt this movie surpassed the first film, while it's still a notch below «Ice Age 2; The Meltdown», which in my opinion is the best of the trilogy.<br/><br/>However, ""Ice Age 3"" is a cute and delightful experience, more equal to the second film than the first one. It has good animation, great cinematography, funny lines and gags, a good score and tender, emotional moments. Most of the familiar and beloved cast is back, including the new, amusing character Buck (my favorite one), Scrat's new love interest and the dinosaurs. In spite there's too many characters and not enough screen time to everyone, you still don't feel that the mayor characters gets left behind. The old cast is more or less just the same way like you're used to see them.<br/><br/>Storywise, ""Ige Age 3"" may not be deep and complex, but one shouldn't expect a profound story while going into this movie, one should watch this movie to get entertained and amused. There are however a subplot that is similar to «Shrek The Third» (which I won't tell more about now). If there's something to complain, it would be the fast close-up shots with Buck, which were unnecessary and I would have liked the film to have more action sequences, but those are just small details which doesn't ruin the experience.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Ice Age 3"" is a great movie for kids (cause there are too many crappy films/shows that is aimed for them nowadays) and for adults. It's one of the best movies of 2009, so just go and check it out, you'll have a entertaining experience. And be sure that you'll may have the catchy ""Walk the Dinosaur"" stuck in your head while leaving the theater.<br/><br/>And by the way, a note to Fox and Blue Sky Studios (as if they would have read this); please don't make a ""Ice Age 4"", it's enough with three movies."
"aightellya","6","0","1","21 August 2009"," Bringing fun back!
","You may think my rating of 9 out of 10 for this movie is a little high, for a mere sequel without an original premise. Why throw such high praise onto it? Well I'll tell you. I believe firmly in rating a movie according to its genre because different people like different things! Whilst most would agree that the Godfather is an excellent movie that is more deserving of a 9 rating than this one that viewpoint is a bit silly since it only considers the movie from the point of view of people who like realistic, dramatic movies and not those who just want a bit of fun and escapism from their movies. I loved the Godfather movies but I wouldn't call them fun! I read some of the other reviews of this movie here and it amazes me some of the gripes that people are coming out with about it: ""Dinosaurs died out 65million years before the ice-age!"", ""there's not much of a story.""... You're concerned about realism In a movie about talking animals? A movie in which tigers are hanging out with possums? You're really gonna gripe about how implausible the time-line is in a Children's fantasy fiction CGI CARTOON? In any case they DO actually explain this away - for those kids in the audience whose parents have crippled their ability to suspend any disbelief (presumably those parents are the ones making such ridiculous comments here and I feel sorry for their kids) as our plucky heroes are surprised to find the underground world - & say so. Can you imagine walking out of a cinema after seeing a movie like this only to hear a concerned parent pointing out to their kids how it wasn't factually accurate? Haha! Why not tell them Santa's not real too while you're at it ya' fun-killer?<br/><br/>As for the lack of story I've gotta say again; KIDS movie people, jeez stop looking at everything cynical and jaded adult eyes! The story is as involving as it needs to be for the purposes of the film (i.e. allow for our characters to get into humorous adventure situations) as who cares about plot twists & character development when you came to a movie to have fun with your kids or even without as there was more than enough here to keep me - a 25year old male with DVD collection filled with 15-18 rated movies - entertained for the full 90 mins give or take a few minutes at the beginning of the movie which opens with the scene from the trailer we've all seen like 20times by now on T.V. or before other movies - its funny but it is a visual gag and so isn't that funny after you've seen it the first 3times.<br/><br/>What's great about this movie is that, as I've already said, if you haven't lost your sense of fun, can suspend disbelief / cynic in yourself, and appreciate a story that exists for the sole purpose of allowing the setup of humorous situations and a plethora of visual gags then you my friend are in for a real treat. I quite liked the first two movies though I can't really recall what they were about (like a good night out - after a few weeks you just remember that you had a good time and that's it, haha) but I thought this one was even better, just rock solid fun from start to finish and a perfectly balanced movie in that you don't have to have seen the previous two in order to follow everything but if you have seen them then at least there is enough new stuff here to hold interest such as Simon Pegg doing an awesome job with the genius comic creation that is Buck the one-eyed weasel; someone here said he reminded them of Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow and I sort of see where they're coming from except Buck is a little of the opposite in that he is foolhardily brave rather than a coward, haha! And so I give this movie a 9 for its genre: the I just want to lose myself in a colourful adventure filled with clever visual gags and a real sense of fun type of movie - nothing serious or dramatic or anything that requires me to think / pay attention. This movie instead just grabs what little attention you might have and takes it for a ride :o) The only reason I didn't give it a 10 for its genre was because I hate and I mean HATE the guy that plays Manny (Ray Romano I think his name is), how he got his own T.V. show (""everybody loves Raymond""... not me!!!) I've no idea, I just don't find him funny, more of a boring, annoying and skull-splittingly drone-some kind of fellow so the fact that even his presence in a lead role was not enough for me to drop this movie more than one star should hopefully tell you how good it is.<br/><br/>One final note, I did not watch this movie in 3D, I watched it on a tiny little screen with only stereo sound and I still thoroughly enjoyed it. I'd imagine it would be much much better - as CGI movies often are - in full digital HD with surround sound so if you have an IMAX near you that's showing this or are lucky enough to have a huge HD TV and surround setup then I highly recommend that you watch it that way as I could tell whilst I was watching it that the spectacle of many scenes would have been much more impressive in 3D/HD and with full on sound. Anyway, if you don't enjoy the movie then do yourself a favour and don't have kids - you'll only turn them into boring imagination-devoid poor suckers like you and thats no fun for anyone ;o)"

I don't think so but number 3 was much awaited.<br/><br/>I saw it in 3D but it doesn't add amazing changes as it is a cartoon with repetitive landscapes (ice or jungle). Furthermore, eye (or brain) adapts very quickly to this vision.<br/><br/>It was great to rejoice with this funny trio, which keeps becoming bigger after each movie. In regard to the new delivery, I can't really like Buck, the jungle guide. <br/><br/>The story is more oriented this time and fast paced. The gags are funny and even hilarious, especially the Scratch ones! They are really at their best when it comes to glide or fall down! <br/><br/>But I fear the extinction is near because the scope is very limited: a ""family"" like this is very difficult to write, all the more in prehistoric times!

The movie overall was good, great story line and great lovable characters. You cant help to laugh at the 3 little eggs that Sid is taking care of for a whole day. Buck is hilarious! The way he goes about things is semi crazy, but a whole lot of fun. I brought my kids from day camp to see it, ranging in ages from 4-12, and when we left the theater they were all very happy at the end result and singing along to the song that was playing during the end credits.

","Well I just saw Ice Age and thought that it was a well spent fun flick. The humor was somewhat used in past films, but overall the usage is fresh and fits well within the story. The film's plot genuinely fits the trilogy, there is no sense of confusion, no disregards of any character. They are all freshly renewed and ready for another adventure.<br/><br/>I am a critic for film style, and am loving it! This film had great film style. The camera angles and zooms and such really followed dialogue and action sequences. One aspect of the film that I would give it a 100% is the transitions between scenes on the movie. The Nut and Nut, they really spice up the word ""transition"" because whenever there is a new situation, they entertain the audience for a little bit and then the scenery takes place with the situation the squirrel holds.<br/><br/>The only reason that I give this film an 8 out 10 is because of the old usage of humor. The audience laughed mildly, along with a few obnoxious children, they were hyped up by the jokes. A great film for the general audience and really a stunner for this year's animation comedy film.<br/><br/>This is worth your time and money, and especially if you have children, it just reminds one of the situations during the 9 month phase of having a kid :) enjoy!"

The main story line made no sense, and seemed to be thrown together by the writers. If you choose to see this movie, go in without expectations, because that's the only way you will enjoy it. The sub-stories will be enough to carry you through the wishy-washy main story.

The only downer of the film was when the baby mammoth is born, its not as heartfelt as it could be, which let it down a little.

"moviemanMA","7","0","3","19 July 2009"," The rebirth of a dying franchise
","The first sequel to 20th Century Fox's Ice Age, Ice Age: The Meltdown, was awful. There was nothing redeemable about the film. The writing was bad, the animation hadn't improved, and the story along with it's characters were rushed and predictable. The franchise was virtually dead in the water.<br/><br/>This summer brought Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, the company's first 3D endeavour. Since most animated films coming out nowadays are heading towards the third dimension, it seemed necessary that this would follow suit. After seeing a few of the 3D films this year this was nothing spectacular, but it was definitely on par with the rest.<br/><br/>The film starts off with Scrat (the squirrel) finding another female squirrel and the two of them fighting over the beloved acorn. Manny and Ellie (Ray Romano and Queen Latifah) are expecting their first child and Manny is not handling being a father very well. Diego (Dennis Leary), sensing that his time with the ""herd"" is almost up, is on the verge of leaving for good. Meanwhile Sid (John Leguizamo) tries to start a family of his own by swiping some idle dinosaur eggs. This opens up a whole can of worms, resulting in the mother dinosaur stealing her babies along with Sid and venturing back home to her world under the surface.<br/><br/>The remaining members of the herd follow him below the surface to a Journey to the Center of the Earth type realm where the meet their guide, Buck (Simon Pegg), a lone weasel whose cunning is almost as great as his madness. It is up to him to bring them safely through the jungle without being eaten by the dreaded monster Rudy.<br/><br/>The story is nothing out of the ordinary but it doesn't disappoint by any means. Where the film excels is in the writing. There are jokes here and there for the kids, after all it is a children's movie, but for the most part an adult will feel pretty satisfied on the whole with the humor. The problems the characters face are not that uncommon for most adults. There are family issues like pregnancy, fatherhood, and other issues like finding a sense of belonging and whether or not you can still keep up with the rest of the world.<br/><br/>The animation compliments the story quite nicely. There are some cheap gimmicks with the 3D effects but they aren't over the top. The layering of the objects in the background and foreground are excellent, giving the film great depth. There are some neat motion shots and point of view shots throughout the film that give it a cool feel.<br/><br/>I'm not really promoting you see this film but if you have the chance to I would say don't be scared. It's a cool little film that has a lot to offer for all ages. I don't think they should make another one, but after all the money this film is making tallies up I think they might have to. That could be very bad. Or not. We'll see."

","Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs {dir.

Visually the film is well done, although (per usual with Ice Age films) the script could use some fine tuning. Some of the one-liners fall very flat and the characters seem to become boring. However, the film's two biggest virtues make up for its numerous flaws. The best part of the first two films was certainly that curious mix of squirrel and rat fittingly named Scrat. This film features Scrat at his funniest, with more extended scenes and hilarious situations than ever. Also, the addition of a new character, a one-eyed weasel named Buck (voiced brilliantly by Simon Pegg), provides a new pace, rhythm and humor to the tired plot-line."

While I'm sure it would look better in 3D, but I suspect not by much.<br/><br/>In this third installment, Manny the Mammoth and his gang make a journey to the center of the earth where they discover a lost world where dinosaurs still rule. We have seen this story many times before. The only thing that carries this story forward are the cute characters and their staunch friendship with each other. The dialogues are quite funny. The art work is commendable with its sense of depth and texture, as before. The action scenes (especially that one with Sid sledding in the snow grappling with three dinosaur eggs) were very well-executed.<br/><br/>The new character, a swashbuckling weasel named Buck was cutely heroic, but I felt I have seen this character many times before in other animated films. Not very original again, including his eye patch. There were a lot of mushy love scenes of Scrat and his female partner. However, treating this situation as a love triangle with the Acorn was comedic genius for me (""Alone Again Naturally, haha!) Some scenes would seem very scary for kids like the meat-eating dinosaurs coughing out entire animals they had eaten, small raptors attacking Ellie while she was in labor or any scene with the giant white dinosaur named Rudy."

","What could be more fun than seeing the makeshift family from the first two ICE AGE feature-length cartoons (Manny and Ellie the Mammoth couple, Diego the saber-toothed tiger, and Sid the Sloth) visit their own exciting theme park, which was under their frozen world all the time?! Manny (Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) are expecting and somewhat preoccupied, as is Diego (Denis Leary), who fears he is slowing down. Feeling neglected, Sid starts exploring and finds three large eggs, which he ""adopts."" Eventually this leads the quartet, plus Crash (Sean William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck) to the warmer underworld, where the eggs hatch as cute little T-Rex's! The ice-agers make a new friend, Buck the one-eyed weasel (Simon Pegg), who leads them through adventures galore. Meanwhile, back at the acorn, Scrat (Chris Wedge) has found his own new playmate, a flying squirrel with a taste for nuts to match his own. Put it all together, and the little ones are bound to leave with a smile!"
