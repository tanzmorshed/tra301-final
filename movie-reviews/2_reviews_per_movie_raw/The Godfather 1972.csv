","'The Godfather' is the pinnacle of flawless films! The first time I viewed 'The Godfather' I was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my all-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let's start from the beginning. The film opens to four words, 'I believe in America', it's crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the film's ""threshold"". This is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first take we are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly portrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando. Vito is a feared man, he is a criminal, he is a mafioso, but above all he is a respected family man, his three sons are depicted by three excellent actors, James Caan, John Cazale and Al Pacino as well as his adopted child Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall. The film follows Vito as he attempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son, Michael. With some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever been seen in the 1970's film industry (including a certain horse's head), 'The Godfather' epitomises how violence can be used effectively within a film. The Corleone's are some of the greatest antiheroes to have ever been seen on screen, whilst they are villains, the audience will refuse to accept that fact, Coppola does something simple and audacious, he takes the guilt out of organised crime. A film rife with beautiful cinematography, memorable musical scores and well-paced action and drama. Overall, The Godfather is one of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes that gets everything right; a gangster flick that is overflowing with life, rich with emotion and subtle acting, and further blessed with amazing direction from Francis Ford Coppola. Arguably the most unforgettable masterpiece to have ever been made."
"andrewburgereviews","10","40","43","1 April 2019"," An offer so good, I couldn't refuse
","It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.<br/><br/>This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.<br/><br/>But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.<br/><br/>The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.<br/><br/>Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.<br/><br/>This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.<br/><br/>Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement."

"SJ_1","10","903","1112","30 September 2005"," ""The Godfather"" is pretty much flawless, and one of the greatest films ever made
","Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.<br/><br/>The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint."

","One of the great movies of its time. Before, and even now is admire as one of the most classic and greatest films of all time. And I agree. I remember when I first watched it I never thought that Sonny would be the one killed, and Michael being the one taking over the family, and ruling with an iron fist. I have to watch at least one or two times a year."
"alexkolokotronis","10","211","259","21 June 2008"," An Iconic Film
","Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies spinned off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can't. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.<br/><br/>The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.<br/><br/>The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.<br/><br/>The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.<br/><br/>The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.<br/><br/>The horse's head, the scene of Brando running with his groceries, the coffee shop scene, ""I'll give him an offer he can't refuse"" and countless other scenes and quotes from this movie have become a part of our culture. These scenes and lines have been recycled over and over again in comedies, commercials, etc. that it is impossible to avoid the greatness of The Godfather. The Godfather is like a disease once you see it you fall in love with it. I don't know if it is the greatest movie ever but it is definitely the most iconic film ever made."
"b-a-h TNT-6","10","491","632","5 March 2002"," Another kind of ""family movie""
","The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for ""gangster movies"", but its influence goes well beyond that.<br/><br/>The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every ""organized crime film"" nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination.<br/><br/>But to say that The Godfather is simply ""influential"" is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as ""a movie about gangsters"". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.<br/><br/>As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.<br/><br/>The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.<br/><br/>However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.<br/><br/>To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his ""innocence"" and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.<br/><br/>I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.<br/><br/>There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an exposé of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.<br/><br/>The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.<br/><br/>The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends."
"MR_Heraclius","10","60","72","23 February 2020"," The greatest movie of all time!
","One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema."
"mattrochman","10","411","555","14 October 2006"," Initially, I wasn't a fan... but then I realised
","This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.<br/><br/>To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.<br/><br/>Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.<br/><br/>2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).<br/><br/>3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.<br/><br/>All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.<br/><br/>I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability."
"JosephD3193","10","13","14","11 May 2018"," A Legitimately Perfect Film
","Really what more about The Godfather can I say that hasen't already been said?<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is perfectly executed and incredibly well put together. The characters are really what added that extra depth to the film. The first character I want to bring up is Sonny. Throughout the movie, you know him as an ignorant and almost childish person, yet when he is shot and killed, you feel immediate sympathy for him. And at the same time he is a determined member of their family business and also caring when the time is needed for that trait to be exposed (ex: when Vito nearly dies in the first act). And when Vito is looking down at his dead body, you really feel for them even though someone like Vito may come across like an incredibly serious and emotionless man. But what they accomplished was, not making him another one dimensional Mafia/mob boss, but someone who legitimately cares for his family. The way they introduce him in the beginning of the film is very well conducted and shows the audience how intimidating he is and the impact he has on other people in what he says and how his word/opinion is extremely important to people. Brando is incomparable in his role and is irreplaceable as his role as Don Corleone.<br/><br/>My favorite aspect of this movie, however, is seeing the riveting transition of Michael Corleone throughout the film. They first introduce Michael as someone who wants nothing to do with the family business, but is eventually the new Don replacing his father at the end of the film. Wow! What a transformation! He is a former Marine who is committed to living a normal, happy life with his wife Kay. However Michael eventually gets involved in the criminal empire after Vito is shot and almost killed. This leads up to the best scene, in my opinion, of the movie. Michael goes out to a restaurant with Sollozzo, the head of one of the rival families of the Corleones, the Tattaglias, in addition to Police Captain McCluskey, with intentions to kill both of them. He does after contemplating it in his head, and this is an incredibly important scene because it is the start of Michael's transition into the new Don we see at the end of the movie. It was not rushed in any way and that's another great aspect of the film. It's nearly three hours long, but it's necessary for the person watching it to be fully immersed into the story and characters. The ending is really well directed and thought out because without any explanation, you know what just happened as soon as someone kisses Michael's hand, which was shown earlier in the film but to Vito, a gesture only given to the Don. Al Pacino gave a great performance and so did every single other person in the movie. Perfect casting all around.<br/><br/>I think one performance that is very undervalued is Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. He plays a super important role in the movie, but is not quickly thought of by most people. He was a side character, but incorporated well in the film as the advisor for Vito, and later Michael.<br/><br/>Many Of the characters in the movie and constantly conflicted with themselves and they display it very well. The entire story is one of the best ever put to the big screen and the praise that it's gotten over all these years are very deserving. <br/><br/>The way they utilize lighting in the film is also very important such as every scene of Vito in his office at the beginning of the film is constantly lit dark showing the fear people feel when entering his office and the seriousness of situations involving him. This also applies to Vito's soft spoken voice demonstrating how intimidating he comes off as without screaming for example. A vast majority of the film, basically the entire 2nd and 3rd acts, with the exception of the very beginning with the wedding to go also how with the 1st act, are all lit dim, in dark tones. On the other hand, Michael, in the beginning of the film, is shown in the bright daylight outside talking with his girlfriend, an excellent contrast between him and the rest of his family.<br/><br/>Great acting, great script, and all put into great hands that made it as amazing as it is even 40 years later.<br/><br/>RATING: 10.0/10"

","This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..<br/><br/>With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on alot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..<br/><br/>Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.<br/><br/>This is definetely a ""must see"" masterpiece."

This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people.

"DaveDiggler","10","109","148","29 June 2008"," An Epic, Masterful Look into the Underground World
","""The Godfather"" simply put, is one of the greatest films of all time. The script is thee best I've ever read. The direction is flawless. The acting may very well have the best ensemble cast in any movie I've ever seen or will ever see. It's also one of the most precise and intricate films I've ever come across as writer, Mario Puzo brings out some of the most hidden and guarded secrets of the underground world ever captured on film. Watching ""The Godfather,"" is like watching cinematic art. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is what brings this film, that's so ambitious and so grand, down to earth with precision direction as he handles each and every scene with such care. The film starts with a black screen and an opening monologue from an undertaker. As the man starts talking about honor, family, respect, and justice we are pulled right in on his luminous eyes as he stands in near darkness. He begs for justice since the American system has failed him. He goes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) for justice. Don Vito is the man of power. He's the one who pulls all the strings and watches his puppets dance from behind the stage and out of sight; untouchable, or so we think. Some of the greatest moments in the film- and very intentional to show the distinguishable difference between Michael and Vito- are of Vito crying over his son, Sonny's (James Caan), death. When Michael learns of the news, he has little reaction. Two of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the film are from the cause of a loved one that has died long before he should have, and they come from Brando. As Vito stands over the body of his son he nearly breaks down. There is clash of feelings between the two men that are never conflicting, but compared. <br/><br/>The film opens during the wedding of Don Vito' daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), and we see just how strong the bond of family really is. You have the family dancing with each other, drinking, laughing, and sitting next to each other to show how close they are, then we see some of the outsiders such as the Barzini family, and surprisingly Michael (Al Pacino) along with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) on the outskirts without much interaction. Michael seems almost out of place as if he is the adopted son and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is more apart of the family than he is. His opening words are to Kay, and they include, ""That's my family, Kay. That's not me."" <br/><br/>We get the feeling that Michael's nearly ashamed of the stigma that goes along with his last name: This is what makes Al Pacino' role- significantly- the hardest performance in the entire film to portray. He's the one doing all the heavy lifting as he has to go from outsider and completely against the family's actions and businesses to, by films end, head of the family. Brando has the teary eyed moments that actors live for, but Michael is too cold for that. Never for a second as he gradually comes to power do we think this turn is ridiculous or laughable, and in lesser hands it very easily could have been. <br/><br/>The final act of the film is loaded with plot points as decisions are made left and right as the film becomes visually and emotionally captivating. As the film draws to an end, Michael has gained half of the power of the family and makes most of the decisions. He's treated, not with respect, but as an outsider, too high ranking for his experience. The Corleone family is on the brink of disaster and losing everything, yet we never get that feeling. We see the two leader's confidence and we keep our confidence in them, even if the other family members doubt their decisions. Michael goes to Las Vegas and makes Moe Greene an offer he can't refuse. Then he refuses. This is Pacino' shinning moment in the film. There's no screaming or the hoopla that goes along with his name. After he treats Moe Greene like utter garbage, Fredo (John Cazale) get's upset and starts barking at him. Coppola is perfectly on his game here, too, as we watch from Fredo's height, looking down on Michael who sits in a chair as he coldly looks up with his radiating eyes, that have so much going on behind them, and simply says, ""Fredo, don't ever take sides with anyone against family again. Ever.""<br/><br/>That's some serious foreshadowing for the second film, and only after watching the second film can you go back and appreciate what Pacino and Coppola pulled off in this scene; Cazale too. We have no idea how serious Michael is. These are some of the stepping stones that make Michael's change believable. He's not quite his father- Vito has a soft spot for his children (admittedly so)- as he's capable of turning on anyone and using the line, ""It's strictly business"" when it comes to family issues. Michael's sister, Connie, calls him a ""cold hearted bastard"" at the end of the film. It's hard to find better superlatives than that, yet we still love him. The interesting thing about Pacino' performance is that he doesn't sugarcoat it. He doesn't try to make the audience love him. He plays the character as the character should be played. That's the sign of great writing; great acting; and great directing since we could have very easily seen someone try to make him likable. This crew just presents the character with all his flaws and let's us decide if we love him or hate him.

","""The Godfather"" is a huge piece of film entertaining, involving sentiment, nostalgia, filial affection, pride, integrity, loyalty, corruption, honor, betrayal and crime... Within weeks of its release, it was clearly a blockbuster, a cinematic phenomenon, an exquisite Mafia epic with outstanding performances... Coppola got everything right, creating a landmark in American cinema...<br/><br/>His film acutely details the inner workings of the criminal ""families,"" and the ruthlessness of those in organized crime, but also examines their steadfast loyalty, love for blood relations, and code of ethics... Coppola and Puzo subtly weave a complex narrative with themes of hypocrisy, power, and corruption which stands as a pulsating reflection of our uncertain times... <br/><br/>With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando creates a personage that will be remembered for ever... The line ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" has reached legendary statues... Brando's Don Corleone is the moral center of the film: a tough, wise, feared old Sicilian who has risen to become an all powerful leader in an empire of Italian-American organized crime...<br/><br/>While crime may be the first image that comes into one's mind in the film, violence plays a vital part in this complicated tale... Brando is the head of one of the five families who are said to control the Mafia in the area of New York... He is opposed to any involvement in drugs, and refuses to risk his political contacts and prestige for such putrefied money... He is behind the time but he understands that society is not alarmed by ""liquor, gambling, and even women..."" He is also a loving family man... His sons, relatives and friends are part of his operations... He despises displays of weakness... He understands the strength of power and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the ""sovereignty."" In the outdoor garden, father and son are affectionate to each other, but cannot express their emotions openly...<br/><br/>The Corleones are a warm, close family and the motion picture (with l0 Oscar Nominations) shows the flavor of Italian-American home life... Don Corleone is an undisputed patriarch, and as played by Brando, he has almost the manner of a religious leader... His voice is quite and rasping, his chin stands as a symbol of his authority, and men kisses his hand as they ask for his favors... He is a charismatic leader and his eyes reflect his kind heart as his implacability...<br/><br/>Pacino's gradual and subtle transformation is the heart of the film... From a gentle man to one of the most cunning, ruthless, and cold-blooded man ever to come on the screen, he has learned from his father never to talk in front of outsiders and always keep his own counsel... His commandment ""Never to take sides against the Family."" <br/><br/>The opening shot of ""The Godfather"" sets the tone of the film as Don Corleone and some of his family listen to an undertaker, Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Cirsitto), pleading for justice for the near-rape and brutal beating suffered by his daughter...<br/><br/>Attending the wedding of his sister Connie to young bookmaker Carlo Rizzi, Michael, a highly decorated Marine captain from World War II, points out the other guests to Kate (Diane Keaton), his non-Italian girlfriend... In the same time Coppola introduces us to his large cast of characters:<br/><br/>Sonny (James Caan), the rough, hot-headed impulsive kid who never really grew up; Fredo (John Cazale), the troubled, shy, weak young man who can't seem to do anything right; Tom (Robert Duvall), the right-hand man, the legal adviser and adopted son to the Godfather steady, reliable, always thinking, always controlled; Connie (Talia Shire), the battered wife and rebellious sister, who achieves and promotes the movie's most horrific scene; Johnny Fontane (Al Martine), the idol star whose tears set up the shocking moment when a movie ""big shot"" named Jack Woltz (John Marley) finds himself in an horrifying pool of blood; Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana), the giant criminal thug, one of Corleone's most trusted enforcers; Tessio (Abbe Vigoda), the fearsome tall enforcer who implies the possibility of violent revenge guaranteeing Michael's safety; and Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the other faithful enforcer...<br/><br/>With a beautiful score by Nino Rota immensely memorable, Coppola's motion picture remains a triumph, nearly perfect in its execution, composition, and impact..."

","The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw.  Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life.  There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them.   Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime.  Its really a movie about family.  The dialogue is just unbelievable.  I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is.  The music, the acting, everything.  People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way  that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather.  The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie.   Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I'm crazy."
"JamesHitchcock","8","131","203","16 May 2004"," A film of great power and a milestone in the history of the cinema
","Before 'The Godfather' came out in 1972, the gangster genre, chiefly associated with Jimmy Cagney and the film noir style of the forties and fifties, had been in something of a decline. It was, therefore, a brave move for Francis Ford Coppola to attempt a three-hour epic based upon the family life of a Mafia don. <br/><br/>The film opens in the immediate post-war period with the wedding of the daughter of Don Vito Corleone. Scenes of the wedding are intercut with scenes showing Don Vito himself in his study, granting favours and dispensing a crude form of justice as though he were an absolute monarch. We soon learn, however, that times are changing, even in the world of organised crime. Don Vito's empire has been based upon gambling, illicit liquor sales and prostitution. Other Mafia families, however, are eager for the profits to be made from drugs, and Corleone receives a proposal from a drug dealer named Sollozzo that the Corleone clan should join him in exploiting the narcotics market. Corleone refuses, ostensibly for business reasons, but it is made clear that his real objections to narcotics derive from his personal code of honour. Sollozzo, offended, orders an attempt to be made on Corleone's life. This fails, but Corleone is left seriously injured.<br/><br/>The focus now shifts to the younger generation. Don Vito has three sons, Santino ('Sonny'), Fredo and Michael, and an adopted son, Tom Hagen. These four have contrasting characters. Sonny is hot-headed and impetuous, Fredo weak, Tom cautious and moderate. Michael, the youngest, loves his family, but initially wants to play no part in their criminal enterprises. Recently returned from the war, his ambitions are to qualify as a lawyer and to settle down in a respectable life with his Anglo-Saxon wife-to-be, Kay. The attempt on his father's life, however, persuades Michael that his first loyalty is to the family, and he agrees to be part of a revenge attack on Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey the corrupt policeman who is on his payroll. There follows a brutal cycle of revenge, as each killing is avenged by another murder. <br/><br/>The film's emphasis on family ties, honour and vengeance recall the revengers' tragedies of the Shakespearean and Jacobean theatre. Coppola does seem to be aiming for a Shakespearean grandeur. Don Vito, the ageing monarch whose powers slip away is reminiscent of King Lear, Michael, a good man corrupted by power, of Macbeth (a comparison which will become even more apt in the later episodes of the trilogy). There is also something of Hamlet in Michael and Sonny's resolve to avenge their father. Such an ambitious film requires acting of a very high order if it is to seem credible, but Coppola was able to draw upon some of the best performances of the seventies. To my mind, this was Marlon Brando's last great role (I have never cared much for 'Apocalypse Now' and loathed 'Last Tango in Paris'), but it was one that he made the most of. His Don Vito is both terrifying and pitiable, part dictator and part lonely old man. His rasping voice (the result of an earlier bullet wound in the throat) conveys both menace and physical weakness. Don Vito may be a bad man, but he is also in a way a magnificent one, and his passing marks the end of an era. <br/><br/>If the film was notable for the last of the great Brando, it also saw the birth of a new star. Except perhaps for 'The Godfather Part II', I have never seen Al Pacino give a better performance than he did here, as he portrayed Michael's passage from a 'civilian' (as his brother calls him) to a warlord, from an innocent young idealist to a ruthless killer. Given the length of time that Pacino is on screen, I am surprised that he was only nominated for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor. It would be interesting to speculate who might have won if he and Brando had been in competition for the award. I am even more surprised that Pacino did not win as Best Supporting Actor; Joel Grey's role in 'Cabaret' (which did win) is more showy and a technical tour de force, but it lacks the emotional depth of Pacino's performance. I also greatly admired James Caan's role as the hot-headed Sonny. <br/><br/>This is not a perfect film; it has flaws, both artistic and ethical. Artistically, there are places where it tends to drag, particularly after the killings of Sollozzo and McCluskey, and even more so after the killing of Sonny, although it recovers at the ending, which is a highly effective piece of cinema. <br/><br/>Ethically, I felt that the film tended to take the characters' world view too much at face value. Don Vito may be a dictator, but he is in his own eyes a benevolent dictator, a man of honour who lives by his own moral code. As others such as Roger Ebert have pointed out, this is a film which views a closed society from the inside; the only outsider is Kay, and her role is a relatively minor one. As a result, we do not get to see the damage that organised crime does to the fabric of society, and the Mafia's own view of itself is never openly challenged. That is not to say, however, that the film is totally amoral. We do see that an ethos of taking revenge can spiral out of control and lead to unforeseen consequences, to the innocent as well as the guilty. This is particularly true of the scenes where Michael takes refuge in Sicily after killing Sollozzo. The dead man's associates track him down, and a bomb meant for him instead kills his innocent young Italian wife Apollonia. <br/><br/>Although there may be no overt condemnation of the moral position of the Mafia, there is implied criticism of its bloodier deeds. All the characters, whatever the crimes of which they may be guilty, are careful to pay lip-service to the Catholic Church and its rituals. Throughout the film (indeed, throughout the trilogy as a whole) the traditional ceremonies of the Church form a backdrop to various criminal activities. ('The Godfather' begins with a wedding and ends with a baptism). It seemed to me that Coppola was using these scenes to make an ironic contrast between the values of organised crime and those of Christianity, especially at the end of the film. Michael, already a 'godfather' in the metaphorical sense of a Mafia boss, becomes one in the literal sense of a baptismal sponsor. Shots of him taking vows on behalf of his godchild to reject the works of the devil are intercut with shots of his enemies being gunned down on his orders.<br/><br/>Despite my reservations about this film, and although I personally would not have ranked it as my all-time favourite, there can be no denying that it is a film of great power and a milestone in the history of the cinema. 8/10"

I love this film All of my family loves it My girlfriend loves it. I think it is one of the best films ever. It stars many actors such as Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. It is one of the most greatest films of all time. I have it on DVD at home and the Soundtrack at home.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945–55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.<br/><br/>Based on Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name, The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre. Ranked second to Citizen Kane by the American Film Institute in 2007,it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1990 as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".<br/><br/>The film was the box office leader for 1972 and was, for a time, the highest-grossing picture ever made. It won three Academy Awards for that year: Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando) and in the category Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Its nominations in seven other categories included Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. The success spawned two sequels: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in 1990."

","The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.<br/><br/>The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get."
"Godz365","10","5","5","27 February 2019"," How things were done back then!
","The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.<br/><br/>The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie.

"BrandtSponseller","10","473","834","24 April 2005"," For me it isn't ""the greatest ever"", but it's still great
","Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.<br/><br/>The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.<br/><br/>Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.<br/><br/>But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.<br/><br/>To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.<br/><br/>But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.<br/><br/>Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).<br/><br/>Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film."

The cinematography is amazing too, and some of the shots and scenes from this movie can be considered the best of any movie throughout time. You can see IMDb's 9.2 rating of The Godfather and hear about the movie as often as you want, but until you experience the power of this film yourself, it will be impossible to grasp the importance of the movie to cinema. Although this movie is from the early 70s, it is by no means dated. Michael Corleone is my personal favorite character of all time, and the chance to see James Caan, Robert Duvall, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and John Cazale work together is unforgettable.

"eric262003","10","14","19","26 May 2014"," The Geatest Movie Ever Made
","You can't really criticize a film like ""The Godfather"", especially from a younger-type guy like me. Since its release in 1972, ""The Godfather"" has been highly praised by fans universally. It's extremely hard for a person who has never seen ""The Godfather"" without having high expectations because millions of people, maybe more have been talking about how wonderful it is. But as a film critic who has seen the movie several times and has read the novel that it was based on by Mario Puzo, this movie really deserves the credibility it gets. It really is that special. The film is a gripping epic that indulges the viewer with plenty of unsuspecting twists and a plot that works in a multitude of dimensions. The mobster's depicted here face many trials and tribulation that involve marriage, favours, family struggles, turncoats, tragic events, violence and rigor mortis.<br/><br/>Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head patriarch and kingpin of his esteemed enterprise is acquainted to at his daughter's wedding, which is a special occurrence in Italian tradition (Sicilian in particular) where the father of the bride is to refrain from offering the groom any special favours. His representatives showing their signs of respect towards the Don are featured in the opening scenes are told through their ways of personal address and greeting regimentations. The Don is to be treated with respect and dignity, a man who follows his own frame of mind to what is fair, and will likely deny any means of avenge. As an example, if anyone was to fondle with his daughter in any kind of way grounds for murder. It's not revenge, as long as your daughter's still breathing.<br/><br/>There are also numerous facets that indicate how not so respected the Don really is. Vito comes from the old school of Mafia, and can be labeled as a ""Moustache"" Pete. For one, unlike his adversaries, he refuses to get involved with drugs or smuggling for that matter. It this is much to the chagrin of other rival mob units in the state of New York. The violence is described disturbingly as nothing personal, it's just business. The philosophy behind this organized crime is chilling, but quite convincing. The violence is creepily accepted and sometimes happens all of the sudden. Suddenly, the Corleone enterprise falls on its foundations, and it's up to the next generation to restore the family so it could be ranked as the top of the best mob families.<br/><br/>The cast features a myriad of talented performers each playing their respective roles flawlessly. The top stars like Brando as Vito, James Caan as the hot-tempered Sonny, Al Pacino as the likable Michael, John Cazale as middle-sibling Fredo, Robert Duvall as mob attorney Tom Hagen, Richard Castellano as Clemenza, Abe Vigoda as Tessio and Diane Keaton as Kay Adams are what I may have expected what the characters from Puzo's book look like physically. Even the smaller roles deserve special credit. The performances were absolutely amazing. The characters in the film compliment the characters from the novel and it is mainly due to the physical structuring and the carefully planned interpretation.<br/><br/>The novel this movie was based on by Mario Puzo deserves praise in itself. Even though this movie was a fictional, there are a lot of authentic features that make every scene and every chapter to be real. I guess people when they think of mob bosses they visualize a supreme Don, sitting in his chair with a long facial expression contemplating with endless level-headedness and leadership. ""The Godfather"" is a marvel from both the film and the novel and it is hard to determine what medium is the better of the two.<br/><br/>If there is one thing that the book is better would be character development. Al Pacino's Michael Corleone is a more prominent character in the novel than in the movie. Michael's transformation in the movie is at times a bit rushed, while in the book it's handled more gradual. The other character Luca Brasi played by Lenny Montana was a more vital character in the novel, which while he was an ally to the Corleone clan, is marked as a threatening adversary with a dark and dreary secret. In the movie comes across as a big oaf, and not as scary. It's also nice that some of the smaller characters from the novel have engaging back stories like Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden). But that's good for the novel's sake, while the film would result in overdone detailing.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Godfather"" is one of the greatest films ever made. Thanks mainly to the crew for creating a well-structured setting that compliments nicely to the characters, the script and most importantly, the direction of Francis Ford Coppola.

","When I first saw The Godfather many years ago, I initially called the film ""a long, boring piece of crap."" Luckily as I have matured, so have my tastes in cinema. This film is heralded as an American classic, and now I can wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. As famed critic Roger Ebert pointed out, this movie is the one where most people can agree on its quality. <br/><br/>Ultimately, The Godfather is still a very long movie but I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing. The film is obviously about the mafia, but this is a different kind of mafia film. Prior mafia films and even those after this one deals with perspectives from an outsider and their perceptions of violence and death with the mafia. However, this film is told within the confinements of a mafia family. The story is told within the inside and that was a unique story angle at that time. I like how the film doesn't show corruption from the mafia family, the Corleones. There are no civilian casualties from organized crime and the only corrupt person in the film is in the form of a police officer. Don Corleone doesn't believe in dealing with drugs, because of how they affect people. The themes of the Corleone family and the movie itself is family and loyalty. As Michael Corleone points out in the movie, ""never take sides against the family."" That is when crazy things begin to happen.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie is very crucial. It is basically a large wedding scene with scenes intercut of Don Corleone in his darkened office taking care of family business. This beginning is important for several reasons. We get the tone of the film and we understand who the Corleone family is. This is also where all the characters are introduced and explained. By the time the scene is over, we get the big picture of the film and we get a sense where the film is heading. The scene is a bit long, but I felt director Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job on introducing all of his main characters in the film<br/><br/>This is a film about family and it takes advantage of the classic structure of handing power between generations. The patriarch of the family is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the head of one of the most powerful mafia families. His children, who play a huge factor in the family, are Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Connie (Talia Shire), and Fredo (John Cazale). Also playing a huge role is the family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The aging Vito decides to transfer power to one of his subalterns, and that causes a ripple between the five Mafia families in New York. The main child here is Michael, who didn't want anything to do with his family and instead join the military. But after Vito is shot, Mike decides to join the family business and take control.<br/><br/>The acting is absolutely fantastic. Marlon Brando delivered one of the best performances of his career as the aging head of the family. He is known for using his devices in the beginning such as his puffy cheeks and the cat on his lap. The way he delivered his dialogue in such a soft-spoken voice is also very memorable. Al Pacino does a very good job, taking wise advice from his father while delivering on his own counsel. This is the beginning for Pacino's illustrious career. Robert Duvall does a fantastic job as Hagen. Duvall has had a legendary career, but the one role I think of every time I reflect on his career is his role as Tom Hagen. James Caan does a great job as the quick-tempered Sonny.<br/><br/>The one thing that does irk me about the film is the use of women. It seems like women has no part of the family. Mike's sister, Connie (played solidly by Talia Shire) is only used for a target of her husband's Carlo anger. He treats her like a piece of filth. Although, Mike does have a special place in his heart for Connie. Mike also has a romantic interest in the film named Kay Adams (played by the eccentric Diane Keaton). I didn't think Kay was a strong character in the film. Also, Vito has a wife but she is just an insignificant shadow only meant for the family pictures. Finally, there is a Sicilian woman we meet. After Michael goes on exile in Sicily for shooting a cop who played a role in the shooting of his father, he falls in love with this girl..but she ends up getting blown up. My only qualm abut the film is how little importance women play in it.<br/><br/>Also playing a huge role in the film is the music. Coppola traveled to Italy to find a composer who can bring an Italian feeling to the film. His find, Nino Rota did just that. The main title is heavily influenced by Italian culture and it gave an authentic feeling to the film-as the main characters are an Italian family. It's a shame that the Academy snubbed his music, because I felt it should have won an Oscar. It's one of my favorite all-time scores.<br/><br/>Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 3 of them including Best Picture, The Godfather is one of America's most influential films. The movie remains popular to this day and if you haven't seen the film, you should see it. It's almost three hours long, but this is a portrait of a mafia family that is all about family. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job directing this film from the very popular novel written by Mario Puzo. The Godfather is an instant American classic.<br/><br/>My Grade: A-"

","Michael Corleone returns home from the war for his sister's wedding. However his return coincides with the beginnings of a war between the main families sparked by the marketing of drugs.  Michael's involvement in the family business increases when his father is the victim of an assassination attempt and Michael wants to kill the two men responsible before going to Italy for a year to lay low.  When Michael's brother Sonny is murdered, Michael returns home to take control of the family and clear up the war.<br/><br/>The most famous and the best film about organised crime is also one of the best films ever made.  The plot is at once straightforward and complex, it deals with things on many levels from the action to the theme of family. The basic story is gripping and sprawling at the same time.  It creates many memorable scenes and lines that have become part of the general knowledge that we all share  that's why it's referred to in everything from Sopranos down to The Simpsons.<br/><br/>Every shot is perfectly framed and has a great sense of period throughout. From the opening speech with it's memorable lines and camera focus down to the final shot and all it implies, it is full throughout.  The action is a pleasure to watch and the lines are so much more classy than more recent attempts at gangster films.<br/><br/>Pacino is great  he not only changes before our eyes over the 3 hours but he manages it into the next film too.  Brando is always a risk on any film, and when he started mumbling and filling his cheeks with cotton wool, Coppola must have worried about what was happening, but he delivers a performance that is so good that almost everyone has impersonated him at some time.  The main cast is full of good performances from actors from all stages.  Up and comers such as Duvall, Caan, Keaton etc are as good as more ageing icons such as Richard Conte, Sterling Haydn, Castellano etc.<br/><br/>In every area the film oozes class and professionalism.  The look at family life is excellent and the only downside is that it can't help but glamorise organised crime  people may be killed but it still looks and sounds cool. But then, if we're going to start criticising films because they glamorise violence or destruction then The Godfather comes along way down the hit list  long after countless hundreds of action movies and summer blockbusters.<br/><br/>Overall this film will always be a classic, your Harry Potters, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings etc will come and go based on how well hyped they are  but Godfather has been on most people's top 5 list for decades and will to continue to be for many more.  Now that's respect."

","An important place in American history is the period when several thousand Sicilian emigrants went to the United States in search of a new, better life, in which there would be no tyranny of the Palermo and Messinxich dons. Who knew at that time that this ""bunch of Sicilian emigrants"" would occupy a high place in the United States and in the history of this country.<br/><br/>Sicily is one of the most beautiful places in Italy. Unfortunately Sicilians, quite friendly inhabitants of this island, the words-synonyms of Sicily are not only olives, butter and wine, but also words like omerta, vendetta and mafia. Yes, the mafia. A small bunch of bandit mackerel in Sicily, run by the Don. In the US, this word took a slightly different meaning. A huge number of gangsters who seek to conquer and rule all the States. A family is a mafia, a mafia is a family headed by a cruel and wise person who manages everything and who owns everything. Proudly and shortly - don.<br/><br/>Mario Puzo is a brilliant writer, rightly considered to be a recognized classic of the twentieth-century literature, having written several excellent and worthy works, the best of which is undoubtedly the novel ""The Godfather"". A book about the life of gangsters and revealing all the doors to the world of the mafia. Mario Puzo was a great connoisseur of human psychology, but the psychology of people who transgressed the law especially. That is why in his novel he explores each character to the depths of his soul and climbs into the most intimate corners of their thoughts.<br/><br/>The novel, and indeed, the film - is not a direct and reliable historical source, but, nevertheless, it contains the quintessence of the criminal world. Five families of New York Piuso wrote from the real five families of New York, Johnny Fontaine Puzo wrote from Frank Sinatra. The literature was tired of books about Al Capone and Frank Costello, and Puzo made a move to a horse-invented a criminal family that was not really there, but which subsequently won, without exaggeration, the whole world.<br/><br/>It often happens that the director, when stating a picture, leaves the original and is engaged in arbitrariness. Francis Ford Coppola director is no less brilliant than the rest of the directors. He squeezed everything that can be learned from the novel Puzo and put it into the film. Doing nothing without adding something new or removing something from the book, Coppola and Puzo created a masterpiece. A masterpiece in everything. Mario Puzo's book became a masterpiece of literature, and Francis Ford Coppola created the film - a masterpiece, a film - a classic that just can not help but like it. Coppola not only superbly put the film, but simply brilliantly picked up the actors. Who knows what was the fate of the film without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Coppola skillfully created the atmosphere of New York at the end of the forties, but also the atmosphere of family life, the life of people from Sicily.<br/><br/>Vito Carleone is a wise and cruel man with clear principles, a loving but stern father. Marlon Brando was just awesome dona
Carleone. His character is a serious strategist who has achieved power and respect himself. Don Carleone's sad gaze, his smooth gestures, his unique voice and his unforgettable ""bulldog jaw"" forever blended into the image of the viewer.<br/><br/>Don Carleone - this is Marlon Brando - sloven and lover in life, but on the screen - a genius who embodied the image of Don Carleone - a strong spirit of a man and a cruel gangster, who has enormous authority. Vito Carleone is a very impressive person who knew how to get others to do things their own way. Marlon Brando with his game was able to make the viewer believe that before him is not just an actor playing a role, but a real person is that same severe don. Brando is a great improvisator.<br/><br/>Michael Carleone character is no less interesting than his father. Michael is kind-hearted and truthful, knowing what his father does, he never wanted to deal with his family and participate in criminal quarrels. Al Pacino played his character no less brilliant than Marlon Brando. Pacino showed all the destruction of the human psyche and the transformation of his hero: from the uninitiated in the affairs of the family of the young war hero, to the new Don Carleone, possessing an iron will, foresight, wisdom and dignity.
Sonny Carleone is not at all like Michael and Vito. He is an impulsive warrior, but a bad strategist who prefers to go ahead, not act cunning. Coppola did not lose on the fact that he called for the role of an American from Sicily. James Caan brilliantly played the role of Sonny - a man with an explosive Italian temperament, ready to always stand up for the family.<br/><br/>In addition to the brilliant acting and excellent production in the film, there is the wonderful music of the composer Nina Rota. An excellent melody, fallen in love with everyone and has long become a classic.<br/><br/>""Godfather"" is a masterpiece, an ideal gangster movie. The film without minuses, blunders and cliches, which pulls to review, even if you know it by heart. This is a classic, a gangster epic, a bible for cinephiles, giving answers to all the questions. A movie that teems with crown phrases that have long since become part of everyday life. A worthy picture, without exaggeration, is the best in its kind.<br/><br/>""Behind every wealth lies a crime"" (c) - it is this phrase Honore De Balzac stands at the beginning of the work of Puzo. The film, if briefly, actually about it. And about the proposal, ""from which you can not refuse"" (c)."

","This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD."

","There is always a risk when a film becomes a huge part of popular culture. So many of it's iconic moments and scenes are ripped off, riffed on, or parodied by countless shows and movies, that there is always a fear that the original will lose some of it's impact, and become comical and stale. <br/><br/>The Godfather, however, disproves this. It is still a masterpiece, and always will be. The story-line proves once again how much the innocent public loves to view the lives of outright evil men, especially when they happen to be of the charming and charismatic variety. Let's look at the most iconic scene; a man chops off a horse's head, and leaves it in his owner's bed in order to scare him into submission. Oh yeah, he's one of the good guys though, so it's okay!<br/><br/>Everything is explored in the Godfather, either directly or subtly; family politics, gangland negotiation, corrupt officials, there is no part of the mafia experience that is not pictured here, taken from the viewpoint of Michael, a character whose transition from unwilling family outsider and war-hero into the don himself really gives the film a unique perspective. <br/><br/>Of course, for me, out of all the fantastic characters, the film is carried by Marlon Brando. There is something magnetic about his performance, a mixture of loving family man, ruthless career criminal, and sophisticated Sicilian gentleman, that is thrilling to watch. One of the all time greatest acting performances."

This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream.

","Some people have called this one of the best movies of all time. I can see why they say that, although I wouldn't quite rate it that high. It does feature an interesting storyline, great acting and magnificent photography so I am not going to argue with those who place in so high, because it's understandable. It also has a memorable score.<br/><br/>One needs to see this on a nice widescreen DVD because it's so beautifully photographed with tons of greens, grays and browns that are just beautiful. It makes me want to visit Italy. The only reason I personally didn't rate it as high as others was I didn't like any of the characters, and especially the hot-headed James Caan. When he got riddled with bullets and was done with, a la ""Bonnie & Clyde,"" that was fine with me!<br/><br/>There isn't as much violence as people might think, if they've never seen this movie. To some, this film might be too slow, in fact. However, when the violence or something dramatic occurs it is intense and can be very brutal. Who can ever forget a guy waking up with a dead, bloody horse in his bed?!! <br/><br/>Like a good film noir, there is a lot of tension running throughout the Godfather films. Everybody is after somebody it seems and you never know whom to trust. That's part of the downsides of living a criminal life: constant paranoia. All this is put together nicely as we become close observers of the Corleone family, its family ties and its ""business.""<br/><br/>Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Caan, Robert DeNiro (later in the saga), Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, John Cazale, Richard Castellano, on and on - quite a cast and quite a movie. I enjoyed both sequels, too.<br/><br/>I am also fortunate to own ""The Godfather Epic"" on tape, which must be some sort of collector's item by now. It is three two-hour tapes in which Godfather I and II are sliced together and the story is presented in chronological order, instead of with all the flashbacks. It's well-done and I would have printed a review on that version, but I don't see it listed on IMDb."
"ironhorse_iv","10","11","15","8 September 2015"," The Godfather make me an offer that I cannot refuse. This movie is a masterpiece.
","It's basically impossible to watch this movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola, without already knowing some of the major themes, motifs, plot twists, within author Mario Puzo's story; due to how popular the film is. Even, if you haven't saw the movie, you probably heard of it. If you had, saw it. You might agree with me, in scope, that this movie is indeed, one of the greatest films ever made. Based off, Mario Puzo's 1969 novel with the same name, The Godfather tells the story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) on his journey, from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss, during the criminal drug wars of the 1940/early 1950s. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found that a lot of critics, overpraise Marlon Brando's work in this, a way too much. Don't get me wrong, Marlon Brando does deserve, a lot of credit for making his character, the patriarch Vito Corleone, so iconic. I just don't believe, that he deserve, the Oscar for Best Actor, that year. In my opinion, Al Pacino should had be nominated & won. After all, Michael is pretty much, the main character, not Vito. Also, Pacino is the one actor that kept the movie, going, with his great range of emotional. Brando show-what disappears, toward the middle of the film. If any, Brando deserve to win, Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards, because Brando's acting is secondary to that of Pacino. It's not personality, it's only business. Besides that, the acting throughout the film was well-performed, from all the actors. I just wish, there wasn't much, many characters. It was so hard to keep track of each one. Some actors, worth noting for their performance are James Caan as Michael's hot-headed brother, Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Irish lawyer, Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Michael's girlfriend, Kay Adams & last, John Cazale as Michael's weaker brother, Fredo Corleone. As much, as I despise, certain gangster films. There was something, likable with these characters. Yes, they do, horrible stuff, but you can't help, feeling bad for them. Indeed, keep your friends close, your enemies closer. Not only was the film had gifted actors, but it was very well-shot. I love, how the film used doors, as a way to symbolize, the different between family life, and 'the family life'. A great example of this, was the last few minutes of the film in which Kay finds out, the truth nature about Michael. It's a crucial theme of the film. The five families are essentially living the American dream with specific ideals that America at the time greatly treasured. One could easily see this as a deconstruction or even an attack on the idea of the American Dream. So it was no surprise that the families met inside a Federal Reserve Bank. Talk about smart! I also like, how the movie has this stark bleak look to it. All the colors in the film, looks so muted, as if to say, this gangster film was indeed shot in early 1940s, technicolor. I like how, clever, the filmmaker was, when using bright colors. Most of the only bright color, used in the film, was orange. It was used as mostly an item, like a fruit symbol. It representing sin, and greed. It's as if it was the forbidden fruit, in the bible. It was also, used as a sexual way to show impending judgment. Everybody that got near it, end up, dying in the film. While, the movie has tons of other symbolism. It's also shroud in darkness and mystery. The movie even has a few film noir inspire scenes, where shadow, become a big factor to show, how shady, the underworld, can be. Vito's daughter's wedding scene shows the best of this. The movie has a lot of violence as well. Scenes like the real horse severed head were pretty gruesome. Still, compare to modern day, gangster movies, the sex, drugs and violence is pretty tame. For the most part, the movie kept to a somewhat classy mode with its subject matter. I do like the editing. The whole baptize sequence was amazing to watch. The pacing for the film is a mixed bag for me. There were some parts of the film that I kinda found boring or out of place, such as the Sicily, Las Vegas & Hollywood scenes. It felt like, I was watching two different films, due to how unfamiliar, each of those scenes, were, when comparing to the New York settling. I just glad, they were very short. The film also drops a lot of the novel's subplots, such as Sonny's mistress, having a large vagina, and having to get surgery on it. Another thing worth cutting is a lot of Johnny Fontane (Al Martino) and Lucy Mancini (Jeannie Linero) scenes. In the novel they both get big story lines nearly the equal of the main storyline with Michael. I'm glad, they cut it out, because it was too jarring. Though one major one, they cut out in this film: Don Vito's youth and rise to power came back, as part of the sequel, 1974's the Godfather: Part II. Happy, that they found, a way to add that, back in. Leave the Fontane BS. Take the cannoli, instead. The film score by Nino Rota was great. You really think of the word 'mafia' when you hear that tune. While, the film doesn't deliberately speak that word, it did expose, what was then, a mostly hidden underworld of Mafia organizations. Overall: While, some big time criminals and even some stars, like Frank Sinatra were against it, and boycott the film, but they couldn't stop the movie, from being made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 40 years after its release. It's a classic."
"TheLittleSongbird","10","18","27","18 July 2010"," I'm finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was
","There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.<br/><br/>True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.<br/><br/>The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.<br/><br/>Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.<br/><br/>The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.<br/><br/>In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox"
"ericjg623","8","130","244","4 April 2002"," Slightly overrated
","One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.<br/><br/>
For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.<br/><br/>What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.<br/><br/>
What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.<br/><br/>And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).<br/><br/>So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred ""Goodfellas"". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively.

"hall895","9","5","6","16 June 2010"," What is there to say?
","Does it even need to be said that The Godfather is an amazing film? Is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful? Everybody knows. Everybody will always know. This is a film which will live forever. The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic.<br/><br/>There are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly. No matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact. Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.<br/><br/>Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway. And one cannot help but feel for Michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business.<br/><br/>Everyone has their favorite Godfather characters, favorite moments, favorite lines. The film has become a cultural touchstone. And as it continues to be discovered by new generations it seems that the film, if possible, actually continues to grow in stature. It is a classic film which stands the test of time. The Godfather has earned its place of honor in the history of film. A true masterpiece."

","First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.<br/><br/>I thought ""The Godfather"" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.<br/><br/>The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don.""<br/><br/>It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.<br/><br/>6/10"

","The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence. <br/><br/>The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.<br/><br/>The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.<br/><br/>http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"

","As an Films Studies student from London. Watching this film was one of the most exciting thrill that ever happened to me. The powerful use of script and the Cinematography used to shoot the scenes were perfect and powerful. The first sequence of the film grips the audiences attention that this is not about brutal murders or shooting people without reason but involves discipline and symbolises the role played by Vito Corleone as being like a senator or a president when people come to help. I have watched this film more than 20 times and still don't get bored of it. If you want to compare it with Citizen Cane or Scarface, you can't. Because its too artistic and a perfect film for a gangster/crime hybrid film. When Al Pacino's role changes the film creates more suspense and concern on how he would run the family, but everyone then believes in him and he then becomes the next Godfather.<br/><br/>This film is one of the best film ever to be made. Perfect in the way it starts and subsequently the ending as well, if you haven't watch this film didn't understand the concept of it, then don't bother watching films. This is the best film ever to be made...10/10"

"jennakristiina","10","10","15","6 April 2016"," Let me begin with just one word.. Masterpiece.
","The Godfather is not just a crime film, it's much more deeper than that. It's about loyalty, respect and more than anything, it's about family and real life. The casting in this movie is flawless. Marlon Brando as the Godfather is a perfect casting choice. He brings his unique style to his character and makes him alive. He's not just acting his role, he's living it, at least that's what it feels like. He truly deserves his Best Actor Oscar. Every scene where he is in and every line he says is emotionally touching and breathtaking, and it's not just because of his acting, but it's also because of the film's magnificent writing and directing. The storyline is outstanding. It's based on a novel written by Mario Puzo. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job with bringing his story to the screen. He really gave us the best film of all time. Brando wasn't the only one who did a wonderful job with his character, because even though Vito Corleone was the key element of the movie, the movie was still mostly about his son, Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino. You can really see his character develop during the movie, and you can feel the respect that his character has toward his father. There's a real connection between those two, even though they have a small number of scenes together. Besides Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, there were other supporting roles that were amazing as well, like James Caan as Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and of course the beautiful Diana Keaton as Kay Adams. This movie has everything. Good acting, directing, writing, cinematography and of course memorable and recognizable music by Nino Rota. In my opinion, there is only one misstep in this film, and that is the lighting in the wedding scene in the beginning of the movie. I can honestly say that this is my favorite movie and if you haven't seen it yet, you should watch it as soon as possible! 10/10 Excellent!<br/><br/>(These are just my quick thoughts about this movie)"
"GeorgeRoots","10","10","15","30 August 2014"," The Greatest Cast For A Movie Ever.
","Regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. ""The Godfather"" is a beloved classic about organised crime, and the Sicilian lifestyles in America. Of course the movie is about the building of a dynasty, a business built on death, murder and betrayal that goes on to run itself on favours and illegal pleasures. However, in this story we see the life of Don Vito Corleone (Played to a tee by the magnificent Marlon Brando), giving favours on his daughter's Wedding day. Here we see a loving, caring man who is both equally loved and feared. So far in the movie, it has had fair tension and introduced us to the family. Then all of a sudden a film-maker awakens to find his prized race horse's head under his bed sheets, and suddenly the tensions of this movie rises considerably.<br/><br/>Without really explaining anything else (I mean I really shouldn't have to), our focus is on the youngest Corleone son Michael (Stunning work from Al Pacino). As a man of considerable morals and high grounds, how far will he be willing to go when push comes to shove? Lets just say ""Falls from grace"" is a perfect statement, befitting of this rich ""Sepia"" toned movie.<br/><br/>Something of a Masterpiece when the film came out back in 1972. ""The Godfather"", has only gotten better of age. There are so many iconic quotes and moments in the movie, and the cast is just seriously one of the best ever put to film. James Caan I hardly recognised, and Robert Duvall was just as brilliant as always. But obviously the biggest argument is, was this movie Brando's or Pachino's? Personally, I thought Brando was just incredible as always, and totally deserved the Oscar he turned down. Both nevertheless are unforgettable on screen.<br/><br/>The pacing was impeccable, as well as the locations that are all shot beautifully. Some part of me does feel that the film is a bit too long, however a lot does happen and instantly captivates you enough to check out the sequels. The music was fantastic, helping bring the era and authenticity out of the picture and into the deepest parts of my brain. I could listen to the ""Love theme"" all day. As said earlier, the movie is about the dynasty of the family, the business of the family and the vengeance of the family. So many themes are present and so much more are explored. Every gangster film ever made owes something to Francis Ford Coppola's efforts.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Probably the first modern gangster epic ever made. As director Stanley Kubrick said: ""Probably the finest cast ever assembled"". 10/10."
"shaun_sat","10","6","8","29 March 2015"," A tour de force of cinema
","Since I was a small boy, whenever I heard of others talking of the greatest movies ever made, The Godfather always came up,most of the time, at the top. I always thought that the movie was overrated, that is, until watched it two years ago.<br/><br/>How to tell if a movie is good? If you can't stop thinking about it, if you keep replaying the characters' lines in your sleep, then the movie isn't just good, it's great. The Godfather's impact on the movie industry is incalculable, in almost ever modern gangster movie there is at least one reference to it.<br/><br/>I can find no flaw in this movie. If there were anything such as a 'perfect' movie, this is it. Coppola provides excellent direction such that though the movie stretches to almost three hours, you won't be bored for one minute. <br/><br/>The highlight of this film is an innovation. The gangsters here are not portrayed as mindless monsters but as men with families. We see Vito and Michael Corleone as protagonists rather than antagonists. Credit for this goes to Mario Puzo's original source material but let us not forget the actors.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando gives the greatest performance of not only his career but of any other actor as the family patriarch. He's so Don-like that you just wished you could go to him with all your problems too. Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone. But he doesn't give a single performance, he gives two. At the beginning, he plays a war hero who doesn't want anything to do with the family business. Pacino skillfully shows us Michael's transition from this to a cold blooded Don at the end. The other actors play their parts well too. In fact, there has never been any other better cast than the cast of The Godfather.<br/><br/>A cinematic masterpiece, this is one for the ages."
"tsakiridis1217","10","6","8","18 March 2015"," A Must-See For All Generations
","""The Godfather"" has been a title so beloved and entirely embraced as a significant, cultural phenomenon, that in a certain level demands of you to watch it with full recommendations off of it. Especially if you're young, there is absolutely no way that the buzz of the ""greatest movie in history"" did not get you. So, even though that buzz doesn't necessarily ruin the viewing for you all-together, I will accept that while I was watching, I was unintentionally trying to like it and feel it.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film sets the mood perfectly. There are no attachments to settled humor or dry dialogue. It warns us that this is going to be a serious take, on some pretty serious issues. Don Corleone's first lines are self-aware and carefully put. This dominating appearance shows us a man trusted, beloved and respected and at the same time feared, depressed and deserted. And that goes for both his family and outsiders. He is a mafia man, one of the greatest, and his life is surrounded by his business partners, by his associates and comrades in this dark lifestyle. And throughout the entire movie, he is presented to have balanced the time between family and business, yet that seems like one impossible task. <br/><br/>Micheal Corleone, son of the Godfather, is introduced like a man with a very different approach and very different opinions on the case of life and choices than the rest of his family and especially his father. That happens for two reasons: early on his life he decided not to be like him (even though he seems to be the one attached by the Godfather as the favorite) and he has chosen a decent life for him and Kay, the love of his life. <br/><br/>Then, everything goes down the drain: someone attempts to kill the Godfather. <br/><br/>It is at that point when the son Micheal starts his decay... No promises, no commitments, no wrongs... Someone tried to kill his loving father. He stares at every single person in his family just standing by, so in his rage, decides to do the unthinkable. Using his status as the most innocent of the Corleone family, he exacts revenge.<br/><br/>When he succeeds, he exiles himself out of the country until things can settle down. He attempts to start a new life away from the madness with Apollonia, a beautiful woman he meets and falls in love with (although never convincing even himself that he has forgotten Kay). He comes to know the hard way that he can't run away from what he has done and what his family stands for. Someone tries to kill him even so far from his home but gets to Apollonia. So upon his return, he accepts the position of the new ""Godfather"" and immediately seems to be a changed man.<br/><br/>Micheal retrieves Kay, makes unconditional promises and ends up being the very person he was trying to avoid.<br/><br/>There are several things in this film that make it astounding. Relationships within the family are displayed in such a truthful way. Francis Ford Coppola offers us a chance to connect with many different characters and their several views. The main plot is driven excellently, with Don Corleone and Micheal taking the grandeur, but in the meanwhile we get to know the deep motions and powers of every person slightly connected to this world. What we get is a fiery and passionate film exploring deep meanings and strong notions. <br/><br/>Marlon Brando won the Academy Award for what was an unbelievably great performance. After this film, I totally get his worldwide fame as one of the greatest actors of all time. Al Pacino shines with charisma (which he perfected on the second part) in the greatest role of his career. And besides these two super-actors, is there anyone from the cast that I can talk badly for? All great.<br/><br/>I guess the only issue with this movie is it's running-time and most importantly the somewhat complicated way things glue together. I understand that Mario Puzo had a difficult task of bringing the book on- screen, but it's the way we are drawn to these characters that makes me confused about who is who. And that is the reason I suggest we stick to the father-son relationship and not worry about certain aspects and scenes we don't understand or just keep asking ""who is that guy talking""?<br/><br/>This is the ""Godfather"" that everyone is talking about for decades, and if you don't like what you hear in the very first scene in that dark room, I warn you... turn of the picture and don't watch anymore. Come back a few years later when you could probably handle it.<br/><br/>On the other hand, you must ask yourself: can you feel the zest for respect and loyalty when Don Corleone whispers his lines? Don't you yearn for the moral and innocent Micheal as the movie goes? Can you sympathize with Kay when the door closes at the end? Then ""The Godfather"" got you where it should have."
"Wiizardii321","10","6","8","15 March 2015"," The best movie by far.
","So at first I always heard from a lot of people when I was younger that Godfather was the most epic movie of all time, I always memorized Vito Corleone's face when I was a kid... Years later I decided it's time I watch this movie and I did it on Netflix. Oh, and when I did, it was so good...<br/><br/>The sharp chemistry is what makes up most of the stuff, these actors always just transcend and transcend so much. Vito Corleone is one of the best movie characters ever. And the performances? These actors gave one of the best performances of all time. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is arguably his best performance ever. I can't say enough of Marlon Brando. Do I need to state the obvious? He is the best for a reason. I would go on forever on Godfather and why it is my favourite movie of all time, but that would be more than 1,000 words. If you haven't watched this, give it a try and see to yourself - a masterpiece.<br/><br/>What ALSO makes the godfather so special is it's line of who is a hero and a villain, can one really call a calm guy like Vito Corleone a bad guy? Technically he should be because, well because.. He is, a good... bla bla bla, it all just goes into your mind and it challenges you. I always saw Vito as a hero, but as Godfather grew more on me, I thought he was more like an Anti-hero. As for Michael, he will always be an anti hero in my opinion. Godfather gives out the most blend and epic characters in fiction history ever, let alone movies."

I'm convinced that I will never ever get to watch a similar movie to this one with this brilliance in every aspect, I don't even believe that if there would be anyone on this earth who has never saw the Godfather Trilogy, it is absolutely highly recommended, but of course its not suitable for the little kids, it has lots of violent scenes, hopefully we'll get to see more and more of these awesome titles."
"sme_no_densetsu","9","6","8","5 October 2010"," Allow ""The Godfather"" to make you an offer you can't refuse
","""The Godfather"" has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. Is that a fair assessment? After re-watching the film recently, I'd say yes.<br/><br/>The 'godfather' of the title is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging head of the Corleone crime family. His time is coming to an end and some of his rivals would like to precipitate that end. When an attempt is made on the Don's life his sons follow in their father's footsteps as they seek to silence their enemies and protect the family interests.<br/><br/>The Oscar-winning script was co-written by director Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, the author of the original novel. While trimmed significantly from the novel the film still clocks in at two hours and forty-five minutes. The film progresses at a stately pace and features countless classic scenes.<br/><br/>Coppola's direction received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and so did Nino Rota's score (at least until it was deemed ineligible). Gordon Willis' cinematography is good (but not great) and the film's evocation of the 40's & 50's is both attractive and authentic.<br/><br/>As for the actors, Marlon Brando was rewarded with his second Best Actor Oscar for his iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone. Al Pacino was nearly as good in his role as Vito's youngest son but he had to settle for a nomination in the supporting category. He had good company, though, since James Caan and Robert Duvall were also nominated. Any one of these three performances would have been Oscar-worthy. There were also several memorable performances in smaller roles from the likes of John Cazale, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden and others.<br/><br/>Is ""The Godfather"" the best American film of all time? Personally, I don't think so but I wouldn't rank it too far from the top. In any case, this is one of those films that every movie lover should see."

This movie however is hands-down my favorite of the series. The story was amazing, and sure made Mafia life look like paradise. I loved the characters, all of them, even the antagonists were unforgettable. Everything looked authentic 1940's style, there weren't any slip-ups as far as I can tell. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale all make a very authentic looking, and truly remarkable family. I was a huge Godfather encyclopedia for a while, I knew 95% of the characters and everything, and its easy to see why, this is a very memorable movie in every aspect. I loved this film at first sight. I read some of the ""Hated it"" comments, and they all say its boring or something. Those people need to grow up, if you want an action movie watch Die Hard or something, this movie is a classic and if those people lack the taste for good movies to watch it they need to take their hate of it elsewhere. This is a perfect movie and deserves a 10/10. Watch this if you want a truly unforgettable experience."
"EThompsonUMD","10","15","25","26 September 2008"," Sets the standard for the gangster art film.
","The Godfather (1972) did for gangster movies what 2001: A Space Odyssey did for science fiction. Like Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola re-energized and, to a degree, reinvented a basic Hollywood pulp fiction action-entertainment genre, using it as a vehicle for the high artistic ambitions of a post-New Wave film ""auteur."" <br/><br/>Within his narrower focus on 20th century American civilization (as opposed to Kubrick's philosophical speculations on human evolution), Coppola shapes the story of the Corleone Mafia family into an epic/satiric vision of American business, government, justice, and moral decline. The Godfather's brilliantly constructed opening sequence, the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter, not only establishes the Don's character, the nature of his organization, the role of family and Sicilian tradition in his world, and the character of his sons (three natural and one adopted), but also establishes the relationship between the Don's world and ""legitimate"" society. For instance, the film's opening words are those of Bonasera, a petitioner for a wedding ""favor,"" whose voice over a dark screen first asserts the American Dream, ""I believe in America. America has made my fortune,"" and then turns to disillusioned contradiction: ""for justice, we must go to Don Corleone.""<br/><br/>Numerous subsequent lines of dialog establish literal or metaphorical connections between the criminal underworld and social institutions. Some of the most memorable ones include: ""My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator.""""Now we have the unions, we have the gambling; and they're the best things to have. But narcotics is a thing of the future. And if we don't get a piece of that action, we risk everything we have. I mean not now, but ten years from now."" ""It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business."" And most famously of all: ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" <br/><br/>The film's title refers to two godfathers, the original Don Corleone and his youngest son - and ultimate successor - Michael. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Corleone, for which he was awarded a Best Actor Academy Award, balances the Don's subtly counter-pointed functions as beloved, grandfatherly patriarch and fearsome, brutal crime boss. Yet Michael, as the character most centrally and significantly affected by the film's plot and played with a brilliance equaling Brando's by a then unknown Al Pacino, is the principal protagonist.<br/><br/>At the wedding, Michael's centrality is signaled by the Don's frantic call, ""Where's Michael? We are not taking the picture without Michael!"" A World War II hero still in decorated uniform, Michael is meanwhile busy differentiating himself from his family to his girl friend and future second wife, Kay (Diane Keaton). ""Luca Brasi held a gun to the band leader's head,"" he relates, ""and my father assured him that either his signature or his brains would be on the release. That's my family Kay. It's not me."" Michael's initial disinterest in Mafia activities is reinforced by his adoring father who envisions him as ""Senator Corleone"" or ""Governor Corleone"" not as his successor. That role is reserved for his hot-headed eldest son, Sonny (James Caan). But, of course, events conspire to suck Michael in - and to keep sucking him in right through Godfather III - the assassination attempt on his father, Michael's coolly murderous response, the car bomb meant for him that kills his first wife, the Sicilian beauty Apollonia (aptly named for the god of sun light), the riddled body of his brother Sonny. Inevitably, a morally darkened Michael emerges at the end of the film, one who outdoes his father in guile and ruthlessness and whose final brutal and deceitful acts in Godfather I seal his doom as a Macbeth-like villainous tragic hero.<br/><br/>Shot mainly on location in various New York City locales, The Godfather spans a ten-year post World War II period. A multitude of props, costumes, and pop culture artifacts arranged by the film's art director, Warren Clyner, and production designer, Dean Tavoularis, lend a rich sense of historical authenticity to the film's mise en scene. Moreover, the film's lighting by brilliant cinematographer Gordon (""prince of darkness"") Willis, contributes greatly to both the film's realism and its thematic symbolism. Compare, for instance, the use of extremely dark, shadowy, color desaturated interior scenes  especially in the Don's home office  with the brightly lit, vivaciously colored outdoor wedding scene or the sun-drenched, romanticized Sicilian landscape.<br/><br/>The Godfather is edited in the classic Hollywood invisible style, subordinating technique to the needs of narrative and visual continuity. But the film is expertly edited nonetheless. In particular one might note the stunning use of multiple parallel editing that occurs in one of the film's last scenes: the assassination of the other crime family heads, elaborately planned to coincide with Michael's participation in the baptism of sister Connie's child. Likewise, The Godfather's soundtrack is a memorable combination of diegetic period music (""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"") and a lush, operatic original score composed by one of the greatest film music composers, Nino Rota (a frequent Fellini collaborator as in 8 1/2).<br/><br/>With The Godfather and its even more ambitious sequel, Coppola pushed the classic gangster film in the direction of high art and released it once and for all from the moralistic grip of the Hays Code, which arose in the 1930s in large part as a response to the romanticizing of criminals found in such early examples of the gangster genre as Scarface, Little Cesar, and Public Enemy. Not only did the code regulate the degree and nature of sexual and violent imagery in all films, but it also specifically required that criminals be portrayed as morally repulsive social deviants and that plots involving them be resolved with the implicit or explicit lesson that ""crime did not pay."" Fortunately for American popular culture The Godfather radically rewrote the rulebook and paved the way for a generation's-worth of gangster masterpieces ranging from the Scarface remake to Pulp Fiction to The Sopranos."

Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews.

Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.<br/><br/>My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience."
"davidburrows89","7","77","162","23 September 2013"," Very Average Film. Very Overrated
","Marlon Brando's acting as the Godfather is sublime and this film is worth watching for that.<br/><br/>However I did find the film very long-winded and at times boring. I liked the slow progression of the storyline and understand why Francis Ford Coppola did the film in the way he did. It's just that I felt the film was lacking something. It could have done with a bit more excitement or suspense to make the film more gripping.<br/><br/>Lets just say I watched this film about a year ago and I still haven't seen The Godfather 2, and I am in no hurry to either.<br/><br/>7/10.

","Excellent film, from the opening to the end you sense a genuine touch into lives of the characters and the world created by the actors and Coppola.<br/><br/>Just the intro of the movie immediately reveals the world you've entered and in the next few scenes you familiarized with family which shows who they are at heart.<br/><br/>Personally, I love a movie that takes the time to deliver a well told story and The Godfather does just that - the scenes revealing the inner struggles of the characters, the conflict in matters regarding their world, and how each character deals with issues is well done.<br/><br/>When a movie makes all their scenes have significant impact so much so that you don't find yourself wanting to pick favorites, you know you're dealing with greatness.<br/><br/>From beginning to end I was immersed, and if you like well done movies I'm sure you'll experience the same."
"tedg","Null","17","30","19 February 2003"," Respect
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Building a life in film is not so much a matter of discovering the worthwhile films, but choosing which of those have the stuff worth building with. I have a clear understanding of what Scorsese is about, which I attribute to the Latin convention for storytelling. This convention is totally invested in characters, not situation or place or God help us, ideas. Scorsese's camera is attached to people, never place. His curiosity is always about people. This is a form of visual gossip that I eschew.<br/><br/>So it is with Coppola. But his two projects (the Godfather and Apocalypse journeys) have another merit in how they work with what came before. Apocalypse is far more interesting in this respect. But `Godfather' is very clever in how it places itself. Gangster pictures began as a matter of a pretend world, and became ever more so as the genre matured. Mobsters lived in a world not unlike that of the Roadrunner,  always at a distance from reality, often winking at the audience.<br/><br/>Coppola took his focus on the human to this genre. The film itself is no masterpiece without this placement, but is great with it. We inherit all the machinery and momentum of the genre to place behind the characters. Brando understood this, and alone is able to effect the transferral. Pacino would go on to sledgehammer his roles, but is appropriately subdued here.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching."

","I bought The Godfather: The Game and was sucked so deeply into it that I wanted to see the movies. My brother kept telling me about how the scenes in the movie played out and that alone was enough to make me buy the entire collection on DVD. I will never regret that decision so long as I live.<br/><br/>The Godfather plays out like a documentary with out the corny voice over. The actors in this movie do such a great job it feels as though you aren't watching a movie but are instead watching the individual lives play out. There isn't a plot that can be fingered out. If you had to it would be the war between all the families and the cause of it.<br/><br/>Don Vito Corleone is approached by a member of the Tattaglia family to form a deal between the two families in a new business venture: the selling of drugs. Don Corleone, a vigilant believer in the old ways, feels that getting into the business of drugs will draw too much heat. And because of this he refuses the offer that is placed before him.<br/><br/>This fuels a fire with the Tattaglia family and it has a domino effect that causes wars between all of the families. The movie revolves around this central premise and comes to a head with the ending of the war. The outcome and what ends the war is also unpredictable and full of strategic writing. And I feel that the ending will surprise any body who doesn't already know how it all does.<br/><br/>The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 is because although it is a very entertaining and among the best movies I've ever seen, I don't feel that it is THEE best. There are movies out there that will entertain all audiences and that are just as good. There are movies that I can watch with friends without them growing bored. It gets a 9 because, as much as I love this movie, I can admit that it will only entertain a certain kind of person. I know there are movies that don't have this restriction.<br/><br/>A definite must buy for collectors; Make sure you like dramatic movies and not action movies though."
"didi-5","8","14","24","23 February 2005"," Mario Puzo's soapy Mafia saga
","Think epic novel crossed with Mafia speak.<br/><br/>Imagine excellent cinematography and direction, a great musical theme, violence, tragedy, spectacle, and the family, and a cast which can't be faulted, and here you have a film which fits the bill on all counts.<br/><br/>Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in one of his greatest roles, one which he supposedly didn't initially want to play) is the powerful Mafia Don we meet early in the film. He has three sons (Sonny - James Caan; Fredo - John Cazale; and Michael - Al Pacino) and a daughter (Talia Shire), and an adopted son (Tom Hagen - Robert Duvall). These are his beloved family and the centre of his world. His day job involves building his empire by making 'offers you can't refuse'.<br/><br/>'The Godfather' was the first film in a trilogy following the fortunes of the Corleone family, and I think the best. It has some well-presented set pieces (Connie's wedding; Sonny's murder; Michael's killing of family enemies in the restaurant; the horse's head in the bed; and Vito's death while playing with his grand-child) and is extremely well-written. The novel itself was more soapy, a work of pulp fiction - the film pulls it together and gives it a bit more class.<br/><br/>I particularly like the characterisations of Vito and his sons. Vito is assured in his role at the head of the premier Mafia family. Sonny is a vain libertine who is hot-headed. Fredo is a weak disappointment. Michael takes his place in the family when he has to (in fact throughout the three films he is shown to be far more ruthless than any of his relatives).<br/><br/>Is 'The Godfather' the greatest film ever made? No, but it is one of the best. Certainly in the top 10 films of the 1970s."

","I was present when the filming of the Horse's head scene was done. I was a Police Officer in 1970 for the Nassau County Police Department, New York. I believe in the mid part of 1971, I was assigned, along with about 10 other officers and a Sergeant, to be at the Guggenheim Estate, Sands Point, Nassau County, NY. This estate was County property. The filming of the Horse's head scene and the dining room scene where Robert Duvall requests John Marley to give a film/singing role to one of the Don's relatives. Marley declines Duvall as you see a horse prancing in the meadow outside. Duvall says he will tell the Don in NY. Marley shrugs off Duvall. I was within 50' of both scenes. Coppola actually used real heads of horses ( they were shipped in ice in huge crates, they mixed a blood concoction). Coppola actually was very picky about the head he wanted to use. When Marley opens the sheet and discovers the head, it looks like sunrise. It was actually raining outside, and yellow cellophane was put on the windows. With the proper lighting, it looks like the sun was coming up, yet it was raining outside. The scene of the horse prancing outside was done at another location. The Guggenheim family were very rich and had art collections, etc throughout the mansion. The police were there to safeguard any of these collections. My girlfriend (now wife of over 41 years) was away at college. Banks of phones were set up. I was on the phone talking for a long time each of the three or four days assigned there. I was young and did not realize the assignment that I was on would be so important in the movie world. There were plenty of staff, extras, etc there. We were there for over 10/12 hours per day. Meals were catered. I also was assigned on traffic sometime later near the toll booth scene, filmed out on the old Mitchel Field Air Base. If you look close, at the toll booth, yellow parking lines are on the ground. Lindbergh, a friend of Guggenheim, flew from nearby Roosevelt Field. Somewhere in my attic, is my police memo book with exact dates when assigned as a ""rookie"" to the making of ""The Godfather"". Well, I guess I said enough, contact me if you need any more information. BTW, I retired in 2003, 33 year career. I became a supervisor in 1987 and was assigned to several movie filming on the ""Gold Coast"" of Long Island. One was the new version of ""Sabrina"", starring Harrison Ford....PS I never saw Marlon Brando, I think other scenes were done in Staten Island, part of NYC....thanks..."
"mjneu59","10","9","14","22 November 2010"," a classic when first released; only improves with age
","The first words in Francis Coppola's organized crime saga (""I believe in America"") are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia Don Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant's passion invoke the spirit of his adapted homeland. It's an ironic gesture in a film which embraces the American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful celebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism, and continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for vengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed sheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic displays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a shading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of footsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and Mario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by itself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing patriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual violence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like reading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical novel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with changing times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly effective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two perhaps the last word in gangster film dramas."
"classicsoncall","10","10","16","28 November 2009"," ""For justice, we must go to Don Corleone"".
","Lately it seems, ""The Godfather"" has had a ubiquitous presence on the cable channels; not a week goes by where I don't see it listed playing at one time or another. For some reason I've never considered watching the film from start to finish since the first time I saw it during it's theatrical release back in 1972 - until today. There's a good reason why. I don't think there's ever been another movie to stay with me the way this one has over the past four decades. I remember virtually everything about it, even the minor scenes like the hit on driver Paulie and the 'sleeps with the fishes' calling card regarding Luca Brasi. Also the names - Clemenza, Barzini, Solozzo, Tartaglia; Moe Green too, even though he wasn't Italian. So effective was the magic of the film that I still have to check every now and then to see if Abe Vigoda (Tessio) is still alive (like I did today), only to find out that yes he is, still going strong at nearly ninety! <br/><br/>Quite simply, ""The Godfather"" is, with no pun intended, the godfather of all the great gangster films, dating all the way back to 1931's ""Little Caesar"" and ""Public Enemy"". For Marlon Brando, it was the quintessential performance of American cinema, so nuanced and mesmerizing that it's impossible to forget. The movie in fact was so powerful that it literally made overnight stars of it's supporting players - Pacino, Caan and Duvall.<br/><br/>There has been enough written about the film that I don't need to get into the story itself. I'll content myself with mentioning the scenes that literally blow me away, then and now - Sonny's job on Carlo in the middle of the neighborhood (that last kick is priceless), the mob hit on Sonny in the causeway, Michael's restaurant rubout of Solozzo and McCluskey, and the way Michael handled Tom Hagen's ouster as consigliere. The cherry topping of course is the baptismal scene, Michael renouncing Satan as he does the devil's work of eliminating the heads of the families who stood in opposition to the Corleones. Every scene of the movie is staged perfectly, yet rendered effortlessly as if it were just another day in the life.<br/><br/>It would have been too easy to use the classic tag line in my summary above, you know, the one about making an offer that can't be refused. With ""The Godfather"", it seems that every scene is larger than life, with the total picture being even greater than the sum of it's parts. So I'll content myself with a recommendation that seems apropos by quoting Clemenza after his man whacked Paulie - ""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli"". For cinema fans, ""The Godfather"" is all cannoli."
"jchandbab","9","53","112","28 October 2000"," A bit long, but at least there's quality as well as quantity
","Part of the reason that The Godfather has been so popular, is that on first viewing it really does seem to have something for everyone.  It's a thriller, it's a (fascinating) documentary on 'Mafia Code', and half way through, for 45 minutes, a tragic love story.<br/><br/>For starters, the acting is sensational.  There are very few people on Earth that cannot identify Marlon Brando's whispering, horse voice and bulldog expression. It has become what is probably the most famous performance in Hollywood's history.  The appearance of Al Pacino in the starring role is also a highlight.  The other highlights are of course the 'sound bytes'. For anyone who has not scene this masterpiece, I will not give the more famous quotes away- but they will be instantly recognisable when heard.<br/><br/>This movie is split into three parts- the crime of the family, and its consequences, the exile of Pacino, and the reunion of the family in which the characters carry out the parts of the plot which set us up for the sequel.<br/><br/>My only criticism of this film is how long winded it is.  Virtually three hours long, it is so meticulous that it becomes very hard to digest.  While the sequel is very deep and thoughtful, this tries to balance intellect and action- and although to a certain extent it succeeds, you wonder if this film would be a more enjoyable experience if there was less discussion and plot details, and a few more thrills."

"Rectangular_businessman","10","13","23","10 July 2010"," A flawless masterpiece
","So, those of you who haven't seen it may wonder, ""What's so good about the Godfather? Why is it that this, out of every movie ever made, is considered by so many people to be one of the if not the all-time best?"" Allow me to explain as best I can. It's the kind of movie where everything is perfect. Everything. The acting, the script, the pacing, the cinematography, right down to the soundtrack. All of it.<br/><br/>Oh, sure, it's a leisurely movie. It clocks in at just under three hours, and the plot takes a while to unfold. But it is NOT ""slow"" or ""boring."" While not a suspense film in the traditional sense, the movie is definitely suspenseful, and I have to applaud Coppola for his excellent use of tension building. In other words, he uses the three-hour length of the film perfectly: there's not a wasted minute among these 175, not a single bit I'd take out.<br/><br/>And besides, the acting is great. Just awesome. Brando's performance is stunning; the guy just oozes cool, as he always does. He's magnetic as Vito Corleone, arguably his most famous role ever. And, of course, Al Pacino's Michael Corleone deserves nothing but the highest of praise. It was the guy's big break, and he does a fantastic job displaying Michael's ruthless, cunning, coldly intelligent rise to power. The two of them pretty much make the movie, but even people playing bit parts give their all, resulting in a movie that makes mobsters seem very human. Special shout-out to Robert Duvall for his excellent turn as Tom ""Badass"" Hagen, and Diane Keaton (one of my favorite actresses, I'll add) as Michael's girlfriend and moral compass Kay. Having been mostly familiar with her for her roles in those classic Woody Allen movies, I had no idea she could carry a dramatic role, but she does an excellent job. And the script is just awesome, including a couple classic lines.<br/><br/>Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes."" And, of course, ""He made him an offer he couldn't refuse."" A whole ton of memorable ones. Actually, pretty much every line in this movie is quotable, and given its three-hour length, that's pretty impressive. And that theme song... oh man. One of the best ever written.<br/><br/>A note also must be made on the baptism scene. All aspiring filmmakers should watch this movie for a lot of reasons, but for that scene in particular. The building of tension, the symbolism, the sacred-profane juxtaposition, the heart-stopping climax... perfect. The scene encapsulates everything I love about the movie into just a few minutes.<br/><br/>And that's the Godfather for you. It's bleak, tender, touching, violent, thoughtful, occasionally horrifying (the famed horse head scene, anyone?), and sometimes even darkly funny. It's a complete masterpiece in every sense of the word. <br/><br/>This, and its sequel for that matter, is a movie for the ages. Basically, if it's directed by Francis Ford Coppola and it's got Robert Duvall in it, you're in for a fantastic movie. That's a good rule of thumb. And the book it's based on is just as good!"

","The few ""perfect"" films to ever been released are so perfect in every aspect that each scene almost feels like a masterpiece on its own. In the case of Coppola's revolutionary The Godfather, this statement holds especially true. Phenomenal and sheer brilliance in every aspect that cannot be matched by modern ""cinema"", Coppola's The Godfather is cinematic perfection in every aspect of filmmaking. From performances delivered by an astounding ensemble cast, to Nina Rota's breathtakingly soaring and epic musical score to Coppola's very direction, The Godfather should essentially be viewed as a three hour masterclass on filmmaking for any aspiring filmmakers. So perfect in every aspect and so free of flaws, no film since its time has matched even half the brilliance of The Godfather."

","The Godfather is an endless movie. No matter the age in which it has been discovered or the number of times you have seen it, this is a work that does not lose its ability to fascination and mystery. The problem is how to talk about it not limited to the amount of praise that his expertise justifies either the wonderful performance of Brando as Don Vito Corleone is evoked (note modulation of dialogues and play with the cat in the three interviews of the first sequence: all his character is defined), the tormented role Pacino as Michael Corleone (is a war hero who works they require to take their place in the crime family), the impulsive character of James Caan, with its counterpart in reflective Tom Hagen who plays Robert Duvall or accuracy of the smallest side, corresponding to names as Italian as Sollozzo and Tattaglia.<br/><br/>The ribbon structure wise, it does not feel his nearly three hours, is also exemplary. It could be considered that The Godfather is organized around collective sequences religious-family: marriage of Connie (the only sunny sequence of the film to the Sicilian intermediate achieved), the justly celebrated baptism-slaughter, disease and death (the Don Vito was playing with his grandson among the vines, is another anthology moment) and the rest comes down to await the arrival of the violence, unrelenting brutality from the shooting of Sonny at the foot of the house (a tribute Coppola to Arthur Penn's Bonnie & Clyde) to the ""premiere"" of Michael in the restaurant.

"Rickting","10","5","7","11 May 2014"," The godfather of American cinema
","The Godfather is regarded as one of the greatest films of them all and it's not difficult to see why. It is a bit cliché to like this movie, but it really does deserve it. Al Pacino plays the son of the head of a crime family who, following an assassination attempt on his father, rises up to become the head of the family, despite previously wanting nothing to do with his family's criminal activities. Aside from the slightly excessive length and the fact that the film made the memory of Al Pacino humiliating himself in Jack And Jill even more painful, The Godfather is one of the few films which could be seen as borderline perfect. Like many great movies, it requires patience. The film draws its audience in slowly as it gets better and more intense as it progresses and by the extremely sad ending there is a sense of awe and genuine astonishment at the quality and power of the movie. It beats Citizen Kane, the other general choice for the best movie ever made. One of the first things to set it apart is the amazing cast, although Marlon Brando is a bit difficult to understand.<br/><br/>The direction is excellent as well, as Francis Ford Coppola's filmmaking isn't showy and visually stunning like in Apocalypse Now, but it's more subtle and restrained and draws the viewer in. The dramatic moments are handled brilliantly, and having a great script to work with certainly doesn't hurt either. What makes the film a success isn't any of the above, but the storyline. The story is perfectly structured, and gets better and better as the film progresses. Not only does it have a multitude of brilliant movie moments, it also has many jaw dropping and startling outbreaks of violence, with the multiple assassinations/baptism finale being one of the best movie moments in the history of the medium. Michael Corleone's conversion into the head of his crime family is very sad, and the movie is overall proof that a family drama can still be thrilling, moving and have people queuing around the block. I don't usually agree with the best picture winners, but this is one which totally deserved to win. Like I said earlier, it's a cliché to love this movie but it really does deserve it.<br/><br/>10/10"
"slokes","10","5","7","20 March 2013"," An Offer You Don't Want To Refuse
","""The Godfather's"" greatness extends beyond my ability to sing its praises, so there's not much insight I can offer. Except this: If you haven't seen the movie, and think like I did that you'll be disappointed doing so, see it anyway.<br/><br/>I did. And I was disappointed, at least the first time I saw it. It was good, I thought, but not that good. Like this character gets killed off too quickly, or the movie spends too much time away from the main story following one character in Sicily, or that famous lilting melody I grew up with doesn't come up for over an hour. I thought it was good, but overrated.<br/><br/>But then I saw it again. Wow, what a difference. Three hours flew so quickly, and I found myself totally immersed in the many different stories going on simultaneously, as well as the way director Francis Ford Coppola weaves them so effectively. ""The Godfather"" has this ability to hit you a completely different way when you see it again, because there's so much depth to what you see on screen at any given moment. But at the same time, unlike a lot of ""deep-thought"" pictures, it's wonderfully accessible, at least to a multiple-time viewer like me.<br/><br/>The story at the heart of things is simple. A mafia family, the Corleones, are going through a rough patch. Don Vito (Marlon Brando) appears to be slipping as rival crime families vie to get into the narcotics market, which Don Vito has always eschewed. After one particularly rough gangster named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) makes a move on the Don, its up to Vito's previously clean son Michael (Al Pacino) to involve himself in family affairs and help Pop out.<br/><br/>That the Corleones are the underdogs in this movie is part of its brilliant perversity. The movie gets you rooting for them, to the point where your journey becomes similar to Michael's. The corruption he embraces in pursuit of his father's salvation becomes something you root for, until at the end, when it culminates in an orgy of violence, you might like me get as pumped about it as you would be watching your favorite sports team pull out a come-from-behind win.<br/><br/>Great dialogue, too, fantastically delivered. Everyone is so excellent in this movie, yet at the same time so understated. From the direction to the cinematography to the music, there's a quietness to the movie that's almost eerie, and does a lot to pull you in. Pacino, Brando, and Lettieri could all be big actors, but they all keep it contained here, especially Brando whose opening scene as the Don sets the bar very high. James Caan is the closest this movie has to an outsized performance, as Michael's hot-tempered older brother Sonny, but even he only boils up once in a while. The phrase ""It's not personal, it's business,"" comes up a few times in this movie, and the scary thing is it really is for them.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. And if you have already, and didn't think it was that great, see it again. You may wind up as amazed as me at what a difference a second viewing can make."

","What's to say about this movie that hasn't been said already. Pure cinema magic. The casting is superb, the character development is superb, the acting is first class, coupled with the legendary soundtrack a true masterpiece.<br/><br/>From the script to the whole dialogue and interactions between the characters the attention to detail is stunning and I wish more modern movie makers would take the time to build and develop the characters like this movie does.<br/><br/>From the opening scene, when Bonasera is looking for revenge for the beating of his daughter, to the closing scene when Kay sees Michael crowned as the Don and Neri closes the door, the movie just flows seamlessly from act to act. Coupled with the legendary soundtrack<br/><br/>The scene where Sonny, Michael, Tessio, Hagen and Clemenza are discussing hitting Solozzo is pure gold. As they all sit around nonchalantly discussing murder, before Michael pipes up and tells them how if they arrange a meeting he will kill them both is so just so well acted, that you actually believe these guys are gangsters.<br/><br/>A real example of great story telling transferred to film."

","New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business. <br/><br/>Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.<br/><br/>Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's. <br/><br/>Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather. <br/><br/>So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos. <br/><br/>An all-time classic."
"tedojanelize","10","6","9","17 December 2015"," the best movie I have ever seen
","The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.<br/><br/>The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow Min out of paper cartons.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.<br/><br/>Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.<br/><br/>But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whisper, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.<br/><br/>The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although ""The Godfather"" is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races).<br/><br/>The success of ""The Godfather"" as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garroting."

","The Godfather movie series is the best that I have ever seen. It's really joy and fun and exciting to watch the movie all over again. I really enjoy the first part the most, but I think the second part is very interesting and adds lots of elements to part one. I wish the Godfather was a whole new TV series, that dose extend beyond three parts. I enjoy the excellent acting, story, and drama. I can't say enough about the music. It's something that many people enjoy listening to on regular bases. Overall I would rank this movie top notch on my list. Highly recommended. have seen The Godfather movies too many times to count. It's part of the lexicon in my family, we quote lines from it all the time in regular conversation. So, I thought this book might be a little boring, just because I already knew the story so well. Not the case! The book adds so much detail to the story that I think I'll be watching the movie again soon in a whole new light. Joe Mantegna does such a wonderful job narrating this story and I'd absolutely recommend his version as opposed to the other full cast version that's out there, especially for people that are really in tune with the movie."
"jeancarloros","10","6","9","1 December 2015"," The Best
","The movie is phenomenal, is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 40 years after its release. <br/><br/>It takes its subjects seriously, bestowing legitimacy upon the internecine power struggles of the Mafia normally reserved for classical themes in high art. There is something deeply resonant in the film's treatment of filial piety, the need for respect, and our culture's abiding interest in the parallel moral universe of the Mafia. Just the best."
"HusseinAlor","10","6","9","26 November 2015"," Movie , which is unparalleled .
","Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If a film is about Jewish mobsters, it's a ""Jewish Godfather""; if it's about the Chinese underworld, it's an ""Oriental Godfather""; if it takes place in contemporary times, it's a ""modern day Godfather"".<br/><br/>If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.<br/><br/>Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it."

"ivo-cobra8","10","6","9","17 October 2015"," Francis Ford Coppola's Epic Classic Masterpice
","The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original ""Movie Brats"" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!! <br/><br/>The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures) <br/><br/>The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola's direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael's Sister and Vito's daughter.

"jeffreyfoster","10","6","9","4 September 2015"," One of the best films ever made!
","The first Godfather movie may be over 43 years old but still holds up well after all of these years. The film is at heart a story of family. It is the story of Vito Corleone and his three sons, Santino (Sonny), Frederico (Fredo), and Michael. It is also the story of Vito's other family, the mafia. The story focuses on Michael, the youngest son. At first, he wants nothing to do with the family business but as the film progresses, he is drawn more and more into it and by the end, he is running the family - both families. The transformation of Michael from family outcast to Godfather is fascinating to see. Al Pacino does a wonderful job of transforming from playful young man to fearsome gangster. Without going into too much detail so as not to ruin the movie for those few who have never seen it, several scenes stand out: The horses head is probably the most famous, or infamous, and has been used in homage and parody by many others in the years since the movie was released. When I rank the best movies I have seen, the original Godfather is always number one on my list."
"GusF","Null","6","9","23 May 2015"," An absolute masterpiece from beginning to end
","Today, I managed to fill one of the biggest gaps in my film knowledge by watching one of the most popularly and critically acclaimed films of all time. I had picked up some of it by osmosis through references and parodies in other works but most of it was completely new to me, I'm glad to say. The acting, writing and direction are all of an extraordinarily high standard. It is a wonderfully told epic tale of family, betrayal, vengeance and a twisted sense of honour. <br/><br/>As the title character Don Vito Corleone, Marlon Brando gives a fantastic performance which afforded him his second and final Best Actor Oscar, though he did not accept it. The Don is a fascinating character. He prides himself on being a man of honour who values loyalty above everything else and has a strict moral code, albeit an extremely warped one. The family business encompasses murder, gambling, bootlegging and widespread political and judicial corruption and yet he refuses to enter the narcotics trade as he thinks that it will be too messy and lose the family its support among the police and politicians. I generally prefer Brando when he enunciates more clearly as opposed to mumbling but he is very frightening as the soft spoken Don. Truly powerful people do not need to shout all of the time and the Don understands this. He seldom loses his temper, using violence as an instrument after a reasonable offer has been refused. He is an incredibly strong and compelling character and Brando's performance represents some of his best work. Francis Ford Coppola said that he wanted the best actor in the world to play Don Corleone, which meant either Brando or Laurence Olivier. Olivier is one of my absolute favourite actors but I can't imagine him as the Don.<br/><br/>In his first major film appearance, Al Pacino is excellent as the Don's youngest son Michael Corleone, another wonderfully compelling character. In his first scene, we are introduced to him as a US Army captain who has just returned from the recently ended World War II. He is the outsider as he is the only member of his family to have attended college and wants no part of the family business. He instead wants a normal life with his girlfriend Kay Adams and this is illustrated by the two of them going Christmas shopping and going to see ""The Bells of St. Mary's"" – in a funny coincidence, that was the first sequel nominated for Best Picture while ""The Godfather Part II"" was the second – in the cinema. However, everything changes after the assassination attempt on the Don and Michael's first involvement with the family business when he murders Sollozzo and McCluskey in the restaurant, one of the best scenes in the film. He spends several years in Sicily, marries a young woman named Apollonia and sees her killed in a car bomb which was meant for him as part of the ongoing war between the Five Families. This experience hardens him and he begins to lose touch with his humanity. He returns to New York City to find that his family is no longer feared as it once was, given that his father has grown weak. The Corleones relocate to Las Vegas and, under Michael's leadership, attempt to legitimise the business but this is mocked by the Nevada based gangster Moe Greene, a thinly veiled version of Bugsy Siegel. It could be argued that Michael does not truly become his own man until after his father's death when he not only establishes himself as the new Don but reestablishes the Corleones as the most feared and powerful crime family. Pacino was deservedly nominated for an Oscar but for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor, which justifiably annoyed him as he had more screen time than Brando.<br/><br/>James Caan is likewise excellent as the Don's hotheaded eldest son Sonny whose frequent outbursts provide a great contrast to the measured, reasonable approaches of both his father and Michael and whose very bloody murder provides another of the best scenes in the film. Robert Duvall is extremely good as Tom Hagen, the Don's unofficially adopted German- Irish-American son and the family's consigliere who is often the voice of reason. A very young Diane Keaton is impressive in the supporting role of the initially naive Kay, who undergoes a steep learning curve in the brilliant final scene when she realises that Michael was lying when he said that he did not have his brother-in-law Carlo killed. The film has a very strong cast overall: John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Abe Vigoda (along with Brando, one of the few non-Italian-Americans playing one in the film), Richard Conte (who was considered for Don Corleone), Richard S. Castellano, Al Lettieri, John Marley, Alex Rocco and Coppola's sister Talia Shire. Although Shire is a little over the top in the last scene, she is excellent in the extremely unpleasant scene in which Connie breaks down and Carlo beats her. <br/><br/>The film's cinematography is beautiful. I particularly loved the frequent use of shadow and darkness. The long takes, one of my favourite film techniques, are not of the same duration as in the films of Orson Welles or Kenneth Branagh but they are used very effectively. My absolute favourite scene in the film is the baptism of Connie's son Michael which is interspersed with a series of brutal murders. Not only is it shot in a fantastic way but it provides another great contrast as well as illustrating Michael's descent.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an absolutely brilliant film which lives up to the hype."

"valdebek21","10","6","9","12 April 2015"," Mind blowing drama, a must see
","Taking a best-selling novel of more drive than genius (Mario Puzo's The Godfather), about a subject of something less than common experience (the Mafia), involving an isolated portion of one very particular ethnic group (first-generation and second-generation Italian-Americans), Francis Ford Coppola has made one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment.<br/><br/>The Godfather, which opened at five theaters here yesterday, is a superb Hollywood movie that was photographed mostly in New York (with locations in Las Vegas, Sicily, and Hollywood). It's the gangster melodrama come of age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesn't (or, at least, shouldn't) pay.<br/><br/>It still doesn't, but the punishments suffered by the members of the Corleone Family aren't limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. They also include lifelong sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power, but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in.<br/><br/>Yet The Godfather is not quite that simple. It was Mr. Puzo's point, which has been made somehow more ambiguous and more interesting in the film, that the experience of the Corleone Family, as particular as it is, may be the mid-twentieth-century equivalent of the oil and lumber and railroad barons of nineteenth-century America. In the course of the ten years of intra-Mafia gang wars (1945-1955) dramatized by the film, the Corleones are, in fact, inching toward social and financial respectability.<br/><br/>For the Corleones, the land of opportunity is America the Ugly, in which almost everyone who is not Sicilian or, more narrowly, not a Corleone, is a potential enemy. Mr. Coppola captures this feeling of remoteness through the physical look of place and period, and through the narrative's point of view. The Godfather seems to take place entirely inside a huge, smoky, plastic dome, through which the Corleones see our real world only dimly.<br/><br/>Thus, at the crucial meeting of Mafia families, when the decision is made to take over the hard drug market, one old don argues in favor, saying he would keep the trade confined to blacks—""they are animals anyway.""<br/><br/>This is all the more terrifying because, within their isolation, there is such a sense of love and honor, no matter how bizarre.<br/><br/>The film is affecting for many reasons, including the return of Marlon Brando, who has been away only in spirit, as Don Vito Corleone, the magnificent, shrewd old Corleone patriarch. It's not a large role, but he is the key to the film, and to the contributions of all of the other performers, so many actors that it is impossible to give everyone his due.<br/><br/>Some, however, must be cited, especially Al Pacino, as the college- educated son who takes over the family business and becomes, in the process, an actor worthy to have Brando as his father; as well as James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, Al Martino, and Morgana King. Mr. Coppola has not denied the characters' Italian heritage (as can be gathered by a quick reading of the cast), and by emphasizing it, he has made a movie that transcends its immediate milieu and genre.<br/><br/>The Godfather plays havoc with the emotions as the sweet things of life—marriages, baptisms, family feasts—become an inextricable part of the background for explicitly depicted murders by shotgun, garrote, machine gun, and booby-trapped automobile. The film is about an empire run from a dark, suburban Tudor palace where people, in siege, eat out of cardboard containers while babies cry and get underfoot. It is also more than a little disturbing to realize that characters, who are so moving one minute, are likely, in the next scene, to be blowing out the brains of a competitor over a white tablecloth. It's nothing personal, just their way of doing business as usual."

The acting is top notch, the cinematography is beautiful, the filming locations and sets are perfect, the sound is great, the music is excellent... I could talk about how great this movie is for hours. Francis Ford Coppola has a clear vision for this movie, and is expertly brought to life.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film starts out at the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie. At the wedding reception we are introduced to the many of the members of the Corleone crime family, however not all of them are part of the ""family business"". At the wedding, Vito's youngest son, Michael, tells his then girlfriend, Kay, that he was not like his family. Throughout the rest of the film, we see Michael Corleone transform into the very thing he claims he hates. It's an excellent example of how character growth should be done.<br/><br/>From the intriguing beginning where we find Vito Corleone being asked for favors, to the climatic ending where Michael finishes his transformation, The Godfather is a landmark film in American cinema."
"RossRivero99","10","6","9","16 January 2015"," Arguably the greatest of all mob films
","Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972) is undoubtedly one of the best movies ever made because to me it was a pitch perfect mafia film that definitely compares to the greatness of Scorsese's GoodFellas (1990), and Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967) but so much better than those two great films put together. The best summary for this film would be about an aging mob boss named Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in an Oscar winning performance) who in a few years time is going to retire from his position as Godfather and pass the Corleone family leadership to his reluctant war hero son Michael (played by Al Pacino in a performance that should have won him the Oscar as 1972s best supporting actor). Besides GoodFellas and Bonnie and Clyde having the most obvious thing in common with this film is that all three films talk about the mob, and the second thing that all three films have in common is that they give people who watch them how ruthless the mob can be in real life. Though I didn't read the Mario Puzo novel I understood this film perfectly thanks to all the perfectly acted performances by Brando and Pacino, but as well as Robert Duvall as the family lawyer Tom Hagen, James Caan as Sonny, as well as John Cazale as Fredo. Coppola's film not only depicts how ruthless the mob can be in some instances but also how violent the mob can be as well as those were the perfect requirements for movies like this. The one thing I really disagreed with most with the 45th Oscar ceremony is why Marlon Brando rejected his 2nd academy award for lead acting when in this movie he gave the best performance of his entire since A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) and On the Waterfront (1954), and as to why Francis Ford Coppola didn't win the Academy Award for best director when I really do think he deserved it. But in the end this film is an absolute masterpiece from start to finish."

","Like many, I consider Citizen Kane to be the greatest film of all time. For unknown reasons, Gone With The Wind is my second favourite movie. Right behind these two is The Godfather, the mafia epic that perhaps tops more ""best of"" lists than Citizen Kane and Gone With The Wind today. As my third favourite film, I do not mind The Godfather ranking number 1 on lists and don't mind when it is raved as being ""the greatest of all time."" It is not the best in my eyes, but I can see why it would be the best in others. Anyway, my reaction to seeing The Godfather is just like anybody else's that feel mesmerized by this mammoth piece of work.<br/><br/>The Godfather launched the careers of director Francis Ford Coppola, author Mario Puzo, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and relaunched the career of Marlon Brando. Because of early classics like On The Waterfront and A Streetcar Named Desire, Marlon Brando earned the rep as the greatest and most influential actor in film history. With a string of less successful movies right before The Godfather, Brando's greatest rival, Sir Laurence Olivier (the greatest stage actor of the 20 century), was the original choice to play protagonist, Vito Chorleone. With Olivier still a huge movie star, Brando's performance in this epic put him back on the map and gave him an Academy Award win for best actor. Others actors, as mentioned above were also nominated for other categories, but all lost. I'm glad they lost, it was such a close call that it would have been a polar-opposing house of opinions.<br/><br/>The Godfather tells the story of the Chorleone family: the most powerful and ruthless mafia clan in America. Don Vito Chorleone (Brando) helps out whomever he feels and makes people ""an offer they can't refuse."" When drug dealer, Sollozzo approaches Vito asking for political protection, Vito, against drugs, declines. So Sollozzo and his current entourage of mob families attempt to kill Vito, which would make his son, Santino (Caan), the new Don as he wants to join Sollozzo. Instead, Vito survives and a deadly web of mob violence explodes. Vito's youngest son Michael (Pacino), is a war veteran who wants nothing to do with the family business, but as the violence rises and the family drastically weakens, Michael is the only one that can bring the family to their original status, by being more clever and deadlier than his father could ever be.<br/><br/>The first half or so, to me, is more of a thriller than drama. Lots of suspense is created after Vito makes the rejection does not stop until after Michael kills Sollozzo and crooked cop, McCluskey. The second half is a drama as we see the family struggling with their downfall and soon rise. The story get more complex as the movie goes on, which may result in a confusion of who's who. That is why this movie needs your full, undivided attention and full concentration. It took me a few watches to completely understand. I love movies that require multiple viewings.<br/><br/>The acting is the best ensemble ever put to film. Brando passes the torch to Al Pacino, as this was Brando's last monumental film and Pacino's first. I don't recall any other movie with such good acting by every single actor.<br/><br/>4/4"
"andkonst","10","6","9","8 September 2014"," The Godfather (1972)
","Taking a best-selling novel of more drive than genius (Mario Puzo's The Godfather), about a subject of something less than common experience (the Mafia), involving an isolated portion of one very particular ethnic group (first-generation and second-generation Italian-Americans), Francis Ford Coppola has made one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment.<br/><br/>The Godfather, which opened at five theaters here yesterday, is a superb Hollywood movie that was photographed mostly in New York (with locations in Las Vegas, Sicily, and Hollywood). It's the gangster melodrama come of age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesn't (or, at least, shouldn't) pay.<br/><br/>It still doesn't, but the punishments suffered by the members of the Corleone Family aren't limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. They also include lifelong sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power, but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in.<br/><br/>Yet The Godfather is not quite that simple. It was Mr. Puzo's point, which has been made somehow more ambiguous and more interesting in the film, that the experience of the Corleone Family, as particular as it is, may be the mid-twentieth-century equivalent of the oil and lumber and railroad barons of nineteenth-century America. In the course of the ten years of intra-Mafia gang wars (1945-1955) dramatized by the film, the Corleones are, in fact, inching toward social and financial respectability.<br/><br/>For the Corleones, the land of opportunity is America the Ugly, in which almost everyone who is not Sicilian or, more narrowly, not a Corleone, is a potential enemy. Mr. Coppola captures this feeling of remoteness through the physical look of place and period, and through the narrative's point of view. The Godfather seems to take place entirely inside a huge, smoky, plastic dome, through which the Corleones see our real world only dimly.<br/><br/>Thus, at the crucial meeting of Mafia families, when the decision is made to take over the hard drug market, one old don argues in favor, saying he would keep the trade confined to blacks—""they are animals anyway.""<br/><br/>This is all the more terrifying because, within their isolation, there is such a sense of love and honor, no matter how bizarre.<br/><br/>The film is affecting for many reasons, including the return of Marlon Brando, who has been away only in spirit, as Don Vito Corleone, the magnificent, shrewd old Corleone patriarch. It's not a large role, but he is the key to the film, and to the contributions of all of the other performers, so many actors that it is impossible to give everyone his due.<br/><br/>Some, however, must be cited, especially Al Pacino, as the college- educated son who takes over the family business and becomes, in the process, an actor worthy to have Brando as his father; as well as James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, Al Martino, and Morgana King. Mr. Coppola has not denied the characters' Italian heritage (as can be gathered by a quick reading of the cast), and by emphasizing it, he has made a movie that transcends its immediate milieu and genre.<br/><br/>The Godfather plays havoc with the emotions as the sweet things of life—marriages, baptisms, family feasts—become an inextricable part of the background for explicitly depicted murders by shotgun, garrote, machine gun, and booby-trapped automobile. The film is about an empire run from a dark, suburban Tudor palace where people, in siege, eat out of cardboard containers while babies cry and get underfoot. It is also more than a little disturbing to realize that characters, who are so moving one minute, are likely, in the next scene, to be blowing out the brains of a competitor over a white tablecloth. It's nothing personal, just their way of doing business as usual.<br/><br/>THE GODFATHER (MOVIE)<br/><br/>Directed by Francis Ford Coppola; written by Mario Puzo and Mr. Coppola, based on the novel by Mr. Puzo; director of photography, Gordon Willis; edited by William Reynolds, Peter Zinner, Marc Laub, and Murray Solomon; music by Nino Rota; production designer, Dean Tavoularis; produced by Albert S. Ruddy; released by Paramount Pictures. Running time: 175 minutes."

","The Godfather, for the few of you who don't already know, is about the Corleone mafia family struggling to survive a war with a rival family. That's about as simplistic a summary as you can get for this masterpiece. There's no way to describe it in a few simple lines and there's already a ton of excellent, well-thought-out reviews here on IMDb. There's really very little I can add to the overwhelming praise for this film. It's obviously one of the greatest movies of all time and its reputation as such is well-deserved. The direction, the cast, the score, the script are as good as it gets. The whole production is as flawless as you're likely to find on any film. There isn't a thing about it I would change. It's one of those movies you have to see at least once before you die."
"CinemaClown","Null","7","11","5 January 2016"," Filmmaking At Its Most Perfect, Genuine, Complete, Crystalline & Pure.
","Immortal for its contribution to cinema & one of the prime examples of filmmaking art, The Godfather is a remarkable inside-out look at the life of a mafia family that also paints an astounding portrait of organised crime. Scoring full marks in all aspects of filmmaking, be it direction, screenplay, acting, cinematography, editing or music, this crime drama immerses viewers into its world from the very beginning and narrates its story with such strong magnetic grip for the next three hours that it's impossible to not be impressed & amazed by it. Even after so many viewings, there is nothing to complain about this classic, there is no weakness to exploit and with each view, the respect for this motion picture masterpiece only gets higher.<br/><br/>Based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo, The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family, a respectable & powerful family having major underworld influences which are overseen by Don Vito Corleone, who is termed as Godfather by his peers as a token of respect. But when Don Corleone refuses to enter the drug business, a series of events are set in motion which results in an assassination attempt on the Don, increasing rivalries among the mafia families, and paves way for Don's youngest son to rise & take up his father's job in order to protect his family and to settle all disputes. The film revolves around Michael Corleone (Don's youngest son) and even the main plot of the story is the evolution of Michael from a doe-eyed outsider, who didn't want to get into the family business, into a ruthless boss later in the story.<br/><br/>The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is no short of amazement. The way he filmed most of the scenes from the very beginning to the end, the casting decisions he made, the chosen locations for shooting, the remarkable screenplay & memorable quotes co-written with Mario Puzo and the overall style of narration & look of the film, it's all brilliantly done. Cinematography is carried out beautifully and the decision to shoot in Technicolor print pays off enormously well for it provided this film a vintage look that wonderfully matched the timeline it represented and also added an artistic flair to the whole medium. Editing is very precisely done with each character getting enough time on-screen without robbing its expertly controlled pace. Nino Rota's score opens the film with a sad, almost funeral-like theme music, and boasts tracks which sound very unusual for a crime drama but then it also fits the film's ambiance remarkably well. The overall work by the entire technical crew is as much responsible for this film's success as the direction, writing & performances.<br/><br/>As far as performances go, The Godfather features a cast of incredibly gifted actors in Marlon Brando, James Caan, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Richard S. Castellano, Talia Shire, Al Lettieri & many more, and every one of them is in top-notch form. Marlon Brando makes Don Corleone truly his own, giving his character a set of unique look & traits and delivers, possibly, the greatest performance of all time which also immortalised the character of Don Corleone in cinema forever and permanently engraved Brando's status as one of world's finest actors. Al Pacino also makes his mark on the big stage and delivers the next great performance as Michael Corleone, plus his rise to power from a reluctant outsider into a ruthless mafia boss remains one of the most spectacular character arcs ever exhibited on film canvas. James Caan stars as Sonny Corleone, Don's hot-headed eldest son, and I don't recall Caan delivering any other performance of this calibre and same goes for Richard S. Castellano who plays Clemenza, a caporegime for the Corleone family. Other notable works include Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams, Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, Abe Vigoda as Tessio & Al Lettieri as Virgil Sollozzo. All in all, there are no complains in this department either.<br/><br/>Telling a tale that spans ten years of the Corleone family in three hours, while also reflecting the world of organised crime with immense character depth & complexity unlike anything before it, and ingeniously blending it with impressive direction, sturdy writing, impeccable performances, striking quotes, innovative storytelling & a mesmerizing score, The Godfather is an exceptionally well-made motion picture and certainly the one with the best cast. Ever since its release, it has become the benchmark by which all the great masterpieces are measured and its influence on cinema, especially gangster genre, is unprecedented. On an overall scale, The Godfather is universally accepted as one of world cinema's finest films, arguably the greatest ever, and the performances by Marlon Brando & Al Pacino alone are the stuff of legends. Plus, this films also marks a significant moment in cinema, in my opinion, in which the baton was passed from Marlon Brando, the finest actor of his generation, to Al Pacino who later became the finest actor of the subsequent era. The film doesn't need my recommendation because it's a must watch for every cinema lover. There are very few movies which are unanimously hailed as a great one from critics, filmmakers & viewers all around the world and The Godfather is unquestionably one of those classics and, in my opinion, the only one that deserves the top spot. A cinematic treasure you should neither refuse nor ignore, The Godfather is genre filmmaking at its most perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline & pure. One hundred percent recommended."

","My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation. <br/><br/>All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.<br/><br/>Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.<br/><br/>The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.<br/><br/>In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.<br/><br/>Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.<br/><br/>The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an ""offer he can't refuse"", or ""Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes"" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.<br/><br/>The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.<br/><br/>In fact it's all beautifully played."

","No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.<br/><br/>And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.<br/><br/>Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.<br/><br/>Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.<br/><br/>Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).<br/><br/>Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.<br/><br/>My Grade--- Part I: A Part II: B Part III: C-"

In contrast, when Michael is courting Kay, back from his long time away, he walks with her, much like he walked with Apollonia, but now the camera is in front of the couple, and we are privy to their conversation.

His sons help their father...except for his youngest Michael (Al Pacino). He wants no part of the family business...but he might have no choice.<br/><br/>A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"") have become legendary. Also there is some violence which was considered extreme in 1972 but is pretty tame today. Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she's married into. The look on her face is perfect.<br/><br/>This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was (rightfully) called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing."

","Here it is, the big boss man Vito is sitting in his gold chair, petting his cat, showing power. The poor man is begging for money from Vito but Vito just taunts him. This is one of the first scenes and probably one of the greatest scene in the movie because it shows how dramatic the movie is by the Vito showing power and wealth by petting a cat and sitting in a gold chair.<br/><br/>
As I was watching this scene I thought I might give my opinion and review on the movie The Godfather. I think that The Godfather is a great movie for the time period it was made in. When it was made there wasn't a lot of technology they could use. But the movie is ultimately dramatic in a good way and it really expresses the characters feelings and emotions. Even though it is fictionalized The Godfather does add historic information to build off their plot which I love that the director did that. They also used one of the most amazing soundtracks I have heard in a movie. If that's not enough to convince you to watch it then I don't know what will.<br/><br/>The movie is set in the 1950's where mafia superpowers are fighting for more power in New York. But this movie focuses on one specific family, the Corleone family. But when the leader of the family, Vito, gets in trouble with the other families he asks his son, Michael, to join the mafia and Michael reluctantly joins the mafia. But Michael starts getting involved in the violence in the mafia and he tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife but ultimately keeps getting dragged deeper and deeper into the dirty, family business.<br/><br/>One reason you should watch this movie is because even though it is old it got multiple awards for best actors and best pictures in 1973. To add on to that it got the BAFTA award for best film music. Now this is important because you can enjoy this movie, even though its old, and you can really experience the dramatic fashion of this movie because of the best actor awards and the best film music contributing to the greatness.<br/><br/>Think about it, Vito's men are getting threatened and Vito is not having any of that. Then all of a sudden one of his men are killed and he says this line ""Revenge is best served cold"". Then out of nowhere two of Vito's men drowns another man that was apart of the gang threatening Vito and his gang. I love this line because it shows how dramatic the movie can be and how it expressive Vito is to go through with the murder.<br/><br/>The movie is really good and I suggest that you give it a watch. It is definitely worth your time and is a 70's classic. And all the achievements and lines from this movie is amazing and will executed. Also this movie also influenced me to really go and try out different things outside my comfort zone. I really hope this review convinced you to give it a watch and this movie shows that joining gangs only leads to violence so don't join a gang."

Also involved are Sonny Corleone (James Caan), adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and muscle Peter Clemenza (Richard S.

Brando plays the wise Vito Corleone very well, but the best performances come from Pacino as Michael and Caan as Sonny.  Pacino is probably the greatest character actor of all time, and this film shows it.  He plays Michael at the start with a young naivety and is able to bring the character along to the end of the film, where he shows the growth of Michael's knowledge and wisdom.  Unfortunately, Caan is only in about half the movie, but he certainly does an incredible job as the hot tempered Sonny.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" is the template for good drama.  Few films achieve it's greatness, but in the end, it is surely not the best.  In my opinion, there is no best movie of all time, but many 'best' films per genre.  ""The Godfather"" is the best crime drama.  ""Casablanca"" is the best romance.  ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" movies are the best adventures.  All of said movies would tie, and be equal in greatness.<br/><br/>So, if you're ever tired of these days' mindless action and mediocre drama films, then pop in one of the classics.  Any one will do, they are all equally entertaining.  Films like ""The Godfather"", ""Casablanca"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" are the reason movies are so popular.<br/><br/>Enjoy, 9/10."

When some of the characters die I didn't care one bit, not once did I care. They could have killed everyone in the movie and I wouldn't care at all because I could not relate to anything of the characters persona.<br/><br/>Due to the lack of character-interest I didn't get interested in the plot at all and it felt like I was dragged through the whole movie with a barbwire around my neck.<br/><br/>Today I plan to get dragged once more when I'm going to watch The Godfather 2 and if it's anything like the first one it's going to be a horrible experience."

However, admittedly, unlike 'The Goodfellas' for instance, 'The godfather' is not glamourised that much, and I'm thankful for Coppolla turning what was at times a tedious book into a 3 hour long gripping tale. I did enjoy the book, but it's lucky that Coppolla was the man who got his hands on it. He turned some of 'The Godfather''s sections into the most mind-bendingly gripping scenes ever.<br/><br/>In a film genre that is incredibly overrated, 'The Godfather' certainly stands head and shoulders above the rest, however, i feel it's genre should forever hold it back from being THE greatest movie of all time."

","""The Godfather"" is so smart, so well written (an Oscar winner for Best Adapted Screenplay) and so well performed that it would have succeeded under the very worst of circumstances. Marlon Brando (Oscar-winning, even though he refused the award) gives the performance of a lifetime as the head of a Mafia family that will do anything and everything to dominate organized crime in post-World War II New York City. However, the face of crime is quickly changing and other syndicates are targeting Brando to eliminate him as competition. What no one figured was that youngest son Al Pacino (Oscar-nominated) may be even more ruthless and maniacal than his father. Robert Duvall and James Caan both received Oscar nominations for their roles in the wicked mix. Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda and John Cazale all do arguably the best work of their respective careers. ""The Godfather"" is epic film-making which ended up being the first true picture to deal with the topic in a non-film noir style. It is an amazing achievement which is probably the best movie produced in the 1970s (that is saying a whole lot by the way) and quite possibly the greatest motion picture of all time.

","When people think of ""The Godfather"", they usually think of the Mafia. But, as Entertainment Weekly noted, calling ""The Godfather"" a Mafia movie is like calling ""The Odyssey"" a guide to the Aegean Sea. This story of how the Corleone family rules New York with their own version of justice entails everything that makes movies good.<br/><br/>First, the opening scene. The shot of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) sitting in his chair petting his cat sets the Don up as a fatherly - but shady - figure. Then, you see Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding: the Corleones are not just a bunch of evil slime-balls. During the wedding, Michael (Al Pacino) arrives. Wearing his military uniform, Michael looks like a handsome young man - possibly an allusion to how these people are adept at deceiving other people. At the wedding, Michael meets WASP-ish outsider Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), who's naturally a little weirded out by the whole Mafia lifestyle - at one point, Michael has to tell her: ""That's my family, Kay. That's not me."" The other two sons are Sonny (James Caan), the immature playboy, and Fredo (John Cazale), the loser. And there's also the adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), now a lawyer. After a trip to Hollywood where he unsuccessfully tries to get a producer to hire singer Johnny Fontane (who apparently was not really based on Frank Sinatra), we all know what Tom does with the horse.<br/><br/>A scene that did a really good job showing the break between 1st and 2nd generation Americans is the scene where Michael and Kay are Christmas shopping and ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" is playing. Vito, as an immigrant, kept many of the traditions from his native country. Michael, born and raised in the US, certainly seems less Italian that his father.<br/><br/>Then, of course, Vito gets shot. After Michael gets revenge, he has to hide out in Sicily. While he's there...well, we all know what happens to Sonny. This prompts Vito to negotiate with the other families. But then, Michael turns out to be even more ruthless than his father.<br/><br/>Probably the most incredible scene is when Michael presides over the baptism of Connie's child. As soon as Michael ""renounces"" Satan, things get ugly. It basically says that every time that they say something holy, someone gets slaughtered.<br/><br/>All in all, Francis Ford Coppola created an inimitable cinematic masterpiece. And the sequel actually managed to equal the original."

","THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.<br/><br/>Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all."

","The Godfather is an insightful sociological study of violence, power, honor and obligation, corruption, justice and crime in America. Part I of The Godfather Trilogy centers on the Corleone crime ""family"" in the boroughs of New York City in the mid 1940s, dominated at first by aging godfather/patriarch ""Don"" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in a tremendous, award-winning acting portrayal that revived his career). A turn-of-the-century Silician immigrant, he is the head of one of the five Italian-American ""families"" that operates a crime syndicate. The 'honorable' crime ""family,"" working outside the system due to exclusion by social prejudice, serves as a metaphor for the way business (the pursuit of the American dream) is conducted in capitalistic, profit-making corporations and governmental circles.<br/><br/>This epic story traces the history of their close-knit Mafia family and organization over a ten year period (although the specific words ""Mafia"" and ""Cosa Nostra"" are not found in the film's script - they were replaced with ""the family""). The presiding, dominant Corleone patriarch, who is threatened by the rise of modern criminal activities - the drug trade, is ultimately succeeded by his decent youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), a US Marine Corps officer in WWII who becomes even more ruthless to persist. Family loyalty and blood ties are juxtaposed with brutal and vengeful blood-letting and the inevitable downfall of the family. Romanticized scenes of the domestic home life of members of the family - a family wedding, shopping, a baptism, kitchen cooking, etc., are intertwined with scenes of horrific violence and murder contracts - a total of 23 deaths litter the film. Over 50 scenes involved food and drink."
"TxMike","Null","8","14","12 December 2004"," Simply a great classic, number one on many lists.
","I was fortunate to see ""The Godfather"" back in 1972 upon its theatrical release. No matter how many ""gangster"" movies were made before this, here we had a different kind of movie. We had a movie foremost about ""family"" and dedication to one another. If you could manage to ignore the fact that this was one of the New York mafia families (set in the 1940s), it was as if we were watching a model family. At once honoring the family patriarch, Don Vito Corleone memorably played by Marlon Brando , and at the same time witnessing the rise of the new family leader, Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino. Equally memorable was the role of Santino 'Sonny' Corleone created by James Caan. And memorable for Robert Duvall who created the quiet role of Tom Hagen. Many list have ""The Godfather"" as number one of all time. To me that doesn't matter, films are meant to be enjoyed each for its own merit. Regardless, there probably will never be a ""gang family"" movie that approaches the overall impact of this one.<br/><br/>Coppola directed this movie and its follow-ups. Not all of his have been great efforts. For me ""One From The Heart"", shot entirely on a sound stage, looks and sounds cheap, I consider it a failure. But he also directed such a fun movie as ""Peggy Sue Got Married"", another ""family"" theme. Al Pacino, even though he was 31 during filming, was still essentially an unknown, but his role as Michael put him on the map, and he is still going strong. ""The Godfather"" is a long movie at three hours, but it never seems long, so well told is its story. It is a classic in every respect, and a copy belongs in the library of every serious movie fan."

Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece of cinema and one of the most memorable films of all time: Brando (Best Actor) gives a superb performance as Don Vito Corleone, the head of a Long Island crime family who faces all sorts of dilemmas, most of which embroil his youngest son Michael (Pacino in a star-making role), fresh from WWII, who takes on the awesome task of being the next leader in crime, violence and double-crossing. Great ensemble cast and some truly remarkable moments captured on film: offering film studio head Marley ""an offer he can't refuse"" resulting with a horse's head in bed; assassination attempts and successes (Caan's hot-tempered Sonny buying the farm at a toll booth massacre the likes of ""Bonnie and Clyde"") and the piece de resistance of baptism of Michael's' godson and the wiping out of his enemies is the stuff of Greek legend. Pure filmmaking at its best. Oscar winner for Best Picture, adapted screenplay by Coppola and Mario Puzo (from his best seller) and some beautiful cinematography by Gordon Willis (suggesting a Rembrandt painting come to life).

","What happened to the sure-footed director of this film?  How did his impeccable craftsmanship ever give rise to such things as the slipshod, overwrought ""Dracula""?<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW<br/><br/>It's hard to say, but there IS that moment near the end, which some mistake for a climax or even a turning point:  Michael is in church, at the Christening ceremony of his sister's child; his henchmen are in various positions around the city (one in Nevada), poised to murder the Corleone family's most powerful enemies and rivals.  Coppola introduces a device he had hitherto studiously avoided: fast cross cutting.  ""Do you, Michael Corleone, renounce Satan?"" asks a priest.  Cut to some act of violence.  Cut back to Michael: ""I do.""  Cut to violence.  ""And all his works?""  Cut: Blam! Michael: ""I do.""  Cut: another  stylishly staged shooting.  It's a wonder Francis Ford Coppola doesn't write the words ""Please note the irony"" across the screen.<br/><br/>I don't fault the decision to use rapid, gliding montage at this point, given that it ISN'T a key moment, merely one that plays out decisions we had seen made earlier, but there's no denying that in the way it's done Coppola both hits us over the head and goes over the top (some of the killings are too operatic for what is essentially a stealth operation) - although thankfully, less far over the top than he probably planned, since the gravitational pull of his carefully made world remains strong.<br/><br/>I must stress that this excess doesn't matter HERE.  I mention it because it's perhaps the seed of something that would grow and grow and ultimately choke later Coppola films.  Just a thought.  ""The Godfather"" itself is perfectly crafted and shaded.  There's the well realised and well photographed settings, both 1940s New York and timeless Sicily; there's the believability and depth (when The Don is shot and thought to be dead, the tears look unforced and REAL, which I doubt you could say of those in any other gangster film); there's the sense that we know these people, culturally homogenous yet not at all the same.  There's Nino Rota's wonderful score.  I don't think this is a GREAT film, in the sense that so many other people seem to think it is.  It doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the morning of the day I saw ""The Godfather"" (I'd seen it before, but this was the first actual screening), someone wrote to me to protest that my harsh comments on Marlon Brando based on his performance in another film (""Viva Zapata!"") were unfair.  What I'd said had struck me as obvious: that Brando's introspective style reveals his character far more to him than it does to us; that he acts without INTERacting, failing to mesh with the rest of the cast; that he mumbles too much.  In my reply I had to admit that I hadn't seen many Brando performances, and of the earlier ones, only Zapata.  I was almost going to admit that his performance in ""The Godfather"" was faultless.  A good thing I didn't!  When I saw it again I realised that Brando may have sufficient grip on his character not to let the film down, but just barely; again, he introspects too much, interacts too little, and mumbles.<br/><br/>Yet the acting in ""The Godfather"" and the film overall are too strong for this to matter in the least."

","Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's  but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.<br/><br/>Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best.  Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever.<br/><br/>To sum up, The Godfather is sensational. A fine film from a fine filmmaker."

Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.<br/><br/>I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough.

"illbebackreviews","10","7","12","9 December 2012"," 'The Godfather' to be called the greatest movie of all time is a fair judgment
","The last time I watched the Godfather I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 and I didn't particularly love it and so I was disappointed. I wasn't looking forward to sitting through this 3 hour movie once more but I'm definitely glad that I did as the second time, the whole story became so much easier to understand.<br/><br/>The Godfather is simply a movie that deals with the crime business within the Corleone family. The summary given on IMDb doesn't seem accurate to me as it simply deals with the lives of Michael and Vito Corleone, as well as Sonny and Tom Hagen.<br/><br/>The greatest strength in the movie is EVERYTHING! I LOVE IT! The acting in the movie is pretty much, beyond explanation with words. Marlon Brando is absolutely a genius of an actor playing Vito, one of my favorite movie characters. Al Pacino did a fantastic job playing the young war hero, Michael Corleone. The only bit of a weakness in terms of acting was Diane Keaton, but it doesn't bother me one little bit.<br/><br/>The writing and direction in the movie is superb. Every scene is executed at top notch and this movie is simply a great explanation of what a great movie should be like and clearly defines Francis Coppola as a superb director. The dialogue is entertaining, and unlike the first time, no scene in the movie bored me one little bit. I love the whole movie and honestly, it felt half its running time The characters in the movie are just brilliantly conjured up. They are all so great in their own ways and each have their own personalities making them unique. I love Vito, Michael, Tom, Sonny, Kay, Sollozo, the corrupted cop and everyone, including such minor characters.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** When Luca Brasi and Sonny were killed off, that left such a strange feeling of emotion in me. Luca Brasi seemed like such a warrior of a man and seeing that Sonny was killed when he was on his way to kill Carlo for his actions against Connie was just heartbreaking.<br/><br/>However, no moment in movie history affected me the same way that this scene did and that is the classic scene with Marlon Brando's Vito playing with his grandson in the garden and abruptly, falling dead. It was so beautifully done. In any other movie, this scene would feel so unrealistic that you wouldn't buy it, the fact that a mob leader's final moments were playing with his grandson but here, the scene is executed to the perfect level. It is in fact, my favorite scene of the movie The scene where Connie and Carlo's character is being baptized at the end was just a brilliant scene and was great to see some bloody action at the end of the film. The final scene with Michael lying to Kay about Carlo's murder was great and when the heads of the families meet in his room and call him 'Don Corleone' is perhaps the greatest ending to any movie along with the Empire Strikes Back **END OF SPOILERS*** In conclusion, upon my second viewing, I can gladly say that the Godfather totally deserves to be called the best movie of all time in every way possible though it may not necessarily be mine. My Flickchart list reports this movie as my 6th highest and it all comes for good reason. Superb directing, action, writing, characters and story totally pay off as this 3 hour movie for me, feels more like a 90 minute film!"
"ElMaruecan82","10","7","12","28 April 2011"," Simply the Greatest Movie Ever Made ...
","In the beginning, a young war hero tells his future wife, how his father helped a successful crooner in his career, by making his manager an offer he couldn't refuse : basically threatening him to death with a gun on his head. Through a true story, he was revealing a secret that showed how menacing is his family, and how different he is. At the end, not only did he threaten his brother in law, but he killed him, and when asked by his wife, if it was true, he answered: 'no', concluding one of the most fascinating characters' arcs in a movie. What happened in between is just the greatest cinematic metamorphosis, pure magic.<br/><br/>This is not the story of a pure soul being corrupted, but the story of a soul whose only choice in order to protect someone dear was to become like him and therefore to realize that the crime that inhabited his father's life, not only could be justified, but ultimately, was the only destiny that could allow him to succeed. This is the irony of the American Dream, of a man who parodied the capitalism to underline its own limits, the same limits that ultimately built his power. An irony that inherited his youngest son, who lost his soul for the sake of blood loyalty: losing principles for the sake of mightier principles.<br/><br/>The fact is that some principles transcend the conventional ones, and if the father didn't want to be a puppet, he had to be the one who pulls the strings, like Presidents who don't pull the trigger, to be the ones to declare the war. More than an iconic cinematic allegory, the strings symbolize the tight frontier between being a legitimate politician and a respected criminal, in other words, being Vito Corleone. Being the master who gives you protection, in exchange of loyalty, letting you act knowingly that everything is under control. That's the point, with Vito, everything is under control. When he promises that the two thugs who brutalized a poor undertaker's daughter will get their comeuppance, we know he'll do it. Now, the question asked in the beginning is : which of his three sons will succeed to this exceptional man?<br/><br/>The answer relies on one scene. Michael kisses his father's hand, in danger in the hospital, and tells him respectfully: ""I'm with you, Pop"" and a tear runs in Vito's face. His son is protecting him and for some reason, we're almost sure that his father will survive, just like with the undertaker. The only man who inspired the same level of confidence than Vito is his son, Michael, who's (ironically again) the civilian, the non criminal. Not because the other sons were not meant to be Dons, the older one was Sonny, hot headed, good hearted, the other was as good hearted but weaken minded, both were criminals in a way or another. Michael was the one because he had to be. More than a story of succession, it's a story of destiny.<br/><br/>And ""The Godfather"" is one of the greatest evolutions that ever enriched the silver screen. Mainly because of this story that everyone could relate to, one who loved his family and whose only choice was to corrupt his soul to protect it. It's not about crime, it's about the very necessities that make crime, not legitimate, but justifiable. It's not about crime; it's about its roots. It's not a crime or gangster movie, it's a movie where the crime setting highlights some principles like blood loyalty, friendship, or family that would have been meaningless in a more legitimate world. This is the thought provoking genius of ""The Godfather"", that made it so universally appealing, because people from every cultures respect values like courage, loyalty, family, and respect itself.<br/><br/>The nature of the story is just one of the pillars on which the greatness of ""The Godfather"" has built its legend ... and I focused on this because the rest has not to be proved: the acting, the direction, the music, the quotes, the characters, the cinematography  every analyzable element is a living proof of the movie's closeness to perfection. Why should I develop this? If you read these lines, you know what I'm talking about, so let's keep this prudish and not try to be too enthusiastic. How ironic that the movie was based on a kind of pulp fiction novel  How ironic that the direction that made the movie with such confidence was so imperceptible  <br/><br/>Indeed, Coppola makes us feel as part of this family, of the Corleones, they are criminals, yes, but the intimacy helps us to root for them  But another irony is that the direction is still present by these little details that gave the film its legendary feeling, every single death occurring has a little something that makes it memorable, from Khartoum's decapitation, to Sonny's ambush, from the restaurant to the baptism scenes, not to forget the two strangulations that opened and concluded the human deaths' series. The details are everywhere, in the script that enriched the cinematic language with so many iconic quotes, from delightful culinary parallels to other fishy metaphors  a script that transcended the novel, and made the film even more legendary.<br/><br/>When it comes to defend ""The Godfather"", I'm the most passionate fan you'll ever find, but I prefer to prevent this review from an overdose of superlatives. I know the movie is the greatest, not because it's my personal belief, but because I can't see another movie to top it, whatever cinematic category I use : story, acting, casting, writing, scoring, editing, direction  I can find a movie better in every element but not in all of them, and beyond all this technicality  it's just a movie that grows on you, after so many viewings, that shines cinematic respect in every single frame. The greatest"

Brando is ideally cast in the title role, but his is basically a supporting role. This is the story of Michael, and Pacino is excellent in conveying the transformation of the character from a geeky soldier to a tough mob boss. Caan, Duvall, and Castellano head the terrific supporting cast. Despite the nearly three-hour running time, it does not drag for a minute. The cinematography perfectly evokes the period.

","A family, the Don, everyone knows him, everyone knows of his power, here is the end of his era and simply the beginning of another, we a fantastic look into a family, into a style of life. It begins and we see who Vito Corleone is, we see another man who shares some things with Vito, both are Italians now established in America, that other man believes in the country that gave him and his family a fine life certainly, here you see what the Corleone family can do. And is a wonderful contrast, is the life the Corleone family, Vito ordered for justice and next he is dancing with his daughter. Family and the business, so in the business part we meet Sollozzo, big nose Italian, great businessman, narcotics are the future and Sollozzo knows that to get to that bright future Vito is important. And all is simply because of don't keeping you very own thoughts with you, every one knew that narcotics means dollars, Vito's son and right hand Tom Hagen, Vito's eldest son Santino but the decision was only of Vito. Then this is a terrific story, logic and business, ""nothing personal"", here Michael Corleone will enter, not to the film certainly but to the business. As any other character Michael is really interesting, here we know that he is a war hero, he is not like his family but certainly he knows the world of his family, he was born in that world. Basically during the very first part of the film we see Michael as a normal man with his former girlfriend Kay, buying Christmas presents, going to the cinema, having dinner and stuff. Soon we will see him in Sicily but before we see his first contact with the business part, obviously he suffered like Santino or Tom when he saw on the newspaper that Vito Corleone was shoot and that was still unknown if he was dead or alive so basically is this what puts Michael closer to the business part. So this is the very beginning of a new era but we don't know that yet, after all Michael was going to have a meet with Sollozzo and his dirty police officer because he was a civilian, not related with the family business. Is a great scene, the very best of Pacino in this film so Sollozo and his dirty police officer are dead, a new ""chapter"" in The Godfather begins, another engaging part of the film, for me each second of The Godfather is wonderful. So we for the first time see Sicily, there Michael is just waiting, there he meets a beautiful girl, she becomes his wife, certainly there are news from New York, Santino was killed (an emblematic scene), the future of Michael is only one. The last time we see Vito as the Don we see him together with Tattaglia, Barzini, Cuneo and Stracci, after this Vito realizes about something and that will save Michael's life. He is still the Don for the men of the Corleone family but certainly if they trust in Vito and are loyal to Vito they must trust in Michael and be loyal to Michael who at the time was already father, Anthony the name of his son, together with Anthony Vito is laughing, enjoying a normal time with his grandson, the most unexpected death thinking in Don Vito Corleone after the life he had, he always had honor, love for his family, he died in a peaceful way, playing with his grandson, in his house, if that would have been an offer certainly would have an offer he can't refuse. <br/><br/>The cast is simply perfect, the voice of Brando, the strange charisma of James Caan as Santino, one of Pacino's best performances, simply each actor/actress is fantastic giving life to all those memorable characters. My very first experience with The Godfather was not a really long time ago, was in 2005 and I came to them together with some members of my family who like me had never seen by then any of the three films, I loved The Godfather and in 2006 I read the novel by Mario Puzo. I remember not having clear in my mind each detail of the film when I started reading the novel, by then I had seen only once The Godfather. I loved the novel and after reading it I went to another one by Puzo, The Last Don and I loved it also. So after this I remember having this sort of Mafia summer by watching first the miniseries based on The Last Don and later watching again The Godfather trilogy. This film has become the one I love the most, its long runtime feels like nothing, I watched it a lot of times back in 2006 once I had read the novel, fantastic. <br/><br/>I received for Christmas the Coppola Restoration four-disc set on Blu-ray, while I haven't seen yet Part II and III (and the new bonus material) on Blu-ray this part looks so beautiful, in short you remember how it looks the blood of Moe Greene (during that memorable baptism sequence)? Well on Blu-ray it finally looks like blood!<br/><br/>PD: my very first IMDb comment was precisely for The Godfather. While I'm not at all ashamed or anything like that about it I don't like it either so I decided to delete it and write another one. I was going to put it here just because it was my very first comment but thanks to the words limit I can't. I will put it on my message board profile."

","Adapted from a Mario Puzo novel, The Godfather has had the most extreme change in views for me, until a couple of weeks I despised it but that was before I rewatched it and now I love it. I think my hate for it was based on when I first saw it at the age of about 16, I really wasn't mature to appreciate the sheer beauty of The Godfather. When released it became of the biggest grossing movies of the 70's and it's no hard to see why. There are so many great aspects of The Godfather. The characters are just so well etched out. The story centres around the Corleone family who are involved with the underworld and their fight to gain supremacy of the underworld over a couple of decades. There is Don Corleone, who maybe an underworld figure but is a man of principle. An example of that is in the scene where he refuses to start selling drugs. Then there is Sonny,who is a far more ruthless man than his father. Micheal, who is the good son is working towards a respectable career. Their worlds turn upside down when Don is almost killed by rival. Sonny takes over the family business and wants revenge. Micheal gets his hands dirty by gunning down the rival(in the famous restaurant scene). Micheal is forced to flee the country so that he can avoid going to jail. Sonny is then eventually killed by rivals and Micheal is forced to run the business. After a few murders Micheal becomes as much of a ruthless mobster as his deceased brother Sonny. What is so remarkable is how family life and business life are intertwined so beautifully. In the beginning at the wedding for instance when they decide to do favours for their guests. All the leads were extraordinary,my personal favourite being Marlon Brando as Don Corleone. There are very few movies that can still shock audiences thirty years after they were first released, The Godfather is one of those rare movies. The scene in which a producer finds his beloved horse in bed with him was deeply disturbing. The Godfather I believe stands heads and shoulders above any Gangster movies because The Godfather is not just about the Mafia, it's also about family. I think most of the credit for the Godfather should go to Francis Ford Coppola. I regard The Godfather to be one of the most remarkable and iconic movies ever made and all the people involved with it should be applauded. Highly recommended to lovers of classic cinema."

","I am not saying anything new when I say that this is the best movie in the history of cinema (at least for most of the people). ""The godfather"" is a major film with a great plot, great performances and it is entertaining since its first moment until the last second. Most of us who have watched it know at least almost of memory some little phrase told by any of its characters.<br/><br/>I am not a big fan of Marlon Brando (even thought I found him extraordinary in ""A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)"") but I recognize that he made the role of ""vito corleone"" one of the 5 most important characters in the history of cinema, nobody could have made this character better than him. Al Pacino became famous thanks to his performance as Michael Corleone in this film, where we can see his transformation from a nice guy to a cold mafia boss.<br/><br/>I have watched this film like 10 times and each new time I watch it I like it more.<br/><br/>The best movie ever"

The actors were great and all played a vital role in this masterpiece. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino have possibly given their best performances in this film than any other they have starred in. Some people might not like this film because it's too long but I think that's sad. People like them should absolutely give this film a chance and if they still don't like it then there is something completely wrong with their taste in movies.

"jzappa","10","12","24","4 October 2008"," This Consummate, Quintessential World-Class Masterwork Is Head Over Heels Better Than The Dark Knight By a Long Shot, and You All Know It.
","The Godfather soaks us up so dry it never has to hustle through. There is something in the deliberate journey of time as Don Corleone entrusts his reins of power that would have made an hour-and-forty-minute-long thriller unbecoming. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you understand merely by the way they exchange looks, or don't, or speak to each other. We are inclined to associate with Don Corleone's family not because we enjoy their gang wars, but because we have been with them from the opening, where they celebrate a wonderful wedding full of old Italian songs, dances and love, and later we watch them await violence while sitting at the kitchen table and eating the pasta cooked by Clemenza.<br/><br/>Endowed with Nino Rota's immortal, extraordinary music score, this consummate masterpiece is entitled The Godfather, a title not only relevant because of the wise Don Vito Corleone, who heads his family with unruffled effectiveness, but also to his son Michael, a hesitant college graduate who is in the beginning feeling shame of his criminal background and firm on living the life of an upright citizen. Coppola follows Michael's ascent to power within the family, on top of the concurrent wearing away of his heart.<br/><br/>Vito Corleone himself is not even the central character in the drama. He is a relaxed puppeteer. The central character, really, slowly comes to be the youngest, smartest son, Michael, who absorbs the spirit of his father's standing while reworking his outdated customs. The Godfather's function in the family enterprise is illustrated by his name, existing outside the following generation which will continue and, with any luck, point the family into legal endeavors. Marlon Brando, who plays Vito as a perceptive, resilient model family man in his wise latter years, in fact has the character lead whereas Al Pacino, as Michael, is the lead. Unhurried and physically at ease, one knows his reaction would be of great anger if he were to be harassed. In the face of his grooming, which is given the least effort needed for a good, attractive look, there's a look about him as if he's just awakened, and that first groggy morning hour is the time he always seems to be stuck within. His presence is imprinted with a brooding, nonchalant style. Smooth and understated, he musters a searing inner fire that makes his tremendous character arc so impactful and amazing. But Brando's performance, as always, is expertly offhand, and it earned him an Oscar. His voice and physicality consciously lack precision, and the incidental result is of a man so at home with power that he no longer needs to prompt anyone.<br/><br/>The remaining actors furnish one case-in-point after another of superb, instinctive casting. Macho and tempestuous James Caan and pragmatic and down-to-earth Robert Duvall, for instance, hardly have to act to embody their roles. While this, the quintessential crime drama, is an extensive, painstakingly thorough film of nearly three hours, there genuinely isn't time to go into the personal history and distinctiveness of such characters as Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the hardened, heavyset family lieutenant, Jack Woltz (John Marley, who was excellent in Faces), the movie baron, Luca Brasi, the faithful contract killer, McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), the corrupt cop, and the rest. Coppola meets this issue head-on with unassuming typecasting. A character who appears in a story long enough to say hello and goodbye, no matter how small, better be real enough that you can assume who he votes for.<br/><br/>Really, the opening wedding sequence deeply familiarizes us with the dynamics of the family, an authoritarianism in the guise of Old World ceremony. Coppola asserts a style and a visual guise that is quintessential, through Gordon Willis's reddish-brown tinted, overexposed cinematography, everything period furnishings.<br/><br/>Men wearing black suits sitting in dark boardrooms parley the particulars of prostitution and gambling, and fashion an isolated society that issues stability and integrity, that is in terms of their own advantages. Politicians and policemen are merely intimidated or trafficked. Esteem and reliability are the legal tender, and all influence emerges from the Don, who calmly keeps quiet control over his territory.<br/><br/>His successor is Santino, the Caan role, always cooking with implicit rage and is incredibly eager to inherit the position. His brothers are Michael and the sniveling pushover Fredo, played by the late John Cazale. The Duvall role is Tom Hagen, the unemotional, factual family lawyer and all-around professional shrewd pragmatist embraced by Vito as a child and brought up as his own. The women are not much more than background scenery. Vito's wife scarcely speaks or even appears. Sonny's wife suffers silently through his shameless infidelity, and the Corleone daughter, Connie, played by Talia Shire, is so often overlooked that her brothers take no notice of her unless she protests about her disgusting husband having beaten her.<br/><br/>An assault on Vito's life alters Michael's attitude, and he comes back to help defend his family's wellbeing as Sonny takes rash control, making a mess of the business and laying everyone on the line, while the laid up and incapacitated Vito can do no more than look on. Michael's bona fide defining moment make its mark in one of the film's most unforgettable scenes of ultimate virtuosity. He takes it upon himself to do a hit at a small Italian restaurant, using a gun that was left for him in a bathroom stall. This forces him into banishment in Sicily, where he solidifies his determination to return his family to a status of eminence."

","There isn't a gangster film out there bigger or better than The Godfather. It's hard to some it up in a few words, but here goes. At the centre of this film is the family. The Corleone family, headed by Vito (Marlon Brando), a.k.a. The Don, or The Godfather. His daughter's wedding tells us all we need to know about the Corleone's; key individuals, small but incredibly thought out sub-plots and a running theme of business and personal matters never mix. <br/><br/>The Godfather is based on the simplest of foundations. Love thy family. Think before you act. Never betray your own. Vito attempts to keep the peace between the crime families. When things go south Vito's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) gets involved. Michael's innocence is torn apart as he takes control of the family business.<br/><br/>With every view comes a new discovery, a piece of the puzzle missed the last time round. The Godfather is a labyrinth waiting to be deciphered. Brando is sublime. He's able to radiate warmth and coercion with the smallest of reactions. It sets up careers for James Caan and Robert Duvall, who're brothers with dissimilar attitudes. The best is to come for Pacino, as this first part in a trilogy only shows his potential. The Godfather is a one of the most intense gangsters films you're ever likely to see."

"MiladAbolghasemi","10","6","10","25 January 2015"," The Best Movie of all time
","The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. Films like The Godfather are the reason i have a passion and love for film. In few movies can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one.<br/><br/>If The Godfather was only about gun Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.<br/><br/>Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. Every major character,and more than a few minor ones is molded into a distinct, complex individual.<br/><br/>The film Begins in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court. It is the wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request on that day. So the supplicants come, each wanting something different - revenge, a husband for their daughter, a part in a movie.<br/><br/>The family has gathered for the event. Michael (Al Pacino), Don Vito's youngest son and a second world war hero, is back home in the company of a new girlfriend (Diane Keaton). The two older boys, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there as well, along with their ""adopted"" brother, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the don's right-hand man.<br/><br/>With the end of the war, the times are changing, and as much as Don Vito seems in control at the wedding, his power is beginning to erode. By the standards of some, his views on the importance of family, loyalty, and respect are antiquated. Even his heir apparent, Sonny, disagrees with his refusal to get into the drug business. Gambling and alcohol are forces of the past and present; narcotics are the future. But Don Vito will not compromise, even when a powerful drug supplier named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) arrives with promises of high profits for those who back him.<br/><br/>Don Vito's refusal to do business with Sollozzo strikes the first sparks of a war that will last for years and cost many lives. Each of the five major mob families in New York will be gouged by the bloodshed, and a new order will emerge. Betrayals will take place, and the Corleone family will be shaken to its roots by treachery from both within and without.<br/><br/>The Corleone with the most screen time is Michael (it's therefore odd that Al Pacino received a Best Supporting Actor nomination), and his tale, because of its scope and breadth, is marginally dominant. His transformation from ""innocent"" bystander to central manipulator is the stuff of a Shakespearean tragedy. By the end, this man who claimed to be different from the rest of his family has become more ruthless than Don Vito ever was.<br/><br/>Next to Humphrey Bogart's Rick from Casablanca, Oscar winner Marlon Brando's Don Vito may be the most imitated character in screen history. The line ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" has attained legendary status, as has the entire performance. With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando has created a personae that will be recalled for as long as motion pictures exist.<br/><br/>Don Vito is a most complicated gangster. In his own words, he is not a killer, and he never mixes business with personal matters. He puts family first (""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man"") and despises displays of weakness. He understands the burden of power, and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the ""throne"", is one of The Godfather's most revealing moments (about both father and son).<br/><br/>The Godfather had three Best Supporting Actor nominees, all well-deserved. The first was Pacino (who probably should have been nominated alongside Brando in the Best Actor category). The other two were James Caan and Robert Duvall. In a way, it's surprising that Duvall wasn't passed over. His presence in The Godfather isn't flashy or attention-arresting. Like his character of Tom Hagen, he is steady, reliable, and stays in the background. Not so for Caan's Sonny, whose demonstrative and volatile personality can't be overlooked.<br/><br/>Family responsibility. A father's legacy. The need to earn respect. The corrupting influence of power. These are some of the ingredients combined in Francis Ford Coppola's cinematic blender. They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries.<br/><br/>Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families. The word ""Mafia"" conjures up images of the sinister and mysterious - scenes of the sort where Luca Brasi meets his fate. Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience."

","The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,brilliant,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece that combines terrific direction,amazing performances from an outstanding cast,a wonderful script and a powerful score. All of those elements make The Godfather a flawless film that is cinema and Francis Ford Coppola at their best.<br/><br/>Based on Mario Puzo's novel and set in New York City in the 1940s and 50s,The Godfather tells the story of Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando),a Don and Mob Boss who is the head of The Corleone Family but is aging. But when Vito becomes a victim of Mob warfare,his youngest son Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)steps in to take over the family as the new don and to protect his Father and family at all costs.<br/><br/>What else can be said about The Godfather that hasn't been said before? It's an absolute masterpiece of cinema that is an instant classic from the moment you first watch it. There are plenty of iconic and memorable characters,lines and moments throughout the film that have become apart of our pop culture that when you the name The Godfather everyone knows what the film is even if people haven't seen it. The Godfather is a very revolutionary film especially with the Gangster/Mob genre because before The Godfather Gangster and Mob films used to be defined by the great Warner Bros Gangster Crime Dramas that starred movie icons James Cagney,Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart but The Godfather reinvented the Gangster/Mob genre and has a style that has been imitated but not duplicated. Where would Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics Goodfellas and Casino or the classic TV series The Sopranos be without The Godfather? The Godfather is a big,epic film that gives viewers a larger than life depiction of a organized Crime family showing the danger,tragedy and sadness that goes on in the violent world that the Corleone's have to deal with throughout the film. Some have said that The Godfather and it's sequels romanticizes the Gangster and Mafia lifestyle and made the mafia world bright and while that may or may not be true,The Godfather is still surrounded with darkness showing the horrifying and deadly consequences of being in the Gangster world where no one is safe. The film is an epic in the truest sense of the world with the length being 175 minutes(2 hrs and 55 minutes)and with The Godfather being an epic there is multiple characters and story lines but director Francis Coppola keeps the film interesting and keeps you glued to the screen with many powerful,intense scenes that punch the viewer in the gut. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is amazing and flawless with many scenes and dialog that is riveting and powerful and none of the dialog and scenes feel forced or fake but feel natural and believable. The screenplay while taking out some of the subplots of the book stays true to Mario Puzo's book with dialog that comes directly from the book. The Godfather's script is movie screen writing at it's very best The Godfather gave birth to two of the greatest and most iconic characters in movie history in Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone. When we see Vito in the first we are easily captivated by him and how he is because despite being a don and major crime figure he can be friendly and helpful with his family and friends earning tons of respect. Vito is also smart and has a moral code when it comes with his family while at the same time using violence against his enemies when needed. With Michael we see how different he becomes throughout the film because at first he wants nothing to do with the family business but when his Father and family are in danger in Michael's mind he has no choice but to run the family but in his own way. Where as Vito is a friendly and helpful don,Michael is cold and vicious but with these two characters there is many levels of depth that make them classic characters you will never forget. Violence plays a big part in The Godfather and the violence in this film shocking with scenes that are brutal and harsh but are true to the universe that The Godfather takes place in. The ending of The Godfather is easily one of the best endings in movie history and greatly sets up the events in Part II. A terrific ending.<br/><br/>The cast is flawless. Marlon Brando is excellent,iconic and at his very best in his Oscar winning role as Vito Corleone,with Brando being charismatic,powerful and sympathetic in the role. Masterful performance from Brando. Al Pacino is brilliant as Michael Corleone,with Pacino being intense,cool and captivating in the role and having great scenes with Brando. James Caan is amazing and fiery as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone,Michael's short tempered older brother. Roberl DuVall is terrific as Tom Hagan,the Corleone's adopted family member and lawyer. Diane Keaton is great as Kay Adams,Michael's girlfriend. Richard Castellano(Clemenza)and Abe Vigoda(Tessio)do wonderful jobs as Vito's Caporegimes. John Gazale(Fredo Corleone),Talia Shire(Connie Corleone),Al Lettieri(Sollozzo),Sterling Hayden(Capt. McCluskey),John Marley(Jack Woltz),Richard Conte(Don Barzini),Alex Rocco(Moe Greeneand Gianni Russo(Carlo)give riveting performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by Francis Coppola is brilliant and stylish,with Coppola always moving the camera and using great lighting and a visual look to the movie that makes The Godfather what it is. Masterful direction,Coppola.<br/><br/>The score by Nino Rota is amazing,beautiful,haunting and iconic matching the movie and every scene perfectly. Terrific score Rota.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster Films,Mob Movies,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see The Godfather,an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece that you will watch again,again and again and is film making at it's best. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"bobsgrock","10","6","10","17 November 2009"," A view from the other side of life.
","The mafia was always seen as evil, secretive and not interesting enough to be a story. Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia. But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best-seller to the big screen. He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo is one of the tightest and carefully constructed scripts of any movie. The film takes place completely within the world of the Corleone family, so we are never asked to hate these people nor sympathize with them. Yet we do, due to the countless scenes involving them eating, drinking, talking. There is a 30 minute wedding scene in the beginning that sets the mood and tone, showing how these people have taken advantage of the American dream. Now that we know them, we care for what happens to them despite the fact that they are evil.<br/><br/>The acting is so powerful, so effective that it is impossible to think anyone could have filled these roles instead. Al Pacino, who was hated by the producers but loved by Coppola, plays Michael very straight and emotionless. His blank stare says everything and nothing, but all along we see change and it is his change of heart and personality that is the most amazing development in the whole film. James Caan is perfect as the hot-headed Sonny, Robert Duvall perfect as the level-headed Tom Hagen, and of course Marlon Brando overtakes everyone as the aging patriarch, Don Vito Corleone. Brando is usually considered the greatest actor ever, and here he goes full length, portraying a man who has been in America most of his life and is growing weary of the direction in which business seems to be going.<br/><br/>The Godfather is one of the best films ever if only for the fact that it is able to suck you in completely to this world. It is long but never plods and always builds with every scene. Indeed, each early scene is somewhat of a set-up for something later. The actors all play it so straight and smooth, everything is completely convincing. And Gordon Willis' dark, moody photography adds to the drama, evoking hidden agendas and secrets. Nino Rota composed one of the most famous of all movie themes, and here it seems to tell us that life is going to get bad and we should have listened to Don Vito. This film put Coppola on the map and made him a director to reckon with. Just like the Corleones."
"Boba_Fett1138","10","6","10","4 October 2009"," THE crime epic of the 20th century.
","""The Godfather"" is a movie that tops many list as the greatest movie ever made. It also tops some list concerning the greatest and most memorable movie lines and the movie it's characters and performances from its actors have also received lots of acclaim throughout the years. And yes, the movie is truly deserving all of the praise that is receiving from everywhere and everyone.<br/><br/>Even though in my opinion part II is an even better movie, this is still the movie that began it all. Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even greater masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it.<br/><br/>The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening.<br/><br/>But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways. It's like an operatic drama about a large Italian mafia family, located in New York. The movie features really a lot of characters in it and therefore also some different plot lines and dramatic developments but the movie does an amazing job with its story and the diversity of it. It binds it all beautifully together and even though the movie does take some big leaps in time and gets located at different locations throughout the world, throughout the entire movie, the movie always keeps flowing very well with a real steady pace.<br/><br/>The family and basically all of the character have to go through some great ordeals. This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings.<br/><br/>In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions.<br/><br/>It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level. It features a still quite young Al Pacino in his break through role and the already more experienced and better known actors James Caan and James Caan, among many others, in important supporting roles. But it is of course Marlon Brando who gives the movie its most body. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters of all time and it was also basically this movie that made him immortal as an actor. The movie only won 3 Oscars but it's no big surprise that one of those 3 went to Brando, who himself of course refused to accept it and instead let faked Indian Sacheen Littlefeather pick it up, as a sign of protest against the treatment of native Americans. The other two Oscar's that the movie won were for best motion picture and best writing.<br/><br/>It deserved to win way more of course and the movie was also nominated for 7 more (not counting in the withdrawn nomination for best music). But one of the Oscar's the movie really deserved to win was for a category it wasn't even nominated in. I was surprised how great the cinematography of the movie was and it truly deserves some more credit. The movie often picks some long shots, in which it isn't always showing a lot. The movie often chooses to show a minimum of things and only chooses to show what the characters also see, so we get more close to the characters and their feelings and thoughts. Truly some effective cinematography throughout, though Francis Ford Coppola directing also needs to take lots of credit for that.<br/><br/>Simply THE crime epic of the 20th century.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"TheUnknown837-1","10","6","10","11 May 2009"," with its long, but taut running time, perfect casting, and all under the control of Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather"" easily scores as one of the best films ever made
","When it comes to naming the greatest and most influential motion pictures of all time, Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece ""The Godfather"" is a title that is practically guaranteed to be among the many listed. Famed director Stanley Kubrick called ""The Godfather"" a candidate for the best movie ever made and ""without a doubt, the best cast."" Although not very familiar with Kubrick's films and his tastes, I will say that on the second regard, he is absolutely correct.<br/><br/>Based on a very good, hard-to-put-down novel by Italian American novelist Mario Puzo, the film revolves around a fictional 1940s Sicilian crime family based in New York. The family is run by a wispy-voiced, puffy-cheeked man named Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who has, for the most part, moved away from the days of violence in favor of peace and prosperity without blood and above all things, lectures on the topics of friendship and loyalty. When an attempt is made on Vito's life, his two sons (James Caan, Al Pacino) and his adoptive son (Robert Duvall) take control of his dynasty and fight to keep him alive and what unfolds is a repeat of days gone by and the world of the Mafia is exposed to a spellbound, absorbed audience.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" is nearly three hours in length and part of this is due to the fact that it follows Mario Puzo's novel almost exactly detail-by-detail, scene-by-scene: a very rare thing in Hollywood, which always seems more than happy to alter and reshape the mold of the authors' visions for the big screen. Coppola's film will without a doubt satisfy the purists, and even to those who have not had the privilege of reading Puzo's fantastic book, this is still a more than enjoyable way to spend three hours. Even at such a length, ""The Godfather"" never fails to keep our eyes focused on the screen.<br/><br/>Number one, we have great characters in what is possibly the greatest cast ever assembled for a single movie. Marlon Brando was great; that was a given. But what really impressed the audiences of 1972, and what still impresses people, are the performances of the supporting cast. Names such as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan, who are at icon status today, were nobodies at the time. Al Pacino, in particular, gives a noteworthy performance that garnered him an Academy Award nomination and made the producers who initially wanted to ban him from the role feel like the biggest idiots on the face of the planet. Pacino is undoubtedly the most ironic character in the film. When we first see him, he's not even so much as a sliver of a Mafia-type image. He's passive, he's quiet, shy, with a clean record, and a war hero. Then, when he has to assume a Family role to defend his father, he slowly turns into the image of his predecessor and by the time the film ends, Pacino is the exact opposite of how we first saw him. Of course I can't leave out Diane Keaton as Pacino's love interest, who watches him change before her eyes, James Caan as the fiery-tempered brother, Robert Duvall as the Family consiligere, and one of my favorites, Al Lettieri as the villainous, steely-eyed Virgil Sollozzo, who fits the exact image of how I pictured the character while reading the novel.<br/><br/>Second, there is the fantastic element that the whole realm of the story takes place in the world of the Mafia. There is none of the tired old elements of, shall we say, detectives trying to uncover the Mafia and take them down or civilians who become victims of the organized crime families. With this method, we successfully connect with and understand the motivations of the characters while the outside world, law and otherwise, simply lies in the background. The outside world meant little to the Mafia, and thus it means little to us as well.<br/><br/>But of course, ""The Godfather"" does not glorify the Mafia. Yes, we do identify and sometimes feel for the characters in this savage world, but never do we justify for them. And when director Francis Ford Coppola tries to give us horrifying violence, he delivers. As he noted in his commentary on the film, Coppola worked hard with his pyrotechnics crew to make all of the shootings and killings in ""The Godfather"" look real as opposed to making them obvious simulations. He uses blood, but not so much to the point where it becomes over the top, but just enough to make it convincing and disgusting.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" was an enormous hit when it was first released. It garnered there Academy Award wins included Best Picture of the Year and broke box office records that would not be topped until ""Jaws"" (1975) was released three years later. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all secured nominations in the Best Supporting Actor category but surprisingly none of them won. It also spawned two successful sequels, one of which I feel is actually superior to the original. And now Francis Ford Coppola has worked with Robert A. Harris to restore his famous trilogy and give it the pristine print that he always wanted audiences to see it in. Among other films such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962), ""Vertigo"" (1958), and ""Spartacus"" (1960), ""The Godfather"" is certainly a film that deserves a beautiful restoration so that it may linger in our collective minds for generations to come."
"ackstasis","10","6","10","6 March 2009"," ""I believe in America""
","'The Godfather (1972)' doesn't need an introduction, nor does it necessarily require a review. Nevertheless, I'm going to go on telling you what you already know: this is one of the great American films of the twentieth century. The 1970s was a landmark decade for Hollywood film-making, and Francis Ford Coppola was particularly productive, releasing the first two 'Godfather' films (1972 - 1974), 'The Conversation (1974)' and, perhaps his magnum opus, 'Apocalypse Now (1979).' This week I was fortunate enough to experience a cinema screening of 'The Godfather,' and this second viewing only inflated my respect for Coppola's achievement. On my initial viewing in 2006, I had been very impressed with the film, but also hopelessly lost for the most part. With literally dozens of speaking roles, and frequent allusions to otherwise unseen characters, the plot had left me stranded, just as 'The Big Sleep (1946)' always manages to do. Suddenly, however, much of it became clear to me; the characters' motivations, deceptions and emotions gently drifted into focus. This was stunning, complex cinema, the sort of bold film-making that puts most modern movies to shame.<br/><br/>A notable artistic observation regarding 'The Godfather' is that Coppola's film-making style is strictly traditional. Whereas a new generation of filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin were introducing a gritty new cinema aesthetic, Gordon Willis' cinematography is graceful, understated and handsome, predating his excellent work for Woody Allen {the most notable example being 'Manhattan (1979)'}. A sprawling family saga, 'The Godfather' boasts a staggering ensemble cast of emerging and established actors, as well as many unknowns who nevertheless give letter-perfect performances. The scenes of violence are typically abrupt and effective, but much of the film's running-time is more closely concerned with dialogue and human interaction, particularly among family members. Needless to say, the quality of talent is more than enough to make these scenes, not only watchable, but astonishingly compelling. Every character down to the smallest speaking part  and there are a lot of them  has such a richly fleshed-out personality, making their actions and development throughout the film both authentic and interesting.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando  in what, along with 'Last Tango in Paris (1972),' was deemed a grand comeback  gives a towering, Oscar-winning portrayal as Don Vito Corleone, the aging head of an Italian organised-crime family. Having endured decades of corruption and inter-family conflict, and seeing his household disintegrate in the futile pursuit of family honour, Vito finally understands in his final moments the folly of his wasted life, and the fateful mistakes that led to this undesirable lifestyle {these precursor years would be explored in greater depth, with Robert DeNiro in the role, in 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'}. Most central to the story, however, is the transformation of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who, in the course of the film, effectively sells his soul to retain that elusive ""family honour."" The climactic sequence, utilising Eisenstein's style of montage to its fullest extent, intercuts the baptism of Michael's nephew with the simultaneous assassination of the Corleone family's enemies. This scene also serves as a baptism of sorts for Michael, symbolising his irreversible initiation into a life of crime, and the final transaction of his soul."

","There might be many movies made since the inception of cinema and trust me wen i say that I have seen superb cinema of many ages and of many genres but never have I come across a movie like the Godfather. It just is the perfect synonym for cinema which can change your life.It is no secret that The Godfather has impacted so many moviegoers and made them into successful film makers or at least aspiring film makers. There are so many things which can be written about the genius of the Godfather.But the most striking thing which has to be mentioned is the perfect transition of the book onto screen.The book has been adapted so well that the movie seems better than the book in some frames.Mario Puzo and Coppola have collaborated so well that its a product of genius. Now we have heard a lot about the casting,but what can i say.I feel I am nothing to speak about the acting prowess of Marlon Brando.I have never come across a performance so spell binding with an amazing screen presence.Brando was Don Corleone will remain etched in every body's mind as the perfect man for the role. Al Pacino was simply sensational.The way he portrayed his emotions are a joy to watch on screen.His acting to me has to shown to every aspiring actor because its such a powerful act which just refuses to fade away from your memory.The supporting cast of Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and James Cann as Sonny are exemplary. The back ground score and cinematography is of the highest class. And the dialogues are just extra ordinary.For example dialogues such as, i will make him an offer he cant refuse.I will reason with him are just so powerful but yet so subtle. Mafia was never so stylish nor powerful.It is a movie to watch for every film connoisseur because until one does not watch the God father he cannot know or cant fantasize A PERFECT MOVIE. a work of absolute Genius.I believe everybody associated with the movie is so god damn proud of himself for having his name attached to it. and I am proud of being a FANATIC of the Godfather."

","The Godfather tells us the tale of a Mafia family and their struggles to keep up with the changing times, and at the same time to value their own morals about family and friendship.<br/><br/>This is an excellent movie, the cast ensemble is perfect and the subtle characterization of Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino is beyond recognition. Marlon Brando kicks up a great acting as the Godfather and at the same time a family man. Talia Shire is, as always, quite overacting, nevertheless that quality proved to be effective in this film.<br/><br/>The story is unique in every aspect and convincing to the last scene. The irony presented within every climactic event in the story will put you in the edge of your seats and think ""How the heck did they come up to this idea?"" The way the twists are presented subtly, the absence of unessential brutality (which is present in almost every crime films these days), the hidden message of the story, the tragedy, the drama, the flawless direction, and most of all the realistic storyline that makes us infinitely more aware of the life experienced by a family whose business is crime-oriented. A very disturbing yet wonderful experience to watch this film.<br/><br/>This is really one of the greatest ever made by the movie industry.

","Don Vito Corleone is the mightiest Mafia boss of New York. He has contacts to the most esteemed politicians and achieves everything he gets into his head. This changes when a drug dealer asks him to join the drug traffic. Vito declines this offer, because he (ironically) considers this ""line of business"" to be a crime. Thereon the drug dealers' men assault Vito and he nearly loses his life. His sons Sonny and Michael thereupon start a campaign of vengeance against the drug dealer and the other dons of New York.<br/><br/>With high expectations I began to watch the film, due to the fact that it is the highest rated movie of the IMDb and regarded as one of the best films all-time.<br/><br/>In the first half hour there are comparatively few spectacular events, but ""The Godfather"" manages it to tie the viewer, conveying the atmosphere very well. So the movie never becomes boring. The interaction of the Mafiosi, their language and methods are amazingly enthralling. Also the setting (amongst others the film takes place in Sicily) and the film music are outstanding.<br/><br/>The main characters are presented very well: The mighty Godfather, who has moralities and takes care of his family despite his racketeering, and on the other hand the ""good boy"" of the family, who is impelled to dirty his hands and become an unscrupulous, ice cold gangster by the assault on his father.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola's film becomes a true masterpiece by the performance of the two leading actors, Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) and Al Pacino (Michael Corleone). Their facial expressions and gestures are just unparalleled and don't lay you to rest.<br/><br/>The film won prizes in series (Oscars, Golden Globes)  that's absolutely merited: Everyone should watch this film at least one time; it is a very prestigious film, above all amongst men it is popular, and it has a very high cultic-factor."
"SnorrSm1989","10","6","10","5 October 2006"," Hard to refuse
","It could be said that the film-adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel marked the beginning of a new era, as it established talents hitherto unknown to the wider public, including Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and director Francis Ford Coppola. Furthermore, THE GODFATHER is often thought of as a ""comeback"" to Marlon Brando, which apparently puzzled the actor himself, as he pointed out in his autobiography that he'd been doing movies without considerable intermission for the last twenty-or-so years. However, the claim may not have been so unreasonable after all, as the role of Vito Corleone made Brando truly sought-after again. By the time Brando embarked on the role, no major studios would hire him due to a reputation for being ""impossible"" to work with, and Coppola was only able to convince Paramount that the actor was simply tailor-made for the part and could not be neglected by having him do a screen-test first. Considering that Brando had once revolutionized acting in America through his raw, unmasked portrayals of Stanley Kowalski and Terry Malloy in the 1950's, this procedure may sound shocking, but once accomplished, Brando proved that he remained the king of acting in the end. His portrayal of Corleone may strike us as being somewhat of a caricature today, as it has been endlessly imitated (and parodied) since, but Brando did in fact attribute the character with far more attention to complex detail than seen in a typical movie ""gangster-boss"" up till that time. That Brando's performance has now, in the eyes of younger generations such as my own, turned somewhat into a cliché is simply the inevitable result of his initial originality.<br/><br/>Also Pacino, Keaton, James Caan and Robert Duvall are, of course, quite outstanding in their roles. Particularly in Pacino's case, his handling of his character Michael Corleone's dramatic development as a person which is so crucial to the story, comes off as completely convincing. From being apparently a rather sympathetic character at the beginning, he changes as he becomes increasingly involved in his father's business life. It is this devoted focus on character development, as well as on how conflicting aspects of a personality interchange such as in Vito Corleone's case, that truly make the story so intriguing as it is. However, it is one thing to have a story of nearly endless potential, but this does not necessarily result in a successful cinematic interpretation of it. Other than outstanding performances, the direction of Francis Ford Coppolla is, of course, more than merely significant; even if one neglects the other qualities of the film, it may be treasured for its own sake, due to Coppolla's extremely competent, innovative techniques. There seems to be too many scenes and moments to pick out just one or two favorites; his ability to define the mood and atmosphere of a particular event through a painstaking attention to every single detail, is arguably of equal impact to the story as the performances of the actors, and make the film a visual delight. This is no less impressive when considering that THE GODFATHER was Coppolla's first major film; he was to establish himself further into the decade with other brilliant films such as THE CONVERSATION, APOCALYPSE NOW and this film's second act.<br/><br/>When released in 1972, THE GODFATHER turned out to be, not surprisingly, one of the most widely-seen, lavishly- praised films in the history of the medium, and earned three Academy Awards out of eleven nominations (Marlon Brando's refusal to accept the award, due to the ""treatment of American Indians today by the film industry,"" has become famous in its own right). This is not to say, however, that THE GODFATHER is a film one is likely to grasp at first viewing; I, for one, did not quite understand its incredible reputation at first (though I did think it was a good film). Much as with CITIZEN KANE or BLADERUNNER, it is probably required to view THE GODFATHER through an historical context, and compare it to other films made around the same time, to get why it is so much adored. It helps matters that it's not only brilliantly made but really entertaining as well, so you're likely to have a good time no matter how you watch it."

","The Godfather is Franis Ford Coppolla's best work (next to Apocalypse Now) and is one of the best films I have ever seen.

The Acting (among many other things) highlight this film-noir/gangster/epic including Marlon Brando in his most recognizable performance ever as the man himself, Don Corleone, but also subtle work from breakthrough star Al Pacino and others like James Caan, Robert Duvall, and great bit parts for wonderful character actors like John Marley and Sterling Hayden.<br/><br/>Corleone gets wounded and, by default through various 'circumstances' in the family (not least of which his ailing health) hands his ""business"" over to his ambivalent but cunning son, Michael (in a well done performance by Al Pacino). The film goes on long, but after watching it a few times, you hardly notice it at all. Every time ones watches this film it gets better because of noticing something small, something wildly creative, one didn't notice the last time and thanks to that it gets richer every time. With a beautiful score, terrific cinematography, and sublime directing and writing by Coppolla (with Puzo) this film belongs not only a place in film history, but in world history as well."

","he Godfather (1972) did for gangster movies what 2001: A Space Odyssey did for science fiction. Like Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola re-energized and, to a degree, reinvented a basic Hollywood pulp fiction action-entertainment genre, using it as a vehicle for the high artistic ambitions of a post-New Wave film ""auteur."" <br/><br/>Within his narrower focus on 20th century American civilization (as opposed to Kubrick's philosophical speculations on human evolution), Coppola shapes the story of the Corleone Mafia family into an epic/satiric vision of American business, government, justice, and moral decline. The Godfather's brilliantly constructed opening sequence, the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter, not only establishes the Don's character, the nature of his organization, the role of family and Sicilian tradition in his world, and the character of his sons (three natural and one adopted), but also establishes the relationship between the Don's world and ""legitimate"" society. For instance, the film's opening words are those of Bonasera, a petitioner for a wedding ""favor,"" whose voice over a dark screen first asserts the American Dream, ""I believe in America. America has made my fortune,"" and then turns to disillusioned contradiction: ""for justice, we must go to Don Corleone.""<br/><br/>Numerous subsequent lines of dialog establish literal or metaphorical connections between the criminal underworld and social institutions. Some of the most memorable ones include: ""My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator.""""Now we have the unions, we have the gambling; and they're the best things to have. But narcotics is a thing of the future. And if we don't get a piece of that action, we risk everything we have. I mean not now, but ten years from now."" ""It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business."" And most famously of all: ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" <br/><br/>The film's title refers to two godfathers, the original Don Corleone and his youngest son - and ultimate successor - Michael. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Corleone, for which he was awarded a Best Actor Academy Award, balances the Don's subtly counter-pointed functions as beloved, grandfatherly patriarch and fearsome, brutal crime boss. Yet Michael, as the character most centrally and significantly affected by the film's plot and played with a brilliance equaling Brando's by a then unknown Al Pacino, is the principal protagonist.<br/><br/>At the wedding, Michael's centrality is signaled by the Don's frantic call, ""Where's Michael? We are not taking the picture without Michael!"" A World War II hero still in decorated uniform, Michael is meanwhile busy differentiating himself from his family to his girl friend and future second wife, Kay (Diane Keaton). ""Luca Brasi held a gun to the band leader's head,"" he relates, ""and my father assured him that either his signature or his brains would be on the release. That's my family Kay. It's not me."" Michael's initial disinterest in Mafia activities is reinforced by his adoring father who envisions him as ""Senator Corleone"" or ""Governor Corleone"" not as his successor. That role is reserved for his hot-headed eldest son, Sonny (James Caan). But, of course, events conspire to suck Michael in - and to keep sucking him in right through Godfather III - the assassination attempt on his father, Michael's coolly murderous response, the car bomb meant for him that kills his first wife, the Sicilian beauty Apollonia (aptly named for the god of sun light), the riddled body of his brother Sonny. Inevitably, a morally darkened Michael emerges at the end of the film, one who outdoes his father in guile and ruthlessness and whose final brutal and deceitful acts in Godfather I seal his doom as a Macbeth-like villainous tragic hero.<br/><br/>Shot mainly on location in various New York City locales, The Godfather spans a ten- year post World War II period. A multitude of props, costumes, and pop culture artifacts arranged by the film's art director, Warren Clyner, and production designer, Dean Tavoularis, lend a rich sense of historical authenticity to the film's mise en scene. Moreover, the film's lighting by brilliant cinematographer Gordon (""prince of darkness"") Willis, contributes greatly to both the film's realism and its thematic symbolism. Compare, for instance, the use of extremely dark, shadowy, color desaturated interior scenes – especially in the Don's home office – with the brightly lit, vivaciously colored outdoor wedding scene or the sun-drenched, romanticized Sicilian landscape.<br/><br/>The Godfather is edited in the classic Hollywood invisible style, subordinating technique to the needs of narrative and visual continuity. But the film is expertly edited nonetheless. In particular one might note the stunning use of multiple parallel editing that occurs in one of the film's last scenes: the assassination of the other crime family heads, elaborately planned to coincide with Michael's participation in the baptism of sister Connie's child. Likewise, The Godfather's soundtrack is a memorable combination of diegetic period music (""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"") and a lush, operatic original score composed by one of the greatest film music composers, Nino Rota (a frequent Fellini collaborator as in 8 1/2).<br/><br/>With The Godfather and its even more ambitious sequel, Coppola pushed the classic gangster film in the direction of high art and released it once and for all from the moralistic grip of the Hays Code, which arose in the 1930s in large part as a response to the romanticizing of criminals found in such early examples of the gangster genre as Scarface, Little Cesar, and Public Enemy. Not only did the code regulate the degree and nature of sexual and violent imagery in all films, but it also specifically required that criminals be portrayed as morally repulsive social deviants and that plots involving them be resolved with the implicit or explicit lesson that ""crime did not pay."" Fortunately for American popular culture The Godfather radically rewrote the rulebook and paved the way for a generation's-worth of gangster masterpieces ranging from the Scarface remake to Pulp Fiction to The Sopranos."
"gerardfarre","10","5","8","11 October 2015"," Simply amazing
","This has to be a masterpiece for me and for my understanding and knowledge. I adore mob films like this one and TV series about the mob as the great TV series I've ever watched: The Sopranos. The shooting of the whole film is sublime, and the shots of the two sequels as well. Coppola got to manage this as a master of film composing. The plot and the development in general is majestic too. The scene of the head horse in the film director's bed is very shocking; I never saw something like that. Now I can only say that this has become one of my favorites films ever (for me and for most of you who are reading this). This is the sort of films that I would watch for many times."

","I love this movie. It's the greatest movie I ever seen in my life. Every time I watch it I see something new. It has drama, action and even comedy. The story is great. It centers around the most powerful New York mafia run by The Godfather. It teaches you about family and betrayal, about life in general. All that Michael does is for his family. He even sacrifices his relationship with his girlfriend to protect his family. The movie is amazingly shot, giving it amazing light. The characters are bigger than life and played by some of the greatest actors to ever live. The soundtrack is very good. All in all is must see."
"MovieAlien","1","69","188","16 February 2002"," MAJOR difference in opinion...
","I finally got a chance to see this movie. I tried to watch it with an open mind, without letting the hype dilute an even slight bit of impartiality - and I just can't say it's a very good movie. Perchance if soap opera was its own category, this may stand true to its title as ""#1"" on the IMDb.<br/><br/>   It perplexes me how people can call this landmark moviemaking when they probably have not seen works from other directors - Kurosawa, Truffaut, Lang... - all of whom had a much better eye than Coppolla. Most of these greats are now forgotten, with the exceptions of occasional screenings at film schools where one discovers that the Contemporary filmmaking style overseas  (1950s and 1960s)  was duplicated by American directors in the 1970s. <br/><br/> So what was wrong with this movie? Nonexistent or loose plot: No suspense, climax, excitement, or outcome. I thought the acting/characters were forgettable. Any other actor could have pulled off what Brando did and the fact they went through all that trouble to make him 10 or 20 year older just proves they shot for name recognition. <br/><br/> There were only a few things that I remember in this 3 hours of triviality: the ""offer you can't refuse"" line, Don Vito collapsing in a garden while a child obliviously plays, Caan's Santino character getting holed up, and bullets consistently going into foreheads. Maybe the artful yet repellent depiction of gratuitous violence is what made this such a masterpiece. But style without substance does not a good movie make.<br/><br/> For those who say ""oh, you just didn't get it, see it again"", please get your mind out of the gutter - stop basing your opinions on what you're conditioned to like. <br/><br/>The Emperor's New Clothes, big time. End of review."
"Azzurrim17","10","8","15","13 August 2008"," Perfect
","First I would like to state that I am 20 years old this movie was made 16 years after I was born, but it is my favorite movie of all time. I really get annoyed when I hear this nonsense about young people can't judge movies because they haven't seen all the classics, well I have seen them all , Casablanca, Citizen Kane, On the Waterfront, North by Northwest and so on. I own all three of these movies, and the original is the best, 2 is very close to the original and 3 is decent. I also hate these people who judge this movie poorly because its all about Italians its pathetic I read so many comments here and everywhere that the sole basis of a poor rating is it being about Italians its a joke, Like in on the waterfront when Marlon Brando's character, transitions from a goon for organized crime to at the end of the film a changed man who wants to be a better man, Michael Corleone's character I feel is the greatest transformation in all of film history, he changes from this nice quiet military, war hero, good citizen, to a dark, ruthless, emotionless character, which he really has to do the collapse of his family. That alone i think makes this movie great, not to forget how great Marlon Brando is in this along with James Caan and Robert Duvall. This movie broke a lot of barriers in film, starting a lot of trends and setting standards for so many other mafia movies, like Goodfellas, and the Departed etc... I really think that if you have never seen it you should invest some time because you will not be disappointed."

Other than the exclusion of some parts that aren't focus on the main characters this is an extremely close adaptation of the novel( word for word in many sense epically near the begging of the movie).

"Prismark10","10","3","4","14 October 2019"," The Godfather
","Francis Ford Coppola got Mario Puzo's pulpy novel and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece with Puzo as co-scriptwriter. Robert McKee famous for his seminars on script writing offers Casablanca as the perfect film. He deconstructs the script and movie in his seminars. He is wrong. The Godfather is as perfect as a movie you can get.<br/><br/>When Paramount Pictures gave the movie a greenlight. The mafia families were concerned that it would lift the lid on how they operated and shine an unwelcome spotlight on the crime bosses. There were attempts to stop the movie being made. They had nothing to worry about, when the movie came out the mob bosses realized that no amount of money could buy the public relations they got from the film.<br/><br/>Instead of murderous gangsters. The Godfather portrays the mafia as men of honour, family men who value loyalty and live by a code. Violence would only be used as a last resort. It is because we never see the outside victims of these people. The story is set within gangsters and their families and associates.<br/><br/>The film opens with an epic wedding sequence set after the war. On the day of his daughter's wedding Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) cannot refuse a request made of him. His godson Johnny Fontane drops by to sing at the wedding and requests Don Vito's help to secure a part in a movie that would secure his comeback. His informally adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is sent to Hollywood to persuade the film producer and when he refuses, the producer wakes up in bed with the head of his prized horse.<br/><br/>Don Vito Corleone is a criminal, the head of the five families. He is also the moral centre of this movie. He is wise, he can be kind but he is also ageing and his values are of a world that is disappearing. Don Vito's reluctance to enter the drugs trade would be his undoing.<br/><br/>The Godfather is really the story of youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino.) The war hero who wanted to have nothing to do with the family business but is pulled in first when his father is shot and then when a further attempt is made on his life in the hospital. After the death of his hot headed brother Sonny Corleone (James Caan.) Michael is groomed by Don Vito to become the head of the family. After his father's death, Michael plans revenge on those who betrayed his family and the rival families.<br/><br/>In his first scenes at the family wedding, Michael explains to his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) the various heavies hanging around and some of the things his father did to pull favours. Michael is an outsider in his own family as he tells Kay that he is not like them. As the film progresses Michael becomes exactly like them.<br/><br/>The Godfather has terrific performances. Marlon Brando won his second Best Actor Oscar and rejuvenated his career. On the other hand Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan were all nominated for the best supporting actor Oscars and cancelled each other out. The film won three Oscars including Best Picture. The big winner that year was actually Cabaret with eight Oscar wins including Best Director.<br/><br/>So much of The Godfather has been emulated since. Michael Cimino was so enamoured by the movie, he opens The Deer Hunter with an epic wedding sequence to set up his story. He also cast Robert De Niro and John Cazale, two actors who appeared in The Godfather films. On the other hand Coppola would later cast John Savage who plays an important role in The Deer Hunter in The Godfather III in 1990.<br/><br/>Then there is the climax. The christening scenes where Michael Corleone renounces the devil and all his work which is intercut with his various henchmen killing the Corleone's rivals. A trick Coppola has used in his other movies."
"gandalf_theWise14","10","3","4","15 August 2019"," One of the greatest, most iconic cinematic achievements of all time
","Where do you even start with a film like this? There are so many layers to The Godfather, so many little intricacies among the plot, that it is simply impossible to fully analyze this film in one review. With this in mind, I'm just going to give some of my thoughts on the film here.<br/><br/>The Godfather does not really have one focused plot line that you can point to. It really just focuses on the inner dealings of the Corleone crime family. There are many things going on, but at its core, it is a film about this family. Through this, though, there are a few stories told. We see the fall of the once immensely powerful Don Vito Corleone, and then, as it would appear at the end of the film, the eventual rise of the family again under its new leader. We see the transformation of Michael, the Don's youngest son, throughout the movie, as he goes from the young man that wanted nothing to do with his family's illegal business to the man in charge of the whole thing. We also witness the terrible and bloody gang war that the Corleone family becomes deeply involved in. Ultimately, The Godfather tells an incredible story, or multiple connected stories, revolving around the Corleone family, as we learn about the inner dealings of this crime organization along the way. From the opening scene, I was completely pulled into the story of this family, and didn't return to reality until the end credits started rolling. It was truly an intriguing and fascinating tale that I couldn't get enough of.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most interesting part of the film was the story of Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino. His eventual rise through the ranks to the new head of the Corleone crime family is so intriguing because of his transformation as a person that was required to make this happen. He becomes more and more morally corrupt as the film goes on, until at the end he becomes the cold-hearted, ruthless leader of the crime family. The film does an excellent job of illustrating what you have to become to rise to the top in a business like this, and shows how these leaders end up having to lose a bit of their humanity to be able to do the things that are necessary to keep their power.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola's masterful direction is one of the main factors that made this film as iconic as it is. The overall mood of each scene is done perfectly; nothing ever feels out of place, everything always feels like it was done exactly as it should be. In fact, I can't really think of anything at all that should have been done different. The one thing throughout the whole film that was messed up slightly was when Sonny was beating up Carlo in the street. You see one punch that clearly was way off, yet Carlo still reacts as if he were hit. It's a very minor detail that can be missed quite easily, but it pulls you out of the film for a moment. Once you get a visual reminder that these are all actors on the screen, it can throw you off just a bit for the rest of the movie and taint your enjoyment of it. Of course, this didn't happen as everything else was done to perfection, so nothing really bad came of this one minor hiccup. The film is still a masterpiece, and a few seconds of confusion won't ruin that.<br/><br/>The iconic cinematography of this film is also such a key part of it. The low-lighting used in many of the scenes captures the mood of so many of the moments, especially in the first sequence of the film. Vito Corleone's daughter is having a wedding outside, and the sun is shining and everyone is dancing and happy. Then, throughout the wedding, the scene will switch to inside, where Vito will be talking business with someone. In these moments, the background is so dark we can barely see the characters. This important feature draws attention to how dark and shady the family business is, in contrast to the overall upbeat and hopeful tone of the wedding. There are many more instances quite like this in the film, but I am not going to point them all out, as, like I said, it is impossible to talk about all of the details of this film in one review. In short, the cinematography and use of lighting are used to perfection to help the viewer derive the mood of the situation from scene to scene.<br/><br/>The score of this film is just as iconic as everything else about it. The music is fittingly dark and used to appropriately set the mood at the right times. It is perhaps one of the best scores ever composed for a film; if not, it is certainly one of the most iconic.<br/><br/>The movies epic 175 minute runtime does not feel excessive or unnecessary like some 3-hour films can. Instead, it feels just right for the story it is telling, and somehow manages to never overstay its welcome. The lengthy runtime feels completely justified due to the overall nature of a film like this, and there is really nothing I can think of that could be taken out without negatively affecting the final product.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is absolutely outstanding. It's stunning how great the cast is at times. Some of the most interesting characters ever created were brought to life by these incredible performances.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando is on a whole different level is this film. There are so many times you can't even believe he's acting. His iconic voice and line delivery has created some of the most iconic and recognizable quotes ever. The performance he gives is chillingly effective and almost frightening, and fittingly so. It is simply one of the best displays of acting I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is also outstanding in this film. I believe he had the most screen time in the movie (despite his best supporting actor nomination), and he does a great job of living up to that. It is really his first iconic role, and it ended up becoming perhaps his most iconic role. Perhaps he doesn't outperform Brando, but he certainly does as good as anyone possibly could at living up to the standard that Brando sets from the opening scene.<br/><br/>James Caan and Robert Duvall do not disappoint either, giving strong performances to back up Brando and Pacino. In fact, there is not a single member of the cast who I think underperforms. At the very least, everyone did their job well, with many going above and beyond to make this movie the incredible achievement that it is.<br/><br/>And then there's the big question: does this film stand the test of time? The answer is yes. The Godfather is a timeless classic that I really don't see ever falling off. Many of the themes are still relevant today, and even without that, it is worth watching simply for the incredible cinematic achievement that it is, and the filmmaking lessons that can be learned from it.<br/><br/>The Godfather is, in short, an epic masterpiece of a film. The direction, story, acting, cinematography, music; all are outstanding and iconic, and they all come together to make this incredible, nearly flawless movie. This review really only scratches the surface of all this movie has to offer, as there is just so much under the surface to be uncovered through deep analysis of this film. Because of this, I would recommend multiple viewings of the film to ensure you are getting the full experience and not missing anything. I know that I will certainly be watching this many more times in the years to come. It is almost undoubtedly one of the best films ever made, and one that everyone has to see at least once in their lives."

Every character is given time to develop and leave his/her mark on the movie.<br/><br/>It starts with Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando) heading the Corleone crime family. Even though it doesn't deal in vices like prostitution and gambling, the Corleone family is the biggest and the strongest crime family in New York! It is made up of family and loyal friends of Don Vito- like the terrifying Luca, the muscle-maker Clemenza, the smart tactician Tessio, an adopted German-Irish son Tom and the hot-headed eldest blood of Vito Sonny among the others.<br/><br/>The Don hears various requests from his troubled friends and uses his contacts in order to help them out, asking for nothing but loyalty and friendship in return.<br/><br/>This calm boat is however rocked by heavy waters when the Turk Virgil Sollozo meets Don Vito Corleone to ask for protection and finance for his narcotics business. Don Corleone refuses. However during the meeting, Sonny shoots off his mouth and shows that he is interested in the deal. And that starts unfolding of a spiral of events.<br/><br/>Vito is shot. Sonny is killed. Fredo, the second son of Don Vito, is sent away to Vegas under protection. Michael Corleone, the reluctant outside, who has led his life they he wanted, away from his father's influence takes over the family reins from his ailing father.<br/><br/>Then transcripts a story of Michael from a family outsider to a ruthless Mafia boss.<br/><br/>After Vito dies, Michael arranges to assassinate Tessio who's turned a traitor, Moe Green- who was a block in Michael's path to buying the entire stake in a Las Vegas Hotel, and the heads of the other families- Stracci, Cuneo, Barzini and Tattaglia! Michael cleverly gets his brother-in-law Carlo Rizzi assassinated who was responsible for Sonny's murder.<br/><br/>With all the other heads of the Five New York Families dead, Michael Corleone becomes the undisputed leader of the Underworld in New York. In the final scene, he is surrounded by his loyalists- Rocco Lampone, Al Neri and the good old Clemenza who refers to Michael as ""Don Corleone"" before the scene blacks out!<br/><br/>Unlike the Mafia films back then, The Godfather portrayed the Underworld as a response to the corrupt politicians rather than goons with guns and money!<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, it still remains the greatest Masterpiece in World Cinema even today after more than 47 years and will continue to remain so for centuries to come!<br/><br/>""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse!"""

Is it the detailed direction by the master Coppola that not only takes you through the character's journey or the timeline but also helps you unravel deep rooted mysteries of the human psyche.
Is it the alluring cinematography by Gordon Willis that makes every frame in the movie look like the most fascinating visual a human eye can ever stand witness to.
Or is it the Masterclass in Acting given by a Brando as the iconic DON Vito Corleone & furthermore an even better performance by Al Pacino in not only the best role of his acting career, but also the most iconic character ever created on celluloid as Michael Corleone.
I guess this is the problem with this film, that all the creative geniuses in the field of Arts & Entertainment got their A game on & filled it with so much of class, passion, performance & excellence, that the film did not have an option but to be the best film in the world of cinema."
"gpeevers","10","3","4","1 April 2019"," Incredible Film-making
","The story of a Mafia family it's about honor and loyalty but it's also a story of crime, it both espouses and perverts the American dream. The film has so many iconic scenes that stand out in the memory, even when years pass between viewings. The film was based upon the best selling novel by Mario Puzo.<br/><br/>The film has an amazing cast who bring to life memorable and well rounded characters to earn our sympathy, despite some of the deeds they perpetrate. While Marlon Brando would receive the accolades and the Academy Award, we also have Oscar nominated performances from James Caan, Robert Duvall and Al Pacino. Also of note is John Cazale (he appeared in only 6 films before his untimely death, all of them were nominated for Best Picture). Not to be forgotten are; Sterling Hayden, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda and Talia Shire. The cast between them have thus far won 5 Oscars wins and been nominated for another 22.<br/><br/>We have the incredible score of Nino Rota remains one of the most evocative scores in film, and it is a tribute to the composer and the film that just a few notes can conjure such images almost 50 years later.<br/><br/>We also have the wonderful cinematography of Gordon Willis who created such powerful images, at times very warm while at other times so very dark.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that the film does paint a somewhat romanticized portrait of a mafia family but it's not just a film about crime it's about family. The film was followed up shortly by a very good sequel (Godfather II) that maintained the high standards of its predecessor even to the extent of achieving the Academy Award for Best Picture, but for me it wasn't quite as compelling. These films were followed by a less memorable sequel (Godfather III) 16 years later that while earning 7 Oscar nominations itself, mostly served as a reminder of how much less powerful it was than its predecessors."

"Amyth47","10","4","6","1 October 2018"," ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER.
","My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠<br/><br/>'The Godfather' is a masterpiece, a perfect gangster movie. A film without flaws, blunders and cliches, which pulls me to writing a review and it feels like I know it completely by heart having seen it a million times now. This is a classic, a gangster epic and a bible for cinephiles. A worthy picture, without exaggeration, the best of it's kind.<br/><br/>Adapted from Mario Puzo's best-selling Mafia saga, 'The Godfather' is a serious dramatic masterpiece directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It is genuinely a top-notch film which depicts the blood, sweat and drama of the Corleone Mafia family.<br/><br/>The film is a long (running time of 2 hours 55 minutes) and leisurely apotheosis of the Corleone family which marvellously builds up a rich pattern of relationships, meticulously detailing the rituals of an enclosed group. The tone of the film is laudatory and romantic and the extraordinary chiaroscuro of the cinematography completely steals my heart.<br/><br/>'The Godfather' contains famous unforgettable scenes such as the opening wedding celebration, a severed horse's head left in an enemy's bed and the cold-blooded killing happening simultaneously with a baby's baptism. However, my favourite scene in the movie is the one wherein Michael Corleone's new bride dies in a car bomb-blast.<br/><br/>Coppola not only superbly created the film, but brilliantly chose his actors. Who knows what the fate of the film would have been without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Marlon Brando is outstanding. His cotton-stuffed cheeks and an almost inaudible whisper perfectly define the style of a reigning Head of Mafia. His presence brings energy to the screen. This was definitely Brando's best ever performance which won him an Oscar which he infamously refused. Yes, the man who made offers others couldn't refuse once refused the movie industry's heftiest honour. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is no less interesting than his father. Michael is kind-hearted and truthful, knowing what his father does, he never wanted to deal in his family's business and participate in criminal quarrels. Al Pacino played his character no less brilliantly than Marlon Brando. Pacino showed the destruction and the transformation of his character: from the uninitiated in the affairs of the family being the young war hero, to the new Don of the Corleone family, possessing an iron will, foresight, wisdom and dignity.<br/><br/>For all its cold-bloodedness, the film is most powerful in conveying the codes of loyalty, love, masculine honour and feminine subservience, enterprise and corporate self-interests in a crime-ridden America. In addition to the brilliant acting and excellent production of the film, there is the wonderful music score of the composer Nino Rota.

","""The Godfather"" is about the Corleones - an organized crime family better known as the mob or mafia - that tells a great story of succession of the leadership of the crime family from an aging Don Vito Corleone to his reluctant and youngest son,Michael Corleone.<br/><br/>This film directed by Francis Ford Coppola that was based on the novel of Mario Puzo stars legendary actor Marlon Brando and Al Pacino,an up-and-coming young actor back then who just happened to appear on his only second major film role.The cast also includes talented actors and actresses such as James Caan, Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton,John Cazale and Talia Shire.<br/><br/>The story starts during the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter Connie.In it,we get meet the members of the Corleone family such Don Vito's oldest son Sonny and his adopted son as well as the consigliere Tom Hagen together with the different henchmen like Tessio and Clemenza as well as different people who are obtaining favors from Don Vito who is also known as the godfather.Then,we get to meet Michael and his girlfriend Kay.It was evident that Michael has no intentions of joining his father's business.But several events happen such as Don Vito getting shot,Sonny getting killed and the other rival members of the Five Families trying to overthrow the Corleones power and influence as Don Vito does not want to be part of the illegal drugs trade.Then,it became clear that the only son who should replace Don Vito,who is getting older and weaker as he approaching near his death,as the leader of the family is reluctant Michael.After Don Vito died,Michael made moves to retain the family's power and influence by killing the leaders of the rival families and getting rid of the traitors of among family.It ended with Michael succeeding and becoming the new godfather.<br/><br/>This epic film definitely is the greatest film ever made.We have great performances coming from Marlon Brando,who won an Oscar as Don Vito,the upstart Al Pacino and the rest of the cast.We also have a great story involving the Corleones as we get to see the transition of the family's leadership from Don Vito to Michael.The characters of the story are definitely far from one-note and they can be as complex evoking humanity.We are also treated to great production set designs, memorable musical scores coming from Nino Rota, a superb script coming from Puzo and Coppola, and a magnificent direction coming from Coppola.With that said,it has become a benchmark for excellence in film and has for many years remained relevant despite being initially released 45 years ago when this review is written.Overall,it is simply a masterpiece."
"BA_Harrison","10","4","6","6 March 2016"," Be sure to give it the respect it deserves.
","The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont's emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can't be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).<br/><br/>In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza's bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every way<br/><br/>The film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.<br/><br/>Coppola's storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank's plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.<br/><br/>Nino Rota's score for Coppola's movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can't even recall Shawshank's score.<br/><br/>Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'. Possibly).<br/><br/>In short, The Godfather is the don in every department."
"joshuafagan-64214","10","4","6","3 March 2016"," America's Masterpiece
","Let's talk about what many people call the greatest movie of all time: Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather. Released in 1972, it took the world by storm, becoming the highest-grossing movie of all time and ushering in a new era of film. Centering around a New York mob family and the descent into darkness of young Michael Corleone, played famously and fantastically by Al Pacino, it took us fully out of the Hays Code era and showed what film could do with mature subject matter.<br/><br/>It is also wonderfully acted, stunningly scored, scorchingly directed, and thrillingly cinematographed. When someone says 'The Godfather', a detailed series of images pop into my mind, a series of images distinct from every other film series in the world. It could copyright its aesthetic, an aesthetic that fits its tone and mood like climatic battles fit action movies or long kisses fit romance movies or sunsets fit the island of Santorini.<br/><br/>This film won five Academy Awards. I can safely that is too low. There is nothing in these films that is any less than the finest filmmaking ever produced. It is the work of a group of men and women at the height of their prowess. Pacino has starred in some terrible movies over the last twenty-five years, including the one that one him an Oscar. And Coppola? The best thing he did after the 70's were adaptations of teen novels. Now, doesn't that seem backwards to you? You're supposed to start off making adaptations of teen novels and move on to 'serious', 'adult' fare afterwards.<br/><br/>But none of that matters, not really. You don't remember Audrey Hepburn as an old woman dying of caner in the 90's. You think of her as one of the influential symbols of the 50's and 60's. And so it is here. Coppola could have jumped off a bridge in 1980, leaving little Sofia without a father. That would have a terrible tragedy, but for better or for worse, it would not be the first thing people remember about him. People die. Art survives. Good art grows. And this is certainly good art.<br/><br/>The next time I watch this movie, I should do a full analysis. It'd take a day or so, and it'd probably run over 30 pages, but I think it's be worth it. There are so many themes at play here. There is enough symbolism floating around to drive someone bad. As a general rule of thumb, if it looks symbolic, it probably is.<br/><br/>There are so many memorable quotes from this movie. I hope you guys don't mind me closing out this review by posting a slew of them.<br/><br/>""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" ""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli."" ""It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes."" ""In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns."" ""I believe in America."" ...Okay, I'm not seriously gonna stop the review. But you get my point. And none of these quotes come at the expense of telling a great story. Many scripts pick between being watertight and being evocative. This one is both, and because of that, all these lines stick in the audience's mind.<br/><br/>One of the greatest lies of cinema is that the lines people remember are the best lines in any given film. If that were true, we'd have stoned college kids and vapid teenage blondes quoting long, flowery speeches instead of catchphrases. People remember lines in films because 1) the lines are important to the plot, 2) the lines are not something that would normally be spoken, and 3) the lines are delivered well.<br/><br/>The people who make animated kids' films have a tendency to forget steps 1 and 3.<br/><br/>Throughout the history of filmmaking, there has never been a film both as good and as iconic as The Godfather. When people talk about films, it is one of the first to come to mind.<br/><br/>In my opinion, it is the face of American filmmaking. Of all the films I have watched, none have more accurately portrayed what it is to be American. Yes, this a film about crime and the mafia. But it is also a film about identity and opportunity and progress and transition and cutthroat business and hope and fear and assimilation and betrayal and broken dreams and uncertainty and family and traditionalism and modernism and ascending and descending.<br/><br/>Annie Hall and especially Manhattan are love letters to NYC. This is a love letter to America. But it is also a hate letter. It explores both sides of the American Dream. It explores the highs and lows and temptations and opportunity everyone faces as they try to make it in this country. It is explores this glorious mess of a land.<br/><br/>Not much else I can say. If you haven't yet seen it, see it."

","Of all the movies I love and admire, I just have to say The Godfather is my favourite movie ever. I could go on forever talking about how great it is. It's beautiful to watch from the opening monologue to the closing-door ending. I know it's kind of cliché to call The Godfather your favourite movie but I mean how could you not? It's pretty much perfect in every way: perfect acting, perfect directing, perfect writing, perfect pacing, perfect music, perfect cinematography etc. Not to mention it has one of the greatest actors of all time, Marlon Brando in one of the most iconic performances of all time and it helped restore his career. And it made actors like the great Al Pacino a superstar. In fact, The Godfather changed everything in terms of movie-making. Anyone who loves movies, should definitely see The Godfather. It's too bad Marlon Brando wasn't present at the Oscars in 1973 because it would've been amazing to see him give on speech on winning the award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for a second time and thanking everyone involved with The Godfather.<br/><br/>But even I'm surprised to call The Godfather my favourite movie ever because I'm not mad on gangster movies. Like I think Goodfellas is really overrated and I think Scarface with Al Pacino is nothing special. But I also think The Godfather: Part II is a masterpiece as well even though it's not as good as the original and it doesn't feel the same without Marlon Brando. Though I've never watched The Godfather: Part III but it's considered by many to be very disappointing so I choose to stay away from it. <br/><br/>But in conclusion, to put it rather bluntly, if you don't like The Godfather, it's hard to believe you like movies."

"Clockwork_Orange55","10","4","6","11 October 2015"," ""It is the ultra-American movie classic, which shares its place alongside movies like ""Casablanca"" and ""Citizen Kane""""
","I can understand on why ""The Godfather"" is being regarded as one of the greatest motion pictures of all time, if not the greatest by some professionals. ""The Godfather"" is the soul of a perfected cinema, one that will be looked upon by passionate students, and one that will be studied for generations. It is the ultra-American movie classic, which shares its place alongside movies like ""Casablanca"" and ""Citizen Kane"". Even its formidable sequel never holds the same kind of stature. To admire ""The Godfather"", is to celebrate American cinema, or just simply movies.<br/><br/>Some time ago, I told a friend that ""The Godfather"" is a great example of a 'complete' movie, and my opinion stays in that manner still. It has everything a movie requires: cinematography, acting, editing, screenplay, directing and obviously, a glorious plot. 'Overrated' is the term adopted by some for ""The Godfather"", and my assumption is that either he dislikes the picture, or he lacks the understanding to realise the wonders of the medium. ""The Godfather"" is the first great film I caught. It is the initiator of my love for cinema. Undoubtedly, the film will always have a special place in my heart.<br/><br/>What began and seemed like a happy family, plunges into darkness too quickly. The joy and light at the beginning are merely silhouettes of the Corleone family. Sonny's (James Caan) trifling with adultery, and the show of his temper, a man asking for murder, an unholy loyalty, and Michael's (Al Pacino) telling of his father's ways of abusing power - all these are signs shown by Coppola on the dangers that will rain down upon them. One who flirts with sin, will face a punishment.<br/><br/>Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), who is the head of the family, is a very powerful and influential figure. With considerable loyalty that his friends pay for him, he holds the power to accomplish his ambitions. ""The Godfather"" serves introductions to the Corleone family, and only with the arrival of a narcotic baron, a spark of its drama, lighted. Although Vito portrays the main character of the story, I treat it such that the Corleone family is the 'protagonist' instead, with their businesses and goals are the greatest displays of the story.<br/><br/>My favourite moment is a scene where Michael places his sick father in a hidden room to avoid a possible assassination. And Vito's tears flow down his cheek upon discovering that his son, has performed with utmost sincerity to keep him safe. That part, clearly magnified a genuine father-son relationship and too, the sheer love that Vito has for Michael and also a magnificent clue that Michael is the right person to succeed his father as the head of the family. No matter how villainous, or powerful or influential Vito may be, he is still an ordinary father who preserves love for his children.<br/><br/>The movie opens up relationships between the people in the family. To witness Sonny embracing his brother, Michael, before the disinclined departure, says a lot about the soft spoken allegiance he has for Michael. And also it brings to light about loyalty and protectiveness within. Not only the story painted picture of aggressiveness of the organisation, but also about characters, that men carry.<br/><br/>James Caan, John Cazale, Robert Duvall and the rest from the cast delivers perfect performances that have made ""The Godfather"" to be inarguably one of the best acted films in history. Marlon might already have passed terrific performances for his earlier movies like ""On the Waterfront"" and ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", but his work for the ""The Godfather"" transcended all these. His embodiment of an old, fading Don gives life for excellence and the body of an acting genius. Al Pacino is responsible for the convincing but subtle transformation of Michael from an innocent war hero, to a cold, hard – hitting Don. That effortless changeover by Pacino is a marvellous piece of acting. John Marley is terrific as the outspoken movie producer but a very short screen time was given for him, and his performance is severely underrated.<br/><br/>There is ""The Godfather"", living under the shades of cinematic greatness. The legacy and influence that the movie brings, endures till today. It is pretty much ironic that the greatest gangster movie is actually the one that romanticises the subject, not the ones that vomit the brutalities that many find a strong connection in between. Coppola made a statement that sounds like the movie is actually ""an accidental success"". I refuse to believe in that. I believe that the geniuses of Coppola, the actors, the writer and the filmmakers involved, that have had truly made ""The Godfather"" a timeless masterpiece.<br/><br/>(Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com) twitter: @Alex_DeSmall"

","The Godfather is not only a great Noir style gangster movie but also a tale of the immigrants that came to this country in the last part of the 1800's through the depression. Poor families from Europe that came to the land of the free only to find that all the wealth was controlled by the land barons, Bankers and well to do. Like Most parents Vito Corleone did what he had to do to raise his family and never wanted this life for his sons. Realizing his words were lost on Sonny and Fredo who was a sickly child did not have much hope of making it on his own. But Michael was different he went to college then into the service in WW2. He was never supposed to be in that world but the attempt on his fathers life makes him realize he is his fathers son. He swears revenge on Salatso and the police captain that protects him and so the story unravels. Great performances By Brando, Caan, Pacino,Duvall,with an incredible supporting cast with Abe Vigoda,Richard Castalano, Diane Keaton and Talia SHire. Perhaps the best of the supporting cast is John Cazale as Fredo Supposedly not the brightest bulb in the bunch turns out to be a very good schemer who wants whats coming to him."

"iceskergirl123","10","4","6","24 September 2015"," Great Movie
","Francis Ford Coppola's screen adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather is a cinematic master piece. The thought provoking irony that shrouds the film leaves the audience astounded by the excellence of the work. The characters are all very dynamic and go through extensive amounts of growth throughout the duration of the film. The use of irony, antithesis, and juxtaposition create such a complex story above and below the surface. Although the movie is very complex and layered, it is not too difficult to follow. It is long, so if you want to get the most of the experience I recommend watching it in installments rather than all at once. It will make the movie easier to follow and keep your attention span fresh. There is a lot of violence, but it is not overly gory. It's more tasteful than films of the Tarantino nature. So, leave your guns behind, grab a cannoli and enjoy this exemplary film full of plot and grade A acting."

","I was searching through the reviews of this film and came across a couple that weren't particularly complimentary about the film.

Secondly, one person seemed to take offence of Marlon Brando's performance, that in itself is an insult as Brando was incredible in this film. Coppola's direction and attention to detail are inch perfect for me. The whole cast was brilliant in particular Al Pacino who gives an Oscar worthy performance of epic proportions. You don't just watch this film for me, you experience a whole new chapter of life that most would never experience through this film. The word epic can be overused in terms of film but this is 100% an epic of epic proportions. I agree that everyone is entitled to an opinion but get with it man, you don't get films better than this and I refuse to believe that people who have rated the likes of 'Django unchained' as close in terms of quality to this film should be allowed to comment on film in general. 10/10!!!"

","Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies enjambé off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can't. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.<br/><br/>The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.<br/><br/>The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.<br/><br/>The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.<br/><br/>The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable."

The only minor ""problem"" is that this and the Part II are complete each other, one by one these movies are less, but this little detail won't minor their merits. In the lead role Al Pacino was the best choice, and don't forget to mention the legend, Marlon Brando as THE Godfather. I think this film represents what nowadays movie are lack of. In this movie the story and the characters are the main parts not the visual effects. In my opinion to this very day, this was Coppola's best directing. And don't forget Nino Rota's melodies which are inseparable from the movie."

","As the film opens, it is the last Saturday in August, 1945 - the Japanese have just surrendered. In the opening scene of the film, the camera (very slowly) pulls back from the face of a man who is in Corleone's dark home office, where the Don regally and ruthlessly holds court. He carries on with the crime family business during his daughter's wedding reception, that is being held in the bright, sunshiny outdoor veranda of his Long Island compound. According to Corleone's Irish-German overseer and surrogate son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall): ""It's part of the wedding. No Sicilian can refuse any request on his daughter's wedding day."" It is the custom of the father of the bride to grant favors and promises to all petitioners and supplicants who pay homage.<br/><br/>Seated in front of the Don's desk is an undertaker named Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto), speaking in a heavy accent (Vito Corleone's wife is god-mother to Bonasera's daughter). Bonasera desperately pleads for a favor - proper vengeful ""justice"" (rather than American justice) for the threatened near-rape and brutal beating suffered by his daughter (whom he raised ""in the American fashion"") by her non-Italian boyfriend and his friend. The two brutes had received a court date and only a suspended sentence:<br/><br/>I believe in America. America has made my fortune. And I raised my daughter in the American fashion.

First things first, yes I like blockbuster kind of movies (you know the types) and i've absolutely adored what cinema has brought in, the past 10 years... But, I've seen many movies from the 50's-80's unlike my generation and i have to say that i am fond of 2/10 of them (The 90's, especially 1994 is a happy exception). That being said you cant imagine how big it is that this movie is my 2nd favorite of all time in all of 400+ movies i've seen...! The pacing is incredible, the picture is meant to be timeless, the sound is captivating, the plot is classic, and don't get me started on the performances. Marlon Brando, the greatest actor to have walked on this earth, proved why he is the best with ,maybe, the best performance of all time. I'd seen the streetcar and on the waterfront and i could believe in my eyes... It's a shame it has a rating of 9.2/10 because it truly is at least 9.9/10... even for an objective voting.

People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather.

","As argued by Tom Hanks in You've Got Mail, ""The Godfather meets all the vital questions that come your way in life."" Although for that reason I never would eat oranges: every time someone takes one of those citrus or play with them in the film, has every chance to perish. Maybe because a film that begins without credits, with a speech in which in its initial nine words patriotism, immigration, business, honor, beliefs and hard reality blend (""I believe in America. America has made my fortune ""), and that there does not fail until the final climax, even the high treason-the Michael Corleone takes himself, his beliefs, because the family is above oneself-can not be bad. For Coppola lived to the limit on the set, with the constant feeling that was going to be fired, the producer Robert Evans and Paramount nor were giving truce, nor would leave to finish a film in which he did not believe the beginning (the end of the day, it was about something far removed from his life, the Mafia and was based on a best-seller); and that pressure came the juice of talent, the essence that inspired the new Hollywood. Because Marlon Brando did a test to be hired him, he refused to do so. For young boys came of interpretation: Al Pacino, John Cazale (which only made five films before dying of cancer, but do five jobs), Diane Keaton, James Caan and Robert de Niro reinforcement for the second part. Because neither the music of Nino Rota or photography Gordon Willis have a second of weakness. Because we all love to say what the ""offer he could not refuse"" and think you can get into the bed of an enemy head of a horse. For these reasons and many others, The Godfather is the best movie ever."

The color theme in dark brown scenes reminded the Gothic era and architecture works perfectly. Men in dark rooms and covered windows taking care of their mostly illegal business.

"kieran-wright","10","4","6","24 April 2015"," The definitive mob movie
","Chances are you may have heard of this film, then again maybe you haven't. Anyway, let's cut to the chase. 'The Godfather', running at just under three hours, boasts at least four set pieces which will have you at the edge of your seat. The director takes care in familiarising us with not just the Corleone family, but also their staff and associates, which really engages the viewer. We are also witness to the transformation of a certain Michael Corleone. There are elements of tragedy in this film which sows the seeds for future perpetrations of revenge, and the ultimate message that I took away was that man has the capacity to cause absolute carnage, which clearly we already know: I suppose that it does no little harm to remind ourselves of that fact. In terms of the acting, it superlative with everyone putting in credible performances. Given that the director was under incredible pressure to make this a success, it is a fantastic feat and still holds up today as the definitive mob movie. However, let me put all that to one side and reserve special credit to Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola who have created quite possibly the best and most recognisable soundtrack in movie history. If you don't already have it, I recommend that you buy 'The Godfather Trilogy' album: there are songs on the album which, if they don't send a shiver up your spine, will reduce you to tears, such is the poignancy of these compositions. I strongly believe that this film would not have been what it is without this soundtrack - it is that crucial to the overall structure."

"Al_The_Strange","8","4","6","2 January 2013"," ""He is a good godson.""
","This film has spawned so many gangster clichés and parodies that it's not even funny. Every time you've heard of people ""sleeping with da fishies"" or ""making an offer you can't refuse,"" it'll all boil back to this classic, highly-tutted film.<br/><br/>On first glance, I dismissed the film as being rather dull, despite a few standout moments. On repeat viewings, I have found it more compelling. The film is most memorable for the scenes everybody knows and loves: the scene with the horse's head, the street fighting scene, Marlon Brando's mumbling, the restaurant shooting, sporadic bursts of gunfights and violence...it's all there. Dialogue dominates most of the film, but when given due attention, the story can be rather gripping and mesmerizing. At this point, the only drag I've felt is in the last thirty minutes or so; the film just kinda winds down after nearly 150 minutes of epic-scale gangster mayhem.<br/><br/>The story is long, dense, and chock full of quality characterizations. The film does a fine job of keeping its events in order so that the politics of each situation makes some kind of sense. What matters the most will be the characters, who are endearing, and the underlying themes of family, honor, and loyalty. Family and generations are probably the most blatant themes, especially since most scenes show some strong contrast (or perhaps comparisons) between adults and children.<br/><br/>As a film, it looks really classy. Photography never was a huge standout for these films, but the sepia tones and framing lends the movie a type of classic family-portrait appeal. Editing is decent. Acting is probably the biggest virtue here. Marlon Brando chews the scenery, despite his mumbling and constant fiddling with things, he does show endless nuance and expressions that brings Vito Corleone to life really well. Al Pacino must be at his most nuanced as Michael, and the rest of the magnificent cast fulfills their parts well. Writing is decent. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, and is especially noteworthy for its period reproduction. Music is nice too.<br/><br/>Everybody should see this at least once in their lifetime.<br/><br/>4/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Good | Film: Perfect)"
"setanta-","1","110","314","18 January 2002"," Completely un-redeeming in any way. Garbage.
","I remember distinctly the first time I saw ""The Godfather"". I was a child and it was being shown on broadcast television.  Granted, neither of theses are optimal conditions for rendering an informed opinion but I remember being struck with how unremarkable- in fact how boring I found the film.  I was particularly surprised by this, as there had been a great fanfare over the broadcast. I chalked this up to my own immaturity and thought no more of it.<br/><br/>The second time I saw the film was in college.  My friend had a brother who was quite a film enthusiast and he, like many others, counted ""The Godfather"" as the finest film.  One evening my friend and I watched the film.  The viewing once again left me unimpressed.  I feigned an enthusiasm for the film that I did not feel, as it seemed the popular, and even the intellectual expectation.  Once again I associated my dislike for the movie with a failing in myself. I apparently did not appreciate a ""good movie"" when I saw one.<br/><br/>Since that time I have seen many films, from many directors, from many countries, in many languages, and with varying budgets from independent offerings to mainstream Hollywood fare.  I certainly do not consider myself to be an expert but feel myself to be an informed member of an audience. Armed with my experience I recently viewed ""The Godfather"" again to expunge my previous failures and to gleefully join the ranks of Godfather sycophants.  Well, I think you know the outcome.  As they say in baseball, three strikes and you're out.<br/><br/>I find the film to be completely un-redeeming in every way.  I do not have space to address the film systematically or technically so I will speak to my central grievance- the story is hollow.  There is no moral center.<br/><br/>I do not demand that a movie have morality.  I do not demand that a film even have a point.  I can take a film at its face value for what it is.  A slapstick comedy is foolish and an action flick is mindless, I do not ask that they be a different movie- only that they meet the narrow definition to which they aspire.  The problem is that ""The Godfather"" aspires to be a great drama and that aspiration comes with high expectations.<br/><br/>Gratuitous violence is expected in big-budget action flicks, amorality can be understood in the quiet desperation of an independent film's philosophy, and self-indulgence is to be expected in the over-the-top musical extravaganza.  However, violence, amorality, and self-indulgence in a film that portrays itself as mainstream drama or even tragedy are reprehensible. This is not art- it is base voyeurism at its worst.  We are standing in the bailey at New Castle or at the Coliseum watching with leering stares at the baseness and depravity of man. This film is not a criticism of man's foul nature, as in the above referenced independent film; it is a celebration of it.  Anyone who claims otherwise deludes himself.<br/><br/>Thus conceived I can appreciate `The Godfather' as a film oddity, a curious victory of the popularity of evil men.  But to say that it is a great film is scandalous, and to say that it is the greatest film is blasphemous.  To say that the highest achievement of man in film is a celebration of cruelty, deception, and greed is a statement that many should reconsider.<br/><br/>I find it interesting that many of those who claim ""The Godfather"" as their favorite film, or the best film of all time can count their viewings of the film on one hand. In fact, I myself (who thinks unfavorably of the film) have given the film more attention then many of the ""fans"" I know.  A friend of mine who professes to like the film recently returned the box-set DVD ""Godfather"" collection that he received for Christmas.  As he put it, he loved the film but when was he ever going to watch it?  That is faint praise indeed for the ""greatest film of all time"".<br/><br/>I am sure there are those who genuinely enjoy the film, but you could say that about any movie.  I would advise those who fawn over this film so to ask themselves if their enthusiasm comes from within or from a modern mythology. ""The Godfather"" is a paper tiger."
"miguelsanchez9753","5","18","41","6 October 2007"," Very over-hyped
","Given the rave reviews, I was very excited when I finally had time to sit down and watch this movie start to finish. I ended up more than a little disappointed. My biggest complaint is that the movie glorifies the underworld in a way that ends up seeming very corny--one scene features a bunch of civilized looking crime lords sitting around a table talking about how gambling, alcohol, and prostitution are OK, but drugs cross the line.<br/><br/>Sure, the story incorporates a lot of dramatic effects, but in the end I felt like the drama was forced into the setting in a cheap attempt to make mid-20th century organized crime look serious and exciting. In this way, The Godfather is a little bit like rap music--it validates a fast-paced, unlawful lifestyle by glorifying the coming of power and masculinity that its main characters undergo."
"mbuchwal","1","106","303","15 February 2006"," Bait and Switch is the Name of this Game
","Does ""Godfather"" romanticize crime and criminals? Yes, it does. Take, for instance, the Godfather's name ""Corleone"" which translates as ""Lionhearted,"" suggesting that the heroes are to be compared to Richard the Lionhearted, legendary chivalrous hero of the Crusades and friend to Robin Hood. There can be no doubt that author Mario Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola have made romantic idols of the Corleones, as the film gilds them with mystery, honor and gallantry. But of what Holy Crusade are the Corleones the leaders? Seemingly a war for survival against vicious enemies who would destroy their gang. But why should we care what happens to a bunch of evil criminals? <br/><br/>""Godfather"" is just as much interesting for what it fails to show the audience as what it does show. The film makers wrongly assume that the audience is sophisticated enough to infer the kind of lurid but educational scene that made such a great success of earlier gangster films, nitty gritty illustrations of the inside workings of organized crime: loan sharking, extortion and vice. ""Godfather"" for the most part ignores this subject matter, the everyday business of crime, in favor of what should be only the end part of its story: a war between gangs over control of the rackets. The drama is essentially without motivation. The movie is simply not interested in showing us much of the dirty business that is the reason for the war. That is because the heroes would seem much less chivalrous if their criminal enterprises were shown in any depth or with any real understanding. For most of its length, the movie plays as a revenge tragedy in which the gallant protagonists could be members of any great family (whether criminal or not) protecting their cherished honor.<br/><br/>Why did the film makers deliberately sanitize the criminal aspect of the Corleone family? Are they apologists for crime? I think they are. One confidence game employed by the film makers, which is also familiar among the annals of organized crime leaders, is a variation on the trick called ""bait and switch."" We expect a portrait of a ruthless and immoral criminal, instead we are made to believe in the essential moral rightness of Don Corleone when he condemns as a contemptible enemy the kind of criminal who trades in narcotics. In other words, we are lured into the theater with the promise of a true to life depiction of the actions of a bad guy, and then the film makers slyly pull a fast one and show us a good guy instead! (We are persuaded to ignore the fact that the Godfather is an extortionist and pimp  even worse we are asked to believe that extortion and pimping are not so bad, especially if practiced by an honorable guy like Don Corleone, who, whatever his failings, is much too decent to trade in narcotics.) <br/><br/>This jiggery pokery was so effective that around the time the movie and its sequel came out an ivy league educated friend of mine on his way to a brilliant career on Wall Street bitterly denounced a critic of ""Godfather"" for making the claim that Don Corleone was not entitled to be regarded as a great hero like President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, General Douglas MacArthur or Doctor Albert Schweitzer, who had received similarly adulatory treatment in film. My friend, having seen both Godfathers, was convinced that a Mafia leader might be just as honorable as the heroic portrait the movies presented.<br/><br/>So, I feel some need on this occasion to remind the public of what the Mafia does, even when they allegedly refuse to get involved in narcotics sales. The Mafia is mainly in the business of Vice. It feeds off the weaknesses of a mass of little people who are corruptible, who are vulnerable to the appeal of easy sex, cheap thrills, quick money and quick fixes of their problems. These little people pay for their vices all their lives, much more than they can afford to pay, and end up ruined for the greater glory of the Mafia. Most racket crime is not glorious; it is petty and mean and easily committed by anyone who has less courage or daring than the average person. But it's easy to understand why the film makers left this out of the movie. It would be kind of absurd to call a scuzzy dirtbag by the name ""Lionheart."""

"aliciadipesto","4","13","28","5 September 2005"," Agonising, overrated, what's all the fuss about?
","Time and time again my friends berate me for not seeing this film and yet consider me to be something of a 'movie buff'. So they duly sat me down on Saturday night with a curry and the director's cut for my entertainment and delight.<br/><br/>All I can say is, there's 3 hours of my life I'm never going to get back. Don't get me wrong; I'm a big fan of gangster movies, I've studied some of the early Cagney/Robinson films and seen most of the more important ones: Scarface, Casino, Goodfellas - I even stayed awake through Once Upon A Time In America. But The Godfather was agonising. Slow, meandering, overly-complicated, lacking punch - what it lashed out in bullets and horses heads, it certainly lacked in dynamite. Watching The Godfather is the cinematic equivalent of the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds; 30 years on it's impossible to see why on earth it was considered so ground-breakingly new and exciting. But by all accounts Coppolla was making a brave movie here, reintroducing a genre stuck in the 1920's and lavishing 168 minutes on the minutiae of one Mafia family.<br/><br/>And lavish it he does. The only thing I can say in its defence is that the production design was superb, it lacked for nothing, the overall look of the film was excellent. The budget must have been colossal. What a pity the plot and the dialogue didn't live up to its promise. With a cast so huge and impressive as well, it's twice as pitiful.<br/><br/>The legendary Marlon Brando couldn't fail to disappoint - the poor man's legend - in my opinion - far exceeded his talent. I understand the director begged Brando to come out of retirement for this, although I kind of wish he'd stayed there. His incessant mumbling, padded cheeks and all, peering out of dark corners and scratching his face just had me turning the volume way up high and becoming increasingly frustrated. Diane Keaton just played Diane Keaton/Annie Hall (her real name, trivia hounds)as usual, with an increasingly terrible haircut. She looked like she wasn't sure what she was doing in the movie any more than we did, she just looked like she wanted to go home. Her relationship with Pacino totally lacked chemistry and I found his return to her from Sicily as a widower highly unbelievable. Even Pacino's 'thunderbolt' relationship with Apollonia seemed contrived and wooden - I know he's meant to be a hard man but he remained so poker-faced throughout the movie I lost any feelings of sympathy for him.<br/><br/>The best part I felt was played by James Caan, whose character was labelled as 'hot tempered' by his father (is that what it takes to be interesting within the Corleone family?!) so of course he met a predictably sticky end like a lot of the better characters. I found a lot of the meandering plot very predictable - to the extent where I was annoying my die-hard fans who put on the show for me, but I couldn't help it: ""Something tells me Apollonia isn't going to get out of that car"" etc. The plot didn't really go anywhere, it just seemed to be setting itself up for that sequel; every 20 minutes or so Brando/Pacino were inviting people to take advantage of 'an offer they couldn't refuse'. It was laughable.<br/><br/>Other than Caan's, none of the characters were the slightest bit appealing; the outrageous behaviour of Tommy in Scorsese's Goodfellas, for example, is counterbalanced by his likable personality: you're laughing in spite of yourself. Pacino's protagonist in Scarface is the same - snorting copious amounts of cocaine and waving a gun around - you still care about the guy, however monstrous he's become. But Pacino in The Godfather was just a cartoon bad-ass, like the rest of them, identikit baddies with no depth whatsoever, no remorse, no weakness, no humanity, no growth. When Brando stumbles to his death among the tomato plants in play with his grandson I take that to mean that Coppolla was showing us Vito had a heart but really, it was too little too late.<br/><br/>Coppolla may well have been brave in 1972 to reintroduce a decidedly unfashionable genre on a conservative audience, and for the time it might have been a breath of fresh air, but the glamour and pace of subsequent, better, gangster fare puts The Godfather in the shade, however responsible the film may be for the genre's future output."

What can you say about any aspect of this movie that is not great and flawless? The sets, language etc. are amazing. I watched this and Godfather 2 on the same week.

"SeminolePhenom","10","7","13","25 July 2005"," The Greatest, no questions asked
","Before giving a summary of this classic, let me just say that this is ""The Masterpiece of all Masterpieces"" when it comes to movies. When I review movies, I consider the godfather as the greatest of all time and rate the movies according. There is no greater movie than this one.<br/><br/>Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando, is The Godfather of the ""Corleone Family Mafia"". Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) returns from war with no intention of joining the family business. Bad blood between the heads of the five families cause a shooting on Don Vito, which keeps Michael away from Kay Adams(Diane Keaton), his girlfriend, and closer to his family with Sonny (James Caan), Fredo(John Cazale), Connie(Taila Shire), and family lawyer Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall). Sonny takes over the family business through Don Vito's bad health and takes very aggressive action. A war is created between the heads of the family, leading to assassinations, betrayal, revenge, and suffering on all parts. To end this chaos, Michael Corleone takes over the family business with his father as his adviser.<br/><br/>The movie is absolutely flawless. The lighting is incredible. It's so dark at some points that Brando's eyes are shadowed. The acting is insanely great. Brando does a better acting job in The Godfather, than he does in On the Waterfront. Pacino's acting is superb. He stars in his first major role, leading to many great performances following. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton give great performances as well. The movie received 4 Oscar nominations for acting alone(Brando in leading role/ Pacino, Caan, and Duvall in supporting role). The movie was nominated for 11 academy awards and won 3 of them (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Marlon Brando)in 1972.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect that a critic looks for. It is highly entertaining, shocking, and tear jerking of epic proportions.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie."

","It is indeed a true classic and one of the best movies out there, however best movie of all time i would have to say no. It does indeed deserve it's reputation as one of the best movies of all time, however based on the fact it was number 1 on the IMDb top 250 i was a tad disappointed. I was fascinated by it's very engrossing story telling, the absolutely stunning performances and the incredible direction from Francis Ford Coppola . It's a pretty powerful movie with a lot of disturbing moments. It starts of a little slow but once it gets going it never fails to grip you. The direction is Incredible. Apart from the slow beginning the direction is flawless, with an EXCELLENT pace,awesome camera work and the way the camera moved with the characters it was great!, plus he created a great atmosphere!. There is LOTS of bloody violence. We get LOTS of EXTREMELY bloody gunshot wounds, knife in the hand, bloody gunshot wound to the head,severed horse head in someone's bed (VERY bloody), a harsh beating and , an very gory gunshot wound to the eye. The Acting is some of the best i have ever seen. Marlon Brando without a doubt deserved his Oscar for his groundbreaking performance, however having said all that Al Pacino deserved the Oscar just as much, it also was hard to understand what Brando was saying at times!. Al Pacino's performance was just as good and was also deserving of The Oscar, he and Brando had some cool scenes together and watching Pacino was just plain fun to watch!. James Caan was EXCELLENT here in his scenes here and wish he had more screen time , he is a terrific actor!. Robert Duvall is very good here with what he had to do i liked him lots. Diane Keaton is excellent here as Pacino's wife and had awesome chemistry with Pacino. Talia Shire was very good here but went a little crazy at times and she sure broke a lot of dishes! (LOL, and the rest of the cast did a tremendous job as well. Overall this indeed a true classic and one of the best movies out there however i was expecting a little too much and was a tad disappointed however i HIGHLY suggest you buy or rent this now just don't go in expecting it to be the best of all time (although a lot of viewers will probably think it is). ***** out of 5"

","I continually fail to understand why The Godfather is hailed as ""The Greatest Movie of All Time"".  I've seen it twice--a second time just to make sure--and I have to tell you that I sat there in a stupor, bored out of my mind.  And I'm not a teenager raised on MTV; I'm in my 30s and am absolutely devoted to movies--I've seen as many classics (American & foreign) that I can get my hands on.  But, for me, The Godfather ranks alongside Singin' in the Rain as the most overrated films of all time.<br/><br/> Singin' in the Rain, at least, I get (it's just my intense dislike for Donald O'Connor that makes me dislike this film).  But The Godfather?   It's just a bland epic about a bunch of moronic gangsters, with Marlon Brando giving a campy performance, and riddled with repulsive violence.  Give me a break.  The fact that this movie is so ""beloved"" has had the direct result that nowadays we got absurdly worse and worse films every year, created by clueless filmmakers."

","This movie is ridiculously overrated. It is merely a overly dramatized celluloid interpretation of life involved with the Italian Mafia. Yes, organized crime is a problem, but this movie is NOT all that amazing. There are entirely too many references to it in other movies, too many spoofs and too many quotes. It's a bad movie. Let it go. There is no real plot line and the bad accents were enough to give me a headache. This movie is mind numbingly boring. It feels as though I lose brain cells every time I am forced to watch this painfully shallow film. Most films following along a similar premise are horribly dull. Why does everyone rave about movies like this and Scarface? They are awful, overly exaggerated and generally badly constructed cinematic failures. A decent script and plot line were substituted for gratuitous blood, gore and explosions. A good movie starts with a good story and a good script, this lacks both. Every aspect of this movie was horribly boring. It does NOT deserve to be named ""The Best Movie of All Time."""
"Engage_With_Zorp","6","17","40","13 June 2007"," The Best Movie Ever Made? I Think Not.
","With a movie as critically acclaimed as The Godfather, you'd think it was the best movie of all time. Sadly, for me, this was not the case. It was a decent movie, of course; but, in the end, it had a few major flaws.<br/><br/>First and foremost is a flaw that many may see as a great asset (thus pointing out the obviously subjective nature of movie watching): its length. Now, I have nothing against long movies, but this one just seemed to drag on and on and on. I've seen many people who made this complaint get called people with low attention spans and low intelligence; this is complete idiocy. The movie had, for all its apparent greatness, many superfluous scenes (the parts of the movie that took place in Sicily seemed particularly long and drawn out). It truly did not know when to end, and thus did not keep my interest.<br/><br/>Another flaw was the the pompousness of the film. It truly seemed to me that every person involved was completely full of themselves and the movie they were making. It just bugged the crud out of me.<br/><br/>Another flaw was the underdevelopment of many of the other crime bosses in the film, all of which are of course killed by Michael's men. I didn't even know any of their names, and this alone should show you how little I could care about them. A great movie makes you care about even the villains, so that their deaths are affecting.<br/><br/>There's more I could say, but I have limited space here, so I'll just sum it up by saying that it was decent, but far from the greatest movie ever made. In fact, it is probably the most highly overrated movie of all time."

I saw absolutely nothing special. I kind of enjoyed the performances of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, and James Caan... but besides that, there is not one really exceptional feature in sight.

","1.- Pouring alcohol into an injury. 2.- Counting the number of books available in a big library. 3.- Reading all those books. 4.- Watching the Weather Channel for 5 hours. 5.- Looking for a needle in a haystack. 6.- Counting the hays in the haystack. 7.- Sharpening 10,000 pencils in a row. 8.- Seeing a tortoise walk a distance of about let´s say, a million miles.<br/><br/>You get the idea, don´t you? This movie was so sloooooooooow, and the story just draaaaaaaaaaaags on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. It was a torture, and at the end, I wondered: WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS MESS OF A MOVIE? It seemed like it was also going to tell us the story of Michael's sons, grandsons, great grandsons,  great great grandsons, and well.... it just seemed endless. ENDLESS. I wondered why IMDb users praise it so much if every single person that I know despises this movie. It's beyond dull. At the end, somehow Michael got rid of ALL of his enemies, in 2 minutes? Just that simple? He should have made that before, and he would have kept me from suffering this dreck. After watching this, I never want to watch one of those called ""classics"" (like Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Schindler´s list, Gone with the Wind, etc.) because it seems to ba a rule that a movie can´t be artistic and entertaining. Few movies combine those things. Those are the true classics. One example? Pulp Fiction. That movie is perfect in every possible way.<br/><br/>I'll rate this movie a 3. I don't give it a one just because Marlon Brando was great. By the way, Al Pacino sucked in this movie. He couldn't have been more inexpressive."
"sullymazda","3","14","32","8 January 2015"," Let's Get Down To The Facts
","OK, I see that the movie has many naysayers. I was one of them when I saw the film in 1972, and I was only fifteen at the time. I could go on and on about the film's myriad failures. It is contrived, self-important, at times even poorly staged. Which brings me to my point. A lot of people seem to forget that Coppola did not win Best Director-- Bob Fosse (for ""Cabaret') did, and deservedly so. He did a much better job. That is one of the eight Oscars that ""Cabaret"" won.The other seven just happen to be Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound, Editing,Original Score, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Actress. So when the time came to open the envelope and announce Best Picture, the Award goes instead to a film that, by that point, had won only two statues (for Actor and Adapted Screenplay). How does any movie win eight Academy Awards and fail to grab Best Picture? With that in mind, ""The Godfather"" is not merely arrogant film-making. Its history and legacy,both--just like its protagonists-- are just downright larcenous."
"CinefanR","1","49","138","30 April 2012"," Massively overrated
","I'm not a fan of this type of movies, but since I like Al Pacino and I've heard so much about this so-called ""legendary"" Godfather, I decided to give it a try. I must say this is the most inexplicably overrated piece of trash I've ever seen. The characters are all ridiculous, unsympathetic and under developed, the story drags and lacks any real conflict and dynamics <br/><br/>But the most disgusting aspect is the movie's intent to glorify a bunch of low-life criminals and turn them into larger-than-life figures, into some kind of royalty. This whole ""family"" tradition is just ludicrous. We're supposed to ""care"" about these characters, to think that they are ""cool"". The major problem here is that there's no real conflict. There's no redeeming value whatsoever, they're all despicable and one-dimensional, so why the hell would I care. <br/><br/>The violence (which is particularly sickening) is another issue, but I guess audiences have come to appreciate it, and it's now a ""hallmark"" of the genre. Imagine, the Godfather's pregnant daughter gets beaten with a belt. But guess what: she's not likable either! She's hysterical, obnoxious and, even worse, she keeps defending her abusive husband. In another scene, James Caan beats the hell out of someone in front of children. Marvelous! That's just great, not to mention cool and ""culturally relevant"". <br/><br/>Marlon Brando speaking with a husky voice and cotton in his mouth is incredibly ridiculous. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone suddenly turns, from a principled man who doesn't want to have anything to do with murder, into a ruthless criminal. What? This character has no depth, no consistency whatsoever. His relationships with women are so poorly portrayed, they add nothing to his development. It's Pacino's worst, I can't imagine why anyone would think this is a great performance. If you want to see a good gangster movie, go watch ""Donnie Brasco"" instead."

","Many men has called this the greatest movie ever made. I disagree, though I liked it very much. The hype of this movie is as interesting as the movie itself as it says a lot about the world we live in and the men who seek power. <br/><br/>I have seen and read intimidation used by people, trying to personally attack any who called this movie terrible or boring calling them stupid, while many other just jumped on the wagon calling it the greatest movie ever made to avoid such attack. A similar pattern to how physically strong, but emotionally weak men like Capone and Hitler came to power.<br/><br/>The movie is significant to both world and film history. I however only give the movie a 5 as by todays standard its less artistic, entertaining and original. I also did not feel there was much new or original to learn from this movie and I did not get that ""wow"" feeling. I would not have much interest to see it again.<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite gangster movies though and its certainly not terrible or boring. However it lacks in much of what I think a great movie should be such as: Moral points, emotion, surprise, humor, editing, cinematography, original thought, special effects, music score or even acting.(the tough guy role is not as challenging as it is to play mentally ill person) <br/><br/>It does also not appeal to a very broad audience (not a movie many women and children like). It was great for its time, but compared to some of todays movies is very limited in the areas of greatness.<br/><br/>If you like movies like old gangster movies or even tough guy movies like ""the departed"" and ""scarface"" or want to know what the hype is about. I recommend this movie it is a great movie for this genre. But it does not reach the emotional or theatrical heights of movies like ""Forrest Gump"", ""the Lord of the Rings"", ""Dances with Wolves"" or even my favorite gangster movie ""Goodfellas""."

Everybody is sterile and no-one is worth caring even the least bit about.<br/><br/>Secondly, almost every opportunity for character dynamics and development is missed. The only character that is developed is Michael Corleone's and even that character is changing from one extreme to the other, in an instant, with no transition whatsoever. The result is characters as mere moronic caricatures to the point of absurdity.

That is something that is extremely hard to top. When you compare the two the style of directing is so different, that they almost look like they were shot by two different directors.<br/><br/>Godfather's biggest issue is poorly made editing, unnecessarily lengthened out scenes and totally unnecessary scenes, but then again what can you expect of a film, which was something, or so I've heard, that even the director was frustrated about. Some scenes just linger on the screen, without any evidence, that the director really knew what he wanted, and, in the end, the producers decided to amp it all in the film just because the material was there.<br/><br/>The best thing about the film is acting.

To me, it just epitomizes the big dumb knock people over the head with a club, speak like you dropped out of school in fourth grade sort of guy movie. I'm a guy. I like guy movies, but I don't like this one.<br/><br/>Brando I like pretty well. Pacino too. Hell, probably half the cast I am very fond of. Why can't I like this movie? I don't know, but it has just never made me feel anything but annoyance and boredom. The problem is people over-hype it and make me want to try to like it. Every time I try to watch it, it's the same thing though.<br/><br/>So sorry, this movie just isn't great."
"rudgeno1-1","1","38","118","27 February 2005"," Overrated to the extent that perhaps makes me underrate it
","This film is long and dull. As a result of the first it is dull for very long periods, which is why this film warrants no more than a miserly 1/10. The acting is competent but no more and I must confess I lost my focus towards the end due to the quite shocking lack of entertainment that can be attributed to a poor script, lacklustre direction and a plot which leaves a lot to be desired. People say Godfather is rare in that its sequel improves upon it, but that isn't hard. Al Pacino gained a big reputation from this one and I am left bemused as to why, and this unfortunate idea has meant Pacino, a mediocre actor at best has been able to infiltrate our cinema screens on far too many occasions with a distinct lack of passion or charisma in any role he displays."

","For years my boyfriend has been insisting that I watch this film - finally I did - big mistake... <br/><br/>My issues with this film are multiple ...<br/><br/>The pacing of the film is just terrible it's soooooooo slow and yet at the same time rushes through many things leaving many questions unanswered.<br/><br/>Character development is beyond terrible especially when it comes to Michael Who goes from nice guy who is nothing like his family to sociopath with no shades of grey in- between .<br/><br/>The relationships are also poor - one minute Michael is in love with Kay the next minute he's in Sicily and, in what feels like 5 minutes, married to Apollonia, then about 5 minutes later she's dead and he's home and married to Kay before Apollonia corpse is even cold...<br/><br/>Smaller issues include the fact that Michael seems to have a black eye for approximately a year - either that or he spent about a week abroad in which time he managed to get married. Also would have been nice to know what happened to Connie after getting beaten up by her husband - clearly she must have phoned Sonny I assume.... Did she lose the child ?... Or is that the child that Michael was godfather to - if so where did Michael's 4 year old son come from.... I guess I was asleep when that was explained or maybe I'd just lost the will to live. <br/><br/>All in all I found the film slow boring and rife withe cardboard cut out characters....<br/><br/>My tip avoid....

","'The Godfather' is one of the most well-known films of all time, and its popularity has made it a legend. It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse's severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film."

It is an OK movie if you like discriminate killing and foul language and the glorification of ""gang"" lifestyle. This movie hardly belongs in the top 50 let alone be in the #1 spot. <br/><br/>Do you know what the saddest part of this movie is? That it was remade two more times with the Godfather III being quite possible the worst remake EVER. I'm not saying you won't like the movie. It is entertaining at times and certainly some very good lines have come from the movie. I just can't stand when movies can't stand up to their own hype."

","The story is disjointed, the acting is terrible (especially Corleone who sounds like he's got a stick up his ass), the film is too long, the wedding scene is almost perpetual, which makes me ask, how did this get a 9.2? I'm shocked to be honest, what an awful, awful movie this is and I don't say that a lot about movies since I tend to appreciate what they are and what they are trying to convey, but this? This is an embarrassment and has to go down as the most overrated movie of all time in my book. There's no good acting performances in the movie, no memorable lines, no excitement, nothing. I'm genuinely disgusted that this movie has such high accolades because to me, it's crap. Absolute crap.<br/><br/>Brando's portrayal of Corleone has got to go down as one of the worst acting performances I've ever seen as well. The accent he uses is difficult to understand, the scene where he's shot in that assassination attempt is laughable as he over dramatizes the whole thing and his general acting performance and portrayal of Corleone, who is supposed to be a feared crime lord, is contrived and doesn't look believable. I'm honestly shocked that someone who is rated as one of the best actors who ever lived can perform this badly. This is the first film I've seen Brando in so I think it's unfair to judge his ability as an actor based on this poor performance, but my expectations will definitely be lowered when I watch another movie and see him as part of the cast."

"XIOMANGER","5","8","21","29 October 2004"," Didn't get it!
","Call me crazy, call me whatever, but I simply didn't get the movie. I think I know the reason why. After seeing 1000s of rip-offs and the motives inside this movie explored to the death in countless movies since the 70s, the initial hand-kissing scene looks pretty trite. Or the making an offer you can't refuse? Puhleeze! <br/><br/>The movie is quite slow. I know it is all about the atmosphere, but it really is nothing special. Neither does the mumbling of Marlon Brando convey any special significance to me. Yes, he is remorseful for being a powerful leader of a criminal empire and assigning this fate to his son. Boo hoo hoo. If you don't become a crook you don't have these kinds of problems. And yes, we all get it. The aggressive son is doomed to be killed in retaliation, the ineffectual son is doomed to remain in the shadows and the resourceful son is destined to take over the ""family business"". He simply kills off his adversaries without it ever being made clear how he outsmarted them or why no one ever came for him in a similar fashion. He actually turns into quite a ruthless son-of-a-... <br/><br/>But there is something more fundamental about why the movie isn't ""doing anything"" for me. The entire notion of ""honor"" and ""chivalry"" among criminals. It's completely fake. Now that America is mostly out of the grip of such people (not so in my own country I'm afraid, but still far from Chicago of the 20s) glorifying them is easy. The truth however is quite different. Criminals usually talk of honor, but their actions are based on much baser things. And they always have an excuse for why they ended up being crooks. Don't get suckered into believing movies like these convey any truth. <br/><br/>Rating 5/10<br/><br/>Scale: 10 MASTERPIECE, 9 Excellent, 8 Good, 7 OK, 6 Adequate, 5 Average, 4 Mediocre, 3 Poor, 2 Bad, 1 HORRIBLE"

"Jeremy_Urquhart","10","1","1","7 May 2020"," Just what everyone needs: another 10/10 review of The Godfather
","The Godfather Part 1 is genuinely one of the greatest films of all time, in my opinion. And I guess in the opinion of many, many other people too. The only reason I add the ""my opinion"" part is because I don't want it to seem like I'm suggesting it definitely is objectively one of the greatest of all time, because objectivity as a concept is kind of silly, and also because if someone doesn't like the film, or was disappointed by it, that's totally okay. I think it's perfectly normal to watch a classic film and feel as though something's off. I've lost count of the number of classics I'd say I ""appreciate"" whilst not particularly ""enjoying.""<br/><br/>But the original The Godfather for me is the rare film where I both appreciate and love it to an amazingly high degree. This is a nearly three-hour film that packs so much into its runtime that every time I watch it, I'm blown away. I've seen it on so many occasions that I know what's going to happen to who, and when, but there are still sequences where I'm on the edge of my seat. It doesn't matter that I know the outcome; the execution of many scenes still blows me away. Al Pacino's character facing a particular moral dilemma at a restaurant is one of my favourite sequences of all time, and really, I only single that one out because if I didn't limit myself, I could call every scene an iconic scene...<br/><br/>... Okay, I can't help it. I also want to rave about the opening scene, especially because I find it best to avoid spoilers (yes, even for old movies. I was born almost 25 years after The Godfather. I couldn't really watch it until 15 years after that at the earliest. You can't tell me I ""had 40 years to watch it so too bad about getting spoiled""... sorry, mid-review spoiler rant over). The opening wedding scene lasts a very long time, and the first time I watched it I may have thought it was a tad overlong (from memory, I had this at a 4.5/5 for a couple of years, then bumped it up to a 5/5 after my first rewatch). But, knowing the story better, and being a little more patient perhaps at an older age, I think the opening scene is incredible. Beyond being beautifully shot and constructed, and beyond the iconic opening monologue and first shot of the film, it's a fantastic achievement in writing.<br/><br/>We get almost all the main characters introduced in a short amount of time, understand who they are and where they stand, what their basic personalities are, and just why Brando's central mob boss character is so revered and feared. Sure, Michael explaining things to his girlfriend may seem like an easy way to convey some of this information, but it's not a crutch, and honestly I think it's organic enough. It's a huge, long movie with a lot going on, and so a long, dense, but still extremely engaging opening scene is needed to allow that story to progress properly.<br/><br/>Almost every scene after that opening scene is fantastic. The one part of the film I don't love is really the film's second sequence in Hollywood, but it's quite brief and still so far from bad. It might just suffer because it comes after a great opening and before approximately two hours of truly iconic stuff (it does feature an infamously memorable climax though, of course).<br/><br/>Really, just about everything in the film is beyond top-notch. Brando and Pacino have seldom been better, and that's saying something, and all the other supporting performances- including the crazily underrated Robert Duvall- deserve almost just as much praise. The music is beautiful, the look of the film amazing, the emotional stuff is devastating, and the violence still packs a surprisingly brutal punch (that one dodgy beatdown delivered by Caan's character aside).<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet, I'd still say go in with moderate expectations. You might love it, you might like it, you might respect it but find it a bit dull... but the less expectations you have, the clearer your response will be. I say that after hyping the movie up a whole lot, I'll admit, but those are my honest thoughts and feelings. I understand its status as a classic and gladly count it among my personal favourite movies. Part 2 is also very good, but I've never loved it as much as Part 1. Part 3 is a step down in quality, but I don't hate it. It has the most flaws of all the films, but there's some stuff in there I like too.<br/><br/>Anyway, watch this first one if you haven't yet, and go on from there with either Part 2 or maybe Part 2 & 3 if you like it. I think the first Godfather has the reputation it has for a reason, and deserves at least one viewing by just about every fan of film at least once in their lifetime."

","It feels a bit redundant reviewing arguably the greatest and most well-known Hollywood film nearly 50 years after it's release, but I feel like I need to pay homage to this true masterpiece of American cinematic art. This is not simply a movie: this is a cultural touchstone, a landmark of human achievement, and a beautiful work of art realized by one of the few true masters of filmmaking, Francis Ford Coppola. THE GODFATHER comes as close to perfection as any film ever could. The directing, acting, writing, cinematography, editing, set design, etc. etc. etc. are all world-class and I've never seen a film do better. Marlon Brando is stunningly brilliant as Vito Corleone, the aging head of a New York crime family; I only wish he had more screen time. Al Pacino gives one of the most memorable and tragic performances ever put to film as Michael Corleone, the reluctant heir to the throne. The supporting cast all give remarkable performances without exception; but Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and John Cazale stand out the most. This is one you'll want to watch again and again, especially if you love classic auteur filmmaking. If you somehow haven't seen it yet, I both envy and pity you!

Unlike his older brothers ""Sonny Corleone"" (James Caan), ""Fredo Corleone"" (John Cazale) and his adopted brother ""Tom Hagen"" (Robert Duvall), Michael wants no part of the family business and Vito is respectful of that decision. Unfortunately, things don't go quite as planned and-like it or not-Michael is soon thrust into the situation due to matters outside of his control. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an outstanding film which combined great acting with a very deep and intricate plot. And to further illustrate its significance it was honored the following year with three Academy Awards and five Golden Globe Awards as well. In short, this is an excellent movie I strongly recommend it to all viewers looking for a film of this sort."

","This film isn't for everyone, I admit that. But for those who enjoy a good story but don't mind the wait to climax, WATCH THIS.<br/><br/>The story is the portrayal of the fall from grace of Michael Corleone. Michael is a tragic hero. Caught between an innocent outside world and the criminal underground of his family, he makes decisions we would've made as well.<br/><br/>The plotline and characters are worlds in themselves. The city itself serves as a backdrop into the fascinating world that makes this film so great.<br/><br/>The violence is satisfying, the scenery and camera work beautiful. Every scene in this film was a work of curated art. Not to mention the church scene which is instantly a memorable movie scene.<br/><br/>What I especially enjoyed in this film was the dedication to the original book that Mario Puzo wrote. Reading the book after watching the film made me appreciate the attention to detail.<br/><br/>5/5. Beautiful. A must watch."

","It was the first event movie of the 70s, the one multitudes queued up to see, the one whose dialogue, characters and imagery instantly became ingrained in the collective consciousness. It made stars of Pacino and Caan, won Oscars for Picture, Screenplay and Brando, in a triumphant comeback. Shortly after its premiere in 1972 Variety reported, ""The Godfather is an historic smash of unprecedented proportions"". At the time the director, Francis Ford Coppola, was holed up in a hotel writing the screenplay for The Great Gatsby, a job he took to relieve his financial problems because he believed in his movie. He had only been given the film after a lengthy wish-list of veterans including Otto Preminger, Elia Kazan, Fred Zinnemann and Franklin Schaffner turned it down. He perked up when Frank Capra wrote to him, claiming it was, "" Out of this world. I cheered inwardly at scene after scene."""
"farleyf-63082","10","1","1","14 February 2020"," Story Or Poem
","In 1945, at his daughter Connie's wedding to Carlo Rizzi, Don Vito Corleone hears requests in his role as head of a New York crime family. His youngest son, Michael, who was a Marine during World War II, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a famous singer and Vito's godson, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to Los Angeles to persuade studio head Jack Woltz to give Johnny the part. Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion.<br/><br/>Shortly before Christmas, drug baron Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo, backed by the Tattaglia crime family, asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines. Suspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. Brasi is garroted during his first meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo. Later Sollozzo has Vito gunned down in the street, then kidnaps Hagen. With Corleone first-born Sonny in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo's deal, then releases him. The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi's bullet-proof vest, indicating that Luca ""sleeps with the fishes"". Vito survives, and at the hospital, Michael thwarts another attempt on his father. Michael's jaw is broken by NYPD Captain Marc McCluskey, Sollozzo's unofficial bodyguard. Sonny retaliates with a hit on Bruno Tattaglia. Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey; feigning a desire to settle the dispute, Michael meets them in a Bronx restaurant, where after retrieving a planted handgun, he kills both men.<br/><br/>Despite a clampdown by the authorities, the Five Families erupt in open warfare, and Vito fears for his sons' safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily and Fredo is sheltered by Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks Carlo on the street for abusing Connie and threatens to kill him if it happens again. When it does, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and riddled with submachine gunfire. While in Sicily, Michael meets and marries Apollonia Vitelli, but a car bomb intended for him takes her life.<br/><br/>Devastated by Sonny's death and realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant Don Emilio Barzini, Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo too weak, Michael takes the family reins. He insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Tom is not a ""wartime consigliere""; Vito agrees Tom should ""have no part in what will happen"" in the coming battles with rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, he is dismayed to see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family.<br/><br/>In 1955, Vito suffers a fatal heart attack. At the funeral, Salvatore Tessio, a Corleone capo, asks Michael to meet with Don Barzini, signaling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone assassins murder the other New York dons and Moe Greene. Tessio is executed for his treachery and Michael extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini. A Corleone capo, Peter Clemenza, garrotes Carlo with a wire. Connie accuses Michael of the murder, telling Kay that Michael ordered all the killings. Kay is relieved when Michael finally denies it, but when the capos arrive, they address her husband as Don Corleone and she watches them pay reverence to Michael as the newly installed don as they close the door on her."

","I have no doubt in my mind that this film is crucial to the world of movies and the world in general. Every part was gripping, compelling, and emotional.

Even characters who seem as unimportant as Clemenza."

"keirjosephwilson","10","1","1","3 February 2020"," Trust me when I say this film has earned its reputation
","It's very easy to let high expectations get the better of you when you watch a film. Maybe the film is perfectly fine, but nowhere near as good as you had expected, and so you are left with a bitter taste in your mouth when sans these expectations you would have had a fine few hours (looking at you, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood). Or maybe your expectations are simply too high for any film to realistically meet. The Godfather could have easily fallen into one of these two categories. After all, when it comes to films that carry high expectations, it's hard to top The Godfather. And yet, in spite of all that, the film is still a masterpiece that enthralled me for all 3 hours of its runtime. Trust me when I say this film is one of those classics that has earned its legendary reputation. Almost everything about in this film is done to great effect. Even things I don't usually notice (unless they're really bad) like the editing and the sound design are done masterfully, the score is not only beautiful but the film knows when not to use the score and let the tension build, and of course you can't talk about The Godfather without talking about the legendary director and cast. With Francis Ford Coppola at the helm of Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duval, James Caan, John Cazle and Diane Keaton, and an amazing story on top of that it really shouldn't surprise anyone this film is as good as it is. There are so many more things I could say to sing this films praises, and so many more things that deserve praise, so many amazing scenes and so many memorable moments/lines, but really, you should just see the film yourself.<br/><br/>10/10"
"macrompictures","10","1","1","31 January 2020"," A wonder craft and an absolute masterpiece
","Such a complex story, beautifully executed and each and every characters done their job remarkably well. Well acted, well directed, well scripted- basically anything good you can say about a movie can relate to The Godfather.
What makes this film so great is how it develops such a complex character (Michael). He starts out as a war hero, reluctant to head his father's crime empire. Then his father is attacked and just barely survives causing Michael to kill the two men responsible. He runs away to Sicily and marries a woman who is later killed and Michael goes back to America and take up his fathers position as the don of the Corleone crime family. He ultimately sends assassins to kill all of the dons of the other syndicates, completing his descent to an evil gangster. Let us also not forget the ending. Well actually I could go on and on about the baptism scene and the last 5 minutes, so just watch the clips on YouTube (or watch the entire movie). This is my all time favorite film. The sequel is also one of the greatest films of all time. 5/5 stars."

When Sonny is shot to death, the marriage with Michael etc.) But when you step back and look at this being something created in 1972 these events come to life you in a new way, hence the title of a ""classic""<br/><br/>In this movie we see the theme of loyalty to family throughout, showing the viewer the importance of sticking with those we are the closest to. We also get to look at the inside of power struggle between different family members and how people can loose respect for an entire family because of one persons actions.

","This movie could easily be pitched as the most landmark creation in cinematographic history for setting the tone of Social Education in the coming years, given serious cosmetic evolution was just on the cards and more than ever, money just had to sit in the right hands to make social sense. While the thirst for bonafide business ventures has been ripe within mankind for the longest time, it is just a badly kept secret that suckers for reputation almost always fall back on triads and godfathers to save their skin from the vengeance of their hitherto ignorant audience suddenly awaken from their poverty induced deep sleep when outsiders take notice of their insouciance and insiders take notice of their pride. Made at the dawn of the fall of the family as a mega-institution, it insinuates that the appeal in gangsters never lay in the fashion or the thrust but in the starkly bare realisation imperative in their context that money finds you only when have people around you to call family, for what needs to find you needs a road to find you, and the homeless never ever had it easy in times of war and in times of peace! If that's too much of a lesson, Marlon Brando's otherworldly performance is just pure, uncorrupted education in theatre."

"fcjsonl","10","1","1","10 February 2019"," True classic
","One of the most enjoyable movies ever, with deep an interesting charachters and realistic storylines. Quite toned down, no over the top action, but the gradual transformation of Michael into a mafia boss, despite his intent not to become one. An important scence in the beginning, from the wedding, has come to symbolize the type of relationship-based culture for me. Bonasera has been avioding the mob for a long time, but now that his daugther was assaulted, he needs their help. He comes and asks for help, offering money. The Godfather refuses - he does not want money, we wants respect. Debt precedes money as a social institution, according to Graeber. The original way of functioning in an economy was local and very trust-based. These types of institutions, together with a well-developed honor codex are very prevalent in the mafia culture. The gracious, private, inconspicuous nature of the mafia, and their honor of their word are central to their role in society.<br/><br/>The story touches on the American dream. I believe in America. America has made my fortune. Bonasera tells Don Vito who knows well enough that Bonasera earned his financial success through legal means, being a man of integrity and with faith in the American judicial system. Like a good American? who has assimilated in the American way of life, Bonasera raised his daughter in the American fashion and gave her freedom<br/><br/>onasera uses the American Dream and tries to live in it, relish in it, and bask in the glory of it.

I saw this movie and immediately become an addict, watched it at least 3 more times the same week. There is so much to talk about it! I found it hard to think someone doesn't enjoying this one. The cast, the great dialogue, big plot twists, all the emotions, everything makes it just great. This is no a film as many of these times that need a 4K quality to be appealing, you will not waste your time, every minute of the almost 3 hours is worth. You will want even more.
If you haven't watch it, what are you waiting for? (""This is an offer you can't refuse"")"
"poliak-branislav","10","1","1","2 January 2019"," essence of cinema...
","We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of ""The Godfather,"" which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront."
"joeflemming","9","1","1","5 September 2018"," One of the greatest movies of all time
","Rarely has a sequel been better than the original and in this case that is saying a lot. The Godfather 2 has Francis Ford Coppola bettering his original film which is such a tall task seeing as The Godfather was already so well received upon release. All emotions one can find in a life are presented here. Al Pacino is absolutely sublime as Michael Corleone who has taken over the business and family even though he is young. All the actors are so good you cannot fathom anyone else in their roles. The cinematography is exquisite and the direction so good it makes you wonder what happened to Coppola come the 80s. This is a must watch for any person who appreciates cinema."

","I understand that this film has been argued as flawless, but I'm giving it a nine based on two reasons from a personal standpoint. This film can drag on at times which can become a bit dull and Goodfellas I think is a better film so I can't possibly give The Godfather a ten. That being said this film still lives up to the hype. The story is fascinating, the characters are well structured and this movie can really bring out every human emotion in its audience. The runtime be damned, this is a film you can easily watch over and over again."

"MovieManChuck","10","1","1","22 June 2018"," Coppola's Crime Family Classic
","4/4 ESSENTIAL<br/><br/>The Godfather (1972) took many aspects essential to a film and pushed them past anything that had been done before. This movie takes the Corleone family, a mafia of sorts based out of NY, and creates for them an exclusive atmosphere. We get to see the Corleones in their criminal endeavors, interacting with the other crime families in NY, and working to make their family come out on top completely from their point of view. We never feel anything ""civilian"", nothing ever tugs at you that these people are evil. This is due in part to the phenomenal performances of (specifically) Al Pacino and Marlon Brando.<br/><br/>As far as script, any screenplay that can isolate your conscience and also entertain you is truly Grade A for a movie of this genre. Mario Puzo, of course, had experience with this story as it's based on his novel. That made him the obvious and excellent choice. These characters don't feel like actors at any point, they feel like family. Every member of the family has his own strengths and weakness that develop over the course of the movie, and they balance each other out perfectly. It's rare to find a movie with characters this real... nothing feels forced.<br/><br/>Coppola's keen attention to the smallest details makes this movie even more perfect. Look out for oranges appearing in the movie: they will always foreshadow a death in the Corleone family... He will always accompany the tone with lighting (a perfect example being the beginning sequence, which interchanges the mortician's visit to The Godfather and Connie's wedding with Carlos) and colors (darker shades of yellow and velvet are prevalent in most scenes with Don Corleone). Also, in The Godfather, there is a noticeable camera theme: fading drag-shots. Whenever these montages come up, they are accompanied by a very upbeat melody. Coppola borrows this tactic 11 years later when directing The Outsiders (1983).<br/><br/>The Godfather is a true classic, and my all-time favorite movie. It over-delivers and then some. Make a point to see this epic."
"apjc","9","1","1","10 June 2018"," It's the ultimate groundbreaker in mob films.
","Look at the cast, the director and writer, you know full well this is a film to watch, even if it's about an Italian pizzeria. Joking aside this was The Godfather of so many great mob films of later date. Certain well known Italians and Sicilians didn't like it, probably didn't run the studio and couldn't make an offer they can't refuse.Does romanticize these murderous clans somewhat, but does portray the Sicilian honour, blood feud and just business ideology well . This is a must see."
"SubhanBakhtiyarov","10","1","1","6 June 2018"," Literally, A Masterpiece!
","Truth be told, The Godfather doesn't need a review. Without undue emphasis, Francis Ford Coppola's direction, Brando's and Pacino's performances are literally flawless. <br/><br/> The first time I watched ""The Godfather"", I was a child and it was the most astonishing film I'd ever seen. Due to my introversion, I was spending too much leisure time in front of TV, and consequently I watched many films during my childhood. However, I can hardly remember those films. But The Godfather isn't one of them. I remember The Godfather as if I watched it yesterday. The Godfather made me experience feelings of admiration. There is almost no film that has 3 hours running time and didn't bore me. But The Godfather was a breathtaking film for me.<br/><br/> I admire Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo for reducing the thick, best-selling book to the controllable screenplay which anticipated the expectations of the millions who had already read the book. For me, the strength of the Mario Puzo-Francis Ford Coppola script is the unbelievable interaction of all these characters.<br/><br/> Seeing 'The Godfather' is still one of the biggest milestones of the film industry 46 years after its release confirms the film's status as an outdated masterpiece.<br/><br/> Whenever I see it, it becomes better and impeccable."

","Is The Godfather my favorite film ever made? No, but it definitely is one of the best movies out there. Not only does it follow an incredibly complex story, but it is filmed beautifly, and the acting from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is brilliant. If you call yourself a film buff and haven't seen The Godfather, you definitely have some work to do.
 I saw The Godfather for the first time when I was probably around 14 or 15, and had some trouble fully grasping why people love it so much. But again, I was young and probably just thought to myself, oh, the movie's old so it's boring. Boring however is definitely not a word to describe this film. It is the complete opposite of boring, with more suspense than just about any other movie ever made. Coppola did not want a movie which was from start to finish mafia gangsters shooting at each other, but instead a movie that makes you bite your nails either hoping for a character to survive or the opposite... The characters (originally from Mario Puzo's book) are either characters you root for, or they are terrible people who don't deserve to live. One of the humanizing elements that is critical to numerous characters in the film is their love for their families. Marlon Brando's character of Vito Corleone is a terrible man, who has had dozens if not hundreds of people killed before, but he has a deep love and care for his family.
 To sum up what I think about this film without spoiling anything, even if you're not into the mafia genre, if you are a person who claims to like film, this movie is absolutely a must see."

","Coppola's crime saga is sweeping in scale yet intimate in scope, focusing as much on family dynamics as mafia machinations, and is all the more impactful for it. 'The Godfather (1972)' honestly feels epic, despite the fact that its relatively few key events are all quite contained (considering it spans nearly three-hours.) This effect is hard to put your finger on but certainly tangible, especially in retrospect; it really feels as though you've witnessed a journey, the beginning of an empire or at least a transitioning period within it, in a way which few films have achieved. It's actually a fair while before we learn anything out-rightly illegitimate is actually transpiring, though, and even then its all treated so casually that it really does feel just like the family business. That's a real strength of the picture, too: how little it relies on needless exposition to convey its characters or world. It is refreshing to get a truly inside perspective on sometimes unseemly events without ever being bombarded with morality, but instead trusted to make up our own minds about several situations that are shaded in grey. While the piece is a little long and can sometimes meander, several explosive sequences and character-driven moments add up, in equal measure, to an excellent experience overall that has defined the gangster genre. It is regarded a classic for good reason. 9/10"
"BonaFideBOSS","10","1","1","22 November 2017"," Best movie of all time
","""THE GODFATHER"" is the best movie of all time because this movie got the most splendid crew. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, Francis Ford Coppola (Director), Mario Puzo the author of the book ""The Godfather"" on which the movie is based on, Nino Rota (composer). This is a TRUE MAFIA FAMILY drama movie. Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of Italian art cinema, THE GODFATHER is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release. Nino Rota's score, the sumptuous set design, and Pacino's raspy pseudo- whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory."

It provides a great story of the mob that was actually based on real- life gangsters and it provides the movie fan a view about gangsterism. Added to that,we also will get intrigued on the transformation of Michael from a war hero and an idealistic young man into ruthless and cold-hearted character as he assumes the position of the Godfather.The story clearly explains everything from the moment that his father Don Vito was almost assassinated until he decided to kill enemies of the family such as Virgin Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey and the untimely death of his Sicilian wife Apollonia,who was killed when the car she was driving was bombed. Aside from having a great story,there were a lot of interesting characters in addition to Don Vito and Michael such as Sonny Corleone,Tom Hagen,Kay Adams-Corleone, Connie Corleone and many others.Great performances by the thespians who portrayed them contributed a lot to these colorful characters.Finally,the script written by Coppola and Puzo remain memorable after many years as many of the dialogues continue to be popular such as ""I will given him an offer he cannot refuse"" and many others.No question that the screenplay being imitated and lampooned for so many years is a testament to its continuous popularity.<br/><br/>After having stated all these characteristics of cinematic excellence,there is no question that ""The Godfather"" remains to arguably the best film ever made."

It's the Corleone family against Barzini and Tattaglia and 3 other mob leaders. The Corleone family is the biggest most powerful mafia family in New York, and the family you turn to if you need a problem to disappear. A lot of blood is spilled and Don Vito Corleone also known as the Godfather (Brandon Marlon) is almost killed in a shooting by another gang. Mike and Sonny are his sons. Sonny is his right hand at first until one day when he gets killed by a gang after going after his sisters boyfriend for assaulting her. Then Mike steps in and takes over, Don Vito gets older and more cripple and soon he dies too, that's when Mike (Al Pacino) becomes the new Godfather, and kills the 5 mafia leaders, to take control over New York, and eliminate all potential threats. <br/><br/>Ah, I just love this movie, slow pace and leaves nothing for your imagination (sometimes I don't like that about a film, but it works in this one).

"stormhawk2019","10","1","1","19 June 2017"," A timeless classic
","The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father's life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organized crime. Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster saga is the story of a criminal dynasty headed by Marlon Brando in one of his most iconic roles. Coppola's direction is deceptively simple in that he uses no gimmicks or stylistic tricks; he merely allows the story to unfold and lets the superb cast do their thing. Brando's mumbling family and loyalty obsessed don has since become part of popular culture folklore (along with the classic score) and all other accompanying performances are top notch, from James Caan's hot headed Santino to Robert Duval's purely business orientated adviser. But this film is really the story of Michael's transition from honest war hero to shadowy underworld figure, played by Al Pacino in his finest role. The pivotal scene in which his newborn godson is baptized while Michael himself, the newborn ""Godfather"", is baptized in blood is an all time great. This is the birth of the modern gangster film and with the possible exception of Goodfellas, it is still to be surpassed."

The Godfather is, to my mind, superior filmmaking because of its propulsive narrative and iconic characters.<br/><br/>What makes ""The Godfather"" great is that the characters in it know they are doing evil things, but rationalize it to themselves that ""the end justifies the means"". Coppola makes the hypocrisy and utterly failed values system pretty clear. A baptism inter-cut with scenes of murder...Vito Corleone is at his daughter's wedding, but sits there planning brutal mob stuff in his office...leave the gun take the cannoli...OK to cheat on your wife but ""dont discuss business at the table"" and so on.<br/><br/>I had to watch this movie several times before I completely ""got"" it. The plot alone is very difficult to follow with all of the questions it raises. However it is one of those movies that rewards the viewers with those very questions for us to ponder and with its richness of story and character. The questions are about how people who regard themselves as ""good"" can do terrible things and justify it to themselves. ""The Godfather"" posits one of the universal problems in life - what is the nature of evil, and how can we recognize it in all its forms? How can people who do evil things think of themselves as basically ""good"" , how can they lie to themselves as they do?<br/><br/>Central to all of this is the metamorphosis of Michael Corleone. He starts out as the returned all American WWII soldier with the respectable but outsider (in reference to ""The Family"") girlfriend, Kay, and by just doing what he thinks he must do to protect his family, one thing leads to another, and he ends up the cynical head of the Corleone crime family, morally miles from where he was when we first meet him."

","I am not a big fan of the sequels even the second is a big step down from this one. What a cast? Like an earlier reviewer said; REWATCHABLE!! Yes, I am Italian, not a Sicilian, and I have seen it hundreds of times. What a cast: Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall. Even the supporting cast is excellent with the film noir legend Richard Conte as Barzini. Puzo wrote such a rich, deep script. The characters suck you in and are so lifelike. Each brother is radically different from the other. Fredo, the mama's boy, the useless one who Michael kills off in the second one. Sonny, the human volcano, with a temper that has to be seen to be believed. Michael, the quiet and deadly one most like Vito but colder more ruthless. Michael was always outside the family looking in; he was held in contempt by the rest as the soft college boy who didn't want to get his hands dirty. This is the answer to the riddle of how he could kill Fredo, his own brother, later in the second one. Notice where he sits at the wedding, as far away from the family as he can get."

","Marlon Brando's old flame that has glowed for years, and flickered along a trail bumpy with mediocre pictures, shines higher and brighter than ever. The old irresistible magic is revived in Paramount's ""The Godfather"" in his intuitive grasp of Mario Puzo's Don Corleone, a living symbol of the poetic translation of his name, the lionhearted.<br/><br/>Brando is cool as the godfather, sagacious head of the Corleone ""family,"" most powerful of the five ""families"" of organized crime in New York. He is relaxed as the loving, indulgent patriarch of his large blood family, in his mansion behind an iron fence in Long Beach, L.I. And he is terrifically appealing as the man who cheats death, recovers from bullet wounds inflicted by a rival gang, recuperates at home to enjoy his garden and grandchildren until he dies of old age.

","The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father's life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organised crime. Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster saga is the story of a criminal dynasty headed by Marlon Brando in one of his most iconic roles. Coppola's direction is deceptively simple in that he uses no gimmicks or stylistic tricks; he merely allows the story to unfold and lets the superb cast do their thing. Brando's mumbling family and loyalty obsessed don has since become part of popular culture folklore (along with the classic score) and all other accompanying performances are top notch, from James Caan's hot headed Santino to Robert Duval's purely business orientated adviser. But this film is really the story of Michael's transition from honest war hero to shadowy underworld figure, played by Al Pacino in his finest role. The pivotal scene in which his newborn godson is baptised while Michael himself, the newborn ""Godfather"", is baptised in blood is an all time great. This is the birth of the modern gangster film and with the possible exception of Goodfellas, it is still to be surpassed."
"looeydoggy","Null","1","1","21 September 2016"," Godfather Review
","The Godfather is simply put a masterpiece. I would highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't had the chance to enjoy Coppola's best movie. First off, the actor's performances are top notch. Al-Gore especially does an amazing job as Michael, always wearing a serious face, really becoming a very professional gangster. The other actors also contribute immensely to the film but none stand out quite like Robert Duvall, Besides Al-Gore. From humble beginnings as Bo Riddley, Duvall really has come a far way as he plays the character of Tom Hagen, Lawyer of the mob. Next there's the shots. Almost all shots have a purpose, from the beginning shot over the godfather's shoulder to slowly approaching a man sleeping with his horse's head. Similar to how shots serve a purpose to the movies progression, so do props. An iconic prop from the godfather are the oranges. Coppola places oranges in scenes to foreshadow that something bad is about to happen, like when the godfather gets shot he's buying oranges! The sound track was also very well done. The violins really give a mobby feel and how the music built up during certain scenes really helped build up tension.(Spoilers) My favorite parts of the movie were when they hit the driver near the statue of liberty, when Michael kills the opposing mob boss and cop, The final scene when Michael closes the door on his girlfriend, and finally, my favorite, the epic finale where each mob boss is killed of one by one as Michael becomes a literal godfather to his sister's child and the godfather of the mob. Overall, I really enjoyed the Godfather for doing everything right, 10 out of 10"

","The Godfather (including Part 2 for purpose of this review) is probably the most analysed film of all time, so really I don't see the point in repeating any of the rhetorics. Rather, what I intend to provide here is my honest two cents of this film.<br/><br/>The Godfather is not an easy film to watch, so it baffled me at that time of watching for the first time (and still baffles me to this day) how it is so universally loved by almost anyone who has watched it. Firstly, there are so many characters that I gave up remembering anyone other than the Corleone family. Secondly, the script is so subtle and tight that the moment I missed a single sentence, I did not get the next scene. It was no easy feat to follow every sentence given the frequent mutterings, so subtitles are almost indispensable. In the end, I pretty much referred to the plot synopsis every 5 minutes.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, the reasons above are also what probably makes the Godfather regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. It just surprises me how a film as subtle as the Godfather has received just as much attention as 'lighter' classics such as Star Wars, Pulp Fiction, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, etc.<br/><br/>Ultimately, my verdict is that the Godfather is a great, iconic film from the 70s era, but my honest take is that the Godfather is perhaps a little over-hyped (not overrated, but over-hyped) to the extent that it gets more exposure than some of the other equally great films from the olden era. For that, the Godfather is a great film, but is not in my consideration for the greatest film of all time."

","The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name. It stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone, focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss.<br/><br/>Paramount Pictures obtained the rights to the novel before it gained popularity for the price of $80,000. Studio executives had trouble finding a director, as their first few candidates turned down the position. They and Coppola disagreed over who would play several characters, in particular Vito and Michael. Filming was done on location and completed earlier than scheduled. The musical score was composed primarily by Nino Rota with additional pieces by Carmine Coppola.<br/><br/>The film was the highest-grossing film of 1972 and was for a time the highest-grossing film ever made. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando) and Best Adapted Screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola). Its seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. It was followed by sequels The Godfather Part II (1974) and Part III (1990).<br/><br/>The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema and one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre. It was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990 and is ranked the second-greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute."

","""The Godfather,"" a 1970s film detailing the struggles of a Mafia family in post-World War II New York City, not only changed the face of cinema forever, but also resurrected a genre that had been dead since the Howard Hughes mafia opus ""Scarface"" hit the silver screen in the 1930s.<br/><br/>Directed by then-novice Francis Ford Coppola, future mastermind behind ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Tucker,"" and ""Youth Without Youth,"" ""The Godfather"" not only demonstrates poise and expertise in writing and directing but also in acting. Coppola put his career on the line fighting with power- hungry studio executives to get the actors he felt fit the roles. <br/><br/>Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone, youngest son of don Vito Corleone, expertly immerses himself in his character, down to the way he walks and talks, carries himself, and even shoots a gun in the famous ""gun behind the toilet"" assassination scene. Marlon Brando as the elder Corleone gives one of the greatest performances in cinematic history. With Robert Duvall as mild-mannered family consigliere Tom Hagen, and James Caan as the hotheaded Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone, every part is well cast and executed to perfection.<br/><br/>Not only are the acting, writing, and directing top-notch, but so is the way the film is carried with great setting, music, and a feeling of authenticity. As Michael travels the picturesque hills of 1940s Sicily, ""Speak Softly Love,"" the famous tune by Nino Rota, transports audiences into the beautiful but deadly world of upper-class criminals. Everything in the film is well timed and well placed, offering the audience a portal into a life filled with twists and turns. <br/><br/>""The Godfather"" also reflects the fact that Coppola collaborated well with Mario Puzo, the author of the novel, and Coppola did a plethora of research to ensure the authenticity of his mobsters. The actors talk, eat, sleep, and kill like real-world criminals, embodying the swagger of high-rolling Italian mobsters. The dialogue flows from their lips as if Al Capone or Jon Gotti said it. <br/><br/>""The Godfather"" will go down in history as one of the most well made films of all time."

","I have dissected this film, piece by piece. This is a film that can be seen several times, and each time, you take something else from the film. It's incredibly difficult to digest all of the beautiful layers that make The Godfather so special. There are thousands of films out there that are cut-n-dry. Basically, what u see is what u get....no less, no more. While, if u don't have an understanding of organized crime and its origin, u will most likely overlook the remarkable accuracy of the film. The life that is portrayed in The Godfather was very real, for many many years. However, as yrs went by, organized crime families, in America, began slowly straying from their core values...i.e., family, ""Omerta"" (code of silence), secrecy, respect, loyalty, etc. The Godfather illustrates life in the mafia during the 1st half of the 20th Century, where as a film like Goodfellas, shows mafia life during the 2nd half of the 20th Century. The Godfather is a film loaded w legendary actors who perform a script that's full of substance & grace, both, written & directed, by the great Francis Ford Coppola. Movies like, The Godfather, come around only a handful of times during a lifetime. Cinematic masterpiece."

","Everyone at some point will see ""The Godfather"" unless they live under a rock. This classic beginning of an epic trilogy beholds a crime story unlike any other for one reason: it doesn't view the crimes as crimes. Francis Ford Coppola shows the business end behind the Italian mafia after WW II. Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) passes his organized crime dynasty to to his reluctant son Michael (Al Pacino) after tensions rise between his fellow Mafia families. This epic reflects a struggle between a family caught up in crime and portrays the consequences that erupt due to such activity. Coppola engages audiences with the settings he portrays with wonderful music and camera work that helps tension rise and lets viewers experience the characters' emotions. Unlike many other films made in the seventies, ""The Godfather"" gets its production value right. It has fantastic costumes and sets that allow you to engage in the characters' conflicts. But what this film does best is show the devastation of a family enlisted in a horrible business that can prove fatal. It makes you rethink everything you know about mafia and show a humanized version of real people who, due to their family, end up doing bad things. This isn't a film about bad people. It's a film about people doing bad things, all in the name of business."

","We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of ""The Godfather,"" which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.<br/><br/>The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.<br/><br/>Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.<br/><br/>But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whispery, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.<br/><br/>The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although ""The Godfather"" is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races).<br/><br/>The success of ""The Godfather"" as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garrotings.<br/><br/>Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so ""The Godfather"" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they'd tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn't have worked. But it's uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish-brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.<br/><br/>Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other."

","amazing movie The Godfather is a 1972 American crime drama film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945–55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito Based on Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name, The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema[6]— and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre.[7] The film ranks #1 on Empire magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.[8] Ranked second to Citizen Kane by the American Film Institute in 2007,[9] it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1990 as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".<br/><br/>The film was the box office leader for 1972 and for a time, was the highest-grossing picture ever made. It won three Academy Awards for that year: Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando) and in the category Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Its nominations in seven other categories included Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. The success spawned two sequels: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in 1990."

","While some may claim showing the scenes in reverse is just an annoying trick to make a simple plot confusing and add a plethora of twists, I wholeheartedly disagree. Any good story teller knows it's not what you say, but how you say it.<br/><br/>By playing the scenes in reverse you experience the confusion Lenny undergoes throughout the film. Showing some of the scenes in chronological order (BTW, the use of B&W instead of color to make the time distinction was ingenious) creates suspense which builds as the two time lines converge. The somewhat rushed pace (compared to a written format) doesn't give you enough time to adequately analyze the events during the movie. This has two advantages: firstly you're going to talk about it after you leave the theater adding to experience immensely, and secondly you don't have time to think about what has happened (will happen) so you're experience better follows that of Lenny."

","The Godfather is one of the rare movie which makes us sympathize the evil. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) gives out the steam of a real mafia Don. The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): ""Don't ever take sides against the family."" Like Babe Ruth is to baseball, like John Steinbeck is to writing, their is no doubt about it, The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. Never before have we seen performances so stellar, by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and everyone else! The Godfather has little life lessons everywhere. Along with an engaging plot, that just completes the most critically acclaimed film of all time. The Godfather is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece."

","Marlon Brando's old flame that has glowed for years, and flickered along a trail bumpy with mediocre pictures, shines higher and brighter than ever. The old irresistible magic is revived in Paramount's ""The Godfather"" in his intuitive grasp of Mario Puzo's Don Corleone, a living symbol of the poetic translation of his name, the lionhearted.<br/><br/>Brando is cool as the godfather, sagacious head of the Corleone ""family,"" most powerful of the five ""families"" of organized crime in New York. He is relaxed as the loving, indulgent patriarch of his large blood family, in his mansion behind an iron fence in Long Beach, L.I. And he is terrifically appealing as the man who cheats death, recovers from bullet wounds inflicted by a rival gang, recuperates at home to enjoy his garden and grandchildren until he dies of old age. Once he comes out of seclusion, to warn chiefs of the five ""families"" that the gang war must stop.<br/><br/>Brando is the strong magnet that will draw fans to ""The Godfather."" But behind-the-scenes creativity is of equal value to this film of towering proportions.<br/><br/>The immensity of the project must have been staggering, but producer Albert S. Ruddy, director Francis Ford Coppola and screenwriter Mario Puzo, with Coppola, make it seem easy."
"callumjcunningham","10","1","1","13 April 2016"," Cracking Film
","Glorious film in a glorious trilogy. Couldn't leave my bed to get a drink whilst watching this masterpiece which was a shame because I got rather parched. It was pleasant watching Mike turn from a War Hero to a cold-blooded gangster-murdering wife-beating badass. Unfortunately his brother Sunshine wasn't as lucky and received quite an excessive amount of metal shot at him but he was a bit of a dick so I was fine with that and it looked cool, good way to go imo. Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) seemed like a good bloke but changed drastically in his spin off film Apocalypse Now which also starred Vito, which took me by surprise since I thought he was probably too old and too dead to be fighting the Vietnamese commies but then again he did survive a drive-by, unlike his sun sunshine, so I don't see why he couldn't survive a small heart attack so I guess it makes sense. Overall I'd say it was a good watch although I did cry when Luca Brasi died whilst swimming, not surprised though he was a large chap."

","This film really opened my eyes to the drama of beautiful cinematography and how compelling you can make an image simply with the framing. Having each shot tell its own story is an incredible element towards crafting an excellent film. In addition to the cinematography, I became a huge fan of Brando because of this film. I read that he used some personal techniques to craft his character and I really admire that now that I am looking for ways to make my own screen-time unique and dynamic. I wish films would continue to use The Godfather as a model for good cinema. There is something missing from modern movie-making that can be rediscovered by watching films like this."

","Prometheus, gave fire to humanity, a cherished and imperative gift for a foolish civilization that much needed it. Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo also gave a gift to humanity, a gift that should be the object of study of film students, an epic and dramatic visual tale for film lovers, and an incentive to appreciate cinema in its brightest and purest form for those who are willing to forget their lives for a little under 3 hours.<br/><br/>The Godfather never gets old, and I believe it never will. It has withstood the test of time and never truly feels like a film of over 40 years of history. At times, this masterpiece begins to resemble fine wine, seemingly acquiring a better taste as it ages on.<br/><br/>Its dialogue profoundly feels like discourse directly taken from the streets of New York at the beginning of the century. The cinematography and the acting feel exceptionally natural, and along with a cohesive and coherent pacing, these components make the flow of the film feel like a river in its calmest days: smooth, beautiful and noble. Every shot in the film faithfully serves a greater purpose; every shot feels like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle that never breaks apart.<br/><br/>The ambition of the storytelling surpasses, I believe, its own expectations. It provides a sense of wonder, of fascination, nothing short of admiration. Despite having seen the film for over easily 30 times, every time I place my eyes and ears over that glorious opening scene, I can't help but feel like a child going to the beach for the first time, or a teenager going on a road trip; I feel a roller-coaster under my seat in its peak, waiting slowly to descend into the sublime. Very few stories can relate in terms of value.<br/><br/>The characterization manifests itself over the course of a film in brilliant ways, exploiting the strengths and weaknesses of every one of its characters superbly. Even the minor characters have moments of spectacle. The motivations of each character come to life in outstanding takes, and not one of them ever truly feels expendable.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a colossus, perhaps the summit of filmmaking. It is something every individual can appreciate, from its little details to its grand climax. It is something to be remembered for generations to come. It is something that will likely be unmatched for a great many years."

The story shows how a man balances his work and family so well keeping in mind that his business is full of threat. Character of Vito Corleone defines what a real man is like and on the other hand Character of Michael Corleone shows how to contain anger and utilize it in most lethal way possible. This Story also shows how the mafia families have ruled the cities with both good and bad to their characters.The early life and career of Vito Corleone in 1920s New York is portrayed while his son, Michael, expands and tightens his grip on his crime syndicate stretching from Lake Tahoe, Nevada to pre-revolution 1958 Cuba. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen."

"suleiman-96114","10","1","1","16 January 2016"," Best Movie!
","The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.<br/><br/>The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.<br/><br/>Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.<br/><br/>But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whispery, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.<br/><br/>The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although ""The Godfather"" is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races).<br/><br/>The success of ""The Godfather"" as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garrotings.<br/><br/>Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so ""The Godfather"" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they'd tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn't have worked. But it's uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish-brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.<br/><br/>Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other."
"sterankofrank","10","1","1","14 January 2016"," Best Movie ever
","This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..<br/><br/>With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on a lot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..<br/><br/>Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.<br/><br/>This is definitely a ""must see"" masterpiece."

","The Godfather is a Crime/Drama movie that was released on March 24, 1971. The movie was directed by Francis Ford Coppola, and written by Mario Puzo and Franics Ford Coppola. This movie won several awards which include: Academy Awards, USA 1971; Golden Globes, USA 1973; BAFTA Awards 1973; David di Donatello 1973; Directors Guild of America, USA 1973, and many others. Main actors in this movie are Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, James Caan as Sonny Corleone, and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen.<br/><br/>The movie takes place within the world of organized crime. This movie shows an inside point of view of the mafia world. Mr. Vito Corleone (main character) is a powerful man who is viewed as a man who is sympathetic, successful, and a loving family man. Mr. Corleone takes good care of his friends and family and in no way (through the whole movie) would do anything that reasonable people would disapprove of. Mr. Corleone takes revenge, executes, or teaches lessons to the ones who betray him in any way. This movie is not a typical crime/drama movie as it doesn't show victimization to anyone not involved in organized crime. Typical crime/drama movies do show victims such as women enslaved into prostitution, families torn apart by a family member who is addicted to gambling, drugs, or alcohol, and sometimes just innocent bystanders. <br/><br/>The editing in this movie was very appropriate as the scenes transitioned smoothly throughout the entire movie. From beginning to end, the sequence of every scene was put nicely in place and made perfect sense for the viewer to understand where the story was going and why. Every single sound effect used was played well within each scene, making the scene effective in making it seem real to the viewer. When there are outdoor scenes the viewer can hear the wind, birds, traffic, and other outdoor noises. When the scenes take place indoors, the viewer can hear the footsteps, door shutting or opening, and other indoor noises, which are appropriate for the scene. When watching the movie, the viewer can see and feel the strong family ties, the loyalty within a social circle, and the betrayal. The movie makes it seem as if it is okay to get rid of those who do you wrong, it is okay to tell white lies, it is okay to do something that is wrong to protect your loved one. <br/><br/>The cinematography of this movie was smooth with all scenes because they did close-up scenes whenever necessary, and in every single scene the viewer can follow the story to the next scene without wondering what is going on or why. There are some bloody and violent scenes; however, that is typical of crime/drama movies. Culture plays a big part in this movie, as there are parts where people are speaking Italian and are doing traditional cultural things such as in the wedding scenes when people are dancing and singing at Connie's wedding. There are also the scenes when Mike is in Italy, and he has to talk formally to the girl's father for permission to date her, the traditional visits to the girl's home and family and the traditional Italian wedding.<br/><br/>The movie is trying to influence the viewer to believe that there are good people who have good morals and family values in the mafia world, and that it is okay to do something that is wrong or breaks the law in order to keep your family or friends safe or away from harm's way. I am not a big fan of mafia movies, and my opinion will not change about organized crime. I do know they have families, and they love them, but that does not make it okay to break the law in any way. The Godfather is a good movie to watch just for the fun of it, for good entertainment, or just because you like watching good movies to kill time, no pun intended."

","This movie is one that has got to be on anyone's bucket list. It is a masterpiece that will never be able to be paralleled in film making history.

Personally my favorite death was the one of Luca Brasi, where he will be sleeping with the fishes along side Solozzo and Captain Mccluskey who were of course killed by good guy Michael! The death that saddened me the most was the one of Sonny played by James Caan. With his temper he was able to keep me engaged and entertained throughout. He was probably my favorite character.

This is a standard ""cause and effect"" progression with each scene logically leading to the next having characters with differing goals clashing, and obtaining help from other characters to resolve conflicts and meet their ultimate goals. As a result, the characters' individual actions as well as group interaction help move the movie along."

","Great movie, lots of emotions, incredible film. Though Marlon Brando's appearance adds up to the whole movie and makes it something wonderful, the trilogy is still great. A masterpiece and a great piece of ART. This movies travels you to the depicted age and era. It gives you the feeling of completeness although you never actually find closure in the film since nothing actually comes to an end. Wish that even more of such films would find their way to the cinemas, but these days these kinds of pieces of art are no more the main target of producers. Finally a great job by Nino Puzo for writing the novels. A fantastic job overall."
"dboccuti","9","1","1","30 September 2013"," The Godfather.
","The Godfather is a classic movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It's about a mobster family where the whole family is involved except one, because he's a college student. The family didn't want to involve him because he had a good educated head on his shoulders. When his father is out one day, there is a mafia hit on him; however things don't go as planned exactly. Long story short, the dad ends up in the hospital and the educated son feels the need to get involved and help his father out. To my surprise, the son who didn't want to be involved finds himself completely wrapped up in the mafia lifestyle. <br/><br/>Shockingly due to previous mob movies that were not as popular with the box office, Paramount Pictures was very hesitant to adapt this film. It was a good thing they did because this was the start up to many successful mob movies. Mario Puzo is the author of the book ""The Godfather"" and thanks to the success from the book, the movie was able to be produced. In my opinion, I love the cast. Al Pacino is an amazing actor and he is known for mafia movies. I was shocked to find out he was almost fired from being in this movie! I can't imagine what it would have been like without him. All of the cast took their roles really seriously and met a lot of mobsters to really get the feel of the role.<br/><br/>One of the most important thematic elements is the very first scene when the bride's dad goes into the room to ask a favor from the Godfather. This is important because it shows how respected and powerful the Godfather really is. That scene was really good for character development and plot. Italian lifestyle is a big part in this movie and one of the ways its portrayed is through the language. Throughout the movie there are some parts that are fully in Italian. Even if you're not Italian after watching this movie you'll be sure to feel like you are. Violence is a big thematic element in this movie. It is constantly happening in almost every other scene. Violence and death are big parts in the Italian/ mafia lifestyle and thats how it always was and always will be. <br/><br/>A very important scene happens right off the bat, Coppola didn't waste anytime! The father is shot, and was supposed to be killed. This is the motivation for the sons change of heart and priorities in life. Another important scene is when Michael goes to visit his father in the hospital bed. While he's in here he has his eureka moment and saves his fathers life. All in the same five minutes another important scene takes place. As Michael was leaving the hospital he runs into a dirty cop who is also in touch with the mafia, and there is an altercation, you'll have to watch to see what happens next! When Michael gets up his confidence, another crazy scene takes place. Michael became sneaky and learned the ways of the mafia. He goes into a sit down with the guys that are above him on the mafia ranking and when he goes to the bathroom he takes the gun that he planted prior to the sit-down and kills all the men at the table. Obviously this is a key point because it shows Michael's growth. The last important scene happens after a lot of deaths take place. There is really no one left in the family so the responsibility of running the family business falls into Michael's hands. <br/><br/>This movie has a lot of story lines which only makes the movie more interesting. Obviously the mafia is a big one. In the first minute were in the room with the Godfather, the boss. Another storyline that unfolds is family relationships. The son, Michael didn't want anything to do with the mafia but once his father got involved he had to do what was right and stand by his father and help out anyway possible. Business is another storyline that keeps the movie moving. The Godfather's famous line is ""I'm going to make you an offer, you can't refuse."" Every time the Godfather says this you know some type of business exchange is about to go down.<br/><br/>I think the director did an amazing job of putting all of these story lines together. There was never a dull moment in the film from the first five minutes to the last. It wasn't like he added unnecessary scenes or additional story lines to make the movie more interesting, everything had a purpose and had me at the edge of my seat the whole three hours!<br/><br/>The most important relationship that is developed in this film is the relationship between Michael and not only his father, but the whole family. He was always the outcast of the family because he never wanted to live the Italian lifestyle but as the movie rolls on, he becomes closer and closer to the lifestyle and more importantly, his family. By the end of the movie Michael's life becomes the whole family business, and let's just say there's a new Godfather in town."

","Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi- generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. One of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes, The Godfather gets everything right; not only did the movie transcend expectations, it established new benchmarks for American cinema. Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told."

This subsequently lead to the creation of some of the most innovative & influential films during the 20th Century. Among the list of 20th Century masterpieces is the critically-acclaimed film The Godfather (1972). Based on the novel by Mario Puzo & directed by Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather breaks all norms of the film industry. A phenomenal cast, a powerful soundtrack and an enriching plot propels The Godfather into a high standard of films. By the end of the film, the audience would be persuaded to sympathize with the Corleone family & their ""business"".

","The Godfather was an excellent film. I very much enjoy a good organized crime film. I think it was a break out roll for Alpacino who played Michael Corelone the son to the Don (Marlon Brando). I must say it made me wonder if the Italian mafia world really exists, and if so is this real in-site. There were some parts that could have been left out, I did feel the wedding scene was being dragged out, I understand that was the only day the Don would grant wishes. I still give it a 10 even the beginning was a slow start. In my opinion I do believe Michael made a good Don, and we all knew once the Don had an attempt on his life he would not fully recover from it. Sonny (James Caan) the eldest son to the Don was groomed to take his father's place if a tragedy were to happen to him, so i was very surprised and a little sadden when he was ambushed and murdered on his way to protect his sister. I think this movie gave some real in-site to a gangster's paradise. It showed how the power can change from one individual to the next in a blink of an eye.How ironic the one son whom wanted nothing to do with his fathers lifestyle, who went to college and fought in the war, was the son who ended up filling his shoes. I would recommend this movie for viewing as well as Thr Godfather II to explore Michael's Journey as the new Don Corelone."

","It's a great film in the history of film. Such a well sculpted film- making. Must watch to experience the true art of film. What I loved about it was the story telling, not exaggerating the crimes, taking the tones seriously and the artful cinematography. Marlon Brando again defined acting and the range of acting. Al Pacino became a star through this film for his extravagant and powerful performance. The production was so neat, the timing of the dialogue. It lives up to the expectation of Mario Puzo's novel. Some of the scenes were so real and eye-opening. It really explores thorough the darkness of human behavior. This is a ""MUST SEE"" movie don't miss it."
"JamesLeeCooper","10","1","1","14 June 2013"," Excellent Movie
","I just want to say that is the fantastic movie. If you wonder the old New York and mafias you're not going to be regret for watching this film. In the movie they're summarizing Italian's Life in 30's. Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap- operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10."
"theonewithallthecontacts","10","1","1","16 March 2013"," A masterpiece! A cinematic achievement not matched, nor bettered!
","The year was 1972. Francis Ford Coppola was in the beginning of this career, and he was only in the process of proving himself as a director. Little did he know, that he was going to direct a movie which would go down as possibly THE most beloved and acclaimed film of all time. The movie was ""The Godfather"". It became the highest grossing film of the year 1972, and of all time (in 1972)! It won 3 Oscars: Best Actor (Marlon Brando), Best Adapted Screenplay (Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola) and Best Picture (Albert S. Ruddy). Unfortunately, Coppola did not take home the gold for directing, nor did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall or James Caan for their brilliant supporting roles! But Oscars really doesn't matter, the movie still stands as a piece of cinematic brilliance! <br/><br/>The Godfather tells a relatively simple tale: Michael Corleone (Pacino) is son of the powerful mafia don Vito Corleone (Brando). Michael recently returned from the WW2, and he wants nothing to do with the ""family business"". Vito doesn't want that either, but after a chain of events, Michael is forced to rise as the new family don, in order to protect his family and allies from downfall. The movie doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. It's a simple plot, it's one we can all understand and it's still en epic gangster movie! And that's the other thing about the film: it's very epic in scope! All the locations, all the props, all the actors, etc. It all comes together to create something magical! <br/><br/>Al Pacino keys in an amazing performance as Michael, the son who must protect his family! At first eye-drop one could call his performance ""low-key"". But it's merely an observation of the characters calmness, subtlety and his cold nature, that transforms into a calculating, ruthless and chilling persona. Apparently, Pacino approached the role with this thought. For my money, this was an Academy Award-worthy performance. Marlon Brando is equally impressing as Vito Corelone. His performance is calm, determined and calculated. But Brando doesn't only present Vito Corleone as a clichÃ© ruthless mafioso don, but also as a father that loves his family, and that the audience can admire and care for. Robert Duvall, James Caan, Talia Shire, John Gazale and Diane Keaton is also presented as capable and great characters! Everyone gets tons of character development, and their performances are spectacular!<br/><br/>Nino Rota's haunting score perfectly illustrates what kind of film we're dealing with here, and every time you hear it the score feels new and epic! This has got to be one of the most memorable film scores of all time! The cinematography is beautiful, the sound is fantastic and overall The Godfather is a truly beautiful film to admire! <br/><br/>Puzo and Coppola's screenplay is brilliant and filled with memorable lines: ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"", ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli"" and ""It's not personal Sonny, it's strictly business"". Francis Ford Coppola truly captures the feeling of a spaghetti gangster movie, and his direction is brilliant, tireless and visible in every scene! Twentieth Century Fox wanted to replace him several times during production, but thankfully they didn't! He was robbed an Oscar!<br/><br/>The Godfather is a movie that will never grow old, and we will be able to watch if for many years to come! It always feels fresh and exiting every time you watch it! From the first monologue by Bonasera, to the last shot of Michael Corleone as the new don, this movie leaves you shattered by the perfection. Saying The Godfather is a perfect movie, is like saying Chuck Norris is badass. See my point? A must-watch for everyone! <br/><br/>10/10"
"che-hooman","9","1","1","14 March 2013"," One word, 'Perfect'!
","This is considered my favorite movie and to many others, no wonder why The Godfather was considered to be the Perfect movie, cause of Frances Ford Coppola's Unquestionable direction and the film's story of the family business and a human story as well! This is the holy grail of gangster films that is to me and everyone, a real unforgettable classic! Excellent movie, quality acting, screenplay,depth of characters, locations! Producer,director,music,all excellent. It will be a long time before this movie is exceeded in all these facets. Current films do not come close in matching Francis Ford Cappola's masterpiece. Mr.Cappola's refusal make another film only reflects great decision making in the industry. Many film makers in the future should emulate the overall quality shown in ""The Godfather""."

","How does one begin to describe a film like The Godfather? Many call it a ""masterpiece,"" and I disagree with them. A masterpiece implies perfection and, in my opinion, no film will ever achieve perfection. But The Godfather comes pretty damn close.<br/><br/>Most already know the story of The Godfather. It's a narrative that's complex, yet simple and it's story that's fluid and interesting. It's complicated, but the story is told with such ease, it's like watching a master artist at work. The Godfather is superb storytelling at its finest.<br/><br/>The story's fluidity has very much to do with the characters. The men of the Corleone family are all distinct and interesting, due to the stellar performances. Of course, the standout here is Marlon Brando as Vito, the aging Patriarch of this crime family. He's simply magnificent whenever he's on screen. That's not to discount the other great performances from the rest of the cast, which includes Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall<br/><br/>The film is technically brilliant as well. The cinematography is stunning, with the more bright colors jumping off the screen, while the blacks set the mood well for darker story moments. The sound is more subtle in its accomplishments, but when you hear the chatter of machine guns, it makes your heart skip a beat.<br/><br/>It's hard to pick my absolute favorite film of all time. I could easily say Lawrence of Arabia, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, or Lord of the Rings. And I could also easily say The Godfather, as most others have done. But I don't like making such conclusive statements. But don't worry, Godfather. It's not personal. It's strictly business."

Him and De Niro who I consider the greatest two actors in the last 40 years both rules the 70s, they prove it again in the sequel that I don't find quite as good as the original, even though MANY people think that this is the one time the sequel finally surpasses the original in the Godfather Series.<br/><br/>I do not.<br/><br/>I think this first Godfather is leaps ahead of the rest, not exactly leaps maybe in front of the second but most definitely the third.<br/><br/>While I like Heat and Goodfellas more then the Godfather I think this is a perfect 10 out of 10 for everything.

","""The Godfather"" is an American Crime film, which made its debut into theaters on March 24, 1972. The film was based on the original penned by Mario Puzo, with the same title. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the film was centralized around the lives of an elite mob family in New York. Regarded as a classic, The Godfather has been an iconic American film, having been considered one of the greatest features in American films. It is a film that is multifaceted having evidence of several emerging underlying themes.<br/><br/>The film commences with the wedding of mob leader, ""Don"" Vito Corelone's (Marlon Brando) daughter. Arriving as a decorated Marine, Corelone's son, Michael (Al Pacino) is in attendance to his sister's nuptials. Michael is adamant about his unwillingness to participate in his families' business of organized crime and is a decorated United States Marine returning from World War II. In the midst of the celebratory event, the Don has a private meeting with Virgil Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) whom requests a monetary commitment and protection to engage in a partnership within the emerging drug trade. Pursuant the investigation of a spy, it is unearthed that that Sollozzo was involved with Correlonne rivals, the Tattaglias. <br/><br/>The denial of the opportunity sparked a fire fight between the two clans; resulting in a failed assassination of the Don. This ordeal prompted Michael, to pursue involvement within the family business. After a visitation with his father at the hospital exposed that the two hired men hired to defend the mob boss were unable to located leaving Vito vulnerable to additional attacks. During his recovery, Vito's eldest son and Michael's brother, ""Sonny"", portrayed by actor James Caan, assumes seniority and regains control of the family affairs. It was following this change-of-command that a string of mafia murders commenced.<br/><br/>Continuation of the feuds between opposing families resulted in many casualties, including that of Sonny, was murdered en route to apprehend, brother-in-law Carlo, for brutally abusing his wife, and Vito's daughter Connie. While idling at a local toll-booth, a slue of heavily armed assassins relinquished gun fire succumbing Sunny to his demise. Away from the heart of the happenings, Michael meets romantic interest Appollonia (Simonetta Steffanelli) , in Sicily. The pair wed, however all is far from a fairy tale ending. The existence of the couple was short lived, as Appollonia was murdered in a vehicle by detonated car bombs that had been placed by assassins sent forth from the feuding families with an attempt to kill Michael.<br/><br/>It is with these developments that you truly see the development of Michael's character.Shaped by experiences, plagued my unspoken heartbreak by losing loved ones, and embracing a life of crime which he formerly opposed. ""The Godfather,"" continues with plights of violence and opposition, as Michael assumes control of the mob's affairs. The move, has set high standards for the genre, as standards for forthcoming films will be comparable to this favorite film. Other movies represented in the same category are those are well-crafted, however, aren't comparable to the storyline and the character development that is presented within the Godfather Trilogy. Movies such as ""Reservoir Dogs,"" imitate the same violent antics that are exhibited in other mafia features, however,lack the same continuity that the Godfather possesses. <br/><br/>As Michael is declared the new ""Don"", he seeks to relocate the business to Nevada to avenge his family, lovers, and friends. The film, is action packed with surprised lurking around every corner with unsuspecting twists that occur as a result of the gritty , unsuspecting life of a mobster. A compelling crime-drama, the Godfather, will never cease to disappoint its audience, and remains a top contender within its genre."
"teddy_unstead","9","1","1","19 November 2012"," A Thorough Yet Spoiler-Free Review. Read it if you're unsure in any aspect about the movie
","Due to the restrictions of the 10 point voting system I have been forced to settle on a 9/10 rating, however I prefer a more accurate score, and that would be 8.9 stars.<br/><br/>The movie is an undoubtable classic. I've noticed on here there are a lot of 1 star reviews, all of which are rather ignorant and at times rather obnoxious. It's understandable if it doesn't live up to your expectations, but I don't even think this movie should have the option of a star rating below 5 because anyone who gives it lower rating should not really be reviewing movies. I admit that I was very against the idea of this film, the idea that it was so popular but would really live up to the standards set by so many sycophantic fans seemed almost impossible to me. Having already been disappointed by the movie ""Avatar"" (not visually of course, but for the predictable and, at times, tiresome plot). The Godfather, on the other hand, has a much more unpredictable storyline, yet nothing that happens is a huge shock. At times seemingly arbitrary events eventually collate into a cohesive part of the movie. Despite pushing the 3 hour mark, you are constantly entertained, and hanging on to every word, almost every action holds some importance and the feeling that something is about to happen is constant and justified.<br/><br/>I don't want to reveal too much about the movie so I shall attempt to keep the review vague in places, and will stop in regards to the storyline now. <br/><br/>Even if the storyline fails to inspire, at the very least, some sort of appreciation, there are five words that command respect: ""Al Pacino and Marlon Brando."" They give the film a level of cool, control and power that affects the viewer in many ways, and maybe even re-establishes the idea of acting. Powerful emotions, casually being used with an air on nonchalance and grace, emotions that are usually over-played, and over-acted in other movies in which actors flaunt their talents carelessly. In this film we get a masterclass in acting from two masters of the screen. The acting from every character is pitched perfectly, every character balances each other out, and their personalities are contrastingly complimentary towards each other. <br/><br/>I have a lot of good to say about this movie, so now I should explain why i gave it a ""mere"" 8.9. Firstly I must admit I don't believe in the idea that there is such thing as a ""perfect"" movie, so I am viewed as a somewhat ""harsh marker,"" and thus it would never get a full 10.0, but there are some aspects of this film that I believe to be either superfluous or under-developed. Basically put, there are bits that could maybe be replaced by some extra character or storyline developments. This, however, is just a personal issue, and I would stress that 8.9 is the second highest rating I have ever given, and to be honest, my mind is constantly changing on that score, and I may actually, in the future, wish to raise it. <br/><br/>On a final note, I will just say that this truly is one of the greatest films ever made, and I would urge anyone reading this to watch the film. If you don't like it that is a shame, but if you do (which you probably will), it will be a film you will carry with you for the rest of your life."
"stephanieamstutz","9","1","1","9 November 2012"," The Godfather
","The movie ""The Godfather"" is an awesome movie! Some things that inspired me to watch the whole series was: tension, characters, and the love. All of these thing brought the movie to life. It was the most dramatic thing ever; however it was sad. <br/><br/>When Michael says ""Ah, that little farce you played with my sister. You think that would fool a Corleone?"" The director did the lines terrifically well. This line capturing to me. This would be the most exciting movie that I've ever seen! I'm so glad my family recommended it to me. At first I thought that the movie would be horrible, but then I realized that the tension was to much that I had to keep watching it. It was the kind of movie that when it ended you wanted to see the next one just to know what would happen. A few times I cried, but don't all movies have a crying point in them. It was just to much action, tension, and feeling in the movie for me to stop watching. <br/><br/>The character Al Pancio was my favorite because he has so much energy in his role plays. Some other movies that he played in was: ""ScarFace"", ""Heat"", and of course ""The Godfather"". All of these were his best yet. Al Pancio is the most vibrant actor that I have ever seen, that would probably be why I love his acting so much. Furthermore, another actor would be Richard S. Castellano. Additionally, this man was the one who taught Al Pancio how to shoot the crooked cop in the movie, and the shocking thing was that he used to be a construction manager. One woman, named Talia Shire, also played a role. She has stared not only in ""The Godfather"", but in ""Rocky"". She is also the stepmother of the Schwartzman family. All these actors/actress were magnificent during the movie, they played their part so well. <br/><br/>The sad thing about the movie would be the death. Moreover, the death was gruesome. It had so much detail that you can't seem to watch; however, you sometimes just can't turn away. Although if given a chance it will come to the point that it's awesome. This stage point of the death will soon rube off in less you hate the fact of blood (lots of blood and cursing). All I'm saying is give it a chance. <br/><br/>The love that the character give to each other is so affectionate, even off scene there still friends. It's like as though there one big family meeting for a family reunion. Even in the movie they gradually connect. For example, Al Panico and Richard S. Castellano. They were like father and son when they were together, and in the movie they were still like family except at the same time enemies. The movie, when seen, will have the same effect on you once you notice how well they act together. The film went on for $80,000 because Paramount bought in before the book became a best-seller. A previous gangster film bombed at the box office, the company was reluctant to even make the movie, and initially budgeted only $2 million to $3 million. That's a fact. <br/><br/>Over all, the movie is great to watch. Its tension will follow you until you've seen the whole series. ""The Godfather"" is one of the most never before seen movies with life in it. With what the movie has you will not no what was just watched. The movie is epic and will always be remembered as the most amazing movie ever."

","Mario Puzo's The Godfather is an exciting thrill ride into the 1940's mob lifestyle. It follows a character theme with additional focus on the plot. Though all five theme elements are present, this story is told with a vision into the lives of a mob family and therefore takes on the character theme. Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brandon is the head of one of New York's five mob families. He lives with the old world style and the Italian tradition that family and business issues should never mingle. At his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding it is custom of the Godfather to take requests. This sets the scene for the ties that bind this family to power. Don Vito has three sons,Santino played by James Caan, Fredo played by John Cazale, and Michael played by Al Pacino. He has one adopted son Tom (Robert Duvall) which is his personal attorney and consilere(adviser). Each of these boys with the exception of Michael is learning the family business. Michael returns home from the military unsuspecting that he will take his role in the business after his father is gunned down by drug lord Virgil Sollozzo. In return for protection and political contacts Sollozzo offers the Godfather a reasonably large profit, but despite the advice of his boys he continues with his old world ways and denies the opportunity. Sollozzo, seeing that the next in line to run the family (Santino) found this to be a lucrative deal then orders the hit on Don Vito. This sparks the mob war of all the five families and the rise of the future Don.<br/><br/>This film in many ways is reminiscent of Donnie Brasco due to its focus on the characters in a series of events. The motifs within this film open up to the central theme of the characters by showing their power and lack of empathy when settling a score. The color pallet was not vibrant which would have been risky since the tone of the movie is more dark and sinister. The fact that this is a movie made in the 1970's as compared to the film technology of today is of no issue because you are truly lost in the actions of the characters. This film is now and will forever be iconic. It shows a blend of chaos and calm and that not all books can be judged by the cover. The reputation of the characters in this film will always be illuminated in the eye of the viewer and it will be difficult for those who have watched this movie to take them out of the characters they portray.

","The Godfather is, in a nutshell, a terrific movie.<br/><br/>The cast is brilliant, from Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) to Diane Keaton (Kay Adams); each one of them suits their role perfectly.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando is without a doubt, one of the best actors to ever set foot on this earth. His astonishing portrayal of Vito makes me sad that he's not going to appear in the sequels.<br/><br/>Al Pacino also plays a beautiful role, one of Vito's sons who later takes on the family business. Notice how he transforms himself from this calm war-hero to a hard-ass Don. Not a lot of people can do that.<br/><br/>I love how the movie - most of it at least - takes place in New York while most of the characters are Italian. But that only spices the movie up. The story is unique and smartly written, and it suits me since I like the time that it took place in.<br/><br/>So if you're a fan of the post-WWII age, then I strongly urge you to get this movie. Hell, even if you're not, it would be a shame if you don't watch it."

","Because this movie has Extraordinary performances, amazing direction, incredible screenplay, and an excellent soundtrack, it's more than good, more than great, it's perfection in every way. When I first saw this movie, I was 10 years old, and I couldn't stand it, and now I love it, so be patient, watch this movie and observe every detail, that will make it unforgettable.<br/><br/>Vito Corleone(Brando) is the aging don (head) of the Corleone Mafia Family. His youngest son Michael(Pacino) has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Tania Shire, Michael's sister) to Carlo Rizzi(Russo). All of Michael's family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo(Lettieri) is looking for Mafia Families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don's lawyer Tom Hagen(Duvall), the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart.<br/><br/>Everybody says that the movie gets everything right, and it's true. This movie follows a narrative rhythm that is impeccable, it never slows down too much, and that's because the whole movie is slow. And in some tense scenes (Like the scene where Michael is changing his father's room in the hospital), and even some funny ones (When Michael is in Sicily talking to a man about that girl that he met, and the guy finds out that she's his daughter), it's done with excellency.<br/><br/>The screenplay is one of the best ever made. It develops it's character so well, that almost everyone is learning something during the story. And of course, it gives us memorable quotes like the classic ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse!"" or ""I'm a superstitious man!"". The Soundtrack by Nino Rota is brilliant, and you can notice that right in the first scene.<br/><br/>The acting is equally impressing, even Pacino that don't usually blows my mind like everyone says (Not that he is a bad actor, he's excellent, but I prefer contained and calm performances), impressed me a lot, he's so cold and looks so smart that make his turns believable and intelligent. Brando gives one the best performances the world has ever seen, and considering that he was 48 when this movie was released, he convinced me that he was a sick, old man (Which Pacino didn't do that well in ""The Godfather: Part III""). And observe the scene where Hagen tells him about Sonny, and you'll see what I mean by saying that it's one of the best of all time.<br/><br/>Verdict: A lot of people, including me, say that it's the best movie ever made, so they probably have a good reason to say that."

"daryl42-1","10","1","1","22 February 2010"," Greater than the sum of its parts. True art.
","9.8<br/><br/>Everybody has heard of The Godfather. You may agree that everybody has seen The Godfather. You might say that everybody loves The Godfather. However, I disagree. It's been 38 years since The Godfather was released in theaters. Although everybody has heard of it, and holds it in high regards, I think that the reason why people enjoy the film is not because of its artistic merits, but its themes and pop culture phenomenon. I also believe that this type of film-making has been lost. <br/><br/>Every component of the film holds together well. Each individual aspect of it is finely tuned, and it is seamed together to as close to perfection as the medium allows, as far as we know it. However, it is not the sum of its parts that makes film or art, whatever medium it may be, great. It is not a group full of musicians that makes a record great. It is not great technical and artistic style that makes a painting great. It is not great dialogue, coupled with a good story that makes a novel great. I believe that when these components of an artistic medium are in harmony, it helps to allow for art to form. The Godfather has all of these components in spades and also becomes art.<br/><br/>The post WWII atmosphere, set in the midst of Italian crime organizations is engraved into the film. The colors are brown, gold and black, perfectly matching the antique tone. The acting is exceptional, with some performances by young actors that acted as a stepping stone for their careers. The music, while used sparingly, comes in and out at just the right times, and matches the mood of the film well.<br/><br/>The camera angles, cinematography and editing are why I used the term near- perfect. There are certain scenes in this film that are simply the best in all of film-making. One of the final scenes, interlaced with a baptism, is an amazing example of using the medium of film-making and its techniques such as editing and directing to inspire emotion and create art. Another scene, which simply just involves one person against a black background, and a single light source above them, is in my opinion one of the best shots of all time, not just in film-making, but photography as well. <br/><br/>The Godfather's greatest feat is not that it is a cultural phenomenon. It is, by all definitions, art. You might call expression and aesthetic values by themselves art, but ultimately it is pieces like The Godfather that inspires artists. There is a reason as to why half of this review is talking about art and not The Godfather. The film deserves to be seen, regardless of what you all ready know or what you think you might know about it. Regardless of its theme and setting, the work that the men and women did during the production of this film and its final form deserve to be recognized. This style of film-making is far and few between nowadays, and if you enjoy cinema, you owe it to yourself to experience Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather."
"BeatlesFan3287","10","1","1","15 September 2009"," BeatlesFan3287 Reviews ""The Godfather""
","When the Godfather was released in 1972, the golden age of Hollywood was long over. Regardless, this film managed to recall that era while at the same time taking advantage of the ever changing times. This film is darker and more grittier than the films of the thirties and forties as such melancholy was starting to become more common in movies. It definitely didn't forget its roots however. The popular film noir style is very evident in this film: not just in the lighting but in the dark subject matter and often bleak themes. And the themes of the movie are indeed bleak. In fact, as people are shot, blown up, and have revenge acted upon them, an inexperienced movie viewer might wonder what the point is. The point is, under the violence and hate, there is a wealth of good: total justification for the mayhem. The Mafia may be murderous and revengeful, but they have values, possibly even more values than normal, law biding citizens.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando gives a breathtaking performance as Don Vito Corleone, a man who is vicious and harden, yet you learn to care for the guy and his family enough so that you eventually root for them every time they get their own way. Al Pacino also gives a great performance as Vito's son Michael, who is different from Vito in many ways. As we learn early on, he could care less about his family's business yet we know he will most likely be shoved into it eventually. We will then learn if he is able to control his family or if he will develop a lust for power and revenge that will cause him to fail altogether. Questions like this are what keep the film interesting and moving forward.<br/><br/>The well orchestrated characters also help the plot along and at no point do they seem unrealistic: even when they make drastic choices. And this is important since this is a very character driven film. And that's just one of the many strengths seen here. All great films have multiple strengths and this movie is no exception. Many crime films were made before this film as well as after it. The ones that came before were sometimes weighed down with Hollywood glamor while the ones that came after it were often all flash with no substance: relentlessly violent with no reward in the end for the viewer. The Godfather dodges those weaknesses and it also avoids being pretentious and overblown. Just one of the many things that make The Godfather the best movie of the seventies and possibly the best of all time."
"Sanou_san","10","1","1","9 September 2009"," Excellent
","Being a youth (but I would safely consider myself now as an adult), I never get into much witnessing adult stories. I now realize that most of them are undoubtedly beautiful stories. Haven't read yet prior to the film Mario Puzo's novel, I pulled my guts to watch the film and did my best to understand the story as much as I do with other good-storied films. Godfather 1 had indeed made me witness another beautiful story of different origin. I never imagined how many beautiful stories would still be lingering out there, of every nature, of any environment or of any country it originates. Watching the film, starts with Marlon Brando playing the role of Don Vito Corleone, known as well as the ""Godfather"". I didn't quite understand really the way how crime worlds work, but to me I get the opportunity to understand dealing business with wits and cunning as how you deal practically with your teacher in school. The situation is different, but manner of dealing them is nonetheless similar. I appreciated well the film for Italian's value of family, relationship and trust. How Don Vito Corleone manage to deal business mixing trust and respect differently. How he mends and considers things equally and with weight. This is the first time I observed for the first time Al Pacino grasping a character filled with composure and serenity, and maintained such equanimity after tides turned inevitable to him in the story. I had to admit it is one of the excellent films I've watch so far. The characters, the setting, the environment, the story itself is so genuine and good that you couldn't deny it as a considerably first-rate film."

"DJAlejandros","1","22","74","10 April 2002"," A good movie, however not worthy of its top ranking
","When a prestige movie is made, utmost attention is given to detail, grandeur, style, and above all, popularity.  Godfather was a movie made to honor the great work of Mario Puzo, who wrote a novel that brought true attention to the human side of the gangster/mobster.  Capolla knew that he had embarked on a great mission when he set out to perform the unthinkable: to show the world that the leaders in crime have souls, and that they are certainly not invincible.  This movie was what it was meant to be, a prestige movie, it took very few risks, and was filmed to simply document the lives of its characters.<br/><br/>I found the Godfather to be a very well done movie.  In fact, I enjoyed this movie so much that I have watched it on many occasions.  This movie serves as a soap opera of the gangster world to me, and it tells its story very well.  However, I do not believe that any film of this character should be given such a high accord in the Top 100 ranking.  The highest position on the rating scale should be given to a movie that fulfills the requirements of a movie to the tee.  The godfather does not do this as precisely as other movies.<br/><br/>People go to see movies simply to be displaced from their ordinary lives. To be transported to another world, life, place, or perspective.  The godfather does a very feeble attempt at fulfilling this essential requirement.  Not at one moment in this movie does the audience become disconnected with themselves.  There is not a single instance where the actions on the screen become real, and where the world in which the audience is watching from fades away.  To those of us who believe in the true excellence of movies, the Godfather does not rate anywhere near the `best movie of all time'.<br/><br/>Movies such as Moulin Rouge, Citizen Kane, Requiem for a Dream, the Matrix, Casablanca, Momento, and even (depending on the viewer) Gladiator, all grasp the viewer by their hair, and thrust them into another world, if for only a few seconds.  The movie watching experience is topped by this disconnection from the real world.  It leaves us in a feeling of awe, and shows us that the movie we just watched was more than just a movie, but a journey into the minds of the characters on the screen, and in some unique cases, a journey into the great depths of our own minds.  With this sort of depth and greatness, these types of movies should be all in the top 10.<br/><br/>This unique greatness is not easily achieved.  In order to capture the audience in such a thrilling way, a great deal of effort must be spend meticulously building up the pace and timing of the movie.  The climax should be the point where the viewer has already been captured into the movie, and should thus create a `climatic experience', thus blowing the viewer away.  The Godfather has none of these elements perfected to such a state that they encapsulate the viewing public to a degree worthy of its ranking.<br/><br/>So it is therefore obvious that The Godfather does not reach the greatness of a few other better movies, and so it is not deserving of its top ranking. If it were up to me, I would move the Godfather down to 5 or 6, and leave room the real screen gems to be appreciated.<br/><br/>This movie gets a rating of 9 out of 10"
"joekonn","1","24","82","4 October 2006"," A vastly over rated movie
","Childish romantic view of common criminals; in no way equal to ""Goodfella's"" which really captures the truth about the underworld. The director must have been fantasizing about some imaginary Sicilian aristocracy (drinking too much vino), or simply mining a vein he knew would be commercially successful. There are excellent performances by Brando, Pacino and Caan among others, but the operatic excesses of the film make a mockery of reality. The individual performances are wasted. Not unlike ""Apocalypse Now"", ""The Godfather"" is an arrogant film with little genuine substance, and undermines an accurate understanding of the subject matter. It substitutes a yarn for a true story and, while it is entertaining, it contributes to the deterioration of our culture. Like the ""Gladiator"" it grabs your attention, then tells you lies. <br/><br/>""The Godfather"" is the cinematic equivalent of Baroque architecture, excessive, gaudy and not worth the work to create."

All I know is that I heard and read endless,over-the-top praise for this movie for years and years. I managed to avoid seeing it until well over a decade after it was released. What a disappointment. I could not believe I was watching the same movie that I had heard so,so much about. I was absolutely astonished with how boring it was. I could not believe how disjointed it was. I could not believe the praise that Marlon Brando was given for such a weak,lackluster performance- it is goofy beyond parody.
As the film rambled and shambled along,I began to wonder if I was the victim of some sort of obscure joke-this crummy film could NOT be the same movie I had heard so much about. Unfortunately,somehow,

","OK, I REALLY don't get it. I always thought: ""Oh well, the Godfather, masterpiece, everyone has to watch it at least once in their live, let's see it then (someday)"". Then today I finally decided myself to watch it and I was shocked about it.<br/><br/>To make it short, it was boring, WAY to long for the amount of real action (and I don't mean Micheal bay action, I mean something like a traceable storyline that doesn't introduce new names and character every time something really happens (and thats not often the case) so that in the end, you don't even know who's who and what is really happening. I don't like a film where you don't know who is doing the action you see, especially if some of the main characters are so similar that you can't distinguish them in some scenes. Also, the film is too long. Take the first set for example, the wedding (or was it a wedding?). If you count all the minutes you see some macaroni's dancing without sense or entertaining the viewer, I think it's around 5 to 10mins. If you look at that you know why the movie is around 3 hours long. Coming to the characters, I didn't have any emotional relationship to them after 3 hours of nearly non-stop conversation. I didn't really care when they died, first because in most cases, I didn't know who was killed in the scene most times and second, because I had no emotions for them. (Let's take that scene near the end, where all the people get killed, like 5 or 6 in three different locations. I didn't even recognize one of them, the whole scene didn't make sense for me. Why would they shoot a women with their child in the bed, especially if the viewer doesn't know who (the f**k) she is??? Not really a pro for a so-called ""masterpiece"") The only two pros I have are the acting and the music. I have to say I'm not a pro in commenting acting in films (watched Catwoman and didn't have a clue why Halle Berry became the golden raspberry for their acting after learning all that stuff with the walking like a cat, martial arts etc.). But I have to say what I've seen in this film is the most natural acting possible. None of the scenes looks contrived, the ""we are all family"" part came very good. Also the soundtrack is really worth recognizing.<br/><br/>To sum it up:<br/><br/>Acting: 10/10 Storyline: 4/10 (really disappointing) Action: 3/10 (even more disappointing) Lenght: 2/10 Soundtrack: 8/10<br/><br/>Overall: Around 4-5/10, I'll give it 4 because it's overrated.<br/><br/>PS: I watched ""The Rock"" the same day and found it much better than ""The Godfather"" (Better action, no lenghts, even better soundtrack, a very simple but at least traceable story)"

And i really don't get how every other character other then the ""angry Italian"" seems underdeveloped, plain boring and uninteresting. <br/><br/>The only way for you to like this movie is by sympathize with the characters. And sympathizing with the bad guys (since almost every main character is a murderer and a mob member, even the protagonist is a bad guy)is difficult, although not impossible. If the director makes the evil sides of those characters redeemable, then it would be a lot easier for the viewer to sympathize and worry about the protagonist if he/she was in danger. When i however see Michael Corleone in danger in this movie, every time i wish for him to be killed, for i feel nothing for him.

But i disagree, there is no denying that the acting and direction in the Godfather is sublime but it is the fact that it is so monotonous, many people will say that it is because i am 14 but i have seen many films including other Coppela films such as The Conversation and Apocalypse Now, which is my favourite film so i definitely am not saying that Coppela cannot direct but what i am saying is that he could have done so much better with the script, the talent and the locations. So overall I am saying this: The Godfather is not a Bad film just very poor and it is definitely not all it is cracked up to be. Thankyou for reading my review."

","This movie was probably relevant in the 70s and may have been a benchmark at the time it was made. Watching it in 2006, I can see how it added to the movie landscape and that effect that it had on subsequent film making.<br/><br/>Some of the film is amazing, but mostly it goes on and on. It is very long, with some of the scenes taking an age, without really adding to the atmosphere or the point. These are not impressive pauses, silences, looks, stares, or useful dwelling time, simply editing that never happened.<br/><br/>This film is worth seeing as a history lesson in film, to get an understanding of the development of the genre, but anybody who has seen goodfellas, casino, or any other mob flick is unlikely to find the moral tale worth the journey."

"The Love Dragon","2","8","22","8 February 2001"," Not as good as I remember.
","I saw this movie years ago, and I loved it. It was my favourite movie. This morning, I watched it again, and began to pick it apart.<br/><br/>This movie is first and foremost overlong. Unnecessary dialogue and scenes weaken the raw effect that could have been produced. The musical sequence after Pacino does his restauant thing is unlike any other in the movie, it doesn't fit in. The part of the movie detailing Pacino's stay in Italy is poorly done, and also doesn't fit in.<br/><br/>Some of the performances are dull, such as Keaton's, Lettieri, and Conti. Yes, I do believe Brando's part is badly written. I know I will be hated for saying this, but the character constantly changes, and his dialogue is never consistent. Brando does his best, and I don't think anyone could have done better, but it was still not a great part. The only outstanding performances were those of Caan and Pacino. Caan's acting is raw and Pacino is right on target.<br/><br/>Besides the main theme, music is weak and unfitting. As I have said, some of the scenes don't fit, and the music score doesn't help any. At one moment, the movie is a gritty masterpiece, and  at another a cheesy, cliched piece of film, going back to the traditional style of film, ruining the film's effect. Had the movie cut all the silly dialogue, not to mention the sans-dialogue scenes that aren't even poetic, which a dialogueless scene should be, the effect might  be better.<br/><br/>Also, to throw some more mud, the romance between Keaton and Pacino is awful, and no chemistry is arisen.<br/><br/>A disappointment, but not to be missed. I recommend a single viewing. One more thing, this film certainly doesn't deserve to be the best ever, it shouldn't even be in the top one hundred, but it doesn't deserve a ""1"" rating, I only give it that because I want the average rating to go down."

Acting by Brando was at best mediocre and James Caan is useless . I don't even reckon FFC as a director either, especially after Gangs Of New York. If this was made in present day it would probably flop. The 2 sequels got worse and the supporting characters never seemed to fit in.I would imagine the book is a million times better.

","I hate reviewing classic movies, since most have a reputation and I feel like I'm not an actual moviegoer/critic if I don't like the classics or give them a certain rating. Anyway, I finally got to see The Godfather. I was a little disappointed, but I still liked it.<br/><br/>In Francis Ford Coppola's Mario Puzo's The Godfather, Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone, son of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), a famous family mafia. The film goes through their various escapades as a crime family.<br/><br/>I really, really enjoyed watching The Godfather. The almost-three-hour runtime seemed to fly by. I was enthralled by the sincerity of the acting and the horrible true-to-life feel of the film. All of the acting was dead-on, although some of the screaming could have been a little better. With up-and-coming stars at the time such as Al Pacino, how can you go wrong?<br/><br/>However, with all movies, they can't be perfect. The film could, or should, have had more plot to it. I know it's supposed to be ""a day in the life of"" type movie, but if it had been with one adventure for most of the way it would have helped. Also, there were lots of supporting characters who we can't remember about for three hours. If that wasn't enough, all of the characters looked like either tall or fat white men with thick Italian accents, making them hard to understand (and of course I had to rent the VHS version so I couldn't read subtitles). More towards the end, I couldn't tell who was on whose side. The ending could have been trimmed down a little; the last half hour or so seemed to actually be boring and not very exciting. Maybe Coppola put it in there so the movie could have the designation of being ""one of those long classics"".<br/><br/>I was surprised about how little strong language there was for a crime movie like this. I would have guessed all the characters to be swearin' like a sailor, but I was surprised. The amount of blood didn't surprise me, but I commend Coppola for putting so much in.<br/><br/>Pacino looked like he does now, minus bags under his eyes. Brando gained about 200 pounds after The Godfather. And, Abe Vigoda looks exactly the same as he did thirty years ago. Yes, that's right. Abe Vigoda is in this movie. Hurray!<br/><br/>The Godfather is an entertaining movie that is overrated but still fun to watch as three hours pass.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Rated R for strong violence, blood, brief nudity, and constant but mainly minor profanity."

"cant-affordsit","10","4","9","4 April 2006"," The Greatest
","This is the greatest movie ever made. It not only gives an interesting view on the mafia, but it teaches many valuable lessons and ideas, for which a good example is in the first scene, the meeting between the Don and Bonasera (""What did I ever do to deserve such disrespect?""). I am 13 now, and the first time I saw this movie was when I was 8. The Godfather has definitely made me smarter and prepared me for the independence of being a teenager. I would recommend if your child is 8+ and has not seen this movie that they watch it right away. I have the full box set, and have seen them all numerous times. The third was disappointing though, with dry acting, repetitive plot, and many awkward moments between Sofia Coppola and Al Pacino. I was also glad that the first two movies did not have too much violence, although there is a fair amount of Thompson guns in them. I have a habit of quoting Brando, who plays a character who delivers some of the most powerful, meaningful lines in any movie I have seen. I have seen most of Brando's movies, from Streetcar to Missouri breaks to the Freshman, in which his lines are so unique and unconventionally spoken they sometimes make me laugh. It was a true shame for Brando to die at the not-too-old age of 80, although he was not in good health at the time. Although many people are sure to claim the fame that Brando accomplished, I will always remember him to be the greatest actor ever."
"jay4stein79-1","7","4","9","16 November 2004"," Re-configured Genre
","During the 1970s, American directors decided, like their French counterparts did in the previous decade, to elevate and transcend the genres that appealed to them as children growing up in the 1940s and50s. Lucas took Buck Rodgers and Science Fiction to new levels, as didSpielberg with the Action/Adventure movie.<br/><br/>Some re-made war movies in their own image; others re-configured the Western. Coppola took a stab at elevating the gangster film from B-movie to artistic masterpiece.<br/><br/>On some level, he succeeded, transforming the gangster film from movies about crooks to movies about crooks and their families.<br/><br/>Though it may not seem like such a difference, adding that familial component made movies about organized crime much more interesting than they had previously been. When critics discuss the great gangster films, few films made before the Godfather are mentioned. The Godfather, in one sense, made gangster movies as we know them. That is no small feat and Coppola ought to be commended for that. He made a solidly acted and directed film in a genre not usually known for those attributes.<br/><br/>However, the Godfather is not the greatest movie of all time. It is not even the greatest gangster movie (that would have to go to Goodfellas) or the greatest movie of 1972 (compare it to the dynamic performances of Sleuth, the absolutely absurd and insane Ruling Class, and Bunuel's masterpiece, the Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie and you will find the Godfather lacking).<br/><br/>Do not mis-understand: the Godfather is an eminently watchable movie, filled with great performances and guided by the sure hand of a very gifted director. It is simply, though, a very good movie - no more, no less. Perhaps I'm able to take a step back from The Godfather because I wasn't there at the time<br/><br/>I understand its appeal and I understand why people call it one of the greatest motion pictures of all time, but I cannot agree with them. It lacks an intangible quality that all great movies have; it lacks an aura. Movies like Close Encounters and Chinatown have an aura that, though difficult to describe, simply exudes greatness.<br/><br/>The Godfather lacks that intangible quality while maintaining all of the tangible qualities of a great film. That one, almost invisible piece, though separates the very good from the great. That intangibleis vital and is something this film simply does not have."
"justafanuk","10","4","9","12 September 2003"," The ultimate drama?
","`I believe in America' are the first words spoken in The Godfather. The fact that they resonate with such power to someone who has no personal or professional ties with the country speaks volumes. <br/><br/>My first viewing of this film was anticipated with equal amounts excitement and trepidation. How could a film of such enormous stature possibly live up to anyone's expectations, let alone mine? Over two and a half hours later I realised I would probably never see a finer film in my life. And about six or seven years on from that revelatory experience, that view grows ever stronger. With the exception of The Godfather Part Two that is. But that's a film for another day. <br/><br/>The Godfather is now so much a part of our culture that it becomes difficult to talk about it as a film by itself. Entire books have been written on how it has not only affected change in the way films are conceived by individuals and whole studios, but also the very nature of the film industry itself. At the time nobody could have predicted that a lengthy (and costly) film set in the 1940's with a relatively little know cast and a serious and weighty subject matter could have made such a huge profit at the box office. Much like in the film itself, ambition and bravado is rewarded with great success and power, and this was true for many of the cast and crew with their subsequent careers. <br/><br/>There may be spoilers ahead but the plot and events in this film are now so well documented I doubt anyone will be surprised.<br/><br/>The film opens with a wedding taking place between Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie and Carlo, a wannabe member of the Family. While the celebrations take place outside in glorious sunshine, in the darkened rooms of the main house Don Vito pays court to various people requesting help with whatever problems they need assistance with. This is where Bonasera, a local baker, opens the film with the aforementioned line and seeks revenge on two men who savagely beat his daughter after she refused their advances. The subsequent conversation sets the tone for the rest of the film. Respect is always demanded from those in power and who are willing to use that power to benefit you. But there may always be a favour required by The Don in return. Later in the film, this favour is repaid to The Don in a way that is both shocking and relieving to Bonasera. Every element in this first scene demands attention from the audience and rewards them by setting a very high standard thereon. The way the camera slowly pulls back from Bonasera to reveal The Don listening to the story as we are, the use of lighting to almost hide The Don's eyes in the darkness, and the expressions, the voice and even the movement of Marlon Brando as The Don immediately put us in the company of one of THE great acting performances. Also attendant at the wedding are The Don's sons, Sonny the firey tempered James Cann, the weak willed Fredo played by John Cazale and Michael, the youngest and most cool headed of the brothers, played as such by Al Pacino. As with Brando, you are assured career defining performances by all three men, and I don't think any of them reached these acting heights again. Equally impressive but not strictly a family member is Robert Duvall as The Don's Consilgerie, Tom Hagen. <br/><br/>In a nutshell (if such a thing were possible) the film follows the reluctant but necessary rise of Michael to the head of The Family and his dealings with his immediate family, his wife Kay (Diane Keaton), the ranked members that protect their Family (Tessio, Clemenza, etc), other Mafia Families and corrupt  state officials. Throughout the film Michael's views on his involvement with his Family change from the events that happen to his father after The Don refuses to involve his Families resources in distributing drugs into the city. When The Don is gunned down and left for dead in the street, and Michael has his jaw broken by corrupt Police Captain McCluskey, whilst trying to protect his unguarded father in the hospital, he sets in motion the revenge killing of both McCluskey and Sollozzo, the man partly responsible for the attempt on Don Vito. The result of the ensuing incredible set piece makes it necessary for Michael to leave the country to Sicily until it is safe to return. There he experiences both happiness and tragedy, as he takes a new bride, Apollonia, and receives news that Sonny was killed for a hit he had ordered on a rival Families son in previous retribution for the hit on The Don. Sonny's death scene is itself one of the most memorable set pieces in all of cinema. When a failed attempt on Michael leaves Apollonia dead, he returns to America, cold and hardened by these terrible events. There he begins to pick up where he left his life with Kay and moves to become his fathers heir. <br/><br/>The phrase that there is honour among thieves is nowhere more relevant than in The Godfather. Michael, Sonny, Fredo and Tom are bound together by the respect and loyalty they hold for their father (in Tom's case, unofficially adopted) and the Corleone name. Their Family will always come before anything else, as shown when Michael leaves for Sicily without much of a thought towards Kay (being both Jewish and a woman excludes her from the Family), or when Sonny rushes to his sister Connie's aid (and ultimately his demise) after she receives another vicious beating by Carlo.<br/><br/>
Some of the most fondly remembered and famous scenes in cinema occur throughout The Godfather. The sequence with Khartum's severed head is an undisputed classic for both the shock value and for showing us early on how far and what type of methods the Family will employ. Sonny's murder is brutal and affecting, the attempted hit on The Don is wonderfully staged with the camera looking down on the event from above, the cumulative killings of the heads of the five Families at the end is a masterpiece of editing (note to George Lucas circa Phantom Menace. This is how you direct separate climactic events that reach toward the same goal!) , and these are only some of the major events that take place. There are so many great lines that it would be fruitless to list even some of them here, as many of them are now as much a  part of the English language as any piece of classic text. What I will mention however, are the delivery on some of the lesser known phrases. When Tom has to tell The Don that `They shot Sonny on the causeway. He's dead', it's a heartbreaking moment both for himself, The Don and the audience and we can completely emphasise with their pain. The fact that we can emphasise at all with these criminals and killers is not only due to the acting, writing and directing of these characters, but that the Corleone Family is just that shade more moral and honourable than the other Families depicted in the film. When The Don calls a meeting with the heads of the five Families to clear the bad blood between them and prepare for Michael's return to America, his delivery of the line `..but I'm a superstitious man..' and subsequent warning is so powerful and commanding that nobody but Brando could have pulled it off with such weight and grandeur. When Michael asks the powerful Vegas hotel owner Moe Green that `You straightened out my brother?' the threat' is so tangible that Moe is immediately sorry and Fredo tries to make light of the situation by assuring Mike that he and Moe are best of friends. Thus begins the tragic downfall of Fredo At the beginning of the film when Michael is telling Kay about his family he assures her that `That's my family Kay, it's not me'. At the end of the film he tells her `Don't ask me about my business Kay'. Both times he is completely sincere and believable. <br/><br/>All throughout the film there are little moments where there may not be any dialogue or anything particularly important that happens to the plot, but they made such an impression on me that I have to mention some of them. The moment when Sonny bites down on his fist so (I assume) he wouldn't swear in front of Connie when he sees the bruise marks left on her face by Carlo, gave me goosebumps. The shot of the Statue of Liberty in the backdrop after Clemenza takes Paulie out to pick up some Cannelloni and has Rocco kill him and leave him bleeding in the car. The simple shrug of The Don's eyebrows when Tom returns from meeting Jack Woltz, and the previous shot was hearing Woltz's continued screams after finding the head of his beloved horse Khartum, in his bed when he awoke. The impeccable way Michael looks, dresses and carries himself when we first see him after returning from America as he steps out of a car toward Kay, and the way Brando's face literally crumbles as he is told of Sonny's death. <br/><br/>Every technical element in this film is of the highest level. The cinematography is beautifully composed and framed, the period designs of New York are utterly believable and we never assume we're in any other time. The music is simply stunning and perfectly highlights the mood of the characters throughout, with the main theme one of the most recognisable pieces of music in cinema. When watching this, the film simply FEELS rich. I take a great sense of importance and history from it, as though it's not merely a film but something much bigger. And there are plenty of arguments to support this, given the massive impact it has left not only on the film industry, but also on American businesses, commerce and crime. There are many stories of real life Mafiosi who base their lifestyle and way of conducting business on the Corleone way. <br/><br/>I think the best compliment I can pay to The Godfather is that once the door is closed on Kay's face and we've both been shut out, I feel like I've witnessed an event, rather than just watch a film."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","4","9","30 August 2001"," Francis Ford Coppola takes a story written by Mario Puzo and makes it into one of the greatest films ever made.
","Italian films have quite often come under some sort of controversy, in large part because of the fact that Italian immigrants have been given an undeserved reputation of being inherently violent and universally tied to some sort of organized crime. Mass media is one of the main reasons for this, which is why Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather instigated such fierce opposition and controversy when it was released in 1972. Coppola has insisted that the film is not about Italians involved in organized crime, but that it is instead a metaphorical representation of the American government. Personally, I don't believe that at all, if only because no one is going to watch a film like that and overlook exactly what they see and make the connection between the film and the American government.<br/><br/>
However, this does not take away from the overall accomplishment that the film makes. The genius of The Godfather lies in Coppola's obvious directing skills, as well as author Mario Puzo's skill as a storyteller. The film tells the story of five tremendously powerful crime families that are at war with one another, but no one seems to be quite sure who committed the crimes that instigated the war, which makes for an interesting investigation as a subplot. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone is one of the best in history, and one of the major accomplishments of the film as a whole is that it is able to take this man, who is really a despicable person, and make him into an endearing character that we really care about. He is the leader of a crime family, but he is made into an antagonist. The film twists things around like that, which is one of the things that really makes it so watch-able. <br/><br/>Aside from making Don Corleone into such a likeable character, he is also made to be tremendously respectable. Personally, I noticed this because I watched The Godfather again recently while going through and watching all of the James Bond films. Here is James Bond, who is supposed to be one of the most tasteful, refined, and high-class figures in action film, and Brando's Don Corleone effortlessly makes even Sean Connery's Bond look like a Spice Girl. The story of The Godfather is complex and involved enough to have taken up three very long films, and they are tied together brilliantly. This film ends with Vito Corleone's son Michael taking over his leadership position, in a scene that doesn't only leave room for a sequel, but demands one. <br/><br/>The film ends with Michael Corleone in his father's office, being addressed by two of his father's assistants as Don Corleone, a title attributed only to his father until that point in the film. It would have been an unsatisfactory to end the film that way without continuing the story, and this was done two years later, with yet another Best Picture winner. The Godfather is a landmark in film history, because of the incredible story, the astronomical performances, the expert direction, and the picture perfect cinematography. The film is literally packed with memorable and famous scenes, and the performances from everyone involved are spectacular. Even at three hours, The Godfather never gets boring or slow.

","Are you kidding me? This movie is at best a 6 on a good day. The mere fact that this movie continually shows up on AFI's Top Ten list tells me that action and brutality are preferred by Americans over plot and acting. It is a decent film but nothing more. There is no way it is in the same league as ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Casablanca"", or ""Lawrence of Arabia"". It angers me every time this movie gets voted # 2 on some movie list. Al Pacino and Brando are good, but it was not the best work that either of these actors produced. It is an entertaining film like ""Indiana Jones"" and ""National Treasure"" but it is not a classic. It is important to remember that just because a film is popular does not mean that it is a great movie. If you enjoy mob movies this one is probably the best of a bad lot in the modern era, but the older films with Bogart, Cagney, and Robinson put this film to shame. I will be delighted when people one day realize the true worth of this film."

","One of the most critically acclaimed films in all of history, The Godfather shows us inside the world of the mob. But not in a usual way. The main character Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the crime lord of the biggest crime family in Ney York, but the film portrays him as an honorable person. He never really does anything that we can look down on him for. He has a strict moral code and always spends him free time with his family. He is an elderly man who has 3 sons and 1 daughter. Michael Corleone (Al Pachino) wants nothing to do with the crime family, Sonny Corleone (James Caan) is a hothead, Fredo Corleone (John Cazale) is a weakling, and Connie Corleone (Talia Shire) is Vito's only daughter. The story really begins when Vito refuses the request of local drug lord Virgil Sollozo (Al Lettieri) and as a result, Sollozo attempts to kill Vito. With Vito in the hospital Captain Mark McCluskey (Sterling Hayden) a corrupt police officer working for Sollozo arrests all of Vito's bodyguards leaving Vito unprotected. With Sonny as the acting don, Michael goes to visit Vito in the hospital but as he is leaving McCluskey shows up and attempts to arrest Michael but not before Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) the Corleone's lawyer shows up to save Michael. Later after convincing Sonny, Michael stages a meeting with Sollozo and McCluskey in a restaurant but in a life changing moment shoots them booth in the head. From that point on the film showcases the evolution of Michael from the college kid he was before now to a ruthless mobster. This film is one of the most celebrated and critically acclaimed in history, and it's easy to see why. The characters here are all great. The acting (which is important because that's what makes the memorable characters) is equally great. Brando in fact won an Oscar for his performance as Vito. If you ever come across this movie, stop and watch it."
"akash_sebastian","9","3","6","17 July 2014"," A Timeless Cinematic Classic; It's a Crime Masterpiece.
","'The Godfather', the first part in Francis Ford Coppola's classic crime trilogy, is an almost perfect movie, with every aspect of it working to its advantage. Before this film, Coppola wasn't known much for his directorial skills. But the mastery of art he showed with this masterpiece amazed everyone.<br/><br/>From Marlon Brando's stunning makeover to the incredible acting of almost every member of the cast, Gordon Willis' spectacular cinematography, tight editing, the remarkable background score (Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola), and almost everything else in the movie is quite flawless. No matter how many times you watch it, from the opening scene with Don Vito being asked for a favour at his daughter's wedding, to the final scene with door closing on Don Michael, the new ruthless boss of the Mafia family, the movie's three-hour long runtime captivates you till the very end. It's unlike most other crime movies with too many plot twists, action sequences, etc. The film is quite character-driven. It mainly shows the transformation of the character Michael Corleone, the war hero returning home during his sister Connie's wedding. Michael was the innocent and reluctant one in the family, who always stayed away from the family business. After certain events, he is compelled to take over the business, and it's sad and intriguing at the same time to see this character slowly evolve into something completely different from what Vito, Michael or any of us had expected. Ultimately, it's a movie all about family.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando was not even 50 when he gives his Oscar-winning incredible performance as the head of the Corleone family. Al Pacino, who plays the central character, gets his career launched with this movie, and shows what he's capable of. Other supporting actors like James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Richard S. Castellano, etc. - all of them give brilliant performances.<br/><br/>There are so many scenes and dialogues in the movie which are more than memorable: the opening favour scene, the horse head on the studio head's bed, the sequences together showing the planned downfall of the family (including shooting of Don Vito), and especially, the craftily directed baptism scene, during which the family executes a few things to finally rise up.<br/><br/>Nothing can be pinpointed in this movie to be called as flawed; it's an exceptional crime drama. It's an astute adaptation, and the movie stands on its own. But if it had a little more heart, I could have called it a flawless and perfect masterpiece."
"vrauto","10","3","6","13 April 2014"," The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel
","We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of ""The Godfather,"" which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.<br/><br/>The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.<br/><br/>The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old- fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.<br/><br/>Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.<br/><br/>But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whispery, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.<br/><br/>The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although ""The Godfather"" is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races).<br/><br/>The success of ""The Godfather"" as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garrotings.<br/><br/>Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so ""The Godfather"" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they'd tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn't have worked. But it's uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish- brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.<br/><br/>Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other."

"aman_akhauri","10","3","6","3 July 2012"," The Godfather : The Greatest Achievement in Cinematic History
","Some things are just meant to be perfect, flawless and well, godly. The Godfather , by Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo is . The way every aspect of filmmaking and storytelling compliments the other in this unforgettable film causes one to wonder ( really) if such a feat can be repeated, ever .<br/><br/>I always have the highest regard for the script before anything associated with films , therefore I'd like to talk about Godfather's screenplay first .<br/><br/>Adapted from Mario Puzo's novel of the same name The Godfather is all about a man's relationship with his family and his responsibilties towards it, that can cause him to abandon his own dreams and ambitions. That this setup is showcased by one of the most powerful mafia families in 1940s New York makes it all the more interesting . <br/><br/>The simple plot being that the head of the Corleone crime family is aging and other crime bosses want him out of the way seems rather straightforward. Enter Don Vito Corleone's youngest son Michael aka 'the innocent college boy' - as his elder brother and apparent heir Sonny Corleone likes to call him - along with a girl. He sums up his life and all that he expects from it in future in one line - ""This is my family Kay , not me. "" Quite clearly the kid wants nothing to do with his crime family or its power. But this family thrives on crime and inevitably becomes a victim as well. After Vito refuses to deal with a narcotics kingpin named Virgil Sollozo, he sets off a chain of events that alters his family and business structure forever. Even a man who has experienced all that life could offer fails to see what's coming and expresses his surprise later on. <br/><br/>A heartbreaking and mind numbing tale of how a powerful crime family comes to terms with all that it feeds on and how the same entities almost destroy the family was , is and will remain unforgettable .<br/><br/>The number of memorable scenes and dialouges is mind boggling. The scene where the Don delivers his famous line "" I'm gonna make him ......."" is enough to express the immeasurable power that the man possesses . And the one where a proud Hollywood producer awakes to find on his bed a ....... , or the restaurant where Michael ......... , or when Sonny pays the price for being hotheaded , and when the Don talks to his son , or when Michael does what he is destined to do, The Godfather overflows with great scenes. <br/><br/>The music and cinematography by Nino Rota and Gordon Willis respectively contribute greatly to the film's overall impact .<br/><br/>The Godfather can never be mentioned without naming Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in the same breath. The level of acting is just ""Oh My Gosh"" . While Brando is great and very believable as Vito Corleone , Al Pacino is and will always remain the one and only choice for Michael Corleone . It is said that Brando developed the mannerisms of Vito himself and if so , then he absolutely deserves his Oscar . Al Pacino transforms Michael from the ideal son to the guy he eventually becomes making sure that one is overwhelmed by the portrayal . <br/><br/>Not once have i mentioned in my tribute ( i ain't that great enough to review The Godfather) that The Godfather is a person, because he isn't and as the Hindi film ' Sarkar' , influenced heavily by The Godfather , says "" The Godfather is not a man , but an idea."" Just that this idea created history.<br/><br/>Note: As much as i don't want to mention it , i do really feel that there is one sequence in the film that required the editor's attention. But nonetheless , it only appears as such in repeated viewings and not the first one . So set aside your coke and popcorn because you're not just watching any other flick , you are watching the greatest of them all and after the conclusion you'll realise that the coke and popcorn are as they were when the words The Godfather appeared on the screen some three hours ago ."

His beloved son Michael has just come home from the war, but does not intend to become part of his father's business. Through Michael's life the nature of the family business becomes clear. The business of the family is just like the head of the family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but given to ruthless violence whenever anything stands against the good of the family. Don Vito lives his life in the way of the old country, but times are changing and some don't want to follow the old ways and look out for community and ""family"". An up and coming rival of the Corleone family wants to start selling drugs in New York, and needs the Don's influence to further his plan.

The cast was simply superb in this film.<br/><br/>Other unforgettable features of this film is Nino Rota's haunting and memorable musical scores;the editing by William Reynolds and Peter Zinner;Dean Tavoularis's evocative set design; and the screenplay of Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola as well as the direction of Coppola. <br/><br/>Overall,The Godfather is the ultimate family film that member of the household will enjoy and could relate to."

","I went into the Godfather expecting a masterpiece from all the reviews and how it number 2 or 3 on the IMDb top 250 films. After watching it I found it very disappointing for a few reasons. <br/><br/>1. You can't understand what the Godfather is saying half the time for the most part it all sounds like he's wheezing. If your going to watch this film put on subtitles.<br/><br/>2. Its way to long. the movie is just shy of 3 hours long! Thats long enough and especially most of the time nothing is going on. I found myself not paying attention to most of the boring parts in the film and there's a lot. <br/><br/>Now I know what your saying, your saying that i don't like long films. To you I say false i don't mind long films like the LOTR Return of the king is 4 hours + in the extended edition but there's a difference LOTR is entertaining there's action going on throughout 80% of the film. <br/><br/>Now I'm not saying I hated the movie I'm justing saying it has a few flaws and its not perfect by any means. Now I have yet to see Part 2 maybe that will change my mind but right now it doesn't appeal to me because its 4 hours + long!

There are other great movies of course, but some of them lack one or two things mentioned above. It's difficult to match this one. Francis Coppola probably did that with The Godfather Part II (1974), and he may have exceeded himself. The Godfather is such a masterpiece that you can watch it over and over again and you will never be bored but always surprised how wonderful it is. Just to see young Al Pacino change for a college boy to a ruthless mafioso is a miracle of movie-making, even more so than Marlon Brando in the title role, albeit a small one. But the most underrated role and actor in both the Godfather movies is Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen."
"loccomotive2000","10","3","6","21 September 2008"," The Shakespearean Epic Of The Movie Generation
","How do you define a movie's greatness? For me, it's pretty straightforward; mainly the direction, the script, and the acting. And the Godfather triumphs on every level. Coppola and Puzo have created an epic tale of a powerful mafioso patriarch passing his crown down to his unwilling son, and the shift of power unfolds brilliantly with betrayal, vengeance and tragedy.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando delivers one of the most intensive performances ever seen in film seemingly effortlessly. His calm demeanor carries along a subtly powerful and intimidating presence. Al Pacino is a revelation in his first role in a major film, displaying his range as he moves from the role of a heroin addict in The Panic in Needle Park, to the reluctant successor of the Don who transforms from the righteous war hero into a ruthless king. James Caan is PERFECT for the hot-headed Sonny, as is Robert Duvall as the intelligent Tom Hagen and John Cazale as the tragic figure of Fredo.<br/><br/>I will run out of superlatives if I continue. Overall, The Godfather is a timeless classic that will always be the epitome of how a truly magnificent epic film should be."

","I had to watch the entire trilogy and reflect on the films for a while before I realized what a great film ""The Godfather"" is. As I watched all three films, I really got familiar with all of the characters and became more intrigued as the series went on. Looking back, I felt that this first film was the greatest of the trilogy for several reasons. First of all, it has Marlon Brando, who portrays the amazing character Vito Corleone. This is one of the most memorable, imitated, and lovable characters in film history. His character is masterfully balanced as a powerful mafia patriarch and a loving family man. For this he won a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar. I also prefer this film because Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is a hero rather than the villain he later becomes. As Vito Corelone is wounded by an enemy, Michael must take over leading his empire while he is recovering. The interactions between the characters is excellent here, as is the film's dialogue. There is also a great supporting cast, consisting of Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and more. What a well-crafted story. Part II is almost as good, but I think this is slightly better.

","And he wasn't wrong. After recently viewing this masterpiece of American film for the first time it is understood why it has earned such acclaim for so many years. It is hard to put into the words how beautiful and flawless The Godfather really is, all I can say is that it is the most brilliant saga of family, business, and crime ever captured on camera.<br/><br/>One of the greatest qualities about The Godfather is its craft. The craft is impeccable in this film. This must be credited to the fantastic cast (from Marlon Brando to Al Pacino to James Caan and even to Abe Vigoda) and to one of the greatest directors of American cinema: Francis Ford Coppola. No other man could have unraveled such a craftily built epic that The Godfather is and remains today. Coppola and co-screenwriter Mario Puzo (who wrote the novel The Godfather) wrote the greatest screenplay Hollywood has seen. And it is due to the genius of both of these two gentlemen that The Godfather came to be.<br/><br/>Two scenes in the movie that prove the brilliance of this film are the fateful diner sequence and the fantastic ending. Micheal's emotion is so ever present in that scene it is like you are right there with him holding the gun, focused on killing the man that attempted the murder of his father. You are with Micheal. Brilliant Scene. I also love the ending in which the door closes on Kay who has just watched Clemenza kiss the hand of Don Michael Corleone, her husband. Best final scene I have ever witnessed.<br/><br/>In final, I return to my opening remarks and Stanley Kubrick's quote, ""The Godfather is possibly the greatest movie ever made."" To me, this statement is amazing. This came from Kubrick...KUBRICK!...quite possibly the greatest filmmaker that ever lived. That just goes to show how powerful The Godfather is.

Besides this they all have normal family lives with most cherished spouses and children and are usually very religious making pompous wedding, christening and funeral ceremonies in the Church or under priests' directions. This reality and atmosphere is splendidly shown in this movie that Coppola directed in a superb way and with a competent and strong hand. The cast has a stupendous performance. Marlon Brando plays a magnificent part in the role of the old godfather of one of American powerful mafia families, mastering his intonation and facial expression effectively thus creating an unforgettable character in the history of cinema. The action unfolds itself along the movie in a very captivating way. I want to stress particularly the sequence of the christening in which the new family godfather (Al Pacino) makes all the oaths in the name of the child (of whom he is also the Catholic godfather) and before the priest while a parallel cut shows us all the time a series of murders of rival mafia chiefs that were taking place at same time in several other places and which had been ordered by himself. The contrast of the religious scene and the violence of the killings is really impressive and full of meaning. This is maybe the best movie about mafia ever made."
"emrelanur","10","3","6","6 August 2007"," A Must See...if you still haven't.
","Filmed over 30 years ago, i believe that The Godfather to this day, is simply the best movie ever made. To be honest, i think that before they make another movie this good, particularly in this genre, we will be watching it with our children's children...if we're lucky.<br/><br/>I had to watch The Godfather more than once to realise that this movie is actually more about family than the mafia or the underworld. Most of the vengeance and deaths in this movie are not caused by money or greed. They are for family. I must say i haven't seen a movie before that gives this much importance to family. Particularly Al Pacino's character - Michael does an unbelievable turn around when it comes to his family. It's just incredible. At first reluctant to get involved with the family business, Michael soon becomes more ambitious and tougher than everyone else, again only for his family.<br/><br/>The fact that this movie is non clichÃ© makes it more enjoyable to watch. It's not predictable in a sense where the good guy wins and bad guy loses eventually. It's so much more realistic than that. I have nothing bad to say about the length, editing and definitely about the cast. Al Pacino especially just continues to surprise me with how good he portrays his character. He is no doubt the best actor in Hollywood. <br/><br/>Some people may find The Godfather very slow, dark and depressing. It's not the loudest and most 'vibrant' movie, but that's kind of the whole point. I believe those people should then stop watching movies from this genre, because if you did not like this one...you won't like any. No words and reviews can do this movie justice and i believe that unlike some over rated, inflated movies The Godfather actually deserves its big reputation of being a masterpiece and one of the best movies ever made. without a doubt...10/10"

","Well what can i say? A great cast, a great director and a great film. This surely has to be one of my all time greats, beautifully acted and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, in a sense that its almost ubelievable to believe that a director could achieve this. The cast line up includes Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino and Diana Keaton. Marlon Brando gives an extraordinary performance as Don Voto Corleone aka the Godfather. With its breath taking story line and emotional story telling and a stellar cast.What more can you ask for this emotionally gritty drama.

"lnunez0306","10","3","6","14 February 2007"," Greatest film of all time.
","Many who have viewed this film consider it one of the best films ever, if not the best film ever made. The performance by Marlon Brando is legendary and iconic. The plot development and character development by far is heads above any other film that I have have had the pleasure of seeing. What in my opinion stands out above all in this film and perhaps the most understated and unappreciated film performances ever.Al Pacino played what I believe to be the most believable and powerful performance in film history. The complexity of Michael Corleone and his slow and uncontrolled spiral into the dark side of power and influence.Never before have I seen a more complete and developed performance; it is as if you see this idealistic young man forced into a life he rejected, only to become the most ruthless and feared crime figure of all time,all the while maintaining a realism and not going over the top much like the Tony Montana Character Pacino Played in Scarface. Displaying power and intimidation with minimal effort or any threatening physical attributes Pacino is able to let us as the viewers delve deep in to the soul of this tortured young man and see the birth of power hungry perverse monster who carries himself like a wolf in sheep's clothing. It was a crime that this stellar performance was not awarded with the academy award. The first two films of this trilogy allows us to see Al Pacino reach the pinnacle of acting, closing out what might be considered the best overall character performance in a film series with a truly under appreciated and powerful performance in the Godfather Part III. Pacino's performance in the Godfather in my opinion is the single best performance in film history, and the Godfather is the greatest American film ever made."
"KillerLord","10","3","6","1 February 2007"," It is a movie ""you can't refuse""!
","Imagine a room full of seasoned movie goers and critics. The topic of discussion - what movies are the best ever? And the name that unanimously pops up as a strong contender for the top spot - The Godfather. With an incredible star cast, an incredible director (Francis Ford Coppola) and a strong story (Mario Puzo) this movie surely deserves all the praise that it can get.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a three hour movie based on the life of the Italian American Mafioso based on the original novel written by Mario Puzo, who also has written the screenplay along with Coppola for the movie as well. It stars legendary and highly respected actors namely Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, etc.<br/><br/>What makes Al Pacino's role particularly tough is the evolution and the development of his character. He starts out as a person who does not want to do anything with the family business and as circumstances change he gradually changes the direction of his life and evolves throughout the movie. And Pacino does it splendidly. Surely his acting skills are not overrated as some might feel.<br/><br/>The story is a depiction of bitter reality, a bitter reality that was already put forward in the novel and made more accessible and imaginable in the movie. Perhaps this also explains why some haters of the movie exist. It does not offer the escape from reality many other movies seem to offer and let us face it - it is not a simple, straight story to understand. Though 3 hours in length, many viewers could watch it over and over again and each time a viewer watches it he might understand it in greater depth.<br/><br/>The direction is near flawless. This is one huge reason why this movie is always critically on the top spot. Incredible research has been done by Copolla and Puzo in depicting the Mafia world. How does a Don think? How does he protect himself by organizing layers and layers within his empire that render him untouchable by the law? How insecure does he feel? What does he consider when he plans a move? How careful does he have to be in every step that he takes? How does he exploit the whole system around him in order to be the one controlling all the strings (please note the puppeteer's strings in the logo of the movie The Godfather)? These are some of the questions both the movie and the novel try and answer.<br/><br/>For those of you who have read the novel, I am pretty sure most of you will not be disappointed. It is the best example of how best can a movie be made out of a splendid novel! And for those who saw this movie and liked it, I'd suggest that you read the novel as well for it shall explain in even greater depth the subtle details of the working machinery of the Mafia empire. And yes, please see The Godfather 2 as well.<br/><br/>And may I also add in the end that the second part ""Godfather 2"" is a fulfillment of the first. A must watch for every person who has watched part one.<br/><br/>I am sure that this movie is going to retain the honour of its top spot and critical finesse for many years to come."

","The Godfather has influenced every gangster film that has been made since. In terms of mannerisms, quotes, story line and characters.<br/><br/>Vito Corleone is also known as Don Corleone, who is the head of the Corleone Crime family, who are one of the five crime families in the Italian Mafia that rule America. Don Corleone meets a drug dealer named Sollazzo who wants to make a deal involving narcotics, the Don who has old fashioned value see's this as a threat and rejects the offer only to be gunned down. The Corleone kids, Sonny, Tom, Michael and Fredo must unite to hold their family and organisation together. And for Michael the youngest, things will never be the same again.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a masterpiece. There are endless scenes in the movie that strike a strong and powerful cord with the audience. From the first scene which shows Don Corleone sort out a problem to the violent death of his son and the rise of Michael.<br/><br/>Although made in 1972, still connects with people today. Its a different type of family movie like someone previously reviewed. It holds a strong sense of loyalty and what one will do if they are pushed beyond their limits. The cast is perfect; Marlon Brando is amazing as the ageing Don, while James Caan plays the hot headed Sonny perfectly and Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall give a great performance. But it is Al Pacino who shines. He portrays the innocent young man who vows to never be like his family only to plunge himself into darkness in order to protect his beloved family.<br/><br/>A masterpiece. A masterpiece that has effected the world when it comes to gangster movies."

","While I certainly wouldn't call this THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE, this movie sure has a lot going for it, starting with the cast. I of course like Brando and Pacino going at it, but my personal faves are James Caan and of course my main man Robert Duvall. All of them give dynamite performances here, forever raising the bar to new actors everywhere. Even though the movie is 3 hours, it hardly ever drags, Coppola has a tight rein on the story (or maybe it's the producers doing that?) and it makes for a highly charged, highly entertaining classic of the first order. Funny as It seems, I only got around to finally watching this movie last year. Although I'm not exactly doing facepalms over the fact I've waited this long to see it, this movie will never grow old with me,"
"michelerealini","9","3","6","9 October 2005"," A novel of images
","Francis Ford Coppola, maybe, didn't think in 1972 that this film would have become a cinematic icon. It's like a show business fairy tale: the young director needed a hit, he had debts and Paramount commissioned him to direct a movie based on Mario Puzo's bestseller. Coppola hired a big forgotten star -Marlon Brando- and some young and relatively unknown actors -Pacino, Caan, Duvall and Diane Keaton. Federico Fellini's music composer (Nino Rota) wrote the soundtrack. The film was shot in Sicily, New York and California. The rest is history.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" is a novel about an Italian-American family and the relationships in the Mafia. It's not only a blockbuster, it is also a deep study of characters. Coppola says that ""Godfather"" is a metaphorical vision of power in America... We can see this especially in ""Part Two"", which is not just a sequel: it's another chapter, where Coppola shows more contradictions in US society -Mafia's reign talks more and more with the other social and political institutions. (Martin Scorsese, for his Mafia's movies, chooses a more neurotic way of telling stories, whereas Coppola prefer a more classical style for his tales and likes to novelize the events.).<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" (1972): we know the Corleone's family and the way a clan keeps its power. There are rhythm, action, drama. And strong acting performances.<br/><br/>""The Godfather, Part Two"" (1974): the story goes on. A more bitter trip into the power and the loneliness of a Boss. The highlight is the combination of two parallel stories -Robert De Niro is the young Vito Corleone, and Al Pacino is the established ""Don"" Michael in the Sixties. It's the best sequel ever realized, maybe better than the original film.<br/><br/>""The Godfather, Part Three"" (1990): not as good as the two previous -actually it is much inferior to them, it was made too many years later. Some allusions to Italian mysteries (the death of businessman Roberto Calvi, the P2 lodge) are quite superficial. For the rest, the movie is well directed. Pacino is more Shakespearean -Coppola says like King Lear...<br/><br/>A must for the new Hollywood movies lovers. The first two chapters in particular."

I also admit that I'm not a Brando fan but if this film is meant to be the best of the best it shouldn't matter if I like Brando or not, I should still like the film right?, and I just don't. My dad is the biggest Brando fan and even he doesn't reach for this film when he fancies a bit of marlon. In my opinion Carlito's Way or The Untouchables are far superior 'films'of the genre. I think the main problem I have with The Godfather other then the never ending dullness of it, is that it always seems to be saying 'oh look isn't cool to be in the mob, we should all do it'. Of course it all goes belly up the the boys in the end but thats just a convention of the genre that has to be met, rather then being the message of the film. Not my cup of tea at all I'm afraid."

","Take a gangster film, dip it in sepia tones, wrap it in Nino Rota's elegiac score, add soap and sentiment, and you've got The Godfather, the ""Gone with the Wind"" of gangster films. And like GWTW, The Godfather represents old-style Hollywood film-making at its most popular, but it's no masterpiece, and Goodfellas and The Sopranos make it seem almost antiquated. Coppola's direction attempts to be sweeping, but the script and the characters are shallow and predictable. Scaled to be epic, the film is slow moving and talky with several characters and sequences that feel dispensable. The film doesn't really deepen or build excitement as it progresses, and despite all the talk about family, the members of the Corleone family are essentially stock characters. Pacino, Shire, Cazales, and Caan don't bond as a family, the patriarch is not a commanding or even likable figure who would inspire love or loyalty and Morgana King as mama barely exists. Though it netted an Oscar, Brando's largely immobile performance is gimmicky, and really a supporting role in terms of screen time. The Godfather is the story of Michael Corleone, and the film is owned by a brilliant Al Pacino. In support, Caan, Keaton and Duvall are pretty much one-note. The Godfather is an acknowledged film classic that became a cultural touchstone which inspired imitations and parodies;it was a media event and a box office phenomenon that swept the Oscars and Brando's sending Sasheen Littlefeather to refuse his Oscar only added to it's legend."

","***Spoilers Ahead***<br/><br/>I read the book by Puzo before I saw the movie made out of it. I loved The Godfather in writing. I thought the characters were well thought out and portrayed. When I rented the movie, I knew that there is no way to give the whole story in four hours and make it interesting so I looked for characters and the way they were illustrated.  I looked for the way relationships were passed on to the viewer compared how it was done in the book and after all this I was very disappointed. <br/><br/>I can forgive the movie for omitting histories about people like Luca Brasi and Al Neri. I can even forgive them for not working more with Johnny Fontane even though it was a great story that tied in well with the portrayal of Don's relationship with his Godson and how he expected to be repaid by people close to him. The movie skipped characters like Nino, Kay's parents and her background, the doctor and several others, but after all, the movie is not supposed to be a book word for word. <br/><br/>The Godfather had great cinematography. The scenes were beautifully picked and shot. My favorite is at the end when Michael stands as Godfather to his nephew and people are getting shot all around, that was amazing. The music was cheesy most of the time, but if that was my main complaint, I could still call this movie to be great. <br/><br/>What appalled me beyond belief is the horrible portrayal of Michael and his relationship with Kay (unfortunately it only gets worse in the 2nd movie) and complete lack of the mother's presence in the movie. Her and Kay develop a relationship. Kay becomes super Catholic and goes to church with her every morning. She ran away from Michael with his kids at some point because she was angry with him. And Michael was patient and never lost his temper with his wife. However, he was also very proud and when he returned from Cicily he did not go to her because did not expect to find her still waiting for him. And the movie failed to illustrate how much Tom Hagen was an outsider to the family. The Don lost some of his power because of Tom and that is why Michael removed him from the post. <br/><br/>I thought that Sonny was portrayed well as were Connie and Carlo. I thought that oranges as a foreshadowing device was a great idea. The ironies illustrated in the movie like the beginning of a movie with ""I believe in America"" are all good things that made this movie stronger. However, it lacks depth and complexity. I don't understand how one can understand what is going on in this movie without reading the book first.<br/><br/>

","The fact this movie is consistently called the best movie of all time absolutely baffles me. This isn't even remotely one of my favorite movies, in fact its one of the worst I've seen. Its 3 hours long, which is far too long, it's beyond boring and the story, or what little story there is makes no sense. I did not understand why anything happened throughout the whole movie, each death just happened for seemingly no reason out of the blue. Some of the actors mumble so much they are impossible to understand or speak in Italian without subtitles, which doesn't help in following along with what's happening. This movie does not deserve the extreme high praise it has received, not by a long shot. Its single redeeming factor to me is the excellent cinematography for its time, I'll give it that."
"irishm","6","4","10","19 April 2013"," I just don't get it
","I finally watched this movie, and I just don't get the hype. I didn't dislike it, and the violence didn't bother me, but I found it over-long and very, very slow. I'm a 50-something who doesn't demand a break-neck pace in a film, even an ""action"" film I'm used to watching long movies that take some time to unfold, and I don't mind that. I have patience. But ""The Godfather"" just seemed to be moving at the wrong pace for its subject matter. I never got into it. I finished it, but I didn't feel drawn into their world.<br/><br/>Not helping was the fact that of course by now everyone, even those who haven't seen the film, knows about all the catch-phrases and classic scenes, so they seem like jokes (although naturally that wouldn't have been a problem when the film was newly-released). Brando almost seemed to be a caricature of himself in the early scenes although he got a little better, a little less heavy-handed, after the Don came home from the hospital. In that first sequence in his office during the wedding, I could hardly understand a word he was saying. How could anyone take a man who spoke that way seriously? But again, I was watching it after many years of encountering deliberately bad Brando imitations, so I was at a disadvantage in that respect.<br/><br/>That wedding good lord, it lasted longer than many marriages do! I thought it was never going to be over. But while I was watching it, I recalled that I had in fact tried to watch this movie about 30 years ago, when my brother was really into it. I didn't even make it through the wedding. I remember my brother fast-forwarding the VHS tape to show me Abe Vigoda when he became convinced I wasn't going to sit and watch the whole thing with him one quick look at Abe Vigoda and I was outta there. This time I also noticed one of my favorite character actors, Vito Scotti, in the wedding sequence.<br/><br/>The people who did ""General Hospital"" in the 1990's must have loved this film. They even lifted the mobster's-chick-gets-blown-up-in-car idea for recycling on the soap opera.<br/><br/>I watched the DVD over two nights. The local public library gives me 7, and for a while there I thought I was gonna need 'em all. A good illustration of my feelings for the tension and pacing of the film are that after Sonny bought it at the tollbooth, I turned it off for the night and went to bed, since that was as good a place as any to break. Just didn't care, one way or the other, what was going to happen next. One less character to keep track of. Plenty more where he came from. I was just hoping Vito Scotti would come back.<br/><br/>I won't give it a 1 as others have in a deliberate attempt to bring down its average I'll give it an honest rating that I really feel it deserves. The fact that I don't understand why so many people are so crazy about this film doesn't necessarily mean that I'm right and they're wrong in fact, it might well be the opposite. But I stand by the title of this review: I just don't get it."
"gavin6942","8","4","10","17 August 2006"," Greatest Movie in World History? Maybe. Maybe Not.
","The people who vote on the Internet Movie Database have ranked ""The Godfather"" as the greatest film ever in human history. Which is nothing to sneeze at, and deserves some seriously thought. I watched the film, thought it was great, but hardly found it to be the greatest film ever made. I mean, if you told me ""Citizen Kane"" was the greatest film ever made, I would wholeheartedly agree. And personally, as far as gangster movies go -- with or without Al Pacino -- I think the real choice should be ""Scarface"". But I'm not professionally trained as a movie critic, so maybe I'm missing something.<br/><br/>I asked my supervisor and a co-worker about the film, and while they both thought the film was good, they really did not think it was some amazing masterpiece. My supervisor said, ""maybe it's good because it is so real"", but that's not a convincing reason and how ""real"" it is I cannot say for sure.<br/><br/>If nothing else, the film might be great simply because it has become so cliché. The horse head, the Marlon Brando voice, the gun behind the toilet and the line ""an offer he can't refuse"" are all part of pop culture these days (over 30 years later). But does being cliché make the film great? I guess that would make ""Star Wars"" the greatest film ever made, which is certainly not true (though not a bad film by any means).<br/><br/>And sure, you have powerful and memorable performances. James Caan is amazing, Marlon Brando is a bit over-the-top (a mumbling, lock-jawed godfather? sure...). And Al Pacino is of course great as always, maybe more so here than anywhere else. Not only does he have more range here than any other film than ""Scent of a Woman"" (more often than not he simply repeats a variation of his Michael Corleone role), but he is so young and plain that he is not even recognizable as Al Pacino in many scenes (I didn't recognize him until 30 minutes into the picture).<br/><br/>I haven't yet mentioned the plot: an aging mafia boss (Marlon Brando) hands control over to his son (Al Pacino) when the father becomes ill, though he hoped never to do so since his son is Ivy League educated. Brando's role is actually quite small compared to the attention he is given (the film is really about Pacino coming of age).<br/><br/>The directing is decent. Nothing special, but not awful, either. Very real and almost gritty (but not dark). The acting is great. The music is perfect. The only thing that really needed work was the fact that many of the Italian scenes had no subtitles and were thus lost in (lack of) translation. The entire Sciliy subplot and Appollonia were excellent and could not have been improved upon.<br/><br/>I'm sure much more could have been said, but I'll cut myself off here. Certainly looking forward to Part II (though keeping my hopes and expectations low) and maybe someday I'll see Part III (though I've been warned not to)."

","Although I have a high regard for THE GODFATHER as a gutsy crime melodrama, I would not place it as the #1 film of all time. That place in cinema history should still go to GONE WITH THE WIND, in my opinion.<br/><br/>But it's a brilliant piece of work, gorgeously photographed, extremely well crafted throughout with everyone in the cast perfectly suited to their roles.<br/><br/>I read the Mario Puzo novel and it's as though each actor was hand- picked for their roles with uniform precision. Highest ranking among the performances are MARLON BRANDO (although I needed the caption feature to catch all of his mumbled words), AL PACINO, who practically carries the main part of the story with a very earnest, very strong portrayal of the favorite son, JAMES CAAN as the hot-headed Sonny, and DIANE KEATON as the romantic interest (Kay) for Pacino. All of the others do stand-out work, particularly RICHARD COSTELLANO as Clemenza.<br/><br/>Rumors that some of the details reflect the story behind Frank Sinatra's desperate quest for the role of Maggio in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY are apparently quite true. After all, here the crooning son who needs to save his fading singing career is eager to get a serious role in a war film that is just right for his own Italian persona. We learn that his sweetheart is also the object of lust by a studio head who has spent millions turning her into a studio star only to risk losing her as a property if she marries the crooner. Sound familiar? It should. Think Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra. Or even Sinatra and Kim Novak. (Is Harry Cohn the lecherous producer???) But just how many of these details are true, I don't know. I like to think that author Mario Puzo invented some of them.<br/><br/>Aside from this aspect of the story, which culminates in a very famous and bloody comeuppance for the uncooperative producer, there are plenty of other gripping sequences where we know something bad is about to happen because of the various injustices within the crime families. This is the hook that ties all of the sequences together and maintains suspense right up until the final touching scene.<br/><br/>A brilliant piece of work--but still not at the top of my ""favorite movie"" list. It's a well-structured crime story by a man who really knew how to write for this genre--and a man (Francis Ford Coppola) who really knew how to direct this sort of crime melodrama, so meticulously detailed and realistically set in the 1940s."

","The Godfather is an engaging and compelling story to say the least, but as a movie- so what?  Just because something makes for a great story or play doesn't mean it can automatically translate onto the big screen.  There has to be some point of making it into a movie, and quite frankly, The Godfather works just as effectively as a book.  The characters, the dialogue, the plot twists- yeah, they're all okay, but where are the shots, the angles, the editing techniques, the sound effects that make this into a number one film???  The conventions of film are all used pretty simply according to the Hollywood format- ie, make the camera invisible.  There are few scenes anywhere in The Godfather Trilogy that stand out in the history of cinema. If you want an entertaining movie, you will certainly like the Godfather. But you may just as well read the book (unless, like so many today, you haven't the time).  But if you want a film that stretches the genre or that will blow you away with an element OTHER than storyline and dialogue, you can do a lot better."

","No doubt a good movie, but to place it among the top ten is foolish. It hasn't introduced anything new at any cinematic level. Its influence on the living trends of cinema is practically zero (no interesting movie made after The Godfather owes anything to it). It's the paradigmatic example of what Fredric Jameson calls nostalgia cinema, a pastiche of the old conventions of gangster movies, a kind of funerary monument. Classical cinema ended long time ago (probably in the fifties), and this movie is just a well-done late survivor, a kind of aesthetic dinosaur."

Diane Keaton also plays easily one of the most annoying roles I have ever seen in a film. Every scene in this film drags on and on and on, making it very possible to summarize the whole thing without leaving out details in around thirty seconds.

"FilmCriticLalitRao","6","3","7","13 October 2014"," By directing ""The Godfather"", American director Francis Ford Coppola has given viewers a unique opportunity of discussing Italian values in an American setting.
","When it comes to a discussion about the popularity of American cinema, it can be stated that there is hardly any American film as famous as ""The Godfather""-a film which has caught the attention of cinema admirers all over the world. While watching the film, at first sight, viewers wouldn't lose much time to learn that the gangsters portrayed in ""The Godfather"" don't care at all for human lives as business interests come before anything else. Hence, it is perfectly normal for a man to get his brother-in-law killed as he has been disloyal to his family. It is the violent scenes of this kind which aim to terrify without being gory. From a cultural point of view, the ubiquitous discourse about American values of Italian gangsters in America make Francis Ford Coppola's film an intellectually rich viewing experience wherein there is ample spotlight on participating in family gatherings, looking well after family members and choosing to converse in English instead of Italian. Apart from the character with a crooked face- actor Marlon Brando who garners all of viewers' sympathies, good performances have come from other leading players namely Robert Duvall, Al Pacino and James Caan. However, exquisite photography by veteran American cinematographer Gordon Willis and great Italian composer Nino Rota are two more reasons for watching this film about a ruthless family of criminals who left Italian shores to wreck havoc in a new land of dreams."

"freemantle_uk","10","3","7","22 April 2008"," The daddy of the modern gangster film
","There is no denying that the Godfather is a classic and one of the best movies ever made. It is a saga of a major Mafia father, the upper echelons and there struggles. It starts with Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) on the day of his daughter's wedding and doing favours for people invited to the wedding. The films shows the outcome of these favours, including the famous sense of the horse's head in the bed. The film then shows Vito refusing to take part in selling drugs and ends up having an assassination attempt against him. The Corleone family is forced into a tuft war before peace is made. At the same time the Godfather shows Michael's (Al Panico) rise in the family, from being a bit of an outsider not wanting to get involved to becoming the head of family after Vito's death. The film shows how person relationships developed and shows the characters as real people. It shows how the Mafia would have worked in the 1950s, focusing on deal making, rising up the ranks and showing acts of violence being conducted.<br/><br/>The gangster film was not a new genre, their were good films in the film noir period such as Scarface, Little Caesar and the Killing. However I am not aware of any major gangster films in the 60s. The Godfather focused on the characters and many different and complex plots and subplots. It was able to bring in more violence into the genre because by the late 60s films were allowed to show more violence. The film also benefits from a brilliant script, the excellent direction of Francis Ford Coppella (this film along with The Godfather Part II are his best films) and a brilliant cast. Marlon Brando was brought back into the mainstream after gaining a reputation for being an ego-maniac, and help made the careers of Al Panico, James Caan and Diane Keaton. This was also the first film I aware of focusing mainly on the Mafia and how it functions. I remember watching a document on the making of the film on Channel Four and how difficult it was for the filmmakers, fighting with the Italian-American community.<br/><br/>The Godfather and Godfather Part II are both classics and must watch films. I admit I have not watched Godfather Part III but that because I heard it wasn't as good and ruins the first two. It has been very influential in the gangster genre afterwards. They was Once Upon A Time in America which was similar in it approach, having many story lines and themes and similar filming of violence. They was Goodfellas which forced on foot-soldiers of the Mafia and set mainly in the 60s and 70s when it was filmed in the 80s. They are also films like Casino and American Gangster, the list goes on. They are also parodies such as Family Business and programmes such as the Simpsons, Futurama and Family Guy. Finally their was the Sopranos (one of the best programmes ever made), mixing elements of the Godfather and Goodfellas. All in all the Godfather is a very important film."

"ellie_auk","10","3","7","17 February 2006"," One of my favourite films
","The Godfather recognises the polar opposite to the American dream. It itself represents the ""dark side to the dream"" in a romanticised way using mise-en-scene and costume as well as Coppola's clever use of binary opposition with light and mood. <br/><br/>The Godfather shows some clear morals also, such as the importance of family and patience. Loyalty is key and you find yourself, as with any good gangster film, becoming loyal to the characters, or the family introduced, in this case the Corleone's. <br/><br/>Coppola's time frame is clear from the beginning, it is set with Micheal's army uniform from world war two, which allows a certain amount of historical l context to be conveyed without being explicit. <br/><br/>Violence within this film is both implicit and explicit, you will view violent scenes and also know when violence is being implied. Which only adds to the beauty and the danger of the film.<br/><br/>Many have said this film is slow moving and confusing, however to watch with a careful eye, which is must be viewed with, it displays a complex world to a naive viewer, sympathy is invoked carefully and somehow all crime committed within the film is seemingly justified with careful use of versimilitude."

"Stibbert","10","3","7","26 October 2005"," A true masterpiece
","The Godfather is a true classic. What differs this movie from others is the realism and that it's very believable. I thought 2 1/2 hour would be a long time, but time really flies when you're having fun! The movie follows the Carleone family, a good old Italian-American mafia family. The year is 1946 and the drug-market is just opening. When the Carleone refuses to take any part in this business some of the ones counting on this get's mad.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the book by Mario Puzo. It's a well written movie. A smart thing to let Mario Puzo do the screenplay as he knows all the characters and the story inside and out. The story is not a simple one and there are quite a few characters. That might make the story confusing, but if you just pay attention you'll do fine. The characters and the combination of characters are great. We have a kind of anti-hero (Michael), the boss (Don Vito), the trigger happy (Sonny), the bystander (Hagen) and more. That gives plenty of opportunities for conflicts between them. The characters are very believable and you get to know them, what kind of persons they are. The story and action is also very good. You get caught up and dragged into another world. The dialog, witch is important to this movie is well written. It's not that typical movie where everyone knows what to say at any time. There are silence and thought-breaks, that makes it all more casual and normal.<br/><br/>The actors are very good. The have settled for nothing less than quality actors in all roles. They use Italian-Americans and that makes it all more believable. Marlon Brando and does a good job and will forever be remembered as Don Carleone. Al Pachino's performance is nothing less than great. The rest of the cast are also very good an delivers a very good performance.<br/><br/>The cinematography is classic. There are nothing really special about it, but it's all over good. The composition is good and the lightning is nice. They've captured the mood very well. It's not happy, it's not dark, it's something in between. There are no shots that stands out in a bad way, so you don't really pay attention to it. You just focus on the story.<br/><br/>The sets, decoration and costumes are incredible. It's very realistic. It's 40's all the way, yet you don't really think about it. You never stop to think that ""this is the 40's"". It all just comes natural. It really helps you get caught up in the movie. Not once do you think ""why don't he just pick up a cell phone?"", because it all seem so realistic and well done.<br/><br/>Nino Rota has made a forever memorable score. It's classic and easy to recognize. It makes a nice, kind of gloomy mood, and fits the rest of the movie perfect. I also like the lack of music. In the action scenes there are no music. This makes it more tense, personal and human.<br/><br/>There are some special effects in this movies. Some blood, fights, shots and explosions, but it not that much. What there is is rather good. Some it has a little theatrical look to it and therefor I'm glad they didn't make a big deal out of it. The fact that they don't literally overkill and focus on this makes the story more serious and much more believable. This movie is no action movie, but 100% drama at it's finest.<br/><br/>The Godfater is a classic, must-see movie for everyone. It has a special place in movie history. It almost a legend. If you like movies this is not a movie to miss. It's a little long, but don't let that scare you. My tip is to watch this movie when you're up to it. If you watch at the wrong time it'll destroy you impression of it, but when you get the chance, watch it!"
"diand_","8","3","7","14 June 2005"," Doors, windows, mirrors
","In contrast to part 2 this is more loosely structured and sometimes less climactic and also seems more improvised. But thanks to the enormous effort put to detailed cinematography and camera-work it lends itself more to repeated viewings. (One example: when Vito is about to be shot there's a poster on the grocery store announcing a fight of Jake LaMotta thus foreshadowing the assassination attempt).<br/><br/>Probably the most interesting is the light and dark contrast between the outer, ordinary world and the inner, godfather world. Even when these two worlds meet in one shot they are still strictly separated by showing two rooms in a way where you watch one world from the other (the end shot e.g. where Kay is seen in one room and the men in another: then the door shuts).<br/><br/>Very effective use of mirrors (reflection), doors (separating worlds) and windows (showing perspective). From the back-to-back shots and other shots where an object obscures the picture we can see where many modern filmmakers get their ideas (Kar-Wai for example).<br/><br/>Coppola has himself watched Antonioni very well: Scenes where only buildings or spaces are shown to create an alienating effect or just loneliness combined with tension (hospital scene). Or characters disappear and only a static shot of the room is seen to signify emptiness (fight between Connie and Carlo).<br/><br/>Especially the end scene is well edited and composed: But they even improved on that scene just two years later."

At first look it would seem to be a film about a family of gangsters, but I think that what it really is is a story of how a good, intelligent man, a war hero, can become a monster by degrees.

","a very exciting and interesting movie,including a lot of good acting specially Al Pacino as Michael Corleone ,which make you think about many things. a movie consist of cruel,clever,killer and of course lonely characters. a movie about violence,about mafia and about the life of us ,the true life of us."
"silentium","10","3","7","4 July 2003"," The definition of epic.
","The entire scale for this movie is huge, and every scene carries emotions with it. The acting is amazing, as is the score and direction. So, what's wrong with it?<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW<br/><br/><br/><br/>
First of all, people get their hopes up so high when they see this film that, it's to the point, if it doesn't change their life it's considered to be boring and dated. But, also, people also down vote it when it threatens the popularity of their trendy LOTR flicks and other movies that make you 'cool' if you like them.<br/><br/>Acting - Brando was so subtle and yet had such a dramatic impact on the way acting was done. I have images from this film that I remember, and mostly I remember Brando holding the cat in the opening scene. His voice has influenced modern film and television - as almost every show on television has paid homage to the father of all film. <br/><br/>Score - The score is haunting, and somber in all aspects of the word. It builds emotional tension and it has a pay off. The main theme is amazing and is beautifully put together and is always in the right context when it shows up in the film. It's beautiful, and I strongly urge you to get the original soundtrack.<br/><br/>Direction - Francis Ford Coppola took a very subtle and consistent approach in bringing this film to life. Think of Michael in the diner with Captain McCluskey and Sollozzo, as the train is perfectly timed in going by, before Michael (in Al Pacino's career making performance) explodes with rage. It is so apparent in his face, and we feel as he does -- nervous yet we still anticipate. <br/><br/>Story - The script is very well written, adapted from the brutal book by the brilliant Mario Puzo. The story of the film was ahead of it's time - and it still is. While being played on television today there are still people who refuse to like this simply because it's hyped. They try to go against anything that's popular in an attempt to look cool. It doesn't work - so give me The Godfather over Pulp Fiction (and all of the hip crime film copy cats that it spawned. i.e. The Usual Suspects [which is ranked higher than ON THE WATERFRONT] -- what is wrong with our society?)<br/><br/>
Everything is perfect as we become immersed in the world of the mafia boss Don Vito Corleone, and we're along for the ride as well follow him through a few years of his life. This film changed the way I saw art within movies.<br/><br/>
Yes, I hated it the first time I watched it. But, for some reason, felt I should watch it again. On the second viewing it was confirmed; I hated it. I trashed it everywhere, including on this site, and made it sound like the worst movie ever made. Boy, how much I've grown. I trashed it because I didn't want to be caught up in the frenzy this movie has produced. It created a whole spawn of copy-cats and followers trying to capture the art as The Godfather did, and sadly, it will never happen. This will never be duplicated or surpassed in any sense. From start to finish I am completely captivated at the imagery, the music, the brilliant acting, and the underlying script that holds so much warmth, and brutality.<br/><br/>For any true fan of film - do not hate this simply because you want to be 'different' from others and look like some sort of outsider since you went against society by not liking a great movie just to prove how original you are. Face it, you're not original - you're doing the same thing others have done when it comes to this film for years, and as I once done as well. All of these kids who hate this film will have the hip movies in their best of lists, and you can figure out their personality from reading them.<br/><br/>Their lists will have these films on it:<br/><br/>The Shawshank Redemption (another reason why people try to hate The Godfather; Shawshank is their favorite film and it burns them inside to see The Godfather best it in the top spot)<br/><br/>Fight Club (hip and trendy, violent and against society. What more could an angst filled teenager want?)<br/><br/>LOTR (The scenery is beautiful, but turning everything into some sort of contrived melodrama because the script calls for it is ridiculous; this is by no means the best film ever made. It's a flavor of the month that will die out as time goes by and people realize the acting is horrible.)<br/><br/>Etc, etc, etc. It seems like it's cool to dislike The Godfather films because it makes you look like some sort of 'rebel.' Trust me, Spock, it doesn't make you look like you're cool; it makes you look very stupid.<br/><br/>
So many people have given this film a '1' in voting. How in the fudge? The music was awful, the acting was awful, the direction was awful? I highly doubt it. Anyone with an IQ over 100 would never say this film deserves a 1.<br/><br/>My proposal for a new IMDb rating system, based on categories.<br/><br/>SCORE: 1-10 [1 = awful   10 = excellent] ___10___ (KEY)<br/><br/>
 ---------------------The Godfather:<br/><br/>Acting (leading) 10, Brando changed method acting forever and, in this role, plays the most memorable film character to ever grace the screen. His voice only deepens his enigma. Respect this man.<br/><br/>Acting (supporting) 10. Coppola got wonderful performances out of his mostly amateur cast.<br/><br/>Score: 10. It's at the same time haunting and beautifully done.<br/><br/>Direction: 10 easily. This changed American films forever.<br/><br/>Script: 10. Written with brilliance, sheer brilliance. The story is brutal, and so is this ambiguous adaptation.<br/><br/>Replay value: 10 -- this film never lets go of me, and has my eye from the very start. I could never get bored watching the masterful acting come from every character in the movie.<br/><br/>There, and I average it up and get my rating of: 10.<br/><br/> ------------------2 Fast 2 Furious:<br/><br/>Acting (leading) 4. I've seen worse, but not much worse. Words are repeated so often it feels like a cheap video game.<br/><br/>Actor (supporting) 5. Tyrese gives needed comedy, but still needs to watch some good films.<br/><br/>Score. 1. Awful, tries too hard to market itself towards an ignorant mainstream teen audience.<br/><br/>Direction: 3. Some of the scenes are decently choreographed, that's about it.<br/><br/>Script: 1. Totally forgettable. The dialogue is stagnant and brings absolutely nothing profound or new to the table.<br/><br/>Replay value: I'd never watch the film again. It brings nothing new to the table and is stupid.<br/><br/>Average that up. If someone gives 2 Fast 2 Furious a 10 for ACTING -- they don't deserve the pleasure of being able to relate to the majesty of the best American film ever made; yes, that's right: The Godfather.<br/><br/>
If you don't like it the first time -- watch it again and force yourself to not get bored. If you make it through the second time (it's an acquired taste) think about it, think about the profound story it expresses, the emotions it throws into scene after scene after scene, inviting us to consider, and even feel, the pain they are all going through, and the love and happiness they often share with their, you guessed it, family.<br/><br/>Don't like this movie? I'll make YOU an offer you can't refuse: a hip trendy blow-em-up-shoot-em-up flick with no moral value and no merit at its core.<br/><br/>
Score: perfect all down the board, this film could never be topped. To me, the only films that come close are Apocalypse Now and Rashomon (in the woods - Akira Kurosawa)<br/><br/>But, before you trash this film -- do what I did: give it an honest chance and forget the hype. After a while you will realize the hype was there for a reason, this film is amazing and will continue to be looked at as the best film to ever be made, regardless of what anyone has to say about it. Say it's dumb, say it's long and boring, yeah yeah yeah, you've got ADD, go watch commercials. They're easy to understand and yet so informative. If anyone actually thinks this movie deserves more than a 6 in rating it is disturbed. No professional film goer (someone who has seen over 100,000 films) would EVER say this movie was horrible. <br/><br/>Goodfellas is just a mundane rehash of everything The Godfather had already perfectly portrayed. It's a good film in its own right, but could never match The Godfather. Sure, it's hip -- let's get some of that so people will invite us to the mall so we can check out the latest ORIGINAL clothing that everyone else that's trying to be original is wearing! Oh, a shirt that says ""you laugh because I'm different, I laugh because you're all the same."" What a wonderful paradox; there's a million cliche'd teenagers out there wearing that shirt now, thinking they're original for doing it - but yet it's a mainstream shirt that everyone has. Come on kids, watch some good films."

"rigi","6","3","7","19 January 2003"," The Godfather does not come close to Goodfellas (Spoilers)
","I am not able to discern much greatness here. Very slow to start it takes too much time to set the mood with period sets and as a consequence does not have the time to make us get into the characters, raise our interest for them. For a long time it is not really clear on which of the main characters the movie really focuses and we thus cannot invest ourselves in one of them, but have to watch in a rather detached way the ""epic story"" of an entire family, their general mafia business dealings which to me at least are nothing new. The focus on Michael which comes only after some time is achieved with a scene where as a loving son he saves his father, then with a rather inexplicable revenge act which starts an all out gang war, and finally with a cartoonish love story which is also an exploitation device: the one full frontal nudity shot is totally out of place, and I am not against sex on film in general (the scene is however a direct adoption of Mario Puzo's pulp style, so it's at least true to the original material). All this is hardly above cliche. <br/><br/>Compare this to Goodfellas, where Martin Scorsese lets us into the head of one single gangster. By concentrating on three friends and their ascent in the mob, the viewer is guided in an effective and engaging way. The exhilaration, the rewards, the madness, the brutality, the arrogance, the anxiety of the mob life are all presented and, using voice over, explained. The viewer gets to understand the motivation of the characters in depth. That Scorsese is a much more effective director than Coppola can be seen from a direct comparison of two scenes. In The Godfather, Sonny beats up his brother-in-law Carlo when he discovers that Carlo beats his wife. This is done in a somewhat drawn out, brutal but standard style, filmed from a relatively static viewpoint at a distance. The average viewer having witnessed hundreds of movie-brawls is most unimpressed. In Goodfellas, Henry knocks down the guy who was harassing his girlfriend in a very similar scene. However, set in a peaceful neighborhood and done in a much faster editing style, the violence comes as a shock and it's over before it has begun. When Henry concludes the encounter with a death threat and Karen in voice-over talks about how she gets excited by the behavior of her boy friend, Scorsese has created a lasting impression. Or, as another example, compare how food is treated, an obvious fetish for the Italian-Americans as portrayed in movies. Coppola treats us to an recipe explained on-screen by Clemenza and a few shots of dining tables and dishes full of food. Scorsese however continuously gives us close-ups of frying pans and people cooking and amassing foodstuffs, and, in the narration of the last day before Henry is arrested, makes the stirring of the tomato sauce into the calm eye of the storm. This is just a masterful characterization, giving 'flesh' to the topic and guaranteeing to leave everybody hungry. <br/><br/>The Godfather does have it's moments, of course, and it has a formidable cast. The problem is that they only have a pulp novel to play with, whereas in Goodfellas it's the true autobiographic material of a real life gangster.<br/><br/>
Finally, I want to add that The Godfather is certainly not the ultimate masterpiece for Coppola. From a directorial standpoint he has achieved much much more with Apocalypse Now. In the end, however, Martin Scorsese is still a better director by far."

","A young Turk is asked to take over the family business. The only problem is that business is a franchise of New York's Murder Inc.<br/><br/>The bones of the original Godfather have been so raked over that there doesn't seem a lot left of the corpse to examine. I almost passed on it until I read some of the other reviews which miss so many important points.<br/><br/>Yes, great acting (Brando as the old Don and the Pacino as the new will never get better parts). Yes, great directing (Francis Ford Coppola). Yes, a great musical score (Nino Rota). But, nevertheless it is a film that won't quite a settle in my own mind. The information we are given on screen, while believable, is only a selected view of organised crime. I might even argue that it is a cop-out view.<br/><br/>I saw this film as a child and was, then, unable to stand back and examine it as a whole. I wanted the cheap bang-bang, the stripped suits and the violin cases. I was bored by the central theme and thought that watching it (for three hours!) was a bit of a chore. Even today it is a bit slow, but I am now an adult and I can see all the things I missed first time around, not all of which flatters.<br/><br/>Not that the central theme passed me by: The corruption of the innocent and the rights of passage. How many other people - other than Mafia sons - are born with a destiny? Members of the royal family, sure, but who else? Offspring's of Frank Sinatra (perhaps referred to, obliquely, in this movie) and Elvis Presley haven't even entered show biz no matter tried to take their father's crown. To tell such a story there is few other places that Director Francis Ford Coppola could go but to the mob.<br/><br/>Here you have it all: Wealth, politics, extreme violence, corporate problems, the psychology of power, double standards: The whole world of lies, truths and half-truths all together in one place. They say the devil has all the best tunes, but he has a few good film scripts in his locker too.<br/><br/>Coppola was nervous as a kitten back then. He introduces the characters in a good light and tries to highlight the good before we see the other side (and often it is not lingered on). He knows full well the audience could be lost before it is won. So no medals for bravery. <br/><br/>We see the wealth and power, in clear visuals, but we don't see where the money comes from. Where are the beatings, the robbery and the drug addictions that the mob perpetrate?  The bricks and mortar of the  Long Island mansion that we see before us.<br/><br/>The family is not involved in drugs (and is against them) says the old Don at a ""sit down""? How do we know? Crime is freelance, the only role of the mob is protection  of its members which means a share of the money they earn out of direct sight.<br/><br/>(You could say that this sight-unseen street crime puts the cotton wool in Marlon Brando's mouth!)<br/><br/>Pornography and vice he doesn't have a problem with - although we don't see it and don't, in the main, care. Women are just another commodity ""that corporations cannot provide.""<br/><br/>Killing seems to be sacred (a theme we see repeated in this series). Pacino doesn't have to kill (it wouldn't have been beyond his wits to have the job done by others) but does so. As a vengeful killer he is real deal - as a non killer he is the baby-faced ""college boy"".<br/><br/>The film does little for women. They are all hand-wringers or professional lookers of the other way. Either that or victims. OK feminism wasn't around back then, but good actresses such as Talia Shire and Diane Keaton don't have a memorable line between them.<br/><br/>Many of the faults of the first part were put right in the second. We see how power was taken (not given) through the barrel of a gun and some of the home truths that Godfather (Part One) tiptoes around. Nevertheless three hours is a lot of screen time not to have a few minutes to look at what these people leave behind - namely innocent victims..."

","I'm a modern type of movie viewer, but I can appreciate classics, like ""Annie Hall"", ""Midnight Cowboy"", ""Forrest Gump"", ""Casablanca"", etc. I simply do not understand what people see in ""The Godfather"" To start with, I'm not really into the whole crime mob Italian Sicilian Naples mafiosi family thing, so it didn't have my attention at that. The acting was good, but Marlon Brando was annoying--his weirdy voice is infamous, but I couldn't understand anything he said! It sounded very flaccid and emotionless, too.<br/><br/>The story itself seemed very pointless... Michael Corleone kills a bunch of people, mob hits, his father gets shot or something, he becomes the new Godfather or something. Nothing had shown itself much changed or resolved. Didn't serve a purpose other than to show a bunch of cursing and killing. With thick accents.<br/><br/>The mood was also very very cold-hearted. There's a general complaint about Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"" that it's very cold, too, that the characters don't have a warmth to them that you can identify with. ""The Godfather"" characters are like this too. You can't identify with any of the characters because they seem so heartless and cold, not even with a hint of charm to them to make you like them, except maybe Marlon Brando, who seemed like a crazy old grandpa who's half-senile.<br/><br/>I can't see the classic status of this movie. If it were released today, would it receive the same praise?"
"Maul_40","1","16","65","18 January 2004"," Quite an interesting piece of film.
","I love the fact that the movie give us an insight in something we would, as ""normal"" people, never get the chance to know. It's a world full of traditions, family values, rich and explicit verbal and behavior language, but also a world of corruption, power, deceit and murder. Francis Ford Coppola knows how to create this Italian-American feeling throughout the whole movie, and it never feels superficial. It's a very good movie, but not extra-ordinary. I lack a bit of depth in the storyline like in the approach of the young son Michael being dragged into the world of the mafia. It was a bit too easy. He gets smacked in the face by a corrupt cop, and suddenly he wants to shoot everybody. I think I miss an essential scene between him and his father in the clinic. Anyway, trying to keep The Godfather on number feels a bit compulsory and bizarre. I think that this great movie needs to get away from this forced spotlight position, so we can appreciate the film without all this hype. And we shouldn't be blind to other great cinematic pearls being made in recent years."

","""The Godfather"" is a 'terrible' film.<br/><br/>It's 'the worst' movie I've seen in a decade. The acting in this film is 'excruciatingly painful'. The whole family are 'watered down Sopranos' who show some phenomenally strong 'lack of' chemistry. The 'boring' weeding scene is the 'highlight'.<br/><br/>Michael is a 'wet fish' and his relationship with Kay is very dumb, and also 'stupid' and 'weird'. The Godfather scenes make me 'sick' and 'woozy'. I haven't seen such dramatized 'try to be cool' dialogue since ""Any Given Sunday"".<br/><br/>Pacino was less wooden in ""Gigli"". That other film he also 'carried'. Both Puzo and Brest were largely let down thanks to this 'Tony Montana' The characters of Sonny and Fredo were so 'unrealistic' I thought they were 'comic book'. I must also highly criticize the music in this film as being 'childish' and sometimes often 'out of place'.<br/><br/>Now on to some other failings of this 'pathetic' movie. The dialogue was 'silly'. If it was supposed to be nail-biting, well, it 'failed'. The manner in which the actors delivered their lines was 'uninspiring'. Brando in particular 'sucked'. What about the 'long' and 'tired' Sicily scenes? Reference to four hours of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" I don't know? The car exploding was so 'unoriginal' and 'clichÃ©d'. And the 'take over' cross baptism montage. Come on, do some CGI instead! Bah, 'armatures'.<br/><br/>How this is ranked above that masterpiece ""Muriel's Wedding"" stumps me. If they had replaced the old and tired Francis Ford with the more youthful Nicolas they might have hit pay dirt."

"jmarktip","3","4","11","10 August 2015"," The Godfather Part I
","Even though I gave this film a three star rating (pretty high for me), I consider it one of the more overrated ever. Reviewers from some newspapers and magazines gave it strong advanced notices, and that got the ball rolling before other media and the public saw it. Plus it had almost an all-star cast headed by Brando, often considered the king of American actors of his generation. Granted Pacino and some of the others were young but most of the cast had some reputation going in.<br/><br/>I know Coppola had not directed much if any but was known as a good writer, especially from ""Patton."" My gripe with the movie is it is basically an overblown melodrama with a lot of hype and gloss. The cinematography is good but not great. The acting: while a few minor people are good, Brando is terrible, mumbling more than ever with those cotton balls or whatever in his cheeks. Why did he think he had to play it this way? James Caan gives the best performance. And the flick is hackneyed, an old-time gangster one, full of violence and anger and crudeness. It is not film noir. They took the crime genre and Hollywooded it up, trying to make something grandiose. Two gangs pitted against each other, using gages and fifty caliber submachine guns. So what else is new? ""Little Caesar"" was better."
"bull-frog","6","4","11","18 January 2007"," Could have been a lot better.
","Because of all the hype surrounding Godfather, I decided to take the plunge. I started out reading the book. I read the first 40 pages on a long flight. Not wanting to spend endless hours reading nearly 500 pages, I decided to watch the movie instead. I have to say I was disappointed. Godfather is basically a soap opera shortened to 3 hours.<br/><br/>First, there's too much dialogue. Godfather's probably 10% action and 90% talk. It wouldn't been so bad if you could understand the conversations, but I found myself constantly missing out on something and having to rewind. I particularly got lost when the Don meets the Sollozzos for the first time. This conversation was one of the most important parts of the film, yet I heard nothing but mumblings.<br/><br/>The jumbled storyline doesn't help either and not much makes sense. Michael's activities in Italy, his business dealing in Vegas, and him beating up a guy in the street had absolutely nothing to do with the plot. Why the hell those scenes even added? I have never seen a movie that conveyed so much confusion to their audience.<br/><br/>The acting was excellent though, but as one has already mentioned - lacked depth. Godfather had little character development and the characters do not have distinct personalities. I swear you couldn't tell Michael or Sonny apart. I think this was more the fault of the scriptwriters or director. Also the chemistry between Kay and Michael just wasn't there. Their marriage at the end seemed odd because of the poorly scripted relationship between them throughout the film.<br/><br/>A good movie in my definition should be one that can be interpreted by even a ten year old. Too often, the movie conveys too little information and expects you know everything that's going on.<br/><br/>I do have to say the movie has an artistic quality to it. The setting and camera-work beautifully done. And as I have said before, the acting was top-notch. Unfortunately the negative aspects doesn't make up for it. When the movie was over, I couldn't believe it was over. I was like, that's it? I was expecting so much more, especially for being a top ranked movie on IMDb.<br/><br/>If you want to see a real movie/show, watch Prison Break."

All the brutal shooting, wife beating, and all forms of killing and hurting made me quite uncomfortable. To me, it makes no sense to glorify violence to such degree.<br/><br/>Put the excessive violence aside, this movie is not bad. I was not bored at all while watching it.

The cinematography is rich and the music is perfect. However, I failed to see how Marlon Brando's performance was top notch. His acting was decent; he did not move much nor talk much.

","I decided to read the novel before I watched this, just to allow me to write a fair critique of the movie afterwards. I would've rated this film 10/10 if during the hospital scene, the Godfather's bed rolled down the flight of hospital stairs and out the main doors, with Al Pacino and the nurse in hot pursuit. The bed would then continue to roll down the street, rapidly gaining velocity, as the mob hit men and several police officers continued in the pursuit of him. This scene would be more enjoyable if several civilians greeted The Godfather as he zoomed past them and wished him a Merry Christmas, perhaps piling presents onto the edge of his bed, happy to see he's doing well after being shot on the streets. Overall though, this was a perfect film that followed the novel closely- I don't have many complaints."

It was like this for every film until I watched The Godfather. <br/><br/>First of all, for a film made in 1972 its film quality is superb! Also, though I didn't recognise the actors I knew they were talented. Even the ones not essential to the story. An example of this is the man in the first scene coming to the Godfather for help. His emotions seemed real, and he perfectly delivered his lines in a single, lengthly shot. <br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie still holds up to this generation, even those like me who generally dislike old movies.

To permit us a glimpse at The Mob, with all of its ethnic insularity, is like giving a chronic gambler a chance to wander above the false mirrors that overlook every casino. A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits. In its blending of new depth with an old genre, it becomes that rarity, a mass entertainment that is also great movie art.

Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs, and Vito refuses his permission or help. What follows is a clash between Vito's old values and the new ways which may cause his youngest son Micheal (Al Pacino) to do the thing he is most reluctant in doing, and join the family business.<br/><br/>I found it to be over long and very drawn out. Sometimes a movie nearly three hours long, can feel like an hour and a half, as it is the engrossing and enjoyable the time flies by. This felt like I spent five hours watching it. <br/><br/>With the exception of Brando, all the cast are superb. And I don't mean that as a slant at Brando, he does what Brando does. No more no less.

Spectacular work of acting in actors like Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Michael Kane, Marlon Brandon and the whole cast. The crew had to be amazing to, in order to make such successful film. Bringing a tragic story from reality to the magic world of the movies, so many people can enjoy it. Today seems the time has not past and it is very pleasant to enjoy amazing acting performances of each actor and still learn from each peace of scene. It will never past away and will stay as a classic, hope it can be around for all new generations of actors, directors and producers. Wish some day I can share tables and set with great actors like them, who have been inspiring and example in my work and professional life as an actor. Thank you all."

","It was like your building a high tower, and with the rules of construction to do something like that you must start with a solid tough base can hold the weight and levels. Godfather was written first with a unique way, that made you more interested to see the man's life, who can change you life, or even make your life in past with a word. For me it started with the DOP, with the amazing picture. Decoration, accessories, the site, and really the performance of all these stars together. Music was amazing and much matching the time of the movie, specially when you do your search of the music of that time. Last and least, the Director, who controlled all of his tools and made this great movie, i never felt bored of watching it."

","There isn't much that I can say about The Godfather that hasn't been said a million times. A masterpiece, as close to a perfect film as you can get, arguably the best film ever made, ""a film you can't refuse,"" etc. Coming from a guy who's favorite films have mafia/gangster-related themes, The Godfather is the greatest film ever made in the history of U.S. cinema, in my slightly biased opinion.<br/><br/>From the legendary music (beautiful work by Nino Rota), to the cast and the acting (Brando, Pacino, and Caan), to the cinematography (brilliantly done by Gordon Willis, aka ""The Prince of Darkness""), to the fascinating story and everything in between, there is nothing about this film that disappoints. It is one of those films that everyone should watch at least once in his or her lifetime, because the chances are that you will want to watch it again."

","A GREAT MOVIE, one of the best film art ever, the actors are great especially Al Pacino that made there(in my opinion) his best performance of his career. this movie takes you inside the Italian mafia world in the US but more important, it takes you inside the Corleone family, it shows the the relationship between the father, Don Vito and his children, especially with Michael(Al Pacino). What makes this movie so fascinating is the way that Francis Ford Coppola(the director) make you to identify with the main characters - people who murder their enemies and live like they are above the law, he make you love and admire the bad guys - The Mafia.

","Until a viewing last month, I hadn't watched The Godfather (Francis Ford Coppola, 1972) for a good five years. In the interim it seems to have got even better - if such a thing is possible.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando is Vito Corleone, the mafia don whose empire starts to crumble when he opts out of a move into narcotics, only for war-hero son Michael (Al Pacino) to enter the fold, jettisoning his father's dream that he'd become a senator. It's grand and sweeping, and yet intensely personal: a wonderfully-acted fusion of family saga and human tragedy whose key players inhabit a vivid world of fierce ethics and bloody violence. Coppola and co-scripter Mario Puzo (who wrote the source novel) have plenty to say about family, honour and the American Dream - and the classic scenes are just legion.<br/><br/>Some have argued that Brando's Oscar-winning performance is really a supporting role, but despite a lack of screen time he dominates the entire film and provides many of its finest moments. There's the moment he learns of Sonny's death, then calls in an emotional favour (""Look how they massacred my boy""), and a simply staggering two-handed sequence in which he maps out past and future to his successor. ""I thought that... when it was your time that - that you would be the one to hold the strings,"" he says. ""This wasn't enough time, Michael, it wasn't enough time...""<br/><br/>The old-fashioned storytelling, complete with impeccable production design, is augmented by Coppola's use of '70s innovations, like overlapping dialogue and informal out-of-focus close-ups, as well as Nino Rota's unforgettable score. The staggering ensemble includes not only Brando and Pacino (who is simply brilliant), but also James Caan as the last word in likable hotheads, Robert Duvall playing pragmatic family lawyer Tom Hagen and veteran Richard Conte, superb in his key supporting role as Don Barzini. It's a magnificent movie."

","I'll admit the movie at first was very boring, but after watching again, I fell in love with it. A movie that is really flawless. Incredible Story (I WON'T REVEAL ANY OF IT), Great Directing, Very Intense and deep scenes throughout the film, great music, the stage is very well set (this takes place in the 1940s, it was filmed in 1972 and it was almost as if it was filmed in the 1940s). And the most important of all is the acting, THIS MOVIE HAS PERHAPS THE GREATEST ACTING I HAVE EVER SEEN. To start, James Caan places as ""Sunny Corleone"", Robert Duvall as ""Tom Hagen"" (you may also know him from ""Apocalypse Now""), The Legendary Al Pacino as ""Michael Corleone"" puts up a hell of a show. And to top of it all was perhaps the Greatest Actor of All Time behind Humphrey Bogart: Marlon Brando as ""Vito Corleone"" Brando was the old actor, but still put up a great show starting a franchise that became one of the greatest films of all time. The film won Best Picture (despite being an R rated film), and Marlon Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor in Lead Role. I'd probably start a debate just saying it's the greatest film of all time, but I'm going to do it anyway, THIS IS THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME, everything is perfect in this film. You are not educated in Filmographically if you haven't seen this movie. If this movie didn't exist, the movies nowadays would be 100% different than what they are now. Period."
"Troll_Patrol101","10","2","4","24 September 2009"," Utimately Great
","''The Godfather'' is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove.<br/><br/>During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt.<br/><br/>The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): ''Don't ever take sides against the family.'' It is significant that the first shot is inside a dark, shuttered room. It is the wedding day of Vito Corleone's daughter, and on such a day a Sicilian must grant any reasonable request. A man has come to ask for punishment for his daughter's rapist. Don Vito asks why he did not come to him immediately.<br/><br/>''I went to the police, like a good American,'' the man says. The Godfather's reply will underpin the entire movie: ''Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you'd come to me in friendship, then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if, by chance, an honest man like yourself should make enemies . . . then they would become my enemies. And then they would fear you.'' As the day continues, there are two more scenes in the Godfather's darkened study, intercut with scenes from the wedding outside. By the end of the wedding sequence, most of the main characters will have been introduced, and we will know essential things about their personalities. It is a virtuoso stretch of film-making: Coppola brings his large cast onstage so artfully that we are drawn at once into the Godfather's world.<br/><br/>The screenplay of ''The Godfather'' follows no formulas except for the classic structure in which power passes between the generations. The writing is subtly constructed to set up events later in the film. Notice how the request by Johnny Fontane, the failing singer, pays off in the Hollywood scenes; how his tears set up the shocking moment when a mogul wakes up in bed with what is left of his racehorse. Notice how the undertaker is told ''someday, and that day may never come, I will ask a favor of you. . .'' and how when the day comes the favor is not violence (as in a conventional movie) but Don Vito's desire to spare his wife the sight of their son's maimed body. And notice how a woman's ''mistaken'' phone call sets up the trap in which Sonny (James Caan) is murdered: It's done so neatly that you have to think back through the events to figure it out."
"jussi-kangas","10","2","4","22 January 2009"," One of the most touching movies of all time
","I must say that I did not like Godfather when i saw it for the first time. This may have something to do with the fact that i was 10 years old and loved Arnold Schwarzenegger action movies. I watched it again when i was 17 and i was blown away by the beauty (and tragedy) of the movie.<br/><br/>I can understand why everyone does not enjoy Godfather. It is quite slow paced and does not necessarily appeal to a viewer who is used to gangster movies with lot of action in them, movies with 'dramatic' Hollywood soundtrack and movies that have quick 'dramatic' plot twists.<br/><br/>First of all, you must remember that this is is not a gangster movie. This is a movie about family. This is movie about responsibilities. So if you are waiting to see Scarface then you are in for a big disappointment.<br/><br/>Best part of the movie is the story. Movie tells us tale of the youngest son of the American-Sicilian mafia family. Tale of the son who has decided to live his life by the laws of the united states and not have anything to do with businesses of his family. But through the tragedy that brings the whole family together, son is little by little drawn back to illegal side of family. Finally son becomes what he did not want to be. What he despised. Because of the responsibilities to the family he forgets his ambitions and plans and becomes the Godfather.<br/><br/>Coppola has really got the best performance out of the actors in this movie. Every emotion of Michael and other characters is forwarded to viewer. Special mention to the cast of this movie. I have not seen a movie with better casting. Cinematography of the movie may be a little out of date but it still is really really beautiful. Especially beautiful sets in Sicily deserve a mention. Nino Rota's soundtrack supports the drama of the movie in a way that I can hardly think of the soundtrack that does this better.<br/><br/>All in all, i love this movie. If you combine first two films, you get the classical story of man changing to what he does not want to be. Classical story about rise and the fall of the man who turns from kind and loving person to ambitious, greedy and paranoid leader who pushes all his loved ones away. Story not too far from another one of the greatest movies of all time. Story not too far from Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>And oh yes. I will dance Speak softly love in my wedding next august."
"mrmoviefreak261-1","10","2","4","29 November 2008"," Take a look at the accomplishment of a masterpiece
","Godfather is a one of a kind film. Nothing can ever beat this kind of story, with the Mafia and organized crime. Francis Ford Coppola just makes an amazing story like this come alive. It was made so that Francis could keep his studio running, Zoetrope, and probably didn't intend for it to be such a masterpiece it is. It's complete genius. Marlon Brando as the Godfather who gets a kiss on his hand and being told who should be killed, and getting lots of friendship from different people. Al Pacino, who is one of the most important actors of all time, is one of his sons, who is in the army, and not really into the family crime business unto soon enough. And other characters who make the Corleone family a one-in-a-million family, with astute heads. This is probably the, or probably one of my favorite movies of all time, just because it works, and is directed professionally, and perfectly. The acting puts a whole other atmosphere into this film. Watch it, and be sure to watch the second one also."

I had heard so much hype about it, and that it was the greatest movie ever, so I was skeptical. I was not disappointed; except when Sonny died, that just ruined my day. He was my favorite. This movie has everything that a good drama needs.<br/><br/>Actors: Everyone that had a role of significance, played it to a tee. I never noticed any moments of ""I can't believe he just said that. This is like CSI:Miami."" <br/><br/>Characters: This movie got you to root for basically the ""bad guys"". It portrays them in a way that makes you feel that they are just like your family, they just happen to kill people for a living. They were all dynamic and interesting, and you couldn't really just classify them as the good or bad guy. <br/><br/>Filming/technicalities: Their lighting was the one thing that I actually noticed about the technical aspect. They always had innocent events out in broad daylight, but when a bad guy came on, or something dark was going on, it was almost always concealed in the shadows. Normally I don't really care about those types of things, but it gave the movie a nice effect."
"vito7","10","2","4","2 November 2008"," Greatest of all time
","For my money the original Godfather is the greatest movie ever made. Compelling, legendary and timeless, with Marlon Brando coming out of retirement to blow the barn doors off the hinges with his portrayal of Vito Corleone, one of the most revered characters in movie history. He once again raises the bar on what a great actor can achieve and should be expected to. This movie began one of the most amazing movie careers in history with Al Pacino and also took America's guilty obsession with the ""ganster"" to new heights. It is a constant frustration for me when The Godfather II gets a higher rating then the predecessor. Also an all time great but there is likely no movie that deserves higher praise then this original ground-breaker. It has set a level of excellence for crime dramas that every movie since only strives to reach. The number of referenced and quoted scenes in modern Americana is matched only by Casablanca and thirty five years later it has still not faded in the memories of its audience.<br/><br/>Logan Lamech www.eloquentbooks.com/LingeringPoets.html"

I wanna say that this is the best film in history but thats really a matter of ones opinion and taste. Whether its better or worse than citizen Kane is your opinion, mine goes with the Godfather. Not that Citizen Kane is far off but what are we judging on here, The films impact, or the Film it self. Citizen is judged by its impact of every film that came after it. As a film it self, I don't feel it matches up to the Godfather nor gone with the wind or Schindlers list Given the difference in eras that they were all made. But hey, thats just me.

","One realizes the importance of movies after watching this movie.Though paced slow , yet misses nothing. The movie tells the story not just of a mafioso but also of one of the strongest and most stable characters created -The GODFATHER. One of the most remarkable part of the movie is Al Pacino's acting. In the beginning he is a very cute person and you don't see any vice in him.Now, when things go bad for him ,you see him changing ,his eyes becoming dangerous.By the end of the movie he is entirely somebody else -The next GODFATHER. The theme music has a touch of negativity in it to depict the dark side of the Godfather but the Sicilian part has very soothing music also. The only drawback(if at all it is) is the pace of the movie which might seem slow compared to these days movie with so many cuts and pacing music,but if you have the patience to watch it, only then will you realize how great the movie is."

The order is established only when there is a leader (even in communism). <br/><br/>Godfather and the other characters in the movie establish the order of human beings with balance of power (to lead, communicate and protect).<br/><br/>This movie has presented the ideology of Godfather in a way that predicts human nature better than many other films. <br/><br/>Those who cannot interpret/correlate this movie with their own lives, please see it again with that notion.

The writing is superb, i've read the book, and together with the film they are both my favorites, and the directing is Coppola getting the whole essence of the honor, respect, devotion, love, desire and revenge. is totally illogical that two films like the dark knight or the The Shawshank Redemption (great films by the way) are better voted that this, the greatest masterpiece on cinematic history"
"nuitsilencieux","10","2","4","7 July 2008"," This *might* be the best picture in movie history.
","When Francis Ford Coppola is on, he is absolutely on. The Godfather, in all of its noirish glory, is brilliant in virtually every respect. It's hard to criticize it, so I'll just honor it some more.<br/><br/>In The Grapes of Wrath (the novel), Ma Joad asks Tom if being in prison has made him ""mean-mad."" She knew Pretty Boy Floyd's mother, and she recalls how Floyd started out as a nice boy who kept getting hurt time and again, and who eventually became a monstrous killer. Michael Corleone is the epitome of that concept. As soon as Vito says that Michael is not to enter the ""family business,"" you know that he will be damned. The movie is his struggle to overcome every single hurt that comes his way, especially when they involve the ones he loves most. You can watch him lose his soul as the movie progresses, and your heart breaks. Coppola and Pacino make you wonder if you should pity Michael, hate him, love him, admire him, condemn him, worship him. That's the difference between a film that skulks around the bottom of the Top 100 films ever made and a film that is always in the top three."

The whole world loves it and hails it as one of the best movies ever. Some (including me) even ranks it as THE best movie ever.<br/><br/>Based on the Novel by Mario Puzo The Godfather, after a lot of problems during the shooting, was released in 1972 and was a great success. It was nominated for 10 Oscars including Best director Francis Ford Coppola, best Costumes, Best Supporting Actor: Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Best Scrip based on previously published or produced material: Mario Puzo, Francis Ford Coppola, Best Leading Actor: Marlon Brando and Best Movie, and won the three last mentioned. The movie got 3 sequel's, one released in 1974 and one in 1990, both directed by Coppola and written by Puzo.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, Brando does the performance of his life. Al Pacino, who got his breakthrough in this movie, together with James Caan and Robert Duvall make perfect supporting actors. For examples take a look at Pacino in the restaurant scene, Caan when he is arguing with Tom Hagen, or Duvall when he delivers a horrible message to his father played by Brando. The writing is amazing, it is true to the amazing novel, a lot of the dialogue is taken directly from it. The directing is perfect, he sets the perfect feeling and mood for the movie and it's a mystery that he didn't win the Oscar for his directing.<br/><br/>To conclude the review.The Godfather is a true masterpiece that no-one should miss, maybe it will change your life the way it changed mine?

"n-mo","10","2","4","2 May 2008"," Apparently it's popular with its subject matter, even...
","Everything about The Godfather is brilliantly framed--well, almost. The depiction of Sicilian country life is, perhaps, a bit crass. Even so, its insular depiction of the world of Cosa Nostra was true enough to life to win the laud even of members of the criminal organisation.<br/><br/>In the first place, ""The Godfather"" does an excellent job of weaving together the literal and metaphorical world of the mafia. Within the mafia, traditional institutions are given a warped, double meaning in which to frame illicit activity. For example, ""mafioso"" literally means, ""man of honour,"" but ""honour"" refers to a loyalty to an entirely different set of rules than those to which any Christian (or post-Christian) would consider even remotely acceptable. ""Famiglia,"" as used in Cosa Nostra, means a criminal corporation. ""Cristiano"" in the Sicilian tongue often designates not merely a Christian but any human being; to CN it signifies any ordinary man of honor. As for ""godfather,"" one mafioso standing godfather to another's son is often a formalisation of an illegal business pact.<br/><br/>Puzo's and Coppola's Corleonesci, however, carry the double-edged sword of actually showing both meanings of these loaded words. The mafia family here IS a literal family; the men of honor, portrayed as they are in a closed word, CAN actually be viewed sympathetically as ""honourable."" (Of course in real life most mafiosi are literally Catholics {albeit sham Catholics}.) Here, the closed world so carefully guarded through layers of command in real life is given further immunity and legitimacy by actually being what it publicly claims to be--and so much more.<br/><br/>Little needs to be said about the performances, which are by and large stellar; the casting of Al Pacino is of course a near sure sign that the film will succeed. Perhaps Diane Keaton may not be much to look at, but she does not play a major role in this installment. Neither do the cinematography, the score, the high-level tension, etc. ad infinitum, require further laud than has already been heaped upon this film. If you haven't seen it yet, you've probably been living under a rock. Immaculate taste and Latin sophistication await, all ye primitives..."
"paul2001sw-1","9","2","4","21 January 2007"," A tale of personal business
","Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' is often voted amongst the best films of all time, but watching it today, it's surprising how conservative it feels. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, for, it's undoubtedly a piece of film-making of the highest class; but also a slow, stately epic that one could not imagine being made today in quite the same form (the contrast with Scorcese's 'Goodfellas', for example, shows clearly the direction in which film-making has evolved). On the other hand, to be fair to 'The Godfather', one must note how much it has influenced the gangster films that have succeeded it, perhaps making it seem more orthodox than it was at the time of its release (there are even stories that it influenced the real life mafia!). Of course, there's something conservative in the very idea of a gangster story, with its appeal to ideas of tradition and respect, even if the need for a plot means that such tales must inevitably focus on period when the traditional codes are breaking down (and the need for honesty must expose the extent to which they are a sham anyway). 'The Godfather' does both these things, in what is ultimately, behind the superficial subject matter, a story of personal transformation, that of Al Pacino's clean-cut college kid into the true successor of his mafioso father (played by Marlon Brando). The fact that this was arguably Brando's last great, complete, cinematic performance, as well as Pacino's first, has undoubtedly added to the movie's iconic status. Overall, I can't quite agree that this is the best movie ever: for all its sweep, it's a tale of people lacking a certain core of humanity, and therefore lacks the emotional intensity of my very favourite films. But it's still a mighty thing, worthy of its place in the cinematic canon."

I saw it on original release in the Netherlands on a weekday afternoon with perhaps 5 people in the theater...when Michael killed the cop and the gangster and walked out right before the intermission, you could hear everyone in the theater gasping from the relief of pent-up breath. The Godfather has one of the great goofs ever shown. In the scene where Sonny beats up Carlo on the street in front of Carlo's bookmaking operation, there's a shot of Sonny swinging a roundhouse right to the left of Carlo's face; you hear the impact on Carlo's face (nice Foley work), and Carlo's head is jerked to his right from that impact. It is all quite persuasive except for one thing: the camera was positioned directly to the side of the fight on a line at zero degrees of angle, and so you can clearly see Sonny's hand miss Carlo's face by at least 4 or 5 inches. A phantom punch! I get a kick out of this every time I watch the film."

Not only is the film aesthetically pleasing but the grandiose storytelling at work is a must see for any film enthusiast.<br/><br/>The real success of this film is the much discussed, understated performance from Al Pacino. It is ironic that an actor who is famous in contemporary cinema for his over the top performances in 'Heat'(When I think of a woman's ass..) and 'Devil's Advocate (insert any line here) delivered one of the finest understated performances in cinema history. Another actor could have over played the part and rotted what has to be seen as the films core. Where Pacino is the core, admirable support surrounds him, with brother Sonny (James Caan was never better) and father Don Vito (Marlon Brando) played lovingly and sympathetically. Brando excels in his death sequence playing it with real heart and also displaying the frailty of a former 'tough guy'.<br/><br/>Although labelled as a masculine film, the film heralds to great supporting performances from Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. The chemistry between Diane Keaton and Al Pacino in the opening wedding scene is a rare thing and the Documentary featured on the DVD allows us to see more of this. Any couple not gripped by the inner turmoil of the male/female relationships in this film must have hearts made of stone.<br/><br/>Finally, my favourite aspect of the film is the work of Walter Murch. This is evident in the cafÃ© sequence where Murch added the sound of the train to the soundtrack. Cinema has never been so tense.<br/><br/>The only way that anyone can realise the true power of what is the finest single achievement in cinema is by watching it themselves. And remember without the first film, the second would never have existed."
"rpan","10","2","4","16 October 2005"," all movies should be made like this one
","Best movie in my category. Brando's acting is magnitudes above any best actors in Hollywood and in any other world theaters. I suspect Brando's brilliance is unmatched by anyone before and (I suspect) after him. For example, Pacino is superb but still Brando is head and shoulders above Pacino. I just love Brando's acting, he simply grabs you and take you to anywhere the movie wants you to.<br/><br/>But a good movie is not only a good actor. The whole cast, the plot, the dialogs, the scenes and last but not least the director - Coppola are all near perfect. I thank GOD for bringing such talent to Hollywood as Brando and Coppola. Al Pacino is good but under Brando's brilliance his color did fade away a bit.<br/><br/>The supporting actor - Robert Duval is also a superb actor. Even in this cold and bloody killing movie he brings warmth of family friendship, loyalty and cool-headedness to the audience and making this movie this much more gripping.<br/><br/>The weight of a first-class movie is apparent starting from the first few scenes of the movie and lasted throughout the movie. Coppola knows how to grab audiences and move them up and down through the plot of the movie - a true master.<br/><br/>It is hard to compare Coppola with Lucas. They are both wonderful directors of different classes of movies. But I believe Coppola can better bring depth and intricate emotions to audience than Luca. This makes him a more memorable director even after we all pass on."
"rogierr","Null","2","4","31 July 2001"," Neither the best film ever, nor my favourite: the greatest crime flick it is
","Definitely not the greatest movie of all time, but the greatest crime movie it could be. Not only because of the very good and epic story (Mario Puzo), but also because of the aesthetics and fabulous cinematography by Gordon Willis (Annie Hall, Klute). Not to mention the absolutely fantastic cast. It's is impressive that Marlon Brando played the completely different part he did the same year in Bertolucci's 'Ultimo tango a Parigi'. I think it is a pity Sterling Hayden (The Killing, Dr. Strangelove, Asphalt Jungle) had such small part in this nine-hour trilogy.<br/><br/>One of the most distinctive elements of this great crime movie is the music, which was already recognizable in 'Rocco e i suoi fratelli' (Visconti, 1960) and was more or less recycled for this film by Nino Rota (Amarcord, Obsession, Boccaccio '70).<br/><br/>10 points out of 10 :-)"
"Yoda-21","10","2","4","2 December 1998"," a movie beyond judgement
","Let me start not with high praise, which is a regular sentence spoken on this movie. It is a motion-picture to discuss and yes there are elements in it that are extremely ambivalent. In the context of acting, directing and all the other formal aspects this is an exceptional achievement. I cannot think of too many others that can claim to have as polished dialogue and yet believable actors. But nevertheless the aspect of presenting a family-tragedy within a mafia-clan is at least to be consumed with your mind switched on. Coppola doesn't bother to present obvious critical points of view, but he presents the members of the Corleone-Clan as business-men. They react on their surroundings in the way it is necessary and to protect their family they don't bother to kill dozens of people. It is the contrast between the loving father and cold-blooded head of the clan, which attracts so many people to Brando's performance. He is so life-like on the one hand and yet manages to mute the  questionable traits of character that would paint Don Vito as a criminal. On the whole it can be said that this is still a movie which should polarize audiences, not least due to the growing influence of mafia like structures in many poor countries."
"eibon09","Null","2","4","13 February 2001"," Modern Gangster Classic
","The Godfather(1972) helped resurrect a low budget genre known as the gangster genre and turned it into a major film genre for the next two decades.  Many people found a new way in speaking to each other by watching this film.  In fact many members of organized crime in the USA began to pattern themselves right after the characters in the film.  The gangster genre would become one of the most popular genres to come out of Hollywood since the end of Film Noir in 1958.<br/><br/>
The film deals more with the joys and sorrows of an mafia family then with what they do for a living.  You can identify with many characters from the film because many people also go through almost similar problems in life. Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo contribute to give some excellent story telling visually.  Marlon Brando gives a very good performance as the head of the family, Vito Corleone.<br/><br/>
There are many memorable moments in this film.  One, the Wedding scene at the beginning of the movie.  Two, the Sollozzo-McCluskey murder sequence. Finally, the death of Vito Corleone.<br/><br/>
The Godfather's success would spawn many classic gangster flicks including Mean Streets(1973), The Godfather Part 2(1974), Once Upon a Time in America(1984), Goodfellas(1990), and Donnie Brasco(1997).  Also influences filmmakers ranging from Martin Scorsese to Abel Ferrara and John Woo to Takeshi Kitano.  Sergio Leone was at one point offered to direct The Godfather(1972) but turned it down.  I believe that The Godfather(1972) would be just as good if in the hands of a genius like Sergio Leone.<br/><br/>
Al Pacino gives a terrific performance as the youngest son, Michael.  James Caan gives the best performance of the film despite his role as a supporting actor.  Frank Sinatara was considered for the role of Johnny the singer but didn't get it because the role was too close to home for the famed singer. Robert Duvall is outstanding as the lawyer for the Corleone family, Tom Hagan"

"y-33180","9","0","0","16 May 2020"," Why is ""godfather"" a classic in classics?
","The godfather tells a romantic gangster epic in a melancholy and calm style. It is one of the greatest gangster movies in the history of the film and is known as the bible of men. Not only has the film been successful in criticism, art and box office, but it has also set an example for future generations. It is a classic film praised by many people, and it has a good rating of up to 100 percent on authoritative film websites. The American Film Academy, an authoritative film organization in the United States, appraised it as ""the greatest gangster classic film in the United States"" and ""godfather"" has a profound influence on film history, gangster type films and popular culture. It is the best film in the film history in the hearts of many directors. The excellent interpretation of actors such as Malone Brando, Alpacio, Robert de Niro and so on, coupled with the historical poetical nature of the story itself, makes the film a masterpiece. ""godfather"", as a gangster film, is not nihilism to dilute the meaning of religion, on the contrary, this film has a deep Christian brand, it rarely discusses good and evil, and rarely uses subjective lens to express religious morality, but at several nodes, it focuses on the inner suffering of the characters and lightly expresses this connotation."

","The film, at first glance, tells the story of an aspiring young man who degenerated into a Mafia boss. However, if you think about it more deeply, you will find that it is actually a process in which people choose between survival, integration into the environment and changing the environment so as to complete themselves. To go a little bit further, it's about how people's beliefs change people."

","This film, which is regarded as a legend, has finally been seen, holding a sense of sanctity to see the whole movie. In addition to my feeling of being blind to the face of foreigners, it's not bad. There are not too many stories in the last three hours that make you want to fast forward. At first, I feel that the godfather is a bad man, but it's only a matter of interest. At least he has his own principle and likes his saying: ""a man who doesn't often stay with his family will never be a real man."" No matter what happens outside, at least he does a good job in this aspect of family and feels happy at home
What's more, I have also seen the sophistication of the world. Why can the godfather get the support of some politicians? Because they owe him more or less. In reality, it's the same thing. Sooner or later, what they owe others will be changed. I don't know whether I understand it or not. But the whole character of the godfather is complex and chaotic, and the actors are also soul level performances, Malone's saying ""never let anyone know what you are thinking"" should also be some of the top, undercover maxims."

What Citizen Kane lacks in a compelling story, The Godfather has one. Every scene has so much detail in it which makes pretty much every scene memorable! From the opening of the movie to the baptism scene. Every scene has value to it. Francis Ford Coppola almost did not make a masterpiece at all. The production company refused to have Al Pacino and Marlon Brando in the movie and look how that turned out. They wanted Laurence Olivier or Orson Welles in the lead role of The Godfather. In any of those two were in the lead role they would have never delivered on a good performance. Michael Corleone is the greatest character to rise to power. It is much more interesting ride to power instead of Citizen Kane."

Marlon Brando, as a veteran actor, blended the two roles of father and godfather very well, and very natural. His first appearance in the movie has completely conquered the audience. He is a unique godfather.
Director: Francis Ford Coppola also arranged the story very well. Although this is a very long movie, I have no fatigue at all. The climax and calm of the story have very good rhythm and regularity.

","People often compare ""The Godfather"", which in many ways is thought of as the original crime drama, with many others that have come since(namely Goodfellas). However, I have yet to see one of these films surpass the original Godfather; it really is as great as everyone says it is.<br/><br/>Based on influence, iconic moments and authenticity alone, ""The Godfather"" has entrenched itself deeply in film history. The acting, character writing, cinematography and screenplay are all outstanding and make the three-hour long runtime more than worth the experience. In particular, I was most impressed with the ensemble staging when a crowd was present which, combined with the editing, kept the film more than engaging enough even when not much was happening. There are more great iconic moments in this film than I care to name; ""The Godfather"" has been referenced and mimicked countless times. Yet even without the glow of its influence, these moments would stand well on their own.<br/><br/>This film can be very daunting for a first-time viewer. It is nearly three hours long and a universally acclaimed classic that one feels the pressure to appreciate. However, I promise you that this one has earned every bit of praise that it gets."

","Winner of 3 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather is one of the most revered movies of all time and its contribution to cinema is remarkable. This movie will make you intrigued by its astounding depiction of the mafia and immerse you into its world from the very start while being impressed by its technical and narrative aspects.<br/><br/>Based on the Mario Puzo novel of the same name, The Godfather spans ten years and chronicles the history of the Corleone family under its patriarch, Vito Corleone, a respected Mafia don nicknamed the Godfather. But when Don Corleone refuses to enter drug business, a series of events are set in motion resulting in the assassination attempt on the Don and leading his youngest son to rise and take over his father's business.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola's direction is nothing short of astounding. Many of the creative decisions he made, such as the way he shoots the film, the casting, the screenplay, which he co-wrote with Mario Puzo, it's all done brilliantly. The technical aspects will also make you impressed. The cinematography is done beautifully and the use of Technicolor provides a memorable look for the film. The editing is also done well and the soundtrack by Nino Rota is one of the most memorable scores in cinema history, as its almost funeral-themed opening track still remains iconic and fits the film's overall tone.<br/><br/>The performances in the film are amazing, as it features an amazing cast of brilliant actors such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, James Caan, Richard Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire and many more. I love how the film handles Michael Corleone's character arc in this film and Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is one of the greatest performances in cinema history.<br/><br/>Honestly, there's really nothing to complain about this film, as it's highly agreed to be of the greatest films in history. The Godfather brilliantly weaves an intriguing look into the world of organized crime along with innovative storytelling, focused direction and astounding performances."

","If there is one link in ""godfather"" that is related to fate, it is love. In such a man-dominated film, full of killing and yin. Mou, brotherly feelings, family feelings, love this thing seems to be just an optional embellishment. But when you go deep into the godfather's story, you will find that this seemingly insignificant wind and snow is sometimes a decisive link.<br/><br/>Mike is, to some extent, the most similar to his father among several sons. Closed inside, it is difficult to see what he really thinks, whether to his career or love; he is loyal to marriage and does not have an erosive private life like Sonny and Fredo. Many people say that Mike's greatest fate tragedy was the death of Apollo, which led him to marry an inappropriate woman, Kay. But maybe that's what Mario Puzzo is trying to tell us, some truth.<br/><br/>Kay and Mike met when they were students, or when he was in the army, it was not important in time, but what was important was that they met Mike in his green and ideal youth. Mike of that period, returned from World War II, the National Medal, handsome and gentle, always humble and courteous to people. He will spend Christmas with Kay after watching the movie and change his face as soon as he finds Kay's wrong face.<br/><br/>Say, ""No, you're Ingrid Bergman. I won't love you more."" If he wanted Kay to take pictures with her family at his sister's wedding, even if she was just a new girlfriend, he would say seriously and tenaciously, ""Kay, this is my family, not me."" I really like him at that time, the kind of fixed eyes for their own future, gentle expression, smiling face. But fate mercilessly went to the assassination, arousing Mike's deep family feelings, and made him go. There's no way back.<br/><br/>He left the United States helplessly and took refuge in his hometown of Sicily. With the godfather's theme song L ove<br/><br/>Theme, Mike walked on the beautiful and primitive Sicilian hillside, when Mike had completed the transformation of his life. He killed his enemy and fled to his hometown. Even though his face was still so handsome, something in his eyes had changed. He no longer has an innocent manner of tenderness. When. When the man who took care of him drove to the hillside to find him and told him not to walk around, he just said calmly, ""I want to see the village of Colion and walk."" There was no hesitation or temptation. By this time he was no longer the pure college student, and had become a young emperor.<br/><br/>In other words, this passage in Sicily is an important transition period in Mike's life. Before he came, he was a pure young man who suddenly killed his enemies and began to transform; and in Sicily, far from the sinful world, his character had begun to change, but he still had good wishes. And with the death of Apollo, at the end of his exile, Mike returned to New York, and the picture of the plot was depressing black. He found Kay and hoped to marry her, but by this time Mike had completely transformed into a new generation of godfather in his heart, and innocence had long been gone.<br/><br/>Maybe that's what we love about Sicily. Because it's too beautiful, as beautiful as Apollo.-it's pure. Mike was completely fascinated by her at first sight. Some people say that this kind of love is not a deep love, but a visual shock, an impulse. But I think she's the kind of woman who fits Mike during the metamorphosis."

","What is it about someone you care about that sets them apart? Are they family, a friend, or someone you feel just needs help? What causes you to go the extra mile to put someone else ahead of yourself? You may find the answers in your religion, your upbringing, or in movies. For example, say your daughter goes out on a date with a guy and she is violently beaten by him and one of his friends. You go see her in the hospital and she cannot even weep because of the pain. So trying to keep your cool you press charges and try by the legal means to bring the young men to justice. It doesn't happen, their sentences are suspended. That may make you lose faith in the system that is supposed to protect you. So now you go to someone else who could help. This person is a bigshot, a pezzonovante in his own way but outside the system. You explain what happened and what you did, and all he says is 'why didn't you come to me first?' How many times in your life have some of us gone to others that don't care and asked for help instead of going to the ones that actually care. And the problem is solved. Imagine for another example that your father is in the hospital and men are coming to kill him. And you are the only one there that can help him. Imagine that you had your own dreams and your own goals that were different to what your father wanted. But in this moment you put all that aside to help your father survive. You assure him that everything will be ok and you are with him now. You bluff out the men trying to kill him and your father is saved. Most of us may never have to defend our dads from someone trying to kill him. But seeing someone laying helpless in a hospital bed in need of help we can all relate to. Every son, every daughter, every parent, every sibling, every friend. You see everybody wants to talk about the gangster mafia element of The Godfather, and say that is what it is all about. But family plays an even bigger role in the story by being the driving force behind the main characters. Family, love, loyalty, sacrifice all these elements are used in the movie to bring a standard boring mafia shootout movie to the level of greatest movie of all time. Francis Ford Coppola used as much he could to bring this point home. The wedding scene was not made up by any means but instead taken from other weddings witnessed by every Italian who has ever been to a wedding. Bringing envelopes filled with money to the bride, nieces dancing on the feet of uncle's, people waiting in line to see the father of the bride, sandwiches in white paper being tossed around. 'two gabagool, one proshootoh!' Then go to the kitchen to make spaghetti. Need a recipe? Try 'a little of oil then fry some garlic, throw in some tomatoes and tomato paste, fry it, make sure it does not stick, get it to boil, put in all your sausage and meatballs, add some wine and a little bit of sugar and that's the trick.' That recipe has been in Italian kitchens long before the cameras rolled. Need an idea for some quality time with the kids, well go to work do what you have to do and pick up some cannolis before you get home. Just remember to leave the gun and take the cannolis. Coppola always said he had to be good or no cannolis when his dad got home to share with the family. Coppola also put in his own family to work, his dad scored the movie, his sister Talia was Connie, and his daughter played the baby in the baptism scene. The family was on both sides of the family. But for me the movie revolves around Don Vito Corleone and Marlon Brando. Mario Puzo based the character of Don Corleone on his mother, everytime the Don opened his mouth all that came out was the passion of his mother, her wisdom, her ruthlessness, and her unconquerable love for her family and for life itself. Therefore only the greatest actor of the day will do to play the part. Coppola agreed and suggested either Brando or Laurence Olivier. Olivier was considered and it would have been interesting but he eventually passed on the role. Only two men wanted Brando, Coppola and Puzo. Brando had a history of being difficult and the studio executives nearly vetoed his casting. Coppola was able to make a deal with in order to cast Brando. Brando had to agree to do the movie for nothing, he had to put up a bond in order to cover cost overruns, and he had to do a screen test. They only got to the screen test because Brando transformed himself from a forty year old man into a sixty year old mafia don before their eyes in a matter of minutes. When the executives saw the footage they said 'no no no, WOW THAT'S INCREDIBLE!' Brando would be The Godfather. But Brando still needed a little extra help. If you watch the movie, everytime Don Corleone is speaking and stops and looks off in the distance he is reading from a card with his lines on it. He still won an oscar though. Two scenes are my favorite in the movie. One is the scene in the restaurant, I feel like I don't need to explain it, because it is the most famous scene. Just know that without that scene the movie would not have existed. When you shoot a movie, the scenes are viewed day by day by the studio decision makers. They were hating what they were seeing, everything shot before the restaurant scene was met with cruel criticism by everyone on the outside not working on the movie. All Coppola could do was show them this scene and the movie was not only saved but validated. There are moments in the movie that other scenes build to, the restaurant was one of those scenes. You know of it's importance because of everything that preceded it. The other scene is the meeting. Don Corleone stands before the other mafia dons and surrenders to them and their wishes. He reasons with them in order to come to a peaceful solution. But there is a catch: if you mess with my other son or if 'he's struck by a bolt of lightning. Then I'm going to blame some of the people in this room and that I do not forgive. So with that aside let me say that I swear, on the souls of my grandchildren, that I will not be the one that breaks the peace that we've made here today.' There is a time for peace and a time for reckoning. This scene is my favorite because you believe him, you go along with his plea for peace. But the other dons do not realize it is not a surrender but a tactical retreat.
So the movie went on to make a lot of money, win a bunch of awards, and won it's way on a bunch of lists that say it's great. I was lucky enough to not know that when I first saw the movie. I saw it for what it was: a father and three sons. One son was intense and savage, another was sweet and innocent, another was conviving and calculating, the father was all those combined. But the father was the steadying force in all their lives. That is why when they all find out he was shot they react in ways we all would react. When you see the father lying in the street his second son is there to help but can't, all he can do is cry and yell 'papa.' The first son nearly strong arms one of his father's closest associates because he wants someone to beat up. The third son panics and tries to do whatever he can to help. That is for the audience, and that that's how everyone relates. Finally, I'll quote Martin Sheen: 'The Godfather is the best filmmaking ever in the history of American cinema. There is nothing that speaks more to who we are, where we came from, what we stand for, and where we're gonna go. That's the work of a true genius.' I agree. It is my favorite, of what I've seen of course.<br/><br/>"".... Don Corleone."""

Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart."

","I did n't understand when I was young, but I was not mature enough at the time. Now it seems that it can indeed be said that it is a man 's Bible.<br/><br/>In the United States in the 1940s, the mafia represented by the godfather Corleone fought openly for the benefit of their families, full of men's scams and conspiracies.<br/><br/>The godfather Corleone is one of the mafia leaders with political resources. Because he refused to expand the drug business with other mafia, he was excluded by other gangs. People in the family were killed one after another. Corleone was almost killed, but he Always keep to the bottom line of non-drug trafficking. After the death of Corleone, his youngest son, Mike, took over his father's class. He was calm, cold, and even cold-blooded, and he was vicious, gradually letting the family grow stronger and become the godfather of the new generation.<br/><br/>In the film, the director showed the image of a man who is a godfather. He has good insight and sensitivity. He is concealed, knows to adapt to the current situation, knows the good and evil, and also has a bottom line to take care of the family. It has excellent educational significance for men in troubled times or in today's peaceful age.<br/><br/>Baunasala 's opening request for help reflects that in the United States in that era, the law and the police did not fully represent justice, and people had to seek the Mafia to provide so-called justice. Even in the face of investigations by federal detectives, the Corleone family did not take them into consideration, because the good relationship between Corleone and politicians made the government not good for them.<br/><br/>Corleone has three sons, a daughter, son-in-law, and an adopted son. The eldest son Sonny is a typical son-in-law, and he doesn't understand politics and power. Because of his unfriendly attitude towards his sister-in-law, Carlo leads to collusion with the killing of outsiders. The second son, Fredo, was cowardly and became a playboy because of his involvement in the family's casino business in Las Vegas, but he was still timid. The daughter-in-law had not been planned into the family business, but Carloine killed Sonny and was also killed by his younger son Mike. Mike is Corleone's favorite son. Through Mike's composure to deal with the murder of his father in the hospital, the courage to enter the Tiger's Cave, and the later performance of taking over the family business, it should be most like Corleone. Corleone should be the earliest to see Mike's potential And he loves him the most, but Corleone did not want Mike to be involved in the family business. Because of the conflict with the drug lord Sorozo's business, there were too many accidents, and Mike had to take over the family business. Adopted son Tom is also a good player in politics, calm and calm in the event, and is loyal to the business of the Corleone family. The arrangement of ""being out"" after Mike took over the family business is estimated to let Carlo show the original shape.<br/><br/>After his gunshot wounds improved, even after his son Sonny was killed, Corleone did not concentrate on revenge and did not have full emotional affection. Instead, in exchange for a solution to the conflict, he promised to escort the drug business. This is really not easy. It is not what ordinary politicians can do.<br/><br/>Mike takes good care of his beloved woman, and although he will also find another couple, he will never get rid of flowers. Sometimes she used good faith lies in exchange for her wife 's trust, so that she would not fall into the fear of gangsters.<br/><br/>Movies and books are called men's bibles, and there are indeed many places that I should study and learn from. However, after all, it is still the Western ""Bible"". Our ancestors also have a lot to teach us, which is more worthy of all of us to understand and learn."

The Godfather is almost a documentary of the Mafia Progress in America (forget Pilgrim's Progress). Most of the scenes are related to some real event. Of course they are all put together into a single story-line for entertainment but it does paint an accurate picture; Vito, the old Don with humane instincts, Michael, the ruthless and efficient successor, the roots in Brooklyn, the rise in NY, the move to Vegas, everything.
Then there are the characters; Brando telling Michael that he has no regrets, except that he couldn't achieve more so Michael could be a ""Governor"" or something, that he had never walked on anybody's string, etc. The very image of the self-made man. Michael, descending from Straight and Gentle to making an offer that Moe Green couldn't refuse. The Family, which is a composite character that pervades everything and justifies everything. And on and on... so many contrasts, so much going on.
This movie could only be made in America. It shows a raw and powerful side. It is Metaphor because it reflects the rest of the country. It is cultural because it educates. And the Finale is Epic."

-The fact that Michael waited until being ""oficially"" a godfather to take care of the 5 Head Families, which happens while he declares that renounces to devil and his sins;
-The final shot in which the door closes, leaving Kay wondering if Michael will ever make Corleon's family business legitimate like he promissed her;"

","The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name. It is the first installment in The Godfather trilogy. The film features an ensemble cast including Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. The story, spanning from 1945 to 1955, chronicles the Corleone family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the transformation of one of his sons, Michael Corleone (Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss."

","If they ask me which films will remain forever excellent, ""The Godfather"" will be one of the first in this category. Filmed after the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo, released in 1969, this film burst into all the lists of the best films and is now considered the best picture of the mafia. Director Francis Ford Coppola got the idea to make a film after reading the book. The film company Paramount Pictures regarded the project as a small gangster drama and did not expect much success. But when Puzo's novel suddenly became a bestseller, the stakes on picture quality rose sharply. And although the studio did not dare to fire Coppola in the middle of filming, fearing for their product, they tried to insert their five cents. In particular, they demanded that Marlon Brando not be involved in the process and that Al Pacino be dismissed.
The plot tells the story of a gangster clan where the old but influential don Vito Corleone runs the show. He has a beloved family, things are going well, everyone respects you - in a word, he rolls around like cheese in olive oil. But suddenly, an attempt is made on Don Corleone, and, as it was unexpected, a couple of days after the deal that would help another criminal clan, but Vito fundamentally refused it. And at a tense moment, Michael decides to solve family affairs and manage his father's empire - Don Vito's beloved son and a man who wanted to abstract as much as possible from the mafia but had to take the reins of government into his own hands.
There is a legend that after the premiere of the film, the director was called by the real gangsters in order to ... scatter in thanks. Coppola showed the world shown in Puzo's novel in as much detail as possible and showed the mafia bosses, ordinary people, with feelings. Speaking about the cast, no other word other than ""Beauty"" does not arise. Rejected the Oscar, Marlon Brando is a very talented actor. He makes him believe that his character has power comparable to the head of state but at the same time an honest, loving, caring family man.
Michael Corleone is a character no less interesting than Don Vito himself. The hero has suffered many trials, as a result of which he changes and makes serious decisions. And behind such a strong character an actor should have stood, no less talented than Brando. 32-year-old Al Pacino is a year younger than the director, rocked Hollywood with his performance. I know that I praise this great actor enough, but it was The Godfather that became the starting point of his fame.
When I hear that the film was shot from a book, I cross my fingers so that the creators do not lose the quality of the picture. But there is nothing to be afraid of since the plot canvas is carefully transferred to the screen. The Godfather is not so much a gangster drama as a story about love, family, power, and betrayal."

Soon enough though, internal trust issues arise in the family as multiple assasination attempts are carried out on a few family members, of which, Michael takes revenge for.<br/><br/>In an attempt to hide Michael from the ensuing drama, he is sent back to Sicily, where he finds new life and tries to start from there. But his short yet dark history follows him and he is left with nothing after going through all the things he has gone through. The innocent, brave war hero Michael is now willing to take on his father's shoes and bring the Corleone family its lost muscle and respect.<br/><br/>In this movie, we see many things that current movie crews can learn from. From using lighting to cover heavy make-up, to an absolute masterful execution of a Juxtaposition right around the end, this movie has it all. All 3 hours of it is a beautiful learning and enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>Also just saying, if you're watching this with kids, there's just a few seconds of upper-body nudity here from Simonetta Stefanelli and that's about it.

","First part
1. Opening music, Italian style, soothing, solemn, with a bit of tragedy. This music is also a musical melody throughout the play. With music, subtitles fade in and out.
2. This opening music laid a solemn and tragedy tone for the whole film.<br/><br/>the second part
1. Bauna Sala's daughter was bullied by her American boyfriend. The law could not give them heavy penalties, so Bauna Sala asked the godfather for help. The godfather refused with respect for himself and friendship, but under the influence, Baunasala yielded and called out the godfather. The godfather agreed.
2. This paragraph is very informative, and Coppola put it at the beginning, which shows its importance. Next, let's analyze the hidden content.
First of all, it presents the ideology of the entire American society represented by the American spirit, economy, freedom, and law. At the same time, it also mentions the family culture that Italian culture attaches importance to. The first line is ""I believe in America."" By Buna Sala. The picture is completely black at this time, suggesting the huge darkness under this line.
Immediately after ""America made my fortune"", this line is a well-known American dream, and strives to succeed.
Next is the American way of raising her daughter, giving her freedom, and also telling her never to be humiliated, of course, the latter is of great importance to Italian culture. The rape of her daughter by an American man reflects the conflict and inequality between Americans and Italian immigrants, and her daughter resisted and suffered violence. The punishment of rapists by US law was suspended for three years and the execution was suspended. The question of law and fairness and justice was thus raised. Is fairness or justice guaranteed by law or by individual violence? The godfather answered, ""Why didn't you come to me first before you call the police?""
The rest is the Godfather's conquest of Buna Sala. It shows the power of the godfather and the value of friendship and respect under the cover of money, which also reflects the ideological confrontation between the United States and Italy. Finally, the arrangement and arrangement of the Godfather on this matter reflected his careful thoughts, and he arranged it to Tom Haggin to explain his status as a military division. Kremensha is also mentioned.
3. Form
A Image Styling Gordon Willis's low-key photography complements content narrative. The appearance of Baunasala, the background is almost completely black, and the characters are fully emphasized, and the low-key photography of the entire room shows that the work performed inside is out of sight. The outdoor light comes in through the blinds, and there are two light sources in the room, showing the texture of the objects in the picture, making the whole picture look like an oil painting. The red roses on the clothes of the godfather were as bright as blood.
B In terms of scene angle, the long zoom lens at the beginning is perfect. The space in which the character is located and the godfather of the close-up scene gradually show up, but it is still the back and adds suspense. The performance of Baunasala was wonderful. The rest are mostly stable fixed lenses. In terms of character transfer, it is mainly the interaction between the godfather and Baunasala. The two were originally in the same sitting position from a distance. Later, he became a stance of Baunasala. Although the godfather was in a low position, he still controlled the position. The later godfather stood up and had more control. Taking a shoulder shot of Buna Sala was also at an angle of depression, which was completely at a disadvantage.
There is a very interesting composition, with the godfather and Baunasala in the foreground, and Santino in the background, showing Santino's learning of the way the godfather deals and his inheritance.
The use of the cat is said to be a temporary intention of the director, but it is here to show the grace and calmness of the godfather. Out of color."

","I had nothing to do on Sundays, and I found the godfather to pass the time.
And then still marveled. If it's true that there's one of the greatest movie openings of all time, this is the one.
Epic films like the godfather, with their huge story structure, their complicated relationships, and their many plot points, all need to be built up in the first act to lay a solid foundation for the rest of the narrative; In this limited time in the pursuit of infinite space, I think, as long as the relevant content can be put in all not bloated, is quite a realm; Can also be in a paragraph, comb the vein clear, simple and complex, only the great master can do.
Why did coppola keep so many relevant details in his hands?
After all, I thought he was telling a story.
To tell a story, to get rid of unnecessary technology, to tell a story in a down-to-earth way,
This kind of unpretentious, should also be one of the temperament that the epic pursues."

But when I saw the movie,I felt that it's a great movie but not the greatest, as we should have some idea of the novel before watching it,so as to know what is happening in the movie ,also we don't know when the time is passing in the movie because they don't show after how many years is a event occuring in the movie (If you are confused of what I am talking about then you should see the movie).
However the performance of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is out standing and the direction of the movie is fabulous. And when you see this crime drama you never feel that the movie is stretched upto 3hrs.
However, it's my opinion about this movie ,according to me ,go for it and I promise you that that you will watch a great holly wood classic that will not disappoint you."
"AndreDaMea","10","0","0","6 March 2020"," Great expectation, greatest Masterpiece
","Where should I start? When I first saw this movie I was already in a mindset that I would enjoy it, because everyone was saying that this movie was great and blala. So I had huge expectations for the quality of the movie. I ignored the fact that I didn't like old movies very much so I bought the Trilogy Collection Box as soon as I had the opportunity. I bought the box and I drove home focused in watch the movie right away. I didn't. I only watch the movie a year or so after I bought it, because I'm an experienced procrastinator, even to the things that I like to do.
A year after I bought it I was seated in my coach in front of the tv thinking what should I do to entertain myself. There was nothing good playing in the cable so I go to my dvd collection hidden inside some furniture that my mums mum (my grandmother) had offered to my mother. And there it was. The Godfather Collection Box. I thought to myself ""ok, there must be time to watch it"" so i took out the dvd and, as I was going to put it in the dvd player I note the fact that I don't own a dvd player. ""What an idiot"" I thought to myself.
After that I realized that my old computer has a dvd player and I proceed to the movie viewing in an old computer with an even older screen. I have to admit that the hardware quality was not good enough for the masterpiece that I was about to see, but it was the only way.
The movie starts and I my mind is blown away by the brilliance of every detail. Marlon Brando, an actor that I never heard about it (sorry, I was an ignorant back then), was simply brilliant in every scene. Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall as well. Dammit! Why didn't I watched this movie early in my life? The movie goes on with that amazing soundtrack and I was even more in love with this masterpiece. I almost cried when Sonny died, and after that when Don Corleone died as well. The horse scene and those that precede it are again, you guess it, brilliant (sorry, my english is not brilliant but who are you to judge it? do you know portugues? Cause I do!).
In the end, I thought to myself ""okay, I reached the peak of quality for the movies that I can watch"". But I didn't, because then I watched the Godfather Part II."

Micheal knows what he wants from the beginning and jumps when he has an opportunity to reach it. Micheals ambition starts to cloud his judgement because he's so young and never had all that power before, it starts to go to his head. Unlike his father who wanted peace asking for a truce with the other mob heads. Each character has a unique personality and the acting for each character is completely different than the next. This is truly one of the greatest stories of all time. You witness a man come back from war than do a deed for his father than go back to Italy only to come back than take over the family. The look of sadness on vitos face when he learns Michael did the deed makes me feel sad even thinking about it.I seriously wonder if their will ever be another movie like this agian."

","Big shout out to Flashback Cinemas for helping me finally, FINALLY, get this off my list of shame.<br/><br/>Of course now I'm left in the precarious position of having seen it and NOT thinking it's the best thing ever. I really wonder how much of that is due to the films own legendary status because it's impossible to go into this for the first time and not know it's supposed to be one of the finest pieces of cinema ever crafted.<br/><br/>I mean don't get me wrong, it's good. The performances are... WHAT HAPPENED TO AL PACINO?! I didn't know he could even do this! I think my first exposure to Pacino was The Devil's Advocate and he's been pretty over the top in most things I've seen but in this he's so quiet and understated but you know there's alot beneath the surface. Brando is great. Would have liked subtitles though for him, honestly.<br/><br/>
I think what I most appreciated though was the way it handles the audience. These days it seems like most movies can't do anything without trying to explain everything. We get inundated with exposition but not here. Things are laid out beautifully so that just by paying attention you pick up on what's going on and who people are.<br/><br/>There are a LOT of people though. With a lot of very Italian names. Had a bit of trouble keeping the rooster straight in my head. Fortunately this is one I'd definitely enjoy revisiting, which I can only imagine to be a deeply rewarding experience because it feels like there are a lot of layers here to explore and new things to hone in on.<br/><br/>It's a great movie. I just don't think any movie could really live up to the massive hype machine of The Godfather. I can only imagine my estimation of it increasing though with future viewing."

Also nice quotes.
Also when don Corleone took the family business he knew everything.
Also liked the fact that when the godfather got shot he got hospitalized but didn't die and in the end when his son was about to take the family business he gave them the advice of a lifetime and told him how would he know the traitor.

","The thing which forced me to watch Godfather was it's rating and honestly speaking it's a good film. In this review I will be speaking about the good and the bad things about the film.
Good things :-
1) Acting - Vito Corleone's acting is a thing of beauty and it is so good that you will never be bored seeing him on screen. Other actors have also done a fabulous work and the acting department is actually very much advanced and strong.
2) Dialogues - Dialogue used are just perfect there's a time when you become a fan of the dialogues and dialogue delivery. And mark my word after the film you will say ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse""
3) Storyline - The best thing about Godfather is his storyline. Even after being an almost 3 hour long film, the film has so many unpredictable twist and turns that keeps you guessing what's next.<br/><br/>Bad things:-
1) Time duration - Film is quite long and even after having so many twist and turns, the films still makes you tired.
2) Storyline - Film has lots of twist and turns but the major drawback is that it has so many twist and turns that at some place you are not able to connect with the movie.
The film is masterpiece and a must watch for film who want to learn the act of acting and dialogue writing. At the end you cannot forget the drawbacks even"

"PWNYCNY","10","0","0","1 October 2019"," Michael as a prince charming?
","In a class I attended in college the instructor, a learned professor of classical literature, provided what was, to me, a novel interpretation of the movie and story The Godfather. He presented the story as a fairy tale. Now, every fairy tale must have its prince charming. In the case of The Godfather the prince charming is Michael Corleone. Michael is a cold-blooded mass murderer, woman abuser and cop killer. He physically beats his second wife who is the mother of his two children, kills his brother, and kills his brother-in-law thus making his sister a widow. Even his first wife, who he loved (proof that he is not completely depraved), dies violently because of her close proximity to him. He is a harbinger of death. So how can such a reprehensible and ugly character be a prince charming? Answer: By cloaking Michael in the trappings of middle class costumes and values. Outwardly, Michael is quiet, soft-spoken, well-mannered, self-controlled, well-dressed, and well-educated. He is, outwardly, a loyal citizen, a decorated war veteran, married, a father, a brother, a property owner, a businessman, and an obedient son. He has all the trappings of respectability. That sets him apart from everyone else in the story who, with one exception, are presented as being no more than a bunch of stupid crass thugs, including his two brothers, Freddie who is dumb and Sonny, who in addition to being dumb is hot-tempered. Compared to them Michael is a paragon of virtue. That makes him seem likeable, someone worthy of empathy. The only exception to the array of unsavory figures that populate this story and interact with Michael is Michael's father, Vito Corleone, the first Godfather, whose real name is Andolini. Vito was born in a part of the world still heavily influenced by feudalistic values in which vendatta and revenge-killings were the norm. If Michael is the prince charming, then Vito is the king. Despite being a premeditated murderer himself, Vito is a ""good-guy"" gangster. He resists pressure from the other gangs to get into the drug trade. A gang war ensues. Vito is shot, almost killing him. That makes Vito seem a martyr who is willing to sacrifice his life in defense of his beliefs and family. He is a king with courage and scruples. But with the king incapacitated, the survival of the family is placed at risk. Oldest son Freddie, being dumb, and second oldest son Sonny, being dead, are in no position to defend the family, leaving only Michael to take up the cause. Michael, who reveres his father, tries to conduct himself like his father, who is Michael's role model, but the norms and values that shaped his father's character are woefully out of place in the modern urban setting and applied by Michael come off as phony and contrived. As a result Michael becomes a twisted and sordid facsimile of his father. Whereas Vito was loved, admired and respected, Michael is despised, loathed and feared. Yet, he does the job of protecting the family, who are the ""good guys"" in this story, and by doing so fulfills his role as the prince charming who rescues his family when everything seemed all but lost. Michael is as phony as his family's last name. His pretensions of middle class respectability are a sham. His propensity for violence is driven by a depravity so deeply rooted in his mind and spirit that it gives cause to question whether he is still capable of showing any compassion. Yet he is the modern-day prince charming who is on a mission to protect what is his, even if it no longer exists except in his mind."

","The Godfather earns its status as a landmark in cinema.

","It took me a long time to see this film and I knew of its reputation long before I did. I'm personally not a fan of films that glorify criminals but this film defied my expectations and it gets better every time I watch it.<br/><br/>I was surprised by how likeable the main characters are and the dignity and integrity of Vito Corleone in particular. There are few films of this length that don't drag but this is one of them. The story and the script are stirringly intelligent and this is combined with clever directing and beautiful cinematography. It was made in the early 1970's yet it beautifully recreates the late 1940's. Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall each put in their definitive career performance in my opinion. Marlon Brando and Al Lettieri steal the show however as masters of understatement. No motion is wasted and yet so much is expressed.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest film ever made and that's from somebody who isn't really a fan of the genre. 10/10"

","In 1945, at his daughter Connie's wedding to Carlo Rizzi, Don Vito Corleone hears requests in his role as head of a New York crime family. His youngest son, Michael, who was a Marine during World War II, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a famous singer and Vito's godson, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to Los Angeles to persuade studio head Jack Woltz to give Johnny the part. Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion.<br/><br/>Shortly before Christmas, drug baron Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo, backed by the Tattaglia crime family, asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines. Suspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. Brasi is garroted during his first meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo. Later Sollozzo has Vito gunned down in the street, then kidnaps Hagen. With Corleone first-born Sonny in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo's deal, then releases him. The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi's bullet-proof vest, indicating that Luca ""sleeps with the fishes."" Vito survives, and at the hospital Michael thwarts another attempt on his father. Michael's jaw is broken by NYPD Captain Marc McCluskey, Sollozzo's unofficial bodyguard. Sonny retaliates with a hit on Bruno Tattaglia. Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey; feigning a desire to settle the dispute, Michael meets them in a Bronx restaurant, where after retrieving a planted handgun, he kills both men.<br/><br/>Despite a clampdown by the authorities, the Five Families erupt in open warfare, and Vito fears for his sons' safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily and Fredo is sheltered by Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks Carlo on the street for abusing Connie, and threatens to kill him if it happens again. When it does, Sonny speeds to their home, but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and riddled with submachine gun fire. While in Sicily, Michael meets and marries Apollonia Vitelli, but a car bomb intended for him takes her life.<br/><br/>Devastated by Sonny's death and realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant Don Emilio Barzini, Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo too weak, Michael takes the family reins. He insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Tom is not a ""wartime consigliere""; Vito agrees Tom should ""have no part in what will happen"" in the coming battles with rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, he is dismayed to see that Fredo has fallen under Greene's sway.<br/><br/>In 1955, Vito suffers a fatal heart attack. At the funeral, Salvatore Tessio, a Corleone capo, asks Michael to meet with Don Barzini, signaling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone assassins murder the other New York dons and Moe Greene. Tessio is executed for his treachery and Michael extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini. A Corleone capo, Peter Clemenza, garrotes Carlo with a wire. Connie accuses Michael of the murder, telling Kay that Michael ordered all the killings. Kay is relieved when Michael finally denies it, but when the capos arrive, they address her husband as Don Corleone and she watches them pay reverence to Michael as the newly installed don as they close the door on her."

"mercurionos","10","0","0","20 September 2019"," What happens if you step into Chaos?
","When you finally decide to watch this movie, since it came out in the 70s, and you were born about twenty years later, you sit down in front of your TV with some degree of expectation. Expectation the movie sees in your eyes, then laughs at you for some minutes. And then a man wakes up with blood all over his pajamas and a horse head in his bed. So you realise that something you were simply fearing is actually true. That is the complex life of the Corleone family.<br/><br/>But please, try ignoring your expectations. Forget about the hype, as many describe this as one of the ""greatest movies of all time"", if not THE one. You won't be disappointed, that is, but there is nothing like a ""greatest"" movie. This is ""only"" a masterpiece in cinematographic production, acting, writing and score, much akin to an opera piece.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" does not care about classical Aristotelian unity, and it can do that thanks to an incredibly coherent screenplay thanks to the combined effort of writer Mario Puzo and director F.F. Coppola. Years pass by, oceans are crossed and decisions are taken without the viewers noticing, as they can't ignore every character's intriguing motivations and cold-hearted yet realistic resolution. This is one of the greatest strenghts of the movie, as its surrealisticly realistic tone constantly entangles your brain in its world: you always know that all you are watching is just fiction, only a story, yet it impossible for the viewer to unsee the cruel nature of a world that did exist. Its a ""historical character saga"" about nonexistent characers.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando's and Al Pacino's performances have no particular traints of features. Because they are flawless. The supporting cast did a great job too, so good in fact that most of the time you can't tell who is the supporting and who's the main cast.<br/><br/>Gordon Willis' fotography is gorgeous from the first moments of the movie. Slowly moving scenes, beautifully lit like Caravaggio's portraits, bring a whole new life to the words ""noir"" and ""chiaroscuro"". We are talking about Italians, after all, and making Marlon Brando mumble some ""italian"" words sure does not mean a lot. Still, it was nice to hear Italian words pronounced correctly almost all the time.<br/><br/>Nino Rota did not write music. The sophisticated sounds you hear while your eyes are accompanied by the splendidly crafted frames are powerful overflows of emotions. Nino Rota was truly a prodigy and a master of his art.<br/><br/>But how are all these different features kept toghether in this masterpiece of a movie? It's a slow and steady descent into darkness, just look at Al Pacino's character, Michele Corleone.
So, what happens if you finally step into chaos?
Well, you won't like it. Your life won't like it. Your loved ones won't like it.
But you won't even notice."

","It often happens that the director, when stating a picture, leaves the original and is engaged in arbitrariness. Francis Ford Coppola director is no less brilliant than the rest of the directors. He squeezed everything that can be learned from the novel Puzo and put it into the film. Doing nothing without adding something new or removing something from the book, Coppola and Puzo created a masterpiece. A masterpiece in everything. Mario Puzo's book became a masterpiece of literature, and Francis Ford Coppola created the film - a masterpiece, a film - a classic that just can not help but like it. Coppola not only superbly put the film, but simply brilliantly picked up the actors. Who knows what was the fate of the film without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Coppola skillfully created the atmosphere of New York at the end of the forties, but also the atmosphere of family life, the life of people from Sicily."
"konstancyempire","10","0","0","18 September 2019"," A true masterpiece
","The Godfather is a true classic. What differs this movie from others is the realism and that's very believable. The movie follows the Corleone family, a good old Italian-American mafia family. The year is 1946 and the drug-market is just opening. When the Corleones refuse to take any part in this business some of the ones counting on this go crazy.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the book by Mario Puzo. It's a well written movie. The story is not a simple one and there are quite a few characters. That might make the story confusing but the characters are great. We have a kind of anti-hero (Michael), the boss (Don Vito), the trigger happy (Sonny), the bystander (Hagen) and more. That gives plenty of opportunities for conflicts between them.<br/><br/>The actors are excellent. They use Italian-Americans and that makes it all more believable. Marlon Brando does a remarkable job and will forever be remembered as Don Corleone. The other actors also deliver a very good performance.<br/><br/>The cinematography is classic. There are nothing really special about it, but it's all over good. The composition is wonderful and the lightning is nice. They've captured the mood very well. It's not happy, it's not dark, it's something in between. There are no shots that stand out in a bad way, so you don't really pay attention to it. You just focus on the story.<br/><br/>The sets, decoration and costumes are incredible. It's very realistic. It's 40's all the way, yet you don't really think about it. You never stop to think that ""this is the 40's"". It all just comes natural. It really helps you get caught up in the movie.<br/><br/>I also like the lack of music. In the action scenes there is no music. This makes it more tense, personal and human.<br/><br/>There are some special effects in this movie. Some blood, fights, shots and explosions, but not that much. It is rather good. I'm glad they didn't make a big deal out of it.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a classic, must-see movie for everyone. It has a special place in movie history. It is almost a legend. If you like movies, this is not a movie to miss. It's a little long, but don't let that scare you. My tip is to watch this movie when you're up to it. If you watch at the wrong time it will destroy your impression of it, but when you get the chance, watch it!"

","This, probable the best known of all Mafia movies, opens on post war New York and is centred on the Corleone crime family. In particular it tells of Don Vito Corleone, its aging patriarch, and his son Michael, who he hope will succeed outside the business. It is a time of change for organised crime; there are those who believe the future lies in the supply of illegal narcotics something Don Vito believes will lead to their destruction as the authorities won't turn a blind eye like they do to illicit gambling. It isn't long before an attempt is made on his life. After that Michael is pulled into the business as he seeks revenge. Soon a mob war is triggered and nobody is truly safe.<br/><br/>To call a film 'sprawling' might not be considered a compliment but here it is meant as one; for almost three hours we are shown ten years in the lives of one family. Highs and lows. It is a story that will see Michael transform from the man he wants to be to the man circumstances force him to be. It isn't a story that glorifies the mafia; it shows that these 'men of honour' have little... the day you are told your safety is assured is the day you are killed. The cast is great with Marlon Brando impressing in his oft imitated performance as Don Vito and Al Pacino doing a really fine job as Michael, a character who changes believably as events affect him. The rest of the cast, which includes James Caan, Robert Duvall. Sterling Hayden and Diane Keaton are also great. Director Francis Ford Coppola does a great job bringing the story to the screen, helped by a fine soundtrack from Nino Rota. Overall I'd say this is a must see for all fill fans."

","A unparalleled statement in cinema on almost all fronts.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" (1972) is directed by Francis Ford Coppola, and co-written with and based on the novel by Mario Puzo. It tells the tale of The Godfather, alias Don Corleone, and originally born Vito Andolini, he is the leader of the Corleone mafia family. As an ageing patriarch, Don Corleone wants his youngest son Michael to take over the family affairs, but he seems uninterested. From then on, the film centres on the increasing tensions between the Corleone and its rival mafia families in the search for power, integrity and honour.<br/><br/>I first saw ""The Godfather"" when I was around 14 or 15 years old, and that was truly when I fell in love with films. As a young boy, I could not attribute it to anything specific, but as I grew older, I realised that its grandeur was to be attributed to the numerous levels that Francis Ford Coppola excels at making the perfect film. From the formidable screenplay, to the precise direction, beautiful integration of the awesomely impressive cast (will there ever again be so much acting talent in one film), the perfect score by Nino Rota, the masterful cinematography by Gordon Willis, and the flawless editing by William Reynolds and Peter Zinner.<br/><br/>To focus on perhaps the film's most impressive element, Brando. His pure artful talent shines through in an ever-immersive performance, where he inspired all of his juniors, including Al Pacino and Robert Duvall. His performance in ""The Godfather"" perfectly exemplifies, why they and so many others of the greatest actors (Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Gene Hackman, Martin Sheen, the list goes on) hail Marlon Brando as the greatest in the history of the acting craft. He exemplifies how he was capable at portraying all human emotions with such depth and range, and he contributes to making this perfect film shining even more.<br/><br/>The very definition of a seminal work and a masterpiece in cinema!"
"aram81","10","0","0","4 September 2019"," Legendary
","It has endlessly quotable dialogue and an iconic performance by Marlon Brando, as Don Vito Corleone. It also has one of the most memorable scores in motion picture history and some of the best acting you are ever going to see anywhere. In short, the Godfather is one of cinemas all-time great achievements. Francis Ford Coppola's gangster saga is as close to perfect as a film can get. There is not a false note to be found in this epic and gripping story of family, loyalty and the corrupting nature of power. They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and few films in history have been as imitated as the Godfather. A seminal work of American cinema."

","Perfection (noun) - the condition, state, or quality of being free or as free as possible from all flaws or defects.<br/><br/>Perfection is the most accurate way to describe The Godfather. It is without flaws. It is without defects. It is simply perfect. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name, this film follows Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Don of an Italian mob family. Vito has four children , Sonny, Fredo, Michael, and Connie (not including Tom, portrayed by Robert Duvall.) Despite being nominated for Best Supporting Actor, Al Pacino, who plays Michael Corleone, is in my opinion the film's true main character (as well as my favorite movie character of all-time.) While every scene is vital in the grand scope of things, you won't find yourself bored or trying too hard to pay attention. The film is essentially three hours long, but it moves at a perfect pace allowing the audience to intake every detail. The Godfather makes you morally question yourself because while the film's characters would almost entirely be considered terrible people in real life, you can't help but empathize and sympathize with them. Each primary actor delivers career-defining performances. This includes, Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, and Robert DuVall. Once again, this film is the pinnacle of cinematic perfection and deserves to always be regarded as the greatest film of all-time."

","I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him."
"bensagalmorris-65193","10","0","0","10 August 2019"," The arguable pinnacle of American filmmaking
","The Godfather is a cultural landmark. More than being just a film, it manages to tell a story of an American family in the post-war era. This family just happens to be different from most. What makes the film such a monumental triumph is how it manages to be a massive popular success while also being an undeniable artistic triumph. The cast is one of the greatest in the history of the medium. Brando delivers a performance of quiet enormity. His sidelong glances and hand gestures do just as much talking as his dialogue. Pacino is so perfectly cast as Michael Corleone that one is amazed to find out how many doubted him for the role. James Caan has never been better as Sonny Corleone. Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton are also perfect in their roles as well. Coppola's direction is magistral. The wedding sequence combined with Vito answering favors in his office is a brilliant piece of work. All of the principal characters are introduced, and exposition is delivered in such a subtle fashion that you might not realize it's happening. We instantly find out all of the necessary character information of these people and it's done in a way that makes it all seem effortless. The film's major sequences are so well done, they are seared into our collective consciousness. The restaurant hit by Michael, the horse's head in the bed, the Sicily sequence, the assassination of Sonny, and the Baptism massacre are all handled in a way that makes them feel like an odd mix of dark slices of Norman Rockwell nostalgia and Catholic mythology. The pioneering cinematography by Gordon Willis turned every form of lighting into a thematic weapon. The darks are so dark, and the rest of the color pallet has a glow that, again, seems to make the film look like Norman Rockwell, or old photographs, adding to the nostalgia. The music is some of the finest ever composed for a motion picture, and I get goosebumps whenever I hear it. The editing is a marvel, look at the previously mentioned Baptism massacre for some of the best in history. In short, The Godfather is a masterpiece on every level and this is only the surface, one can dig much deeper into the film, and you'll find a story of America itself. But, that is beyond the scope of this review. I'll just say, if you somehow haven't seen this artistic milestone, get on it, and witness the start of the greatest saga (at least for the first 2 films) in American cinematic history."

","Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If a film is about Jewish mobsters, it's a ""Jewish Godfather""; if it's about the Chinese underworld, it's an ""Oriental Godfather""; if it takes place in contemporary times, it's a ""modern day Godfather.""<br/><br/>If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.<br/><br/>Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it.<br/><br/>The film opens in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court. It is the wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request on that day. So the supplicants come, each wanting something different - revenge, a husband for their daughter, a part in a movie.<br/><br/>The family has gathered for the event. Michael (Al Pacino), Don Vito's youngest son and a second world war hero, is back home in the company of a new girlfriend (Diane Keaton). The two older boys, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there as well, along with their ""adopted"" brother, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the don's right-hand man.<br/><br/>With the end of the war, the times are changing, and as much as Don Vito seems in control at the wedding, his power is beginning to erode. By the standards of some, his views on the importance of family, loyalty, and respect are antiquated. Even his heir apparent, Sonny, disagrees with his refusal to get into the drug business. Gambling and alcohol are forces of the past and present; narcotics are the future. But Don Vito will not compromise, even when a powerful drug supplier named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) arrives with promises of high profits for those who back him.<br/><br/>Don Vito's refusal to do business with Sollozzo strikes the first sparks of a war that will last for years and cost many lives. Each of the five major mob families in New York will be gouged by the bloodshed, and a new order will emerge. Betrayals will take place, and the Corleone family will be shaken to its roots by treachery from both within and without.<br/><br/>The Corleone with the most screen time is Michael (it's therefore odd that Al Pacino received a Best Supporting Actor nomination), and his tale, because of its scope and breadth, is marginally dominant. His transformation from ""innocent"" bystander to central manipulator is the stuff of a Shakespearean tragedy. By the end, this man who claimed to be different from the rest of his family has become more ruthless than Don Vito ever was.<br/><br/>Despite the likes of Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Scarface, ...And Justice for All, and Scent of a Woman on his resume, Pacino is best remembered for the role he created in The Godfather (and subsequently reprised in two sequels). While this is not his most demonstrative performance - indeed, he is exceptionally restrained - the quality of the script makes Michael Corleone notable.<br/><br/>Next to Humphrey Bogart's Rick from Casablanca, Oscar winner Marlon Brando's Don Vito may be the most imitated character in screen history. The line ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" has attained legendary status, as has the entire performance. With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando has created a personae that will be recalled for as long as motion pictures exist.<br/><br/>Don Vito is a most complicated gangster. In his own words, he is not a killer, and he never mixes business with personal matters. He puts family first (""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man"") and despises displays of weakness. He understands the burden of power, and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the ""throne"", is one of The Godfather's most revealing moments (about both father and son).<br/><br/>The Godfather had three Best Supporting Actor nominees, all well-deserved. The first was Pacino (who probably should have been nominated alongside Brando in the Best Actor category). The other two were James Caan and Robert Duvall. In a way, it's surprising that Duvall wasn't passed over. His presence in The Godfather isn't flashy or attention-arresting. Like his character of Tom Hagen, he is steady, reliable, and stays in the background. Not so for Caan's Sonny, whose demonstrative and volatile personality can't be overlooked.<br/><br/>Family responsibility. A father's legacy. The need to earn respect. The corrupting influence of power. These are some of the ingredients combined in Francis Ford Coppola's cinematic blender. They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries.<br/><br/>Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families. The word ""Mafia"" conjures up images of the sinister and mysterious - scenes of the sort where Luca Brasi meets his fate. Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience.<br/><br/>We come to The Godfather like Kay Adams - outsiders uncertain in our expectations - but it doesn't take long for us to be captivated by this intricate, violent world. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told. Yet that last haunting image (Kay's shock of recognition), coupled with Nino Rota's mournful score, leaves a crater-like impression that The Godfather Part II only deepens."

","""Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.<br/><br/>The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.<br/><br/>Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.<br/><br/>But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.<br/><br/>To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.<br/><br/>But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.<br/><br/>Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).<br/><br/>Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film. "" I completely agree"

","This movie change my life.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility."

If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.<br/><br/>A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.<br/><br/>I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.<br/><br/>I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.<br/><br/>Watch them!

The words become like a wet blanket in the face of these great images. I always felt what a romantic life of the man is every time I touch in such great masculinity.<br/><br/>Although the Corleone family is a criminal organization, they have their own rules and behave themselves coherently. This is the reason I feel they are awesome.
They act cool-headed, but I feel the charity and the warmth of humanity at the same time. The man with the coherence is absolutely cool.<br/><br/>The god father's back told us their philosophy and the manly sentiments were. Michael was gradually piling himself on his father's back.
The dignity of mafia should reflect to 'the brand image.'<br/><br/>I got a goosebumps with the change in Michael's appearance he got more and more distinctive as Don Corleone.

","This movie is very good, I like it very much. I watch it when I was small and didnt understand, I think is like soap opera. But I watch it again, recently, and now I understand and like it very much.<br/><br/>This movie is about how you can murder people and not get in trouble with police if you have a lot of power. If you have a strong family, you can murder other people, but problem is if the people you murder also have strong family. So if you are powerful, you dont have to worry about police, you have to worry about other people who also have power. I think this is very original and unique idea which you do not see in many movies. I think this is another movie about america.<br/><br/>In this movie is one man who is young in beginning, going to weddings and parties. He is nice guy and maybe he wants normal stuffs. But then he goes to italy and people start murdering people more and more. And by middle of movie, he learns that you can murder people, and maybe he wants to also, so he murders a guy when they are eating pasta, and he never stops. After that he gets other people to murder for him. He goes to lost vegas and murders a guy there too because the guy doesnt have any parties like they wanted. Everybody like him more and more, or maybe they are scared of him, because he murders and so they start to kiss his hands at the end.<br/><br/>It is interesting movie, I did not think about it before, but it is interesting how he only have to worry about other people with power who want to murder him, but he is not worried about if he will get in trouble for it."

","<ul><li>Where are all the men? - They are dead. Vendetta...</li></ul><br/><br/>In the film, two weddings, one baptism and one funeral. In between these events, someone is usually blown up, shot, cut, strangled or just beaten. Typical family life, is not it? ..<br/><br/>Many reviewers assure that the ""Godfather"" is focused not on mafia fights, but on relationships within the family. I dare not agree with this point of view.<br/><br/>The motive of the family, I do not argue, is strong. But still it is a film about the mafia, about the bandits. If you replace relatives with companions-friends, not so much will change in the plot, as it seems at first glance.<br/><br/>The creators of ""The Godfather"" idealize the image of the criminal. Men in black tuxedos in posh black cars ... But are they men? People who lie, who do not keep their word, who smile in the face, holding a knife behind their back ...<br/><br/>The film shows that any problem is solved in at least two ways. You can try to talk to your opponent. And you can just put him on the bed ...<br/><br/>For all that, I liked The Godfather. The action takes place measuredly, but not boring. Acting, as far as I can tell, is at a high level. And, of course, the music is just amazing."

","The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake."

","The Godfather is an almost perfect film. Almost all aspects are done perfectly. A neat plot and a good storyline. Use of property with totality. In the ranks of acting, all actors are able to play such extraordinary roles. Both Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall managed to play their roles very well. Al Pacino, for example, who succeeded in turning into a cold-blooded mafia leader, or Marlon Brando, a charismatic figure and very family-like who succeeded in playing the leader of the mafia network, who was wise in making decisions, is also the main attraction of this film. But what was more surprising from Marlon Brando was his expression, I don't know how he formed an iconic facial expression.<br/><br/>But in my opinion, there is something missing from this film. As others say, this film is sometimes boring. The time used for one scene is too long. The most important thing, at least for me, is the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the policeman. Apart from getting married there, it doesn't really show that he does many things, nor does he contribute much to the story. But overall, this film deserves to be one of the best films in the world."

","Here it is, the big boss man Vito is sitting in his gold chair, petting his cat, showing power. The poor man is begging for money from Vito but Vito just taunts him. This is one of the first scenes and probably one of the greatest scene in the movie because it shows how dramatic the movie is by the Vito showing power and wealth by petting a cat and sitting in a gold chair.<br/><br/>
As I was watching this scene I thought I might give my opinion and review on the movie The Godfather. I think that The Godfather is a great movie for the time period it was made in. When it was made there wasn't a lot of technology they could use. But the movie is ultimately dramatic in a good way and it really expresses the characters feelings and emotions. Even though it is fictionalized The Godfather does add historic information to build off their plot which I love that the director did that. They also used one of the most amazing soundtracks I have heard in a movie. If that's not enough to convince you to watch it then I don't know what will.<br/><br/>The movie is set in the 1950's where mafia superpowers are fighting for more power in New York. But this movie focuses on one specific family, the Corleone family. But when the leader of the family, Vito, gets in trouble with the other families he asks his son, Michael, to join the mafia and Michael reluctantly joins the mafia. But Michael starts getting involved in the violence in the mafia and he tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife but ultimately keeps getting dragged deeper and deeper into the dirty, family business.<br/><br/>One reason you should watch this movie is because even though it is old it got multiple awards for best actors and best pictures in 1973. To add on to that it got the BAFTA award for best film music. Now this is important because you can enjoy this movie, even though its old, and you can really experience the dramatic fashion of this movie because of the best actor awards and the best film music contributing to the greatness.<br/><br/>Think about it, Vito's men are getting threatened and Vito is not having any of that. Then all of a sudden one of his men are killed and he says this line ""Revenge is best served cold"". Then out of nowhere two of Vito's men drowns another man that was apart of the gang threatening Vito and his gang. I love this line because it shows how dramatic the movie can be and how it expressive Vito is to go through with the murder.<br/><br/>The movie is really good and I suggest that you give it a watch. It is definitely worth your time and is a 70's classic. And all the achievements and lines from this movie is amazing and will executed. Also this movie also influenced me to really go and try out different things outside my comfort zone. I really hope this review convinced you to give it a watch and this movie shows that joining gangs only leads to violence so don't join a gang."

Also I think that another reason that I like this movie so much is because of my personal preference. I like al Pachino first of all and watch all his films which a great pleasure and also I like the Italian mafia theme very much.<br/><br/>In one word, this is one of the mjust watches!!"

"one-nine-eighty","9","0","0","31 January 2019"," THE family film
","Based on the Mario Puzo book, the Godfather, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, tells the story of Vito Corleone, Don Vito Corleone, or more accurately, the Godfather. His vision is to transfer power of the organisation to an understudy - ideally his son. With any luck, the organisation can transcend the crime background it was born from and become self-sufficient as a legitimate business.<br/><br/>Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a mafia crime organisation in New York; he's both respected and feared. Times though are changing; other crime families want a piece of the action - the only way to do that is to remove Don Corleone. Don Corleone, despite the fear he brings to people, he's shown to be a family man - always looking out for his immediate and extended family. We get to see a fabulous juxtaposition as he's both celebrating the marriage of his only daughter, but in the background he's finalising important family business. After concluding the celebration it's back to normal, Corleone assumes that everything is moving forward with no issues and he'll soon be out of the hot-seat. When he barely just escapes an assassination attempt it's up to his family to look after him, the organisation, the family, and themselves if possible.<br/><br/>The Corleone sons try their best to be there in the hour of need. James Caan plays Sunny, hot headed and determined to make sure the family is respected, even if that means looking for a fight. John Cazale plays middle child Freddo, who enjoys more of a hedonistic lifestyle than he does a life of aggressive crime - more a lover than a fighter it's always assumed that Freddo wouldn't be a success as the family head. Robert Duvall plays Tom Hagan, who, although not family by blood, he's the adopted child who plays a vital role of advisor and lawyer to the family. Then there is Michael, played by Al Pacino, the black sheep of the family - never doing what is expected and living by his own rules. When he was expected to stay at home - he leaves for an education, when a scholarship could be paid for - he's off to fight in WWII, when he's expected to find a nice Italian wife - he brings an American home to visit the parents. It seems he's always doing the opposite of what is expected and he's the son that's always at loggerheads with his dad as attempts to find his own place in the world. With the family in turmoil, young Michael does what nobody expects, and makes a stand. All the time he's adamant that the stand he's making is short term and he has no plans to follow in his father's footsteps.<br/><br/>This is an amazing film - which isn't just my own opinion, heck, just look at film review and polls over the years and this film usually finds its way into top five lists. It's beautifully written by Puzo (I've read all his Godfather books) and the film sticks extremely close to the source material. Coppola does a fantastic job directing it, focussing on even the tiniest details, for example; camera heights to portray perception in scenes, small mannerisms that he's asked actors to show shots that compare and contrast people in the same shot. There are brilliant performances from everybody on and off screen - the score and photography is just as strong as the actor's performances - which is top class.<br/><br/>Although the film is crime and mafia themed, it's just as easy to think of this as a social film, looking at interactions and relationships, character developments and family life. It's a haunting and powerful depiction of a family caught in the middle of conflict and upheaval - it's a film that stayed with me from the first time I watched it and still gives me goose-bumps when I re-watch it 20-30 years later. This absolutely gets a 9 out of 10 from me."

","One of the best Mafia movies ever made; great actors and characters, costly production, awesome plot.<br/><br/>
I agree that Brando's portrait of Don Corleone sometimes appears slightly comical but you also have to see that his character is getting old and weak, hence the raspingly low volume voice and he isn't a purely bad Don and very sincere with his family (especially own blood) members and I think Brando was the right man to portrait these kinds of character traits. Also, every time I saw myself thinking it's comical, I also got bad thoughts like 'You can't think like this of the Don', hence this shows, it is a good performance if he makes me scared as a viewer having these kind of thoughts.<br/><br/>
There are quite a few people in this movie who only get introduced to the audience on the surface, but play a bigger role towards the end but me as a viewer, I don't feel any bonding to them since I only saw them for 5 minutes before. I think they should've gave them more screen time, so the viewer remembers them better.<br/><br/>
Overall, this is a milestone in the history of movie, you have to watch it at one point. Some scenes - You won't forget. 9/10"

","This Movie nice. its open under world man life. ""The Godfather"" is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove.<br/><br/>During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt."

","There have been numerous Crime/Drama films that chronicle the lives of a Mafia family or certain outcast 'wiseguys', but none of them leave an impression as deep as the one left by The Godfather. That is because The GF isn't JUST a crime/drama, it rises above a genre, it's about family. 
The transformation of Michael Corleone is one of the greatest character stories in cinema history, from the reluctant family outsider to the ruthless mafia boss, about how the least involved son is forced to take over his fathers' empire. 
The intricacies in the storytelling, the twists in the plot get you every time. It makes these thugs seem not like dim-witted robbers, but suit-clad businessmen. This movie has managed to start up a legacy, a cult. The sheer power of it leaves one speechless and spellbound and perhaps that is why it is the greatest that celluloid has to offer."

"arjunflamingfeather","10","0","0","27 July 2018"," Mario puzzo; unread book but seen movie.
","Italian Mafia who kill and go rich; government takes their money. No credits to this cast and crew but at the Awards. The story did not need to ring a bell in memory but movie reviewers like to seat in chairs with no cushions and watch 'The Godfather'. 
Review to the movie is that the further research into films that is done; the analytic is that light their was impressionistic. The shoot in movies are with lights in the backdrop that are with people and barricades; no photography without permission. 
It is not allowed to publish or view these contents that are from backstage and the reasons are unavoidable because the crew spent their work in preserving that truth that should be viewed at cinema halls or in digital video devices. On the television the story of the 'Godfather' is featured with the set of box. Plugging in to the channel proves validly that watching 'The Godfather' starring Marlon Brando as 'Godfather' will not lead to him adopting a child from us. 
Recommending 'The Godfather' to viewers because it is a Marlon Brando film and books have been written on the former and latter."

","""The Godfather"" was a phenomenon for its time and still is over forty years later. The acting, writing, directing; everything is perfection. <br/><br/>This film is about the Corleone crime family and centers around Michael Corleone, son of the head of the family Vito Corleone. Al Pacino's acting is beyond perfect to the point where I can even say it is the best male acting performance. Watching his character going from kind-hearted and generous to a cold pathological liar made me feel everything that the characters felt. The most amazing part is the chilling ending when Michael is confronted by his sister, who claims he killed her husband. After she is taken out of the room, Michael's wife Kay talks to him about this and tearfully asks if he did murder his sister's husband. Michael denies everything, and Kay believes him. When she leaves the room, she spots her husband in a regal position being treated like an emperor by three people who have just entered his office. It is in this moment when Kay realizes that her husband has lied to her, and she is a fool for marrying an evil murderer."

","One of the best movies I've ever seen. It could be argued that Francis Ford Coppola's film of Mario Puzo's bestseller, at once an art movie and a commercial blockbuster, marked the dawn of the age of the mega-movie. Appropriately, the film is about a similar transition in organised crime, as the gentlemanly but sinister world of Don Vito (Brando) is eclipsed by the more brutal and expedient organisation represented by the doomed Sonny (Caan) and the calculating Michael (Pacino).<br/><br/>The old gangster movie is represented by Richard Conte and Sterling Hayden in bit parts, while Brando's cotton-cheeked patriarch represents everything about old Hollywood that Coppola aspired to. The younger generation is represented by the then fresh, exciting talents who remain respected names in their profession (Pacino, Robert Duvall, Caan, Diane Keaton). This is a film that has entered popular culture: even if you've never seen it, you know the lines (""Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes""), and some of the scenes (the horse's head). But there's more to it than moments imprinted on the psyche.<br/><br/>With a period setting evoked by amber-tinted photography and Nino Rota's elegantly decadent score, The Godfather has dated a lot less than most films of the early 70s. It paces itself deliberately, making its moments of action and horror more telling for the leisurely paths it weaves between them. With performances, style and substance to savour, this shows how it is possible to smash box office records without being mindless."

"brandinscottlindsey","9","0","0","18 June 2018"," A Story of Loyalty and Family
","The Godfather explores criminality, the temptations of wealth, loyalty, and what one is willing to do to protect those they love. There is a theme in the story of life and death, a duality of one thing ending and another beginning. While Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, is a successful and capable character within a crime family, he only fills this role to protect those he loves. This film explores the ideas of the complicated villain. Justice, loyalty, and family are of ultimate importance, but there is a criminal twist to these ideals.<br/><br/>The Godfather asks us all: how far will you go to protect your family? And does the ends justify the means? The Corleone's enemies operate the same way as they do, eliminating any notion of good and evil. It's simply ""them vs us"". In such a vile environment, the only virtue one can have is loyalty.<br/><br/>In the opening of the film, Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, is throwing a wedding for his daughter. During this peaceful and happy family event, dozens of loyal followers come to Vito to pay their respects, and in some cases, request unhappy favors. The first guest shown with Vito elaborates an important point of the film: an Italian immigrant has been wronged and refused justice by a corrupt system. Therefore, the father goes down a dark path and comes to the Godfather for justice. This is an example of the ends justifying the means, the duality of using evil for good. In a way, the father received justice for his daughter, but he's also a murderer for taking the law into his own hands and punishing another beyond what the law would have called for. The opening scene also highlights the contrast of having a happy wedding while at the same time, making arrangements to have people murdered. This theme is reflected throughout the film, with a powerful ending."

","We are all humans and most of us have a family and those who don't are likely to create their own kind-of-family environment around them. Family means love, devotion, sacrifice, and many other greatest things. Humans surely can't survive on its own and without even a family has even less chance than to stand out. 
What's a film? For me it's like a book with graphics which makes one person re-live the story with the characters as if he/she was there too. Coming from these two aspects; family & film, I think what movie could be better than a one which shows what family is and makes the one re-live the story of the film. We see a person, a father who would do everything to protect his family. Needless to say, all the actors who played were also the best actors of all time."

What I experienced through this film was how to respect family morals, different contrast to business behavior, and most importantly how to discern who to trust. This film tells a thorough storyline from beginning to end. It's not just a mobster movie, but a family and business movie as well that journey's you through the never ending trials and tribulations that can come with working with a family business.

","This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD."

","The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake."

","When a movie isn't called one of the greatest of all time, then high expectations are bound to come. Sadly, this means some people will be disappointed. I've felt the same way about Dr. Strangelove and Back to the Future. So every movie has naysayers, just how it is. But I am always astoundes when I hear someone does not like The Godfather. 
It really is the closet thing to a perfect film that I have ever seen. From the story, the production, direction, and of course, the acting. Brando puts on his greatest performance. Pachino, Duvall, Keaton and Caan also put on extraordinary performances. The movie is long but never boring. It always manages to keep you interested even in the more slow parts. That is good filmmaking.<br/><br/>The music is haunting and beautiful and fits the film like a glove. The story never glorifies the lifestyle. It takes great care to show the characters best and worst sides of themselves. They are all fully realized and incredibly well developed. It shows the saga of a crime families rise, fall and rise again, in the most epic fashion. <br/><br/>Im still pretty young, in my early 20s, and I'm hoping to be a movie critic someday. I don't think I could have picked a better movie to review. <br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola has made at least three of the greatest movies ever made. This movie, it's sequel, and Apocolypse Now. Some say Seven Samurai, some might say Casablanca, others Citizen Kane, but in my mind, and many others minds, This is the greatest movie ever made."

","The Godfather is one of those movies, that will take a straight up evil and bad man and make him look human.

It is the pinnacle of flawless storytelling.

","Of all time. Of. All. Time. To have an accolade such as that isn't just impressive, it's near impossible (especially by today's standards). The consequences of acquiring such an achievement results in expectations being sky high, not just for first time watches but for multiple viewings as well. For me, it's a first time watch...the ultimate question is: Is this really the greatest film ever made? I cannot answer that, not after one viewing. It's an incredible behemoth at 177 minutes. Now I always say ""honesty is the best policy"", so with that in mind...my one and only criticism, the pace stagnates occasionally. The plot sometimes comes across as monotonous, whether that be due to the film's length or the actual substance. However, before you destroy my opinion and cast me out for lack of credibility, The Godfather is truly a phenomenal film. It's aged incredibly well since 1972 and is one of the few films I've seen where every scene is packed with rich characters, traditionalism and sharp dialogue. It's meticulously crafted. Coppola's direction was, dare I say, perfect. Nothing seemed out of place, although there was one fight scene where the punches were so far away from the actor's...but that's an absurdly minor gripe. Marlon Brando was palpable. He exhumed power, control and vulnerability. A patriarchal figure in a family struggling to stay in authoritative control in a time of corruption, deceit and betrayal. The screenplay beautifully captures the balance of the crime world and a hearty Sicilian family where traditional values are considered in both of these different environments. To most people, family is everything. The film really conveys that in a sensitive yet compelling way. Pacino was fantastic. Rita's score was utterly memorable. Puzo's screenplay was full of life. It's so much to take in one viewing that I'm sure my rating will change in the future. But I cannot deny there were moments when I looked at my watch. Some say the sequel is superior, so I have high hopes."

"uzunmetraj","9","0","0","18 February 2018"," The Godfather (1972)
","The Godfather is a great movie that innovated the crime genre. It has a great story which (for a nearly 3 hour movie) moves quickly. We are brought close to the professional and personal lives of these mafia men, and when we see some of them gunned down, it's relatively hard-hitting. This was an innovation at the time: for a mafia film to bring us emotionally close to the characters. Perhaps the most shocking scene in the film (not to spoil anything) ends with a car riddled in machine gun bullets. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone can be seen as one of the most iconic performances/roles in film history: it is Brando transformed, and he's fun to quote back to. Like any movie that is labeled with such a ""legendary"" status, The Godfather is a tad overrated; but still very good nonetheless thanks to it's great story, performances, and iconic scenes."

Although Marlon Brando exhibited his best father performance, Al Pacino showed a better father performance. The film was a political analysis of that period, when the American filmmaker was very good at describing that period. the first film is perfect as well as it is still so beautiful in the film. but the third movie is a little unsuccessful. everyone is an excellent masterpiece that can be recommended. good looking..."

","In this Godfather's hyper-violent Waltz it is strictly business, kill, or be killed. The Godfather trilogy directed by Francis Ford Coppola is legendary among movie-critics and fans alike, and capturing generation after generation in the sad, and hungry world of mid-twentieth century organized crime. The casting is excellent with Marlon Brando as the legendary Vito Corleone, the namesake of this film: The Don, the Godfather. Following is Al Pacino's breakout role as Michael Corleone, the youngest of the three Corleone brothers. The story focuses primarily around the Corleone family as a whole, though Michael takes a primary seat as main character as the story progresses further. <br/><br/>The family is very close, as shown in the opening scene at Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding with the big Italian family singing Luna Mezz O' Mare laughing, and having a right old time. Contrast that with Michael who is sitting at a table by himself, almost ashamed of the family he belongs to. He even goes as far as to tell his girlfriend that ""It's my family, Kay. It isn't me"" when she asks him about the deal that the Don made that couldn't be refused. On the opposite of the quiet Michael is the hotblooded Sunny (James Caan) Corleone, the oldest of the three, smashing cameras of photographers trying to get a picture, and even so much as spitting on the badge of an FBI agent checking license plate numbers<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola loves to use close-up scenes meant to inspire uneasiness, or dread followed by wide shots of the characters. A half eaten sandwich is of no real concern to most people, and does not deserve a close-up for the sake of a close-up. However, in the context of a half eaten sandwich at a guard post with no sign of the guard, it leaves an air of curiosity. Where did the guard go, why is he gone? Then another notch further, the guard who isn't there is supposed to be defending the Don who was almost gunned down in the streets only a few scenes prior. Now most viewers I would assume have never had armed hit men after them, but the atmosphere that Coppola has painted up to this scene leaves it clear that the men are coming back, and that the only one who can save the Don is the one person who never wanted to get involved in the business, Michael. This is but one example of many in which ordinary things, or the lack there of, create the atmosphere because death lurks around every corner.<br/><br/>Beside the fantastic screen-play, and the shot compositions, when one remarks upon The Godfather, they should also mention the musical accompaniment which helps build the scenes like no other. The whole soundtrack is primarily written by Nino Rota with minimal exceptions. The one which most everyone knows is the main theme of The Godfather, ""The Godfather Waltz"" is a very foreboding and slow tune played out on the trumpet for a few moments before being picked up by a few other stringed instruments. Throughout the scenes, the soundtrack might play a more upbeat and serene piece but as soon as you hear that trumpet, all bets are off. It doesn't matter what happened in the scenes prior, somebody is now dancing to The Godfather's tune.<br/><br/>Over-all, The Godfather is a wonderful film I would recommend for anyone to watch along with the entire trilogy. It's the type of film that will last from generation to generation as a truly marvel of a film. That, I can guarantee."

","There is very few films I will give a 10. This is the film that help redesign a new era of filmmaking. It was so influential and so well made that the film is still just as popular today as it was when it was first released 1972. The only other films from the 1970's that I can think that is still gaining huge amount of fans is ""Grease"" and ""Jaws"". Now I might not give those films a 10 but it does show that films from the 1970's set the mold for films and filmmakers.<br/><br/>Now ""The Godfather"" took us inside a mafia family and made us see that they are a ""Real family"" that does illegal things. <br/><br/>In this film Don Corleon is the head of his family and protects his family and his friends. When another ""Family"" wants him to do another type of business he refuses and his family ends up paying the price. The family dynamics change rapidly and not for better. <br/><br/>One of the 10 movies you need to see."

","The first part of the unassailable trilogy by Francis Ford Coppola , The Godfather set in the early 1940s follows the life of Don Vito Corleone , the aging patriarch of a crime dynasty who transfers the control of his empire to his reluctant son Michael Corleone. Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name by Mario Puzo , The Godfather is one of the only two films based on a Pulitzer prize winning book which went on to win the prestigious Oscar , the other being "" To Kill A Mockingbird"" .
 When narcotics hits the streets of New York and tension between the five families (Strachi, Cuneo, Barzini, Tattaglia, Corleone) heat up , all of the families wind up supporting Virgil Solozzo to avoid a long destructive war. 
 The film has every odd in its favor as Brando pulls off the performance of a lifetime portraying Vito Corleone, Pacino introduces his innate and instinctive whit and, Coppola's meticulous direction which shapes up into a genre defining timeless classic of the west. While Brando and Coppola walk home with an Academy win each, Pacino wins hearts all over.
 Released in 1972 and often crowned as the film of the decade, the film however does not appeal to people of all ages. Despite being a timeless classic, the film may at some points come across as very strong and too violent.
 A deep untwisting plot supported by iconic performances and impeccable direction, the film narrates a story about crime, drama, redemption and an offer you can't refuse. All in all, ' The Godfather' comes out as a benchmark in classic film making and speaks for itself. Even after all the years that have gone by and all the years to come the film continues to elate and appease the viewers, who return the love for the same.

","The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for ""gangster movies"", but its influence goes well beyond that.<br/><br/>Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.<br/><br/>The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every ""organized crime film"" nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination."

"benkitching13","8","0","0","31 January 2018"," Great performances, but often tedious drama.
","7.5 out of 10 for clarification. <br/><br/>The Godfather's opening scene is masterful effort, with the camera slowly edging backwards to expose more of Brando's figure to the audience, accompanied by a severely emotional and haunting monologue. After viewing this scene, I conceived the notion that at least a large amount of the film will follow this trend. It was eventually made clear that I was misled. <br/><br/>It's not that there aren't other instances of great performances, dialogue and plot twists. The issue is simply that a considerable bulk of the picture is borderline tedious drama, and that much of this drama doesn't in fact contribute to character development. For example, Michael's shift of agenda seems to happen remarkably quickly, and without sufficient character development to provide explanation for this."

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>From the opening 6+ minute long tracking shot that starts with a close up and ends over the shoulder of Vito Corleone listening to a man, the films is engrossing and much credit goes to Brando's unforgettable portrayal of Don Vito. His voice, demeanor, style and wiseness set the tone for the hefty film. While the story is highly intricate, of shifting power down the family lineage, it is also an majestic look inside the engine of a mobster family and their world which often flows from New York and Sicily. My reviews are too brief to get into plot details but the acting is top notch with a gluttony of famous actors, the pacing while slow is measured appropriately to let scenes and dialog sink in. The violence is effective and raw as well as memorable yet not over the top. This is an ultimate classic of mobsters playing angles trying to get the upper hand. Who will outsmart who and who will survive within the code of honor?"

","The Godfather, the mafia movie that knocks all others out of the other and known as the best movie of its kind. While I agree that it is extremely well made, written, and produced, there are some points that make me take a step back and need a second look.<br/><br/>The Godfather shows many points of the life of the Corleone family. Starting with the happy time of Connie Corleone's wedding and slowly spiraling into madness, finally ending with the ""crowning"" of a new Don and a new generation. But in-between, the pieces can be hard to fit together.<br/><br/>My biggest thing about it is that instead of feeling like a movie with a giant story, it feels more like multiple short films made to fit together. These short films as I call them have very little, if any, ties to each other. Obviously it is the same characters but these could be a movie all on their own. The stories seem to be: The Wedding, The Narcotics Saga/Vito's Close Call, The Corleone's Go to Sicily, Sonny and Connie's Troubles, The Vegas Move, and The Rise of the New Don.<br/><br/>The only other complaint I have with this movie is the fact that it is hard to narrow in on a specific timeline. It seems to open in the 1920's but between the opening scenes and the end of the movie, the scenes in between have no real sense of when this was happening. For example, time from when Michael has to flee the country to when he marries Apollonia feels like it should be a couple months, at the very least. But according to the shiner we see on Michael's face, it couldn't have been more than a week or two. Quite the reasonable amount of time to fall in love! Another would be the the time skip between when Michael takes over the family business to when Vito Corleone finally passes. <br/><br/>Other than that, I agree that the movie definitely deserves the praise and reputation it has created for itself for almost the past 50 years! The dialogue, the soundtrack, and the cast are nothing short of fantastic."

How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.<br/><br/>I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did.

","Watching The Godfather is an event. Clocking in at five minutes shy of three hours and having some of the most epochal dialogue in the history of film, watching The Godfather is taking part in something that has forever changed the landscape of cinema. Mario Puzo's novel that he himself helped adapt into the 1972 film by Francis Ford Coppola offered a groundbreaking insight into the world of an organized crime dynasty. Highlighting the human beings associated with such death and destruction certainly took audiences by storm in the early 70's, and continues to do so today. Seeing the origin of where a number of cinema's most iconic lines came from is a truly magnificent journey, and one certainly worth the three-hour investment. <br/><br/>Opening with a lavish and joyful wedding scene, a certain ominousness lurks beneath the smiles. The Godfather sets its tone exquisitely in its opening moments with the introduction of ""Don"" Vito Corleone, played excellently by Marlon Brando in arguably his most celebrated role. We learn in just a few minutes from both the body language of those around him and their willingness to please that Don Corleone is an important man with immeasurable influence. His influence is so great that, on this, the day of (his) daughter's wedding, there is a list of those approved to see him. In perhaps one of the most talked about film openings, we see Brando with his oft-imitated manner of speaking and his accidental side-kick of a small cat (a stray that had wondered on the set), delivering a speech that has left an indelible imprint on pop culture since its utterance. <br/><br/>The Godfather came out nearly 20 years before I was even born so I have heard lines from the film repeated for years. Somehow this film has avoided oversaturation and seeing the lines delivered from the characters onscreen was as fresh as hearing them for the first time. I was amazed to learn with this viewing that The Godfather is nearly a three-hour film. It is one of the films I watch with rapt attention every time I see it and is the perfect slow burn, that it has never felt like an overlong film. The coloration achieved is mesmerizing, as I almost feel like I'm watching the intimate home movies of the family onscreen. <br/><br/>A brilliant and elegant score by Nino Rota captivates the audience and informs us of the mood of each scene. In an interesting way, however, it also runs a contrast to the mood onscreen. In a move that has often been imitated, but never to achieve the effect of The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppola juxtaposed many happy and celebratory scenes with sinister ones. The most discussed example of such juxtaposition is the scene in which Michael Corleone, expertly played by Al Pacino, is becoming a Godfather to his sister Connie's (Talia Shire) baby at the same time that he is becoming the Godfather to the Corleone family. The baptism scene taking place in a brilliant church with beautiful stained glass and a menacing echo is shown between hitmen killing associates and members of the rival families. As Michael's Godfather vows are being read, the murders are taking place to bridge the two ways in which Michael is becoming Godfather. The splicing of that scene marked the phenomenal transition of Michael being the family outsider, to the don of the Corleone family. A number of other scenes use juxtaposition in such a powerful way, most notably the scene in which a man is killed with the Statue of Liberty towering in the background, representing the freedom that was sought, but never obtained. Another such commanding display of juxtaposition is the joy of Christmas filling the air when Vito Corleone was stopping for fruit, only to be paraded with bullets in an attempt on his life. Later, the glistening Christmas trees lining the front of the hospital when the second attempt on his life was made. In an astounding feat, Francis Ford Coppola flanked such opposite compositions together many times throughout The Godfather, with the method never coming off as a stale or forced representation designed to manipulate the audience. <br/><br/>In addition to the powerful scenes Francis Ford Coppola engineered using juxtaposition, he made many more standout scenes. Even though I'm vegan, THAT horse head scenes is among my favorite in cinema. That unassuming Nino Rota tone filling our ears as the camera pans the outside of the lavish home and into the bed where the horse head warning now sits is a truly brilliant example of powerful filmmaking. The tollbooth scene is another nod to the directorial aptitude of Francis Ford Coppola. Despite the fact that we have watched Sonny Corleone (James Caan) act with a quick temper and more than willing to kill any obstacle to his goals, we feel remorse for his massacre as we watch him being led to his death. There is such a bond between the Corleone's and the audience that we want to see them prevail over their troubles, despite the fact that they would be more than willing to consider us as acceptable collateral damage if we happened to walk on the wrong side of the street during one of their hits. That level of audience endearment to cold-blooded murderers proves Francis Ford Coppola's mastery at directing complex human relationships. <br/><br/>The Godfather is, for me, the film with the best opening and closing in the history of cinema. Losing none of its steam throughout its 3-hour runtime, the opening, and closing of the film show the lengths Francis Ford Coppola traveled through his incredible telling of Mario Puzo's story. The framing from the wedding to Michael becoming the Godfather of the family is magical. The framing and use of foreground, middleground, and background of that final scene are mesmerizing and perfectly sets the tone for the continuation of Michael's story for the two sequels that follow. Multiple actors play a role in The Godfather that also serves as my personal favorite roles of theirs including James Caan, Abe Vigoda, and Robert Duvall. In a film that is more tense and terrifying than my favorite horror films, The Godfather is a timeless classic that has more than earned its place on the list of best films ever made."

There's no question who the true star of this one is.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie works: from the dimly lit cinematography to the beautifully crafted score.

I was really surprised on how serious this movie was made and the effort it took to make this into a successful masterpiece! Marlon Brando's performance in this movie is EXCELLENT! I was really enjoying every minute of his screen time and because of his Italian accent and also because he was a very interesting and likable character. The amount of drama that occurs in the film between the five families is absolutely heartbreaking and mind-blowing due to FANTASTIC performances brought to the film! I also really enjoyed Al Pacino's character known as Michael Corleone! I felt that he had a lot of charisma in almost every scene he was in and he tries to avoid being an idiot character and ends up being another likable character throughout the film! I think this is DEFINITELY a film that everybody should see at least once because it is definitely worth a watch for anyone who LOVES watching movies from any genre including myself. The Godfather is a film that HIGHLY surprised me and it's a classic and a masterpiece in movie history and it will stay as one of the GREATEST movie of all time and it has to be the greatest movie I have ever seen and i'm gonna give The Godfather a 10/10."

","Perhaps the greatest movie ever made. Growing up i watched this movie more than a hundred times, and still.. never ceases to amaze me.<br/><br/>The honor and morality of ruthless kilers, the cold and in the same time warm atmosphere. The clash between the top actors (Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall) and the newcomers (Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, John Casale, James Caan). This movie is a school in acting and directing, and a pure sample of how a flawless movie should be.<br/><br/>Everything perfect."

Romance, drama, terror, suspense, and even the occasional slight sense of humor. This is a powerful film.<br/><br/>Most people strongly respect the Corleone family. Their values are very simple.

","Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family ""business."" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare. Once Michael has been groomed as the new don, he leads the family to a new era of prosperity, then launches a campaign of murderous revenge against those who once tried to wipe out the Corleones, consolidating his family's power and completing his own moral downfall. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather was followed by a pair of sequels. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi"

"vmoreno2007","10","0","0","28 December 2017"," The Godfather is the ALLTIME BEST MOVIE IN MY LIFETIME!!!!!!!
","Spoilers!!!!The movies are just as rich in dialogue and plot as the books themselves. It is a compelling saga about the rise of the mobster Corleone family. You have to watch it several times before you understand the depth and magnitude of the storytelling. Marlon Brando was hailed for his acting in this film, I thought Al Pacino who plays the conflicted son of the patriarch had far more facets and nuances. I watched Godfather 2 and then 1 back to back so forgive me if the reviews overlap it really is one continuing story. It starts with an Italian marriage of the daughter where Vito grants favors to the Sicilian communities and extracts favors in return, You cannot help but side with his character.He has a sordid seedy side with mobsters, organized crime and racketeering. And yet the audience empathizes with his strong love for his Italian family as well as his ties and loyalty to his even closer knit mobster family. We see the magnitude of the power of the Godfather when Tom Hagen, the adopted son of the Godfather, an Irish Lawyer goes to Hollywood to send a message from the Godfather. He wanted his friend Johnny to have a plum role in an upcoming movie. The director shows off his beautiful mansion and $600,000 show horses. The director quickly becomes enraged at the request seeing that Johnny had stolen a starlet he was involved with and sends Tom on his way (Duvall). The next morning comes one of the most memorable scenes where he wakes up to the graphic bleeding horse head. The scene is powerful. Marlon Brando does some of his best acting in this piece it is best role of his lifetime which ultimately defines his acting for his generation as well as future generations to come. Every gesture is well thought and planned. From the script comes lines that even now are still unforgettable and are still often quoted--""I'll make you an offer you cannot refuse"". The best acting is not when someone shows a full range of emotion it is at its best during quiet solitude, you can see Don Vito pondering and thinking his next step. he is pained when he hears Michael probably his most beloved son had killed the police and was sent away to Sicily, Michael's fate is sealed. He had always wanted him to be of legitimate power being the smartest of all the children. The quiet garden scene is magnificent as you see Marlon Brando conferring with Michael who is now getting entrenched in the family business and how the Godfather says he never wanted this for him. Deep down, Don Vito just wanted to make good for his family. Despite all the crime, he still loved his family and kept them close united in the family business. Vito was a bit of a Robin Hood, expelling bad people to help the good people which is why we emphasized with his character and rooted for him even with the evil entrapping. Even as he plotted revenge on the local Mafia boss in Sicily who gunned down his mother, father and brother we still cheer for him as he exacts his revenge. As his power declines, when Solozzo wanted to do narcotics and exact police coverage from the Godfather, even with promises of more wealth, Vito still had a code of ethics, that was to do no harm to children and not get involved with the sordidness of drugs. we can all relate to that. An attempt on his life is made and as we see the great Don fallen physically and literally from power and health, slowly the rise of the younger Corleones occur replacing the rapidly fading Don Vito Corleone. Another intense scene ensues when one of their hit men Luca Brazi is found dead, a package is delivered to their home with a bullet vest wrapping dead fish--an old Sicilian saying --he is sleeping with the fishes. A scene that has been multiplied and quoted a thousand times over in film and in media. The Godfather's usual body guard calls away sick that fateful day which does not go unnoticed. One day Clemenza, one of the Don's faithful accomplices since the start accompanies the body guard on a trip then tells him to stop while he takes a leak. The bodyguard is then shot. Clemenza nonchalantly tells the gunman ""leave the gun but take the cannolis"", another famous line. Alfredo, the middle son of Vito is incompetent and could not even pull the trigger on the gunmen who shot his father, he is outcast to managing casinos in Nevada being cared for by his younger brother Michael who he slowly resents. HIs is a portrayal of weakness in a family of dominant men. Sonny is the oldest brother who acts before he thinks steps in as the next Don. Micheal hears about his father's shooting as he and Kay (Diane Keaton) walk by a newsstand. He is hailed as a war hero and is the intelligent one who never got caught up in the family business. But with the shooting of his father he is inexorably pulled into the dark side. He visits his father and sees no staff or guards he moves his father to another room. Enzo, one who the Godfather has granted favors to comes to visit. Michael enlists his help to make like they have guns. He shows Enzo how to pretend his coat is loaded with a gun. When Solozzo's hitmen come by Michael makes a motion towards his coat as if he's about to pull out a gun and the mob car quickly scurries away. The cinematography is dramatic and magnificent. This scene was set at night. Michael hiding in the shadows and the shadowy figures of the hitmen are gripping telling the story of revenge, crime and evil. You see Enzo sjaking like aleaf knowing he could have nearly been gunned down. The police come by and the corrupt chief breaks Michael's jaw when he tells Michael to leave. Tom quickly comes by posing with private investigators, but the corrupt cop knows when to high tail it. This is the fateful night that Michael turns, you see a fine display of emotions on his face and he is compelled to do something to save his father which wins over his reticence in getting involved. You can practically see Michael's thoughts it is an all consuming role. Michael cannot deny his loyalty to his father despite his innocence. While Sonny and the main caporegimes are plotting, Michael pipes up he will take out the chief of the police and Solozzo. They are stunned It was unthinkable. They are astounded but impressed by Michael who is well known even among the 5 families of crime to be not involved. This marks his entry into depravity and darkness. They plan to use a respectable restaurant where the gun will be planted in advance in a bathroom, Clemenza reiterates 2 bullet to the head then drop the gun and walk. The plan goes without a hitch. Michael is banished to Sicily for a year where he falls in love with a beautiful but virtuous Italian girl. It is charming to see how women used to be courted before women's liberation and women are still virtuous. He courts her the old fashioned way slowly wins over the father and it is quite beautiful seeing the old world ways where she is chaperoned by 5 older women. You see the charming traditions of a Sicilian wedding set against a picturesque backdrop of old world villages and beautiful hills You feel like you are a part of the wedding party. He teaches her how to drive, but alas, one of his bodyguards plots to plant a bomb and his beautiful young wife gets caught in the crossfire. Michael goes home but does not seek Kay for another year. Kay is hurt but accepts him back and you wonder how a sweet innocent women can blend in with such a family ridden with crime. Connie, the only daughter of the Godfather, is wrapped up in her own drama. Her husband is a violent man.; She is often seen with bruises and black eyes. Sonny's temper is ultimately his downfall. He threatens Connie's husband if he should ever touch his sister again like that he would not see the living daylights. Connie's husband betrays the family and sets Sonny up by provoking a fight with Connie. Knowing Connie will be home he asks a mistress to call causing her to lose her temper followed by a glorious scene of dish smashing. It felt real as if you were in the room with them, what followed next was a very realistic scene of her husband taking his belt off and she runs to the bathroom with cries of terror, it was very uncomfortable to watch but you felt the raw emotion. Sonny hears about it and without an escort runs to Connie's defense and is assassinated in a brutal gun scene on the Long Island causeway, which is one of the most unforgettable scenes of the movie. Here you felt the backlash of crime and what befalls you when you get mixed up with it. Kay asks Michael if he would be the godfather to Connie's child. He consents but in the back of his mind is plotting the revenge of his father and his brother. The last scene is iconic and intense. You have the pure sacred baptism of Connie's sweet little baby with the congregation being asked to renounce sin, Satan contrasting with gory scenes of the 5 family heads gunned down graphically, one is having a massage being gunned down by a hitman through his glasses, another is trapped in a hotel of St. Regis and gunned down through he glass doors, another is gunned down in an elevator by Clemenza, another is gunned down in bed with his mistress all the while you see scene. The vendetta is final and complete. In the end, Michael exacts his cold revenge from Connie's husband who is led away in a car and garroted. In the last scene, he lies to Kay and she watches him being silently hailed while the caporegimes kiss his hand and the door slowly closes, it was an awesome scene. In sum, it's movie of deep family love, traditions and culture, betrayal, passion, greed, revenge, innocence turning into evil and that no matter how powerful you are there is always someone more powerful who will gun you down. Godfather is the best movie I have ever seen in my life, nothing compares."

","But Oldman also sinks deeply and empathically into Churchill's lower ebbs, projecting a sagging, load-bearing frailty and eloquence-sapping indecision we less readily associate with this semi- mythical figure. As foreign secretary Viscount Halifax (Dillane, once more compelling as a grey, rigid man of power) politically manoeuvres against him, we see Churchill flag and flounder. Not only is it impressive evidence of Oldman's dynamism and flexibility as an actor, it's also a timely reminder that world leaders should pause,"

","I read the paperback book, ""The Godfather"", when I just became a teenager. The book and the movie are rare for both being excellent, which is why both received high awards.<br/><br/>I found the book riveting and I couldn't put it down. But being an innocent young teenager I was horrified by the violence that men can do to men. The character of Luca Brazzi was terrifying, even though it was just fiction. Even the actor who played him, a former, 6'6"" wrestler, was perfect for depicting the quiet, smoldering malevolence as a family 'company' man who took care of the family's enemies in frightening, brutal ways. It was no literary surprise when the Brazzi character met his own brutal karma end.<br/><br/>It's easier to gain an assessment of Don Corleone's three sons, Sonny, Fredo, and Michael watching the movie while the book does go into better detail.<br/><br/>In the book/movie, Michael, the reluctant son, proves the most capable in the intelligence, cunning, and amorality of his father as his two older brothers fall by the wayside. Yet the whole tragedy is that Michael wanted to be a good man of ethics and morals and would have been a very decent man in a normal family. Fredo, the middle brother was also born in the wrong family. Portrayed as the weak brother, Fredo's weakness was that he completely unsuited mentally, psychologically, and emotionally for life in a crime family and to do the kinds of evil and violent things that would be expected of him. Both men, Fredo, and Michael, would have flourished in normal, middle-class to upper middle-class families. It was the eldest son, Sonny (Santino) who possessed the strength, charisma, apparent leadership ability but not the deep intelligence, foresight, perception, self-control or wisdom to lead the Corleone family.<br/><br/>For me the tragedy is not so much the violence or the Corleone family but the two younger brothers, Fredo and Michael, both of whom sincerely and strongly desired to be good men. Fredo's inner weakness led him to betrayal and his ultimate end. Michael's love for his father and family led him to sacrifice the life of a good man for that of an evil crime boss who could give the orders to kill enemies without hesitation and emotion and no regrets."

","Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.<br/><br/>The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well- made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint."

","I cannot tell you how damn LONG I've been waiting to finally see this movie! It's taken multiple excuse-less years of avoidance for me to finally muster up the time and energy to consume this delight and, now that I've finally seen it, I'm happy to say that it IS indeed a brilliant, powerful, and borderline perfect masterpiece!<br/><br/>I viewed this film in its restored edition on a crisp, beautiful blu-ray disc and, honestly, that's probably the best way to watch this movie. Try and find the most visually pleasing copy of the film you can find and just sit back, relax, and watch! The cinematography is truly gorgeous, and probably some fraction of what makes this film so memorable and beloved to this very day. Every shot is a painting within itself...mundane actions now take on this otherworldly elegance only seen in the finest novels and most stunning works of art. Just staring at this film makes it well worth the three hour length.<br/><br/>The performances are also all spectacular, largely because of how fantastic the cast is. We all know about Marlon Brando's Oscar- winning performance, and how breathtaking that beautiful monologue of his towards the end is, as well as the fine acting efforts done by Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and (in a much smaller role) the great Sterling Hayden, not to mention wonderful supporting performances from Abe Vigoda, John Cazale, Richard S. Castellano, and Talia Shire, among plenty others. <br/><br/>Nearly every scene is engaging and gripping, and the three hours are quite quick and the overall film flows like a steady stream of neverending goodness...there isn't much else to say about this one. While I may not think it is ""the greatest movie of all time"" as some others like to label, it is still a damn good (scratch that, I mean GREAT) one, and must be seen by all!"

The legendary scene with Don Corleone where he is in his office on the day of his daughter's wedding. The lighting and shadows in that is really impressive. Another one of my favorites that show how a movie can take you on a journey. Forget about what's going on for a couple of hours. When Michael was in the bathroom of the restaurant and the train was passing by and you see him searching for his pistol.

","Perhaps the single greatest movie I have ever seen. I was a student back then at Arizona State and I had heard about it from others shortly after it was released. At first after seeing it for the 1st time I thought the Don was wicked....then after seeing it several times he was actually protecting his loved ones even though he was in criminal activities yet many of his moves were handing out needed justice that the courts did not provide his fellow Italians with in NY. I saw the strong family values in him yet it was hard for me to realize his was a dark career. He created his own empire from zero having got off the boat all by himself as a very young boy after watching his family murdered in Italy, but what he saw from that was what raw power could do for a person from what that Italian Don had done to his own family. I think it internally made him gain same type of absolute power yet try to use it with fairness in family and related situations. He was not a wild cut throat Don.....there was honor in his power and we all could see it. Wonderful movie of an immigrant coming to America all alone and with perseverance and actual self preservation rise to power his people and lead them through then American tough times for most.

","A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits.<br/><br/>Of the many themes which The Godfather touches upon, it is that of ""family"" which resonates the most. The film is based upon the novel by Mario Puzo (who co-wrote the screenplay) and many sub-plots were minimized or thrown away by director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola, himself an Italian American and family man. He knew that the only way to make Puzo's sprawling novel work on screen was to focus on the familial relationships within this crime story, whether it be father to son, brother to brother, or husband to wife. In this world blood is not only thicker than water, it is holy.<br/><br/>MMR Top 150 banner Coppola opens the films with an interesting shot of a pitch black screen giving way to a desperate figure, an undertaker pleading to Mafioso patriarch Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) to revenge the savage beating of his daughter. It is the wedding day of the lone Corleone daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request, which Don Vito takes on with reason, while also subtlety enforcing his position as a man to be respected and feared.<br/><br/>Brando's casting was a coup for Coppola, for three reasons. First, it exhibited the brilliance and innovation of Brando's thespian prowess, creating a wholly new mafia figure within a world of stereotype. Second, it re-established Brando's standing as a major player after years of being labeled ""box-office poison"". And third, it points to Brando's influence as ""godfather"" to a generation of actors, many which play his children in this film.<br/><br/>Plot wise, The Godfather begins with the attempted assassination of Don Vito from a rival crime family unhappy with his refusal to enter the narcotics trade. With the Don temporarily out of the picture, it is up to his sons to run the Corleone clan. There is hot tempered Sonny (James Caan), meek mild Fredo (John Cazale), adopted son of Irish ancestry Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and the fiercely independent Michael (Al Pacino).<br/><br/>It would be Michael who comes through as successor, and as a result The Godfather is as much Pacino's film as it is Brando's, introducing himself with a revelation of a performance."
"adam_pittavino","10","0","0","21 October 2017"," The movie that changed everything.
","""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"". Simply stated, but it's a line that echoes far beyond the screen, and deep into film legend. 'The Godfather' is often touted as the greatest film of all time, and it's easy to understand why. Francis Ford Coppola, out of his depth for much of the production, has undoubtedly filmed more than just a movie, but a timeless portrayal into the heart and soul of a powerful mafia crime family. The Corleone family, headed by Don Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando, has risen to the top of the mafia pecking order in New York by not only by associating the family with politicians, but by strong family values kept in check with an iron fist. Just like politic's, a lot happens behind closed doors in the the world of a crime family, but unlike politic's, the consequences are much more severe. Not only did 'The Godfather' revitalize Marlon Brando's slumbering career, it put another's on the map. Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone, the Don's youngest and seemingly innocent son who has shown little desire to follow in his fathers footsteps. Pacino, who's status as one of the great actors has grown profoundly since his starting role, was a mere theater actor from NewYork and relatively unknown in Hollywood circles. But as the story grows and we see the Corleone clan come under threat from rival mafia families, Michael demonstrates through sheer strategy and cunningness the gusto to become the Corleone family top dog. While crime is the focal point of the film, violence is never far behind as we see the kind of ruthfullness required to reign in the criminal underworld. It's the little things that make 'The Godfather' the film it is though. The pasta sauce lesson from a Corleone family henchman, the cat in the study during the daughters wedding, all give the audience foresight into Coppola's grand detail and vision. 'The Godfather' with a scale of rich fullness rarely seen in films as brutal, not only holds the mantle of greatest mob movie of all time, but is also hailed as a turning point in the history of American cinema."

","The Godfather (1972) is a Classic Crime Drama about an organized crime dynasty ran by Don Vito Corleone played by Marlon Bando and his goals to pass down the family business to his reluctant son, Michael played by Al Pacino. This feature has aged so incredibly well that you won't even feel like you are watching a movie from the 70s. The Godfather is a beautiful work of art. The acting in the film, the detailed and complex plot, and the editing are among the highlights of the movie.<br/><br/>The acting is magnificent and will have you quoting the main characters for the rest of the week. The movie begins with Don Vito Corleone in his office during his daughter's wedding. One of the first things that you will notice is that Don Vito has a very strong accent which suggests his character was not born in America. He is a strong man with strengths and weaknesses which he is able to convey from the beginning.<br/><br/>The plot is amazing. Although this film is over 3 hours long, there are no dull or boring parts. The dialogue is short and sweet and to the point. There are definitely some moments that had me screaming at the TV and some other moments that made me very sad. Each character has pros and cons which makes them authentic and works to drive the plot into the direction that it is supposed to go.<br/><br/>The editing is great. You can tell that the editor really enjoyed and believed in the film because of the scenes that he chose and where he placed them. This movie follows a chronological order so that you can easily follow along with the plot and there are not any scenes that I think should not have been included. Unlike some films where something happens in full detail and then they explain it to another party in full detail, this is not an occurrence in this film.<br/><br/>I would recommend anyone who is a fan of crime, dramas, or just classic movies, in general, to give this movie a watch because it was executed to perfection. The movie contains many themes that would not be suitable for children so I would recommend this film for audiences of at least 13, depending on maturity. <br/><br/>I tried to come up with criticism for this film, but it proved to be very hard. Never a dull moment, I enjoyed this feature from start to finish. The Godfather does an excellent job of portraying a powerful mob family with many conflicts that the average person will relate to, and some that no normal person could relate to. Watch as the characters struggle with the choice to act violently in order to protect the ones they love, and the choice to make peace with enemies to reduce the likelihood of a war. The acting, the casting, the screenplay, the dialogue and the editing are all excellent and tie the film together into a work of art, an absolute masterpiece!"

","How is it possible for a gangster film to bring a tear to one's eye?<br/><br/>I've lost count of the number of times I've watched this film, although every time it leaves me overwhelmed. The first thing which makes this film, for me, is the music; its genuine authenticity, being scored by a genuine Italian maestro, is unmistakable which, together with its stunning cinematography, gives the film its true and honest character. Beyond this, the storyline is excellent, although it does help to watch the film more than once given the extensive character list. On top of this, the cast is simply outstanding, each perfectly suited and giving clear distinction and definition to their character and each delivering a performance which they have surely not surpassed in their respective careers. It is easy to single out Pacino, Brando and Caan as the standout performances, each of which are excellent, however the supporting roles are equally impressive and go beyond support, sharing the intricacies of each character, their inter- relationships and their moral struggles in the face of organised crime and family values.<br/><br/>Without wanting to give anything away, the closing scene is, in my opinion, one of the best moments in cinema.<br/><br/>Quite simply, this is not a ""gangster film"". It is a masterpiece which needs no categorisation, it needs just to be enjoyed."

","RELEASED IN 1972 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather"" stars Marlon Brando as the aging don of an Italian mafia dynasty in the 1940s who decides to transfer control of his clandestine empire to his hesitant but formidable son, Michael (Al Pacino); meanwhile a gangster war breaks out between the five Mob families in the New York City area.<br/><br/>MAIN CAST: James Caan plays the tough son, Sonny; Robert Duvall plays the adopted lawyer son, Tom; and John Cazale plays the weakest Corleone son, Fredo, who's basically exiled to Vegas. Diane Keaton & Simonetta Stefanelli play Michael's American and Sicilian babes respectively. Talia Shire appears as the ""hysterical"" sister of the Corleone family, Connie, and Gianni Russo her duplicitous, abusive husband. Al Martino plays Johnny Fontane, the singer of dubious talents inspired by Frank Sinatra.<br/><br/>I'm not big on gangster flicks because it's hard to work up compassion for protagonists who are criminal scum. I usually can't wait for them to be wiped off the face of the earth (or sent to prison for life, sharing a cell with Bubba). But, if you can handle this element, ""The Godfather"" is a great Mobster movie and one of the greatest gangster flicks ever. This is basically a drama with flashes of brutal, shocking hoodlum-oriented violence.<br/><br/>Highlights abound, starting with Brando's great performance, well displayed in the opening scene, and the awesome mid-40s ambiance. The restaurant sequence is suspense at finest. Other great scenes include the Beverly Hills horse bit; a rugged henchman unexpectedly garroted; Michael's rescue of his father at a deserted hospital (which is reminiscent of a similar sequence in 1968's ""Bullitt""); the assassination in the reeds; the brief-but-potent ""love at first sight"" moment in Sicily; Sonny's beating the snot out of a deserving POS; the sudden explosive death of a loved one; the unexpected tollbooth sequence; Vito playing with his grandson in the garden with an orange peel in his mouth; and the baptism sequence juxtaposed with Michael's men carrying out their wicked deeds.<br/><br/>What's the moral of the story? The ending tells all: Choosing a life in league with organized crime will turn you into a hypocritical, lying, murderous fool.<br/><br/>THE FILM RUNS 2 hours & 55 minutes and was shot in the New York City area; Sicily; Las Vegas; and Beverly Hills, California. WRITERS: Coppola & Mario Puzo from Puzo's book.<br/><br/>GRADE: A"

","The Godfather is a very intense viewing experience. I really liked how they used the bottom lighting so he could not really see who was talking at the beginning, it left a sense of suspense about it. The suspense of what could this person's business be what is there business what do they do. Why are they coming to the Godfather for help? The other thing I really like about the film is how before he goes to get the gun from the bathroom to shoot the men in the restaurant. When he gets to the bathroom he takes the gun and has to calm himself down, then he goes to shoot the guys and hears the sound of a train right before he does it. I feel that the intensity of the train noise rising as he is about to shoot them was a brilliant choice of thing to do because it shows how he is thinking about it. I do not like how they used low lighting all the time. I get it is a dark type of movie but it does not need that type of lighting like all the time. They could have used neutral lighting because that is not light but not dark at the same time. I feel like that would have worked better because low lighting ended up making the scene look way darker than it had to be. The Godfather was a very good movie and overall it was a very nice movie with an amazing story-line. The way they portrayed most of it was amazing but when they overused some of the lighting is what made me kinda feel off about how some parts of the movie may not be that great. I did like a lot of the sounds in his head."

","This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from every cast member is standalone, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family and carries the power a mafia head should possess. James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons, with polar ideology but equivalent love for the family. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time you hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get a Metascore of 100 and it is. It was one of the movies which defined the crime genre or to say the gangster genre.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best- selling novel of the same name. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to a ruthless mafia boss."

","Yesterday, was the final day of my examination. A day I had been longing for quite some time. My teacher actually gave us an assignment to write an essay about my future career, but school businesses can wait. I got more important stuff to do. I went to my room, flipped open my laptop, and searched for a good movie in Netflix. Something caught my eye as I skimmed through the movie lists. There it was, Marlon Brando's face as the infamous mafia Don. With a vibrant looking rose just pinned in his suit. The Godfather was offering itself to be watched. An offer I can't refuse.<br/><br/>The Godfather was cited as one of the best movies ever made. And so it was natural for my expectations to rocket to the sky. At that moment, I created a fictive challenge for the film to justify my expectations. I heard Brando's mumbling voice say 'Game on'. So I prepped myself for a 3 hour ride and pressed the play button.<br/><br/>To praise it as a great movie would be an insult. It is a masterpiece, as was acknowledged by many people already. When I hear the word masterpiece, I can't help but envision an image of a grand luxury. The aging quality of antiques, the majestic stroke of paint on a canvas inside a gold patterned frame. The fact is, I saw these opulent features in The Godfather. Every scene shot in the movie feels grand. You feel all the splendor from the Corleone family slowly getting under your skin. The music is also a great help to the aura of the movie. It sets the tone with uneasy calmness that makes you respect the movie with all your heart.<br/><br/>Of course all the beauty of the movie wont be complete with a great story. And The Godfather has a great one. It is about the daunting reign of the Corleone family in New York. They had strive under the leadership of Vito Corleone. However, now his time is coming to an end. His condition is getting worse, while the other families are getting stronger. The inheritance of the throne will soon take place. The throne was left vacant earlier than expected, however. Due to the failed assassination of Vito Corleone that left him in a coma. His son, Sonny, was next to the throne. But he too, was assassinated. This left his youngest son, Michael, a war hero, to step up. Despite his early reluctance, the thirst for revenge got the better of him. And once you stepped into the dark, the darkness will consume you. And thus, Michael decided to become the new Don of the Corleone family.<br/><br/>The credits rolled. I closed my laptop slowly as I let my brain digest one of cinema's finest. I took my notebook out of my bag and placed it in the table across my bed. I pondered as what my future career will be. And I would be lying if I said being a mafia hadn't crossed my mind."

"tyson-hunsaker","10","0","0","17 August 2017"," One of the best and most memorable film experiences.
","The Godfather is without a doubt, one of cinema's most adored pieces of celluloid in history and is loved by universally everyone. Without question, it is indeed fantastic in every sense of the word and with this one, it may be completely justified to believe all the hype. <br/><br/>The story centers on a young Al Pacino as the youngest son of an Italian-American mafia family headed by the great Marlon Brando in arguably his most iconic role. As things take a nasty turn for the family in relation to other competing mafia families, Michael (Al Pacino) gradually plummets his way into the dark and unforgiving world of crime. While the film is an adaptation of the book by the same name written by Mario Puzo, rest assured this picture has a flare entirely of its own. Thanks for Francis Ford Coppola, we're treated to a perfectly crafted story with incredible characters, breathtaking performances, and beautiful story-telling.<br/><br/>First thing to note about the performances: every member of this fully-loaded cast of talent is on top of their game and if you've seen any of these actors at the peak of their powers, prepare to see it all at once. What makes the atmosphere so immersive besides brilliant performing is also an iconic musical score that you'll remember for years. Much like the bleak yet humanizing tone of the film, the score portrays a somber and harrowing theme of crime, revenge, murder, yet contrasted with very human emotions like regret, grief, and genuine sorrow. <br/><br/>The Godfather has also become famous for it's unique cinematography provided by Gordon Willis. Every shot feels like a beautiful and dark painting that speaks volumes to the characters and their tragic journeys to the point of no return. <br/><br/>Cinematically, The Godfather is outstanding and quite frankly, perfect. Any gripes with the film would find some minor plot details that felt irrelevant to the story or any major character arcs. Minor flaws aside, this film is truly one of the greatest movies ever made and personally the most memorable modern tragedy. It's one everyone should see no matter who you are because it's an unforgettable experience."
"TheOneThatYouWanted","10","0","0","12 August 2017"," Somewhere in my top ten
","What can I say? This is easily one of the greatest movies ever made. Not just because the acting and everything is on point, but because Brando pushes it over the edge. There is no argument about it, Marlon Brando is the greatest actor of all time, and not just because of what he does in this film but for nearly every film he has been in. And his later films are all the better because at that point, he more or less mastered his craft. But yeah, The Godfather is an excellent film. The secret behind it, other than Brando's acting is the story. It isn't a crime story but a tale about a family; most people can not wrap their heads around such a concept."

The directing is so spot on in my opinion the second best directed film Coppola strives for such realism you can see it in the scene with the dead horse the actor wasn't aware that there would be a dead head in his bed and the head is real from a real horse so is scream is so authentic. The opening scene and ending scenes has so much detail and symbolism that I can't even go into details. The pacing is f.....g amazing you never get bored even thou it's 3 hours long when ever you are close they hit you with a scene that just blow up and you are fully hooked again. The script is amazing a great story and so many quotable lines the story has so many twist and turn and the characters always feel real the dialogue is spot on delivering so much suspense and information so effectively. The Score it's probably the best score of all times I have never heard a score that fits the movie so perfectly and could also work effectively as normal music it delivers so much suspense and, the best pieces are the godfather waltz (the start) and the baptism these pieces deliver suspense information are are just great I sometimes start hearing these pieces in my head because they are so good. The cinematography is also some of the best of its kind the lighting conveys so much information and every scene is framed perfectly every scene could be a painting.

","The Godfather took the world by a storm upon its release and set the golden standard for crime films to follow, especially those of the gangster subgenre. It also continues to define the careers of many of its actors, including Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. And no wonder, the film is truly wonderful in idea, style and execution. It's also interesting to learn that prior to this film, people didn't really know that much about mafia. Apparently the real mafia even contacted the film makers and politely asked for the actual word mafia not to appear in the film. And it doesn't. Furthermore it's only mentioned once in the sequel.<br/><br/>The Godfather is an extremely well-made film as can be expected from Francis Ford Coppola, but what I think elevated this film into such a cultural keystone is its style. It makes organized crime look glorious, operated by people of honour and respect. Yet it doesn't really shy away from the murkier aspects of the organization. Starting from Brando's Vito Corleone, the don of the family. He's an aged man, ravaged by years, and more than capable of making poor decisions. Yet he has this unbelievable presence. The same can be said about his children, all capable and controlling unbelievable resources, but each plagued by limitations, vice and corruption. Michael (Pacino) seemingly being the best out of them, but even he has his flaws, though we would have to wait until the sequel to explore them more in depth.<br/><br/>The story reflects the same themes as the characters. It introduces an empire and then proceeds to tear it down, showing how fragile it was in the first place. If the fall of one man can take down everything he has ever built, how well had he built that something in the first place. <br/><br/>Special mention should also go to Nino Rota's iconic score. The Godfather theme is one of the most well-known pieces of cinema music in the world, and for a reason. It's subtle, fits the style of the movie perfectly and is instantly recognizable. The music overall is fantastic, but it's that score you'll remember.<br/><br/>The Godfather is often called the greatest movie of all time. I can see why, even though it's not my personal favourite. But it's still a masterpiece, no matter how you look at it."

Particularly when trying to understand how the establishment and the corporations that form operate today, having drawn so many lessons from the modus-operandi of mafias and narco-trafficking cartels around the globe. The CEO's of Barclays and HSBC as the latest incarnations of what Marlon represents in the title role of this film: an all-consuming, naked ambition of power, who are always more than ready and eager to splash vast quantities of other people's blood in the pursuit of profit, while hiding behind minions to do it.<br/><br/>This film continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release. Nino Rota's score, Gordon Willis' chiaroscuros, the sumptuous set design, and Brando's raspy pseudo-whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory.<br/><br/>The film possesses an operatic quality, yet it's more understated than it is flamboyant.

","The Godfather is 170 minutes of excruciating realism in the virtually intoxicating world of Italian Mafia - every detail is picked upon, every emotion is explored with fine resolution - it is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola cleverly insinuates an inherent evil in all his characters, weaving a sense of fear in the audience through every frame as he skilfully employs his overwhelming background score to amplify the significance of every transition. Marlon Brando is impeccable in his intimidating yet layered performance as the Don, but it is truly Al Pacino who heightens the picture as the viewer feasts on his electrifying rise from an innocent, patriotic soldier, to the head of the Corleone family.<br/><br/>There are numerous thrilling set pieces throughout the film that resonate profoundly towards the audience through their eminent grandeur, such as the Baptism killings, the Sollozzo assassination and the brutal murder of Sonny. However, amongst these iconic scenes of visceral brilliance are the character arcs that truly touch the viewer, including Michael's subtle romance when taking refuge in Sicily, as the audience indulges in the glorious beauty of Italian culture, or even the domestic predicaments that Connie has to painfully bear, which the audience takes to heart.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it is the homely, yet threatening physiognomy of The Godfather which makes it the perfect gangster film, one which should never be missed."

Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.<br/><br/>For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.<br/><br/>What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.<br/><br/>What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times.

The Godfather is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathise with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove. During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organised crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt. The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): Don't ever take sides against the family."

","Best film ever, greatest cast, the soundtrack and cinematography.I have seen this movie probably 100 times and each time I capture something new.Marlon Brando is the greatest character and an example of a wise mafia boss.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is a wonderful fit into a coldblooded next in line, showing a great character, amazing charisma, sweet looks and merciless heart.HIs relationship with the brother Freddy after his betrayal is so powerful , specially the words that describe the mafia family values where you never go against your family.<br/><br/>Female character is powerful as well."

","The Godfather set the tone for generations of film after it; through directing, acting, the power of music, and the power of culture. Francis Ford Coppola masterfully creates a small world within America, where the Italian culture permeates and adapts to the world around it. Brought to life by giants like Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall, and juxtapositioned against an alienated Al Pacino, who evolves his character to a point where he finally shoulders and carries the film. The music is so wonderful to the time the film is set in, and is a character in and of itself, marking distinct scenes into immortality. The Godfather is a film built out of perfection, and easily stands the test of time."

","Lets talks about the godfather. Now i know what everyone is thinking, 27 nominations and 23 was won. Very accomplished movie to say the least but that's not what makes it a great movie. What makes it a great movie is that it is timeless! It exceeds every expectation that was brought upon it. Now i know about 90 percent of IMDb users will say "" of course it's a great, what is there not to like about it. Well this movie does have a few flaws, not a lot but a few! But overall a fantastic piece of art. I've always wanted to create a movie that was visual as much as the godfather was or is. It really jumped Hollywood into a new era where mob movies were a thing and you could totally take risk with your story development and other things as well. I think it's fair to say that this movie has probably inspired a lot of directors in the film industry or better known as ""Hollywood"".

","In ""The Godfather,"" we have the New York-New Jersey world, ruled by five ""families,"" one of them headed by Brando. This is a world where emotional ties are strong, loyalties are somewhat more flexible at times, and tempers are short.<br/><br/>In makeup and physical movement instantly evocative of Orson Welles as Charles Foster Kane in ""Citizen Kane,"" Brando does an admirable job as the lord of his domain. He is not on screen for much of the film, though his presence hovers over all of it.<br/><br/>It is Pacino, last seen (by too few) in ""Panic In Needle Park,"" who makes the smash impression here. Initially seen as the son whom Brando wanted to go more or less straight (while son James Caan was to become part of the organization), Pacino matures under the trauma of an assassination attempt on Brando, his own double-murder revenge for that on corrupt cop Sterling Hayden and rival gangster Al Lettieri, the counter-vengeance murder of his Sicilian bride, and a series of other personnel readjustments which at fade out find him king of his own mob.<br/><br/>In a lengthy novel filled with many characters interacting over a period of time, readers may digest the passing parade in convenient sittings. But in a film, the audience is forced to get it all at one time. Thus it is incumbent on filmmakers to isolate, heighten and emphasize for clarity the handful of key characters; some of that has been done here, and some of it hasn't. The biggest achievement here is the establishment of mood and time.<br/><br/>Among the notable performances are Robert Duvall as Hagen, the non- Italian number-two man finally stripped of authority after long years of service; Richard Castellano as a loyal follower; John Marley as a Hollywood film mogul pressured into giving a comeback film role in a war film to Al Martino, an aging teenage idol; Richard Conte as one of Brando's malevolent rivals; Diane Keaton as Pacino's early sweetheart, later second wife; Abe Vigoda as an eventual traitor to Pacino; Talia Shire as Brando's daughter, married to a weak and traitorous husband Gianni Russo; John Cazale, another son who moved to Las Vegas when that area attracted the mob, including Alex Rocco as another recognizable character; Morgana King as Brando's wife; and Lenny Montana as a mobster.<br/><br/>Nino Rota's fine score, plus several familiar pop tunes of the period, further enhance the mood, and all the numerous technical production credits are excellent. So, at the bottom line, the film has a lot of terrific mood, one great performance by Pacino, an excellent character segue by Brando, and a strong supporting cast. That will be enough for some, only half the job for others.<br/><br/>Murf."

","Widely viewed around the world as one of the best American films ever made, the opening movie from the crime saga The Godfather is a milestone of cinema history. The Godfather, together with Star Wars, from 1972 has become one of the most parodied movies ever. Director Francis Ford Coppola paints an amazing portrait of the Corleone clan's rise and near fall from power in the US as well as in Italy. Francis Ford Coppola masterfully manages to balance the story between the Corleone's family life and the vast crime business in which they are engaged.The story views the Mafia from the inside as Francis Ford Coppola saw it, and as Mario Puzo did when he originally wrote the book in which he portrayed the story presented here.

","Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.<br/><br/>The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well- made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint."

","the greatest crime show i have ever seen. The godfather is a tale about revenge, betrayal,love and hustle. On this hand, A powerful and rich family. An Organized crime empire passed down from father to son. On the other hand, Other ruthless powerful rival families. Special thanks to Al-Pacino and Robert De Niro. Some of the greatest Actors of our time.The motion picture (in view of a script labored over for quite a while by Puzo and afterward at last given frame, I think, by executive Francis Ford Coppola) gets a similar vibe. We have a tendency to relate to Don Corleone's family not on the grounds that we burrow group wars, but rather in light of the fact that we have been with them from the earliest starting point, watching them sit tight for the fight to come while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper containers. <br/><br/>""The Godfather"" himself is not even the focal character in the dramatization. That position goes to the most youthful, brightest child, Michael, who comprehends the way of his dad's position while modifying his antiquated ways.

","The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence. <br/><br/>The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.<br/><br/>The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis."

","Plot Summary The godfather film is a crime novel that written by Italian American author called Mario Puzo and directed by Francis Ford Coppola. This Classic film was first published in 1972 based on a fictional story of a mafia family that lived in New York City. The Film showcases a crime novel that consists of the war between the Don Corleone family, the mob and four other mafia families in New York city and Staten island in New York. After Don Vito Corleone being shot by a man who works for drug dealer Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo. The tension rises and Corleone's two sons Michael and Sonny Corleone are left with no choices but run the family business with the assistance of consigliere Tom Hagen and two caproreglieres. The death of their father becomes a major tragedy and loss to their family but Micheal Corleone decides to seek for revenge on his father's death by murdering all of his father's enemies. Theme of the Film ""Its business, not personal has been a slogan in this film. Power, dominance and respect has also been a main theme of achievement in the don Corleone family and the mafia families. This film also shows a range variety of American Italian traditions of the don Corleone family, the rules and rituals that shows a great focus and the ways of living their lives in world of full of crime. Last but not Least, this classic film shows a brilliance in his son on taking responsibilities in order to protect his family after the death of his father. However lately its arguably that he ends up causing conflict between himself and his family. Techniques and styles in the film This film has used different key elements and style to create a masterpiece. The usage of various sound and melodies; the Italian melodic music has been a major use in transition of one scene into another. Also the film has been directed with various camera angles and focus such as using the ironic montage and close up angles of the main characters.<br/><br/>In the first scene in the meeting, the camera tends to slowly focus on the main character Don Corleone and later fades to other characters in the meeting. This allows audience to focus on what's the main character is portraying and saying in that scene. Conclusion I have enjoyed watching this classic film and find this story to be very well articulated. The story was very artistic with great characters that tracks down the roots of mafia crimes and traditions. however, I also find the film to interesting because of the them that has been portrayed and the urge of power, respect and dominance is inevitable in the mafia world."

","The Godfather was one of the great films that I still failed to watch, so lately I took the advantage and gave it a try. There is so much written and said about this movie already that you should probably go far more into the film to really get all the points that make this title as lasting as it has proved to be. But I'll try to sum up what went through my mind as a viewer without further knowledge of the background and making of The Godfather.<br/><br/>First I have to say that I am not at all a huge fan of mafia films. Not that there weren't multiple good ones but the topic in general doesn't really catch me most of the time. What makes this one special is that it achieves to make plausible why people act the way they do. It doesn't glorify the mafia or paint a pittoresque picture of it, rather it shows how tired the business can make people and how even they hope for a better future for their children.<br/><br/>You can really relate to how exhausting it has to be to be in danger all of the time, not knowing whom to trust or what to expect. Even though I'm quite sure not all the mafiosi were perfect gentlemen like described in the movie and cared first and foremost for the safety of children and innocents.<br/><br/>The running time is indeed quite long, but since it could be characterized somehow as kind of a saga, you don't really start to feel bored. To be totally honest, even though some parts could be also told shorter, it didn't bother me at all.<br/><br/>What prevents me from giving it a full 10 stars are mainly two aspects. First the characters, or at least some of them appear a bit stiff. Hoe Michael turns from a ""regular"" member of the family to someone that is left with one facial expression only is somehow not really believable. Which leads secondly to some plot points that I think are a bit under-explained. When Michael's wife gets killed in Italy and he returns just to tell Kay he loves her, that development just seems a bit out of the blue to me.<br/><br/>But never mind, you see how much work and effort was put into this movie and no-one should regret seeing it. I don't think it is a must-see because after all it's message for me is not that powerful but if you are looking for a well made movie then you should definitely lay back and give it a go."

","To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.<br/><br/>Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility."

It succeeds not only in pulling off the use of a classical/formal/mannered film language correctly and remarkably; that language is used to emotionally evoke a grand archetypal American narrative, Operatic and Tragic, built around an immigrant family, and charting its rise, corruption, and fall in ways that comment on a vast array of subjects that relate to the American condition: Marriage, Politics, Poverty, Crime, Innocence Lost, Violence, Loyalty, Betrayal, etc. etc. So: It's a classical tale told nearly perfectly; with rich, soulful acting, magnificent cinematography, and insinuating, meaningful dialogue."

Yet, but what it perfectly does is to combine all the virtues and improvements of cinematography, and raise them to an advanced level. At its time, it seems it's the end of cinema in terms of perfection. Moreover, it paved the way for the emergence of a new breed of actors such as Robert DE Niro, Al Pacino, James Caan, John Cazale, Taila Shire, Diane Keaton. It made Robert Duvall a power player in Hollywood Cinema, and gave a legend, Marlon Brando a chance to make an honorable leave that he unfortunately did fail to use.

","The Godfather is altogether fantastic film. It is, in my personal opinion, flawless in every way. People who have not seen this film, I am warning you, because this review will contain spoilers. First off, let's talk about the acting. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are fantastic. And other actors who are first starting out in this movie, such as Robert Duvall (To Kill a Mockingbird) and James Caan (Elf) are also fantastic. Robert Duvall gives a phenomenal performance as Tom Hagen. He gave a good depth to the film by him trying to convince Michael and The Godfather about all the things that they are doing are bad. And James Caan gives a great performance as Sonny, who likes to get himself in trouble. Then, Marlon Brando plays in his Oscar winning role as Don Vito Corleone or The Godfather. He was amazing as the Don. The way he acted with his voice, and his hand movements, and you could just feel his reign of power over everyone else, but you can sense that his control his failing when the other five families try to kill him in the process. Now, let's talk about Al Pacino as Michael Corleone. I still do not understand why Al Pacino has not won an Oscar for his role as Michael. Especially for his role in The Godfather Part II. Al Pacino blew me away with his performance. What I like the most about his character was it showed his character arc perfectly. It shows how he realizes that the only way that he can protect his father is become part of the family business, and Pacino portrays that aspect of his character so well. For the way the film was done, it was done great. I liked all the hazes of grey and brown everywhere, it gave it an older feel to it, which made it very good. And the score composed by Nino Rota is absolutely great. It fit the feel of the movie great, I hum it all the time, so I give the movie big credit for that. But, probably the biggest thing in this movie that makes it shine, and I would give it the most credit for, is how this film perfectly balances the struggling life of the Corleone family, and the ugly violence of their life in the mafia. It balances it great, I am in awe in how they were able to balance it, because most movies today when they try to do that, they usually tip more towards one subject over the other. But The Godfather keeps those two story lines balanced throughout the entire three hour run time of the movie. And another thing that I have to say, or else I am absolutely insane not to mention this, are the amount of famous quotes in this movie! This movie is filled with lines that you will be saying constantly, like the famous line ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse!"" by Vito Corleone, or ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli."" that other movies copy off of all the time! So, this really is probably the best movie I have ever seen, I have no flaws with this movie, which is why I shall give this movie a 10/10, and I highly suggest you check this movie out, it is an amazing experience!"

","May contain spoilers*<br/><br/>To review what is in my mind the greatest film of all time could involve many superlatives, mind blowing, genius, astonishing. All of which would be true, but its the components that make up those superlatives that I'd like to write about. <br/><br/>I procrastinated watching the Godfather trilogy for about a year. My dad had pushed me to watch the films but for reasons that now seem insignificant I refused. One of the reasons was the length of these films, my OCD wouldn't allow me to only watch the first film, as I had been told by a few people the second film was even better.Another reason was the subject matter, I just didn't think gangster films where my thing, how wrong I was. Several Godfather sessions later and the procrastination of watching them in the first place seems comical.<br/><br/>From the first second to the last, The Godfather had me mesmerised (theres one of those superlatives I spoke about) the film completely took me to another world, a believable one too. I was in awe of the big named actors that I'd seen in more recent films but never actually seen the film that they were all known best for. Al Pacino's break through role, Marlon Brando's peak performance, along with Robert Duvall and James Caan. Two actors who i'd grown up watching in various other films and yet I'd neglected the one they surely must be most proud of.<br/><br/>I grew up seeing cartoons such as the Simpsons reference the Godfather, never knowing what the references where. Famous scenes such as the horses head in the bed and Marlon Brando stroking his cat as he talks of respect. All things I'd seen homaged and yet there I was... a clueless kid.<br/><br/>I've seen many Al Pacino and Marlon Brando films, but to have them in the same film, its an honour to watch. Two of the greatest actors of all time and probably two of my top three (along with Robert De Niro who features in the sequel).<br/><br/>I could go on forever about the stylisation, cinematography and genius direction from Francis Ford Copolla but the simple truth in my eyes. As a matter of fact the truth in most people's eyes, is that this is the greatest film of all time. A perfect 10/10."

","I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film.

","Beautiful movie that will last throughout time.<br/><br/>The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.<br/><br/>The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons."

","I have to admit that although I have not had any information about the subject for many years, I would think that it would be a heavy future, and that I would face the film and such a thing. I do not think that it is such an exaggerated script, the impressive aspect of Filmin is not it. It was all over it. It was a great story that Michael, like Michael, turned himself into a character who could not feel his family's way of life, and that he had become his father over time. Brando's character was a legend in itself. If you're still watching, do not waste any time.I did not see such a heavy character. I regret that I watched too late. The work of the family was very well done. The tones of the auditions were all legendary. It was the most beautiful film I've ever seen in my life."

A good reflection of the violent human nature and the things that we as human beans are able to do to get and protect what we want. for me the most important aspect of the movie is the way it makes the emotions get touch in a very deep way. Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business."

The film has a charm part, which are the details behind the scenes, over all star cast, the author of the script and clear about the director and screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola who is a legend! No doubt the best of the film is the direction, which is an exquisite class! With an absurd Coppola will calm counting frame by frame this story that could have been done in a hurry the basis of chases and shootouts endless. But on the contrary, with few action scenes, the director uses all his talent to focus on very rich scenes with good use of light, sound, photography, performances and spectacular dialogues, all working in harmony and building this history that is intertwined with the dirt permeating the mafia and at the same time love and loyalty that is due to the family."

","The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): ""Don't ever take sides against the family.""<br/><br/>It is significant that the first shot is inside a dark, shuttered room. It is the wedding day of Vito Corleone's daughter, and on such a day a Sicilian must grant any reasonable request. A man has come to ask for punishment for his daughter's rapist. Don Vito asks why he did not come to him immediately.<br/><br/>I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com.

","The Godfather is a 2006 open world action-adventure video game developed by EA Redwood Shores and published by Electronic Arts. Originally released in March 2006 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows, it was later released for the PlayStation Portable as The Godfather: Mob Wars, Xbox 360 as The Godfather: The Game, Wii as The Godfather: Blackhand Edition, and PlayStation 3 as The Godfather: The Don's Edition.<br/><br/>The game is based upon the 1972 film of the same name, and tells the story of an original character, Aldo Trapani, whose rise through the ranks of the Corleone family intersects with the plot of the film on numerous occasions. His actions in the game often take the form of events that happened off screen in the film; for example, he avenges Bonasera's daughter, he drives Vito Corleone to the hospital after he is shot, he plants the gun for Michael Corleone to kill Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey, he places the horse's head in Jack Woltz's bed. Although the game was condemned by Francis Ford Coppola, who claimed Paramount never told him about its development or asked for his input, it does feature voice acting from several stars of the film, including James Caan as Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and Abe Vigoda as Salvatore Tessio. Marlon Brando also recorded dialogue for Vito Corleone, in what would be his final acting job, but his ill health made most of his recordings unusable. Al Pacino, who played Michael Corleone in the film, is absent in both likeness and voice, choosing to lend his image instead to Scarface: The World Is Yours.<br/><br/>The Godfather received mixed to positive reviews across most systems, although the PSP version was generally seen as inferior to the others. The game was a commercial success, selling over two million units. In 2009, a sequel was released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows. Based on the 1974 film, The Godfather Part II, the sequel did not sell as well nor do as well with critics as had the original, and EA scrapped plans for an adaptation of the third film."

","The best drama I've ever seen. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando had amazing performances. This has been the most important role for Al Pacino, and he has achieved the fame with this movie. I like very much the Vito Corleone's voice and role. It's unforgettable. I like the Robert Duvall's role too. The plot is very interesting and thought provoking. It has many elements like drama situations, crimes, and romances too. I also think that this is the best crime movie about Sicilian mafia. When I was watching the film for the first time, I was paying much attention and trying to figure it out. Maybe, you have to watch it two times at least for best understanding.<br/><br/>For me, this is the best Francis Ford Coppola's movie. He has known how to adapt the Mario Puzo's novel to the wide screen. The Godfather II is good as well, so any of them can be your favorite. I highly recommend this movie, and I'm sure you will want to see it many times. It lasts about 3 hours, but you won't feel it. Now, you have to plan to see this movie and enjoy. Then you could watch Godfather II and III if you want more."

","The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.<br/><br/>The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.<br/><br/>Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.<br/><br/>But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whispery, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.<br/><br/>The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although ""The Godfather"" is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races).<br/><br/>The success of ""The Godfather"" as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garroting.<br/><br/>Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so ""The Godfather"" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they'd tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn't have worked. But it's uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish-brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.<br/><br/>Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other."

","The Godfather is written & directed by Francis Ford Coppola and stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall and Richard Conte.<br/><br/>The ageing patriarch of an organised crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son.<br/><br/>Whenever you get into a discussion with someone about filmmaking or ask about their favourite movies of all time, at some point they will mention The Godfather. There's a very simple explanation for this, and it's something to be discovered when experiencing the movie for yourself.<br/><br/>It's very clear how incredibly well written this movie is, from the first scene, to the last. Not only the writing, but the magnetic performances throughout are consistently showcased against a backdrop of New York from 1945-1955. One of the reasons this movie is so beautiful is because of how realistic it is. Although we can't say we've been a part of an empire like featured in the movie, we can all relate to the characters. It's a dark and tragic story.<br/><br/>The acting as aforementioned is phenomenal. Brando is vitally important in his convincing portrayal of Don Vito Corleone. As is Al Pacino as he gradually becomes the front-man during the movie's running-length. Caan has a heart-breaking turn in his character's arc, and he performs wonderfully. The same for Duvall, Conte and everyone else not mentioned. The list is too long to name each individual, but they don't go unnoticed.<br/><br/>Although this is a long movie, there's so much going on and in such intricate detail that the time effortlessly drifts by. Every character has a chance to transform within the time-frame. Don't be put off by the duration. Many filmmakers these days are afraid of making their work too long, but if done correctly, it can be a tremendous piece of art. This movie is a fine example of that fact.<br/><br/>The original score by Nino Rota is one of the most recognised soundtracks of all time, and respectfully so. There are moments where his music is used greatly, and moments where it isn't used at all. While this happens the music is changing also. It's the perfect sound for such a story, and pairs with the picture brilliantly.<br/><br/>Verdict; The Godfather is widely regarded as a masterpiece. One of the greatest movies of our time. I can fully agree with these statements and add that in its many years since release, it hasn't aged a bit. If you haven't yet experienced The Godfather, please do yourself a favour. With so much greatness in front of you, it's an offer you can't refuse.<br/><br/>The Godfather, 10/10."

","It is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews make sure that it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy because I did think that it was a good film but that was really it I wouldn't call it the 'best movie ever' it was worth watching and I do think that everybody should watch it at least once in their lives but that is really it. I did find the film very long-winded and at times boring. I liked the slow progression of the storyline and understand why Francis Ford Coppola did the film in the way he did. It's just that I felt the film was lacking something. It could have done with a bit more excitement or suspense to make the film more gripping. It has good acting, nonetheless, and outstanding directing. But after you've succumb to its somewhat impressive acting and directing, you'll realise it's merely a boring film with slow scenes that are difficult to draw you in. However slow paced it was it did show a good representation of mobs in the time period because it was mostly dialogue instead of the gun heavy gangsters most people will think of when they think about gangsters and the mob it is really about family, loyalty, greed and relationships and this is all shown very well specifically Michael arc where he started of not wanting to be part of the family business but later on takes command and becomes the voice of the family and this shows loyalty to his family and he does have a few problems with relationships when he has to leave one women he loves to go into hiding and then his next love is blown up in their car so he doesn't really have the best relationships and this development of the character is the reason he was my favourite character throughout the film I give praise to Marlon Brando and Al Pacino for their extremely grasping roles there are many fantastic things about the film such as the street fight and the iconic dialogue like ""sleeping with fishes"" and ""it's not personal only business"", but that being said, there are many other things I find boring, slow, and inpatient about it such as the opening scene of the wedding which I thought that it went on for longer that it needed to. However, it is a good film, overall. Just too overrated is all. Considering all this I would rate this a 6 or 7 out of 10."

Pacing of this movie is a bit slow at times but it's needed to build up to something bigger if you know what I mean. And the soundtrack? Beautiful music which fits perfectly for the movie. Nino Rota did a great job. Marlon Brando as godfather was the best casting for the role ever! He just showed how acting should be done. Again one the well made and perfectly crafted movies ever.

Well, Godfather is a film that talks about mafia, drugs, death, violence, illegality, corruption, addiction, etc .. yet he is beautiful, beautiful, it seems ennoble impure acts at the same time cause the same disclaimers, but end you delights and surprises, because it also talks about family, loyalty, friendship and acceptance, watch this movie, even if it is your movie genre, at least try, there's no way you leave the loss with this work as striking the 7 art.<br/><br/>Sorry for my English translator google."

It starts out in a unique fashion, a story giving us an insight into the life of a mafia group and how it became a family business span of over three to four generations. This story is encapsulated with love, politics, religion, betrayal, trust and everything regular thing you can find in life. There has never been a movie like this that catches my attention like this one and there might not be another. I love the entire story and there was never a dull moment.

","""For justice, we must go to Don Corleone.""<br/><br/>Out of the vast amount of movies, more than 50,000 total to date as of this review, only a few films are described by many a noted film critic as a ""perfect movie"". However, one of those movies, to me, deserves the title of being the most perfect movie out of 'em all. That movie is the 1972 crime drama by the name of ""The Godfather"".<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Italian-American author Mario Puzo, this was the movie that revolutionized the art of gangster pictures since its inception. This wasn't like films such as The Roaring Twenties (1939) or The Public Enemy (1931), which were about ordinary mobster life. Instead, we focus on an entire family of the mafia that runs a vast empire in New York City, lead by the aging, yet all powerful Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He's retiring from the business, and has to choose which one of his sons to take his place, either the hair-trigger tempered Sonny (James Caan), adopted son, consigliere, and lawyer Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), or his youngest son and war hero Michael (Al Pacino). However, as this is happening, unexpected things are happening within the Corleone family itself including selling out and betrayal, and an all-out war between all of the five families (Corleone, Barzini, Tattaglia, Stracci, and Cuneo) is brewing that turns the entire city into a blood-drenched war zone where only one can remain supreme.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Francis Ford Coppola, whom prior to this was also responsible for movies like Finian's Rainbow (1968), You're A Big Boy Now (1966) and The Rain People (1969), none of which were very successful box office-wise. The Godfather was the turning point of Coppola's career, not just because most of his future pictures would be smash hits, but would also earn him his first Best Picture win. The film itself is poetic, thanks to the assistance from the book's author Mario Puzo, who also wrote the screenplay for the picture. Coppola illustrates both the positive and negative sides of mafia life, the fall and rise of an underground empire, and the meaning of loyalty all at once. All of the main characters in the film are also relatable and three-dimensional to a tee. You actually feel for them and understand their mindset, making it true to life, to where even actual mobsters commend the film for its realism.<br/><br/>Future gangster pictures like Brian De Palma's Scarface (1983), Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990), and Mike Newell's Donnie Brasco (1997) owe something to this movie, aside from the fact that two of those films also star Pacino, making it about not just about the career of a mobster, but also about the mobster himself and the relationship between his colleagues. In other words, they're in-depth character studies, and that's what makes The Godfather a truly epic and moving film, let alone a film that, as I've mentioned in the beginning, is described as a ""perfect movie"". Even teachers in colleges and universities that teach film studies or any form of filmmaking would refer to showing this film as part of a curriculum. Overall, it's a film that is considered mandatory viewing for every moviegoer, even if you don't like sitting through films that are nearly or over 3 hours. If you haven't seen it, stop what you're doing right now and see it."

","Must watch together with all the 3 parts <br/><br/>The Godfather series is widely regarded as the greatest films in world cinema and is seen as one of the most influential films of all time, especially in the gangster genre. <br/><br/>The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.<br/><br/>The Godfather presents the gangster's perspective of the Mafia as a response to corrupt society. Although the Corleone family is presented as immensely rich and powerful, no scenes depict prostitution, gambling, loan sharking or other forms of racketeering. Some critics argue that the setting of a criminal counterculture allows for unapologetic gender stereotyping, and is an important part of the film's appeal (""You can act like a man!"", Don Vito tells a weepy Johnny Fontane)"

","Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it. Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families."

","I have watched The Godfather so many times I'd be rich for every dollar viewed, that said, I cannot fault this cinematic masterpiece, that perfectly romanticizes organized crime. The characters develop especially Al Pacino's Michael, but all the actors have something to do and say and in a style that has today become synonymous with Coppola. The violence is stylized like a 1950s movie. The dialogue moves every scene forward. It breaks every rule by starting with a wedding and it works. Coppola has great fun with every scene, so evident in his use of family members, notably Talia Shire. Writing this has made me want to watch it again. Perfection!"

","I am not going to tell you why I think this film is great. There are very few films that have been discussed so intently as this one (Citizen Kane and Casablanca are the only two that come to mind that might be more respected) and there is nothing I can say that hasn't been said. Also, I'm not going to try and change your mind, it's probably already set and if you are anything like me, it's not changing anytime soon. Besides, film is art not science and art is about emotion. No movie has meant as much to me as The Godfather, let me tell you why. I think I got hooked on movies because I am an obsessive person. If I read a good book I must read ALL of the authors work--two days into The Road, I had ordered McCarthy's other nine books. Everybody loves movies. I bet one in three adults hasn't touched a book in over a year but most of us make our pilgrimage to the local multiplex at least once every month or two and there are a handful of movies--whether they be Citizen Kane and 400 blows or Die Hard and The Rock--that we'll watch whenever they're on TV. At eleven or twelve, I certainly had my list of favorites but most of them were simply entertaining. I've since learned to appreciate Raiders of the Lost Ark as a piece of film making and ET as a genuinely brilliant work of art (its one of those movies you loved as a kid but love even more as an adult) but the Godfather was really the first movie that blew me a way. I may not have been able to tell you why but even back then i could tell, this was something special, this was a work of art. This film, along with its sequel (I like to think of them as one movie, mainly so I don't have to pick a favorite) Have topped my list of all time favorites for as long as I care to remember. Often I've wondered if its simply because of how strong my initial reaction was after that first viewing but every time I re watch it, from the beginning or starting in the middle, I'm reassured that it truly is the greatest film of all time. 'I believe in America,' still makes the hairs on my neck stand up, right down to the final scene when they close the door. The baptism is one of the greatest scenes in cinema, or is it the one at the toll booth, or at the wedding, or in the restaurant. There are too many. It is a film that doesn't just work at every level, it works perfectly at every level. If you have not seen this film you cannot say you love movies. American cinema may not have began here but every film since has been made in its shadow. It is the greatest film of all time and will never be topped, Period."

","The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father's life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organized crime. Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster saga is the story of a criminal dynasty headed by Marlon Brando in one of his most iconic roles. Coppola's direction is deceptively simple in that he uses no gimmicks or stylistic tricks; he merely allows the story to unfold and lets the superb cast do their thing. Brando's mumbling family and loyalty obsessed don has since become part of popular culture folklore (along with the classic score) and all other accompanying performances are top notch, from James Caan's hot headed Santino to Robert Duval's purely business orientated adviser. But this film is really the story of Michael's transition from honest war hero to shadowy underworld figure, played by Al Pacino in his finest role. The pivotal scene in which his newborn godson is baptized while Michael himself, the newborn ""Godfather"", is baptized in blood is an all time great. This is the birth of the modern gangster film and with the possible exception of Goodfellas, it is still to be surpassed. Source: http://www.huludb.com/movies/19122-the-godfather"

","It is very difficult as a young person to evaluate a movie which is older than I am, but this movie is still very enjoyable despite the poor quality which comes along with 1970s movie making. I expected a lot of this movie because of its reputation, so I was a little bit disappointed but it kept me engaged from start to finish so I was still quite happy after watching it. This movie is so unpredictable it felt like I was behind the plot from the beginning, but I enjoy a movie that makes me think, but that might not satisfy everyone. The development of characters didn't keep the leads separated enough in my mind. In fact, when Sunny and the Don were shot it took me a second before I knew for sure who had been shot. All in all, it is a very good movie that would certainly be improved upon in the modern day, but because of when it was made, it can't be compared to modern films.

"KingCritic","10","0","0","25 February 2016"," So.... Why can't modern films be more like this masterpiece?!
","So if you asked me what was one of the best films of all time, guess what I would say? The Godfather! My experience with the godfather began all the way back when I was a little kid. I would watch scenes of this movie all the way from 9 years ago. The main reason I love this film, is because it managed to get a book with uncountable sub plots, and turn it into a film with only one plot, Michael's. The way the movie follows Michael, and shows his subtle change through ingenious imagery, and slow but interesting dialogue, into by the end of the film, the big man himself.And its not like Michael hogs the movie or anything, he allows space for Sonny and Vito to grow in, and even for minor characters to give outstanding jobs acting. Another thing, the acting. Oh my god, the acting in this film is phenomenally amazing! It shows you that you can get a bit of the character, dig a hole in it, pour a bit of yourself in to it, and you have yourself a great character, with you playing as it. God! What performances. Brando's performance as Vito, is a textbook case of too good an actor-itis. Not only does the film manage to get something classical like dialogue from the book, and add its own unique style of being calm, but yelling through the words you are saying. Also, the dialogue from this movie, is something so ahead of its time, -Sigh-it's so good. There is no real legitimate criticism I can give The Godfather, besides the fact that it took some sub plots and characters I loved from the book, and chopped them out of the film for a faster run time, which is fine, since the movie is like 4 hours long. I can't tell you much more about the film without giving it away, which would be really messed up as it is a must watch film. It's good. It's the pinnacle of cinema. The zenith of movies. Just watch it it's so great."

","The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.<br/><br/>The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.<br/><br/>The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.<br/><br/>The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable."

Ambassador of narrative classicism tinged cinefilia and spiced with personal experiences of its director, fascination with corruption and violence as inherent in the construction of power factors of both a family and a nation, conjunction of talents in adverse conditions with successful results and unexpected, the proof that even in the most unexpected place can wait a stainless classic, the Godfather is all that and the opportunity to see this in a movie theatre is a pending issue that many viewers or not viewers should have fulfilled."

","The Godfather is the best movie ever. No, sorry, is a masterpiece. Great script, great casting, great music, excellent acting and directing. When somebody asks me to explain this movie: ""I... There are no words. Watch it. That's all I can tell you is watch it. Then you will understand why there are no words to how good this is""﻿ One of the best scenes in all of cinema. The Don gives no loyalty to country or political party. He has no faith in the government or the courts of law. He is fiercely and violently loyal to his family and friends. He abides by a code of ethics. In many ways he has effectively declared himself independent of the government. He looks for no handouts from the government, and he assumes full responsibility for himself, his family, and his friends. This includes the responsibility to wage war if or when necessary. He is ruthless, but not arbitrary. The punishment must fit the crime. He is loyal to his friends, and he expects his friends to be loyal to him. Those who betray are traitors, and traitors are to be put to death. In his own way, he is a dedicated businessman, a politician, a judge, a soldier, a husband, and a father. He provides. He protects. All he asks is for your respect, your loyalty, and your friendship.﻿<br/><br/>Phenomenal film.<br/><br/>R.I.P Tessio﻿"

Hands down it is a prefect movie in every shape of the word. The moment i began watching this movie it took me in, i'm not Italian but felt proud to be a Latin American after watching this because of the amount of pride and value the writer gave to these characters, the love of family is one that i can relate to being from a Hispanic family. Many similarities in the way we conduct our lives. <br/><br/>Building up the Godfather, with the dramatic lighting, long cuts, the sense of realism as if you were there at the wedding says so much about the director. The roll of the god father must have been a hard roll to fill and execute, but Marlon Brando murdered it. He is nothing like any of his movies in the past. The embodiment of this character is one to remember. Hollywood needs more movies like this to be released in 2016 and 2017. <br/><br/>I'll be waiting..."

The story shows how a average man become a leader, for good and for bad, the process is hard and cost tears, blood and a piece of our souls. We learn from this thriller that we can't control our destiny, and even our reactions to life challenges isn't full of ourself, in essence great part of our acts is just instinct. This is the main argument and lesson here, we can't make plans in the long run, but we can train to respond to new obstacles.

This is not a bang bang boom slapped together type film to stuff the appetite of the average movie goers; it was carefully and perfectly crafted in every way imaginable. Conventional wisdom did not influence this films director, Francis Ford Coppola's vision is original in every way. This film is the alpha and omega of all films ever shot! Nothing will ever compare.

Every people can learn something from this movie. <br/><br/>The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.<br/><br/>The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.<br/><br/>This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.<br/><br/>This is the GREATEST MOVIE of the 20th century."

","Everyone raves about ""The Godfather"" and its achievements. I say it's all a matter of opinion. The performances are probably what makes this film a work of art. It'd be nearly impossible to find another film where Diane Keaton, Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, and the rest of the cast do work of such quality. Even in the sequel, they begin to slack off (with the exception of Keaton and Pacino). What this movie also benefits from is the power of the story, but there are moments where the overall mood becomes oppressive and a bit too slow.<br/><br/>The film is a joy to behold, with an evocative score, sensational photography, and many other great elements. Would I put it up there at the top of the heap? There are other films that are more consistent, whose elements work well as a solid unit and deliver more satisfactory results."

The question we must ask ourselves is""Are Italians really that thick headed and vulgar?"" and the answer is a resounding no. You almost get the impression that Vito Corleone is a homosexual and that James Canns Character has a mental diffieciency. The only good character depicted in the movie was Al Pacinos part.

","If you want to see the quintessential american crime film?  Goodfellas. The Godfather is romanticized garbage in comparison.  Take a look at Coppolas' interviews about the godfather.  It is not a film he was passionate about doing, nor is he proud of the mafia legacy and he was a little bit insulted the studio thought he would do a good job just because he was Italian. Coppola purposely turned the story into a universal tale of a king and his family to avoid the broken, bloody and undressed view of the ""earners"" on the street.  He didnt want to focus on this, because of his aforementioned lack of pride.  He turned the mafia into a fairy-tale.<br/><br/>Scorcese created goodfellas with passion and respect.

","I'm not really the target audience for The Godfather franchise, but I did go into the movies with an open mind.

With all those elements in place, why wouldn't I like a movie about the importance of family, Italian heritage, and loyalty?<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of violence, but ironically, the version of The Godfather that I saw had been edited for appropriate television audiences. Much of the blood and violence was cut out, the swear words were muffled, and the sex scenes were deleted. The movie was only an hour long-just kidding! I don't know how or why this movie became so legendary, since to me, it felt like a B-picture starring a bloated, tired, low-energy Marlon Brando. This felt like a typical '70s movie, or an '80s television movie, with cheap production values and a has-been lead. I'll never, never understand why Marlon Brando was cast as the title role, and why, after his performance was seen during rehearsals, he wasn't replaced by someone else. Why wasn't Anthony Quinn cast? Marlon Brando must have patterned his famous, never-endingly mimicked accent after a relative or family friend, but among my Sicilian family line, and meeting people during my trips to Italy, no one has sounded even remotely like the cotton-mouthed, whispering, jaw-jutting ""Italian"" accent.<br/><br/>I doubt I'm the only person in the world who doesn't like The Godfather or its sequels, but those of us who aren't fans are certainly quiet. If you haven't seen it yet, I'm sure you'll want to at least try it out, since there are so many famous moments to the first movie. There's the offer, the cannoli, the bag of fruit, the car bomb, the fishing trip, and of course, the horse's head. Marlon Brando scratches his jowls, James Caan is a royal jerk, and Al Pacino explains the difference between personal and business. But most importantly, there's tons of self-importance and an almost tongue-in-cheek seriousness that begs the question, why were there two sequels?<br/><br/>Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

His oldest son who was hot headed, angary, but a wonderful tactican like a general could never run this family. His second son Fredo was not man enough to to do his job. He youngest son though, the person who killed Sollozzo, was a calm, thoughtfull, ruthless man, and would be the person to take over the family business.

Francis Ford Coppola directed the proceedings like someone who has lived and breathed this material, and he doesn't allow his love for movie-making magic to cloud the realism of this family's dark dealings, but he perhaps allowed the cast too much free reign and some sequences tend to ramble.

"melkor-3","Null","3","8","26 November 2004"," Nicely done, but lacking substance
","Today, it is by far agreed that The Godfather is a masterpiece of cinematography that presents us with a purely masculine, yet passionate reality of the world of gansters. Unfortunately in my case, this very masculine approach to the movie is what makes it a bit dry and well...unpolished...unpolished to the point that I would not call it a masterpiece and I would definitely not have it ranked as #1.<br/><br/>On one hand, we are presented with manly values such as loyalty, brotherhood and fatherhood that eventually result in the triumph and conquest of weakness within the man, as well as within the family. On the other hand, these values are only a bitter half of human reality and yet another half, the feminine one, should also be there for it is both these natures that make a true human being, that make a true family. Without this feminine touch, The Godfather, was quite dull and well eventually boring.<br/><br/>Though as a man, I did feel the pride and could relate to the masculine aspects of the movie, deep inside, I also missed the emotional side. We see compassion of the Don toward his loyal subjects, but it is not the same kind of compassion one would express toward a human being. We see tears of the defeat, but those tears are quickly slapped out of the face of the one crying. We see romance and love, yet that as well, ends quickly in death and loss of a loved one. This emotional, feminine touch is what makes a great movie great. It allows for a human being to explore his nature in its entirety, not just its part. That's what makes great movies great, such as most of Akira Kurosawa's masterpieces for instances. Kurosawa made us feel ourselves through his visions, he made us realize that we're not just men or just women, he made us see our true human nature. His family was one with both polarities present or if they were absent, they would come together at the end. The Godfather instead eliminates this other polarity and creates a distorted vision of a chauvinist world where men govern, men rule and men eat men.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the movie is good, but far from the best."
"richard_conrad","Null","3","8","23 July 2004"," Overrated (*SPOILERS*)
","Wow, what an overrated movie. And since I obviously hold the minority opinion on that, let me elaborate. First, I've seen only the first movie, not II or III. This review is about the first movie, and I was expecting it to stand up as its own movie, which it did not for me.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS AHEAD)<br/><br/>I'll start with the things I liked. The acting is pretty good, with the exception of a few scenes. Some of the scenery is good, notably the parts that take place in Italy. The portrayal of the different characters and the motivation behind their actions is well done in a fairly complex plot. So, overall, I can see how people would say it's a well-made movie. That's about it.<br/><br/>So what did I not like? The Godfather simply did not entertain me.<br/><br/>The biggest disappointment was that there really was no major character I could identify with. All the men were basically a bunch of lying, cheating, murderous sons of bees, and I'm not just talking about the family business. They treat their women TERRIBLY. Carlo abuses his wife (there's no excuse to take it to that level, even if it's ""business""). Sonny, a married man with kids of his own, is seen with mistresses. Even Michael, who might have been the one character I could somewhat identify with, leaves for Italy, stays away more than a year without so much as a peep to his girlfriend Kay, gets married, watches his wife blown to pieces, then shows up in the States again one day and proposes to Kay out of the blue. (""Did you miss me? Now that my secret wife exploded in flames, I guess that makes you #2 on my list, and oh by the way, I need you, I love you, ooh baby baby, please marry me."" What total crap.) Then near the end, he refuses to answer her simple question, she (unbelievably) keeps asking, he relents, and with a dramatic pause, he finally lies to her. And she believes him, even just for a few seconds? You've got to be kidding. How can I like a movie when I really don't find myself sympathizing with any of the characters?<br/><br/>The violence - not well done. Am I really to believe that a man sleeping on his bed wakes up and discover his horse's severed head placed under the sheet at his feet, with blood covering his own hands and arms? Yeah, that could happen while I sleep... NOT. And what terrible acting when the guy sees the horse head and keeps screaming! Also, the scene where Moe gets shot - look at the bullet hole in his eyeglasses - it's unbelievably small. Was he shot with a needle gun? People might view this as nit-picking, but it really jumped out at me while watching the movie, and it bothered me. And what about Sonny's murder? Is it really necessary to have his killers fire 300 bullets, and to show the whole thing? Look - when the whole premise of a movie is violence, it had better be well-done violence, especially when all the characters are such scoundrels and I don't care who lives and who dies.<br/><br/>One of the best movies ever? Hardly. I'd put it in my top 300, because I've probably seen about 300 movies in my life. For some movies, you see them once and if you don't like them or you don't quite understand them, you're at least intrigued enough to want to watch them again. For me, this is not one of those movies."

And even though the Confederacy has a romantic air attached to it, we're all glad that the Union won (the sane ones amongst us, anyhow).  Somehow, movies don't quite reflect what we actually think, and we often end up rooting for protagonists that we would hate in real life.<br/><br/>All this build-up leads me to the doubtless controversial statement that I can't really warm to ""The Godfather"" because it's about a bunch of scuzzballs.  I can admire this movie, but I can't love it or relate to it in any way, except maybe as an allegory about the corrupting influence of power.  I can't relate to LOTR either, by the way, and I don't think either film deserves the title of ""bestest picture ever.""<br/><br/>I actually think ""The Godfather: Part II"" is much better, as it's more concerned with family relationships (the ""human"" element) than the boring gangster-vs-gangster conflicts that predominate here.  And I have a theory that people confuse the first two Godfather films in their minds, combining the best elements of both into some kind of uber-picture that doesn't actually exist (people do the same thing with ""Star Wars,"" mistakenly remembering Yoda and ""Luke, I am your father"" as elements from the ""classic"" first film).  Most of the famous Godfather scenes are not here, but in the sequel. Here, we get Brando mumbling incoherently - the performance everyone makes fun of.<br/><br/>I prefer ""Donnie Brasco"" because the character development is richer, and even ""A Bronx Tale"" because it has a powerful anti-gangster message, and because it meticulously recreates a specific time and neighborhood (as opposed to this film, which creates a gangster fantasy world).  But generally speaking, I'll take a straight drama - about people who aren't hit men - any day."

How this movie got to the top of the 250 is a mystery I'll never understand. Even Citizen Kane is a better view than this item.<br/><br/>Perhaps this film was groundbreaking in its day, but frankly, Marlon Brando was laughable (as usual), the characters were stereotypical (though I guess they are the model for a generation of stereotypes that came after), and the story unremarkable. Kind of like the Thorn Birds meets Married To The Mob.<br/><br/>That said, the film was OK.

However for those who read the book first, it is all familiar territory. Marlon Brando has only been better in ""On the Waterfront"" and Al Pacino has never been better, that is saying something.  The film is perfect, almost. The book is better than the film and rarely get's mentioned.  Emotion is there, but an age old stereotype get's enforced along the way.

I had heard how great the movie was so I watched it, and I was appalled.<br/><br/>I grant you, the movie follows the book closely, but it doesn't understand what makes the book work. Most of the actors know what to do, and Al Pacino is perfect, but Marlon Brando is clueless. Vito Corleone is NOT a thinly veiled thug. He is a caring man, who is forced to do some horrible things. But in the end he accomplishes far more good than evil. This only makes Micheal's transformation in the book more horrible, because the deaths he commits serve no such higher purpose.<br/><br/>Also, scenes of great importance are removed, Johnny Fontane is barely in it, Santino's girlfriend has a cameo, and the Doctor is nowhere to be found. I know these character's don't directly effect the plot, but they give it an emotional foundation to build upon. I cared about them more than any of the other characters. I know Coppola had to cut the book down for time to do a movie, but he would have been better off doing a mini-series instead."

I know Pacino and Brando are decent actors but compared to performances such as Judd Nelson in The Breakfast Club or Rodney Dangerfield in Caddyshack, it's seriously under par. It's easy to play a moody gangster but could you imagine Al Pacino playing Ross Geller in Friends? Me neither. The guy has no versatility.<br/><br/>One more thing is the music wasn't too hot either.

"MovieAddict2016","10","3","9","19 April 2008"," Not ""the best film ever made"" but certainly one of the great ones
","The movie opens at Don Vito Corleone's (Marlon Brando) home in the 1950s. His daughter is being wed and the entire ""family"" has come to celebrate. Vito's son Michael (Al Pacino), the most ""Americanized"" of his immediate family, has rejected the traditions of his ancestors and joined the army. He has no plans of becoming an errand boy for his father.<br/><br/>Michael's older brother Sonny (James Caan) is hot-headed and overzealous. He is next in line to inherit ""the throne"" from Don Vito, although Vito suspects perhaps that Sonny is too heated for his own good and will never make it on his own. An important scene in the film is when he belabors his son about correcting him in front of strangers.<br/><br/>A plot emerges involving a corrupt policeman and a competing Mafia family, who try to assassinate Don Vito and successfully murder his eldest, Sonny. Michael steps in to avenge his father's death, but must then be sent off into exile in Sicily for a short period of time to avoid the authorities, leaving behind his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton), who wants to get married.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, its strength lies in Brando, Caan and Pacino. Brando is perfect - his trademark ""soft mouth"" being inimitable - whereas Caan is very good at turning Sonny into a multi-dimensional character. Pacino is great and displays intelligence and a certain suave aura, which is vital to the character. This was a glimpse of Al Pacino the actor before he turned on the screaming switch.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola does a wonderful job behind the camera, which is more than can be said for his efforts within the last decade. Likewise the script by Coppola and Puzo is very well-written with impressive dialogue and conflicts of the characters.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" isn't exactly the *best* film ever made but it's certainly a great movie; a masterpiece that redefined epic cinema much in the same way ""Lawrence of Arabia"" did."

The characters are shallow and one-dimensional, yet the film takes them seriously and treats them with gravity; there isn't a shred of irony or humor in this nearly 3 hour film. I didn't find the numerous scenes of the family's business dealings compelling, nor was I persuaded by the film's attempts to draw a parallel between organized crime, business and politics. And Talia Shire, Robert Duvall, Morgana King, Brando, Caan, and Pacino never felt like a family to me; they rarely if ever are all together, and does the Godfather ever meet or talk with Michael's wife Kaye? Brando's performance is an impressive stunt, but it's really a supporting role and the Old Don's manner of speaking becomes tiresome as does the film's solemn pacing. Pacino is the film's star and he is excellent and convincing in his transformation from fresh-faced to poker face. Diane Keaton's Kaye is unbelievably naive, and Talia Shire as Connie carries the melodramatic scenes including a fight with her husband that is redolent of so many other scenes of marital discord. Morgana King as mama Corleone spouts clichÃ©s. And though most of the characters are guilty of betrayal, double crossing and murder, I actually developed more sympathy for some of the Corleone's victims notably Tessio and Moe Green than I did for them."
"Geeky Randy","10","2","5","17 March 2015"," Geeky Randy's summary
","Brando and Pacino share the lead in this masterpiece based on screenwriter Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name, about the boss of an organized crime family gradually transferring control of his business to his son, a war hero who never had any interest in following in his father's footsteps. Pacino's transformation from a black-sheep to a ruthless Mafia boss is so slick that it's worth every second of the film's epic length, while Brando's iconic delivery as the legendary Don Vito Corleone is literally untouchable and indisputably one of cinema's greatest performances. Definitely a film that might need one or two replays before being fully appreciated, but it is a classic for all the right reasons. Followed by a must-see second installment two years later, which is arguable even better than this perfect picture! Direct Coppola co-wrote the script.<br/><br/>**** (out of four)"

","It's really hard to argue against this film as the greatest of all time. The Godfather is one of those rare instances where incredible plot meets incredible interpretation. It has Iconic performances to iconic characters. Dialogues that are bursting with quotes, style, and even wisdom. Themes that resonate immediately with anyone: family, loyalty, honor, power, revenge, legacy. Etc.<br/><br/>The story is essentially an emotional tragedy sprinkled with humor/fun. It makes us feel for this family. Moments of warmth if you will, largely thanks to characters like Vito (warmth) or Sonny (humor). As such we feel more impact when family members make mistakes that effect the whole. <br/><br/>There's also something special about how the film interacts with the viewer, and it's hard to exactly explain what it is; it's an unusual tone. I guess it has something to do with how it all mixes: the superb acting, the almost-strange-but-beautiful camera shots, the haunting music. I would argue that it makes the film as a whole haunting.<br/><br/>It's just damn perfect."
"raphaklopper","10","2","5","7 October 2013"," BEST MOVIE EVER MADE, period! (Here It is the review from Parts 1-2-3 together)
","Does anyone ever asked the question about what is the best movie ever made? The movie that never get wrong in conveying its history and get right on all the points? The film that is very close to the word ""perfection""? Well, ""The Godfather"" parts 1-2-3 are undoubtedly the answer to this question. Separate the 3 movies and judge them separately is easy. Of course the 1st is where we get marveled, and the other two we had already noted some mistakes, but that's why the three movies together are not only a masterpiece from Francis Ford Coppola but also (perhaps) the best story ever told in a movie.<br/><br/>While in the 1st part, we are introduced to the Italian mob-family the Corleone's facing various threats from rival mob-families. That forces Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) tries to push his youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), to be his successor and be the next family's godfather; In part 2, we have the exact continuation of the story of Michael in the power of the family trying to raise the family business to other countries but he ends up making mistakes along the way. And simultaneously, we have the story of the young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) showing how he came to America and started raising his family; And finally the 3rd and last part we see a older Michael Corleone, suffering from mistakes that he committed in the past. But now he tries to redeem himself before his children Anthony (Franc D' Ambrosio) and Mary (Sofia Coppola) and his family trying to finally legalize the family business going into business with the Vatican and elect his nephew Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) as the new family godfather. But the dangers have always followed the Corleone's closely.<br/><br/>As I said, all parts form the masterpiece that Mario Puzo (Screenwriter) and Francis Ford Coppola (director and screenwriter) brought to the world with his vision of the Italian mafia. Many criticize the film by worshiping the Italian Mafia, which it technically does, but the way that both genius explore it is fantastic.<br/><br/>Throughout the history of the Corleone's, Coppola and Puzo explore the life and business of the mafia and how it works, demonstrating the business and the wars between the Mafia families that are shown realistically and terrifying. BUT, it is not just a story of violence and tragedy as many accuse (which is 60 % of it), because as the film progress it raises throughout the history various concepts of honor, justice and family, all revolving around the Corleone. Making the public really feel part of the family and start to worry about each family member in all parts of the story, at the same time with the family business and his honor.<br/><br/>The writing from Puzo and Coppola help much in this regard. The script is extremely ""perfect"" in all parts. The narrative is so superb that it never gets boring or leave loose ends, and always raise the values of honor and family through the best dialogs ever put on film. But Puzo and Coppola can make these long dialogs in simple conversations between human beings facing their problems, putting ourselves in their situations and relating with them, leaving the film more exciting and engaging.<br/><br/>But Coppola not only explores the Italian mafia and their families but also puts at various points in American history: the first part is right after the 2nd World War and Michael is a war hero returning home, but he ends up becoming the godfather from his family; on the 2nd part in the history of young Vito Corleone we see him coming in America at the time of the great Italian immigration meeting the ""American Dream""; on the 3rd part with Michael going into business with the Vatican we see a huge line of corruption and murder within the church .<br/><br/>Both in writing and directing the film is excellent too but the performances are the highlights of the movie: Al Pacino is excellent in every detail with a penetrating gaze and frightening expressions (and still annoys me that in 3 films he didn't get a Oscar for his role); Robert De Niro is a perfect young Vito Corleone in both voice and gestures reminding us of the badass and unforgettable old man from the first part with a simply perfect performance from Marlon Brando.<br/><br/>Many say that the 3rd part should never be connected to the first two for be to horrible. I think the film is still a masterpiece but obviously it has his inconveniences leaving loose ends like: what happened with Tom (Robert Duvall), the family's lawyer, he died or he started his own family as he wanted in part 2? And also adds a lot of plots and little development, at least in the 1st hour of the film. But after a huge chopper scene everything settles superbly and concludes the trilogy or rather the film perfectly.<br/><br/>Simply putted is the best movie ever made, the drawbacks and inconveniences are almost invisible (except in the 3rd part). Concepts of honor and family within the Mafia; full of suspense and drama; criticizes America and the church. All this in a movie with excellent performances, direction and writing simply perfect. All that makes ""The Godfather"", the strongest brand of cinema till today<br/><br/>10/10"

In this movie you will understand how things work in mafia and which is the followed hierarchy. <br/><br/>Marlon Brando made on of his best performances of his entire career as Don Vito Corleone and it seemed as he had won the Oscar for the Best Actor in a Leading Role in 1973. You will also love the performance of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone (Nominated for Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role).<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" is a movie that you must see and I strongly recommend it to you and I am sure that you will rate it with a 10/10."

","THE GODFATHER of all Gangster movies is an understatement for the line 'THE GODFATHER of all movies'. You won't miss any element of a great movie in this. Two greatest actors from Hollywood (Brando & Pacino) and a director whose fame is worldwide. The two lead actors were actually chosen instead of Redford and Olivier for various reasons.There were lots of budget issues while producing this movie but Coppola handled them absolutely well. Apart from production cost, he had to handle few supporting cast who weren't actually actors but gangsters.The director did say in an interview that he had tough time asking a character to read a sentence in English.<br/><br/>There are at least dozen movies (in my country alone) which inspired/copied this epic.So, the bottom line is if you haven't watched this yet then get a copy now."
"PeterMitchell-506-564364","10","2","5","2 April 2013"," Oh my god, we've created movie greatness or a mafia hit
","What a movie this is? Like a ride and a half. Only coming to view it again last year, after last seeing it, I'd say, early 1990, late 89' this movie I've watched a few more times, again the other night, has grown on me. It's undoubtedly a masterpiece that deserves it's place of respect as one of the great movies of all time. Ironically the film was on GO the night after I've video'd it again. That just shows ya, what a classic this is. They don't make films like this anymore. The acting is high calibre. I loved James Caan in this as the hot headed brother who meets his demise in one of three bloody scenes, the most notably of course, that horrifyingly violent scene with the horse head, in the bed of a movie producer refuses to play ball. If you want a favor, like a wrong to be righted, talk to the Godfather, (an unparalleled performance by the late great Marlon Brando, who died penniless at 145 k's-hard to believe) can solve all your problems. Brando in this, just shows ya as in other films like Apocalypse Now, he's just the consummate actor. He must of inspired so many wannabe's. Of course the great discovery of a young talent, who soon would become an acting legend/role model, was of course Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone who when we first meet him, he's not part of his mafia family. In fact, he somewhat despises it. It's the choice he makes later on, after a near death experience with a loved one, where in his eyes, payback is warranted, even though, he quotes ""Never personal"". He becomes one of them, after brazenly taking out a crooked cop, and the head of another mafia family, responsible for the execution on his father, Don Corleone, (Brando), a tough cookie, surviving five close shots. What resilience this guy has, proving some guys are just lucky, or hard to kill. All the emotions, Pacino shows, nervousness, agitation, as he braces himself to make his first kills, were so believably intense, not overacted, just nice, perfect even. Pacino then vacates to Sicily for a year, to wait for the heat to cool down, where he marries a Sicilian beauty. I couldn't believe Diane Keaton, always terrific, and so good (fine) in this, escaped an Academy award nomination. She was just as good as most of the excellent leads. Watching Caan kick the crap out of his sister's abusive husband, was a guilty viewing pleasure. Caan really impressed me here. I won't tell you the last scene of this movie, but it involves a big fat lie, from Pacino, when asked a one time question by Keaton, which impactfully stayed with me, where if I was Pacino, for me, answering ""Yes"", would be an impossibility. There's some things you don't see coming in The Godfather, and the story takes different paths throughout the film. The cinematography is of course, first rate, and I love the interior shots in the Don's office, and again, here's a mafia film, that has me craving Italian. Although it's occasionally violent, most of it's pretty graphic too, oh that blood so under colored, more orangy red, flowing, it will always stand as the no one mafia film. God help us, if something of it's ilk, better's it."
"jackzell94","7","2","5","9 March 2013"," Great movie but extremely overrated
","The Godfather is most peoples favorite movie of all time and that's fine. But for me their are better mob movies that explore the mafia. This movie is an epic such as Saving Private Ryan or Gladiator but it doesn't give you an emotional staying power like these films do. Be that as it may, I really enjoyed The Godfather because it makes the story of these characters believable. The three strong points of this movie are its story, you live this life with these characters and you don't doubt that they had to go through serious heartbreak and triumph throughout their lives. Another strong point is Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone. It is an iconic screen performance and has definitely been copied in later crime movies. It's such an original character. And then the last strong point is the writing, so many memorable quotes are from this film and as they should be. In action movies visual effects and stunt doubles make you feel good. In a great movie like this the action is the dialogue. An overall good movie but extremely slow."
"kosmasp","10","2","5","4 February 2013"," And so it begins
","The beginning of a movie always sets the tone. Same goes for this movie here. And watching this you can understand how this influenced the TV show ""Sopranos"". But back to the first scene. It involves the Godfather character who has to talk to people on the wedding day of his daughter, because it is tradition. The way it is filmed and lit is exceptional. The tone is set in more than one settings. Because you also get what the movie is about: Respect, Fear and Power.<br/><br/>Some of which get achieved by manipulation, convincing (in more than one way) or buy-out. What lies above all? A thing the Godfather always tells his children (or his lawyer)? Family is what matters. The movie does hold up to the test of times. You might have seen movies that have more violence in them, but when this movie gets violent it doesn't hold back.<br/><br/>The performances are awesome and I can't wait to listen to the audio commentary by Mr. Coppola (which is supposed to be controversial, I'll see about that). So re-watching the movie reminded me of how good it is. But also of how much I miss the Sopranos. One of most known little facts of the movie, Marlon Brando stuffing his cheeks, make you look at the movie differently too. It still takes nothing away from it of course. Exceptional in every sense, even if you don't agree with the way the ""family"" functions (and you shouldn't agree with it of course, just saying)"
"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","5","29 March 2012"," Quite Amazing What Coppola Pulled Off
","The Godfather (1972) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola's epic masterpiece adapted from Mario Puzo's novel about crime lord Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) and his attempt to keep his family from going in the wrong direction. Everything imaginable has already been said about this movie so there's not too many reasons to go back through it. Having recently watched the movie theatrical as part of Paramount's re-release, I must say that knowing the film and story so closely allowed me to just sit back and enjoy what Coppola put on the screen. What really struck me is how there are so many reasons why this film shouldn't have worked yet everything came together so perfectly. People know about the studio not wanting Brando and Al Pacino but can you imagine what would have happened had neither one been here? I've never felt this was anywhere near Brando's greatest performance and in fact I might not even place it in the top ten. That's not saying anything against his work here but it speaks for how great he was. I think the most impressive thing was seeing how well he could play someone elderly. Just think that he followed this up with LAST TANGO IN Paris and it just shows what all he could do. With Pacino it has been said that the studio didn't like the rushes they were seeing involving some of his early stuff like at the wedding. Watching these scenes it's easy to see why they'd be nervous but just check out the sequence when his character takes on the responsibility of going to the restaurant. It's really like Pacino the legend is born in this scene and that brilliant scene is like us seeing what was to follow in his career. <br/><br/>Not only is there Brando and Pacino but also Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, John Cazale and Abe Vigoda turning in masterful performances. Another thing that really sticks out is how brave Coppola was for letting the story takes its time. There are many, many slow moments here where we get dialogue scenes that get dragged out. Everyone mentions the wedding sequence but this is a perfect example of where the slowness is such a benefit as it really gets you on the inside of understanding how this family works. Coppola allowing the film to takes its time was a dangerous move but it really pays off because there's not another film like this. A lot of future movies tried to copy the style and this certainly slow, building drama but none of them were as successful. Nino Rota's music is simply irresistible and the opening cords as the movie opens are just chilling. The cinematography is some of the most amazing you're ever going to see and the lighting here is among the greatest ever. Especially effective are the scenes inside the Don's office and how the light was used. <br/><br/>THE GODFATHER isn't going to get my vote as the greatest movie of all time, of the decade or even the greatest gangster picture. With that said, there's no question that this is still a essential part of American film history and with so much talent involved it's just amazing to watch it today and admire what all they were able to accomplish."
"StevePulaski","10","2","5","28 March 2012"," The media has made it a mockery you couldn't ignore
","The question everyone will likely ask me upon viewing the lengthy and heavily-celebrated Godfather I will not answer. That question is ""is it really the greatest film of all time?"" I can't answer it. I'm in no position to, nor have I seen every film ever made to correctly state that. How can you say what the greatest film of all time is if you haven't seen literally every film ever made? That question will never be answered. If you polled a million people, the question would still be answered with subjectivity. There is no possible way to define what is the greatest film of all time without any subjective input. It can't be done.<br/><br/>I will say The Godfather is an important film. Perhaps the greatest, but definitely one of the most important in the history of the art form. Its depiction of the mob, to my knowledge, is dead on, and runs like a stage play or opera at opus length. It is three hours long, and I recommend two or even three sittings before you finish it. To take it in all in one sitting is difficult, not just because of length, but because of content. It is five minutes shy of three hours and feels every bit as long. It's not a problem, since the film immerses you with intricate visuals, dialog, and its casual glide of events, but it makes for a sometimes testing excursion.<br/><br/>Everyone knows the story, so I won't go into it. Basically, we follow the Corleone family, an Italian mob run by Don Vito, played with unmatchable talent by Marlon Brando, after his daughter Connie (Shire) is married to Carlo Rizzi (Russo). After that, we see dramatic events following the wedding and run-ins with other gang outlets, fights, and lengthy monologues involving the family.<br/><br/>I grew up on Scorsese's mob flicks, and one who has will find a grand difference between Scorsese's portrayal of mob life and Francis Ford Coppola's portrayal. For one, Scorsese's mob films, of course we're primarily speaking of Goodfellas, were more about exploiting the lifestyle, with an outsider looking into the action, who would eventually become one of them. In contrast, Coppola brings us right into the lifestyle, not from an outsider's perspective, but from the perspective of many different family members. Don Corleone is not the main character in the film. Nor is Carlo Rizzi. Surprisingly, Al Pacino's Michael is the one who lifts most of the picture off the ground in terms of characters.<br/><br/>Pacino is outstanding. Every scene he's in, he possesses an undeniable screen presence that is equal parts ominous and electrifying. Brando brings a unique sense of direction to the screen as well. He seems calmer, more confident than any mob boss I've seen portrayed before. It doesn't seem like he needs to hammer home the idea he is the boss. He believes without a shadow of a doubt everyone knows it, and if they don't, they soon will.<br/><br/>The Godfather, like many classics, shows signs of age. It has a dated look to it, where all its colors appear to be washed out. It doesn't bother me, but I've heard others complain heavily. Some even find it to be ""overrated"" and boring. I don't really see it as that, mainly because I can see what makes the film top many ""best film"" lists. It has tremendous writing, intricate, serious directing from Coppola, gifted performances, and some of the most impressive cinematography, evoking seriousness, atmosphere, and detail to perhaps the sternest extent.<br/><br/>But I can see people being underwhelmed because of one inevitable outlet; pop culture and media. The Godfather has to be one of the most parodied films of all time, with lines, events, and monologues tempered with and mocked in frequent TV shows, movies, and even children's shows. I did a short film in high school about ""The Doughnut Godfather,"" where a student dressed up in a fancy suit, put on a luxurious hat, and had a stuffed cat sit on his lap. This could very well make the film lose its serious aspect to some because immediately when we hear the line ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse,"" we divert our thoughts to where we've heard that before.<br/><br/>Another big difference I noticed between Scorsese and Coppola's work is that Scorsese's mobster films are more about history, rather than characters. We do get heavy characterization, but each films seems to have a great deal of respect for mob history and real life events. Coppola focuses a lot more on characterization and performances, as well as creating vignettes involving the Corleone family, showing family meetings and murders. When we look back at Goodfellas, we do think performances, but we more or less think of events that shocked and surprised us. When we think Godfather, we immediately reminisce about the extremely involved and award-worthy performances.<br/><br/>This could very well be one of the greatest films I've ever seen, but again, who am I to judge? My job is to say if I enjoyed a film and do I see audiences liking it. I'm sure many, if not every person, reading this review has seen The Godfather, and if not, then they have an extra task on their list. Unfortunately, some won't see the beauty because so many grittier mobster films have come out, that don't involve heavy monologues and intricate performances, and pop culture has greatly subtracted the impact the film once had. This shows gangsters in a different light. Ones that don't feel the need to boast power or success. They know you already know what they've done just by how they speak, act, and move.<br/><br/>Starring: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. Directed by: Francis Ford Coppola."
"ferguson-6","10","2","5","3 March 2012"," Would you like an orange?
","Black screen. Cue the lone trumpet's haunting opening notes of Nino Rota's theme. Close up of a suffering man. ""I believe in America."" That, my friends, is a powerful opening to a truly great film.<br/><br/>It's been 40 years since it's original release, and this latest remastering looked and sounded amazing on Cinemark's largest screen. Following those opening moments, we get our first look at Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone. On this screen, it was almost like seeing him for the first time ... a disquieting figure that oozes power and demands respect.<br/><br/>There is no need for another review of this truly classic American film. Instead, this will offer a few observations (possible spoilers) and notes of interest ... combined with the highest possible recommendation to watch this one again!<br/><br/>At its core, author Mario Puzo's story is about power, loyalty, trust and family. We witness what happens when one is viewed as having too much power. Loyalty is rewarded, and disloyalty brings the harshest possible penalty. Trust is gained over time, but lost in a flash. And family is the most complex subject of all.<br/><br/>Over the years, there have been a few movies with more star-studded casts, but it's difficult to imagine a more perfectly selected cast: Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda. Each of these actors have graced the screen in numerous roles, but for this three hour film, they become Corleones, associates, enemies, etc. <br/><br/>There were a few things that jumped out at me during this viewing. The use of oranges (the fruit) contradicts the health benefits preached by the medical profession. Every time we see a bowl of fruit, a fruit stand or someone peeling, eating, or selecting an orange, a scene of doom (usually quite violent) is soon to follow. Carlo is even wearing an orange suit when Sonny (James Caan) shows up and paints the sidewalk with him. Don't miss the billboard featuring oranges that Sonny drives by just before he pulls up to the toll booth. Brando's final scene is preceded by him playfully scaring his grandson with an orange peel. I understand the importance of Vitamin C, but I think I'll stick with supplements!<br/><br/>It's very interesting to note the camera angles throughout the movie. In an unusual approach, director Francis Ford Coppola uses an ""eye-level"" camera almost exclusively. This gives the viewer the feeling of being part of the scene, especially during the small group meetings within Corleone's dimly lit office. The few exceptions are the overhead shot of Corleone being shot, the Los Angeles cityscape, and a couple of shots at the wedding to emphasize the scale of the event.<br/><br/>The famous ""Mattress Sequence"" was put together by George Lucas (Star Wars fame) for his friend Coppola. This is the segment after the Louis Restaurant shooting where we get a montage of B&W crime photos and newspaper headlines. These are real life crime photos and one of the shots is of Frank Nitti, Al Capone's trusted enforcer.<br/><br/>It's quite fascinating to recognize how many ""classic"" lines of dialogue sprung from the movie, especially when you notice the minimalistic approach to dialogue used by Puzo and Coppola. Much of the communication is non-verbal body language, glances, nods and shrugs ... Brando, especially, is a master at this.<br/><br/>One of the more remarkable facets of the film is the transformation of Michael (Al Pacino). We first see him as a dashing war hero relaxing at the wedding with his girlfriend (a baby-faced Diane Keaton). He is very laid back and kind of cocky with the thought that he can rise above the dirty family business. He sees himself as better than that. Watch the subtle changes in his appearance ... his hair, his posture, his eyes, even his hat! As great as Brando is as the Don, it's Pacino's performance that really takes the film to an unprecedented level. It's really fun to compare Michael's even-keeled, calm processing approach to the high-strung, act-now-think-later approach of his brother Sonny.<br/><br/>The final note involves actor John Cazale. Here (and in part 2) he plays Fredo as a frightened, insecure puppy who is desperate to find his place. Imagine your father being Vito Corleone and your brothers are Sonny and Michael. It's to be expected that you might be overlooked and overpowered in conversation. The really interesting note about Cazale is that this was his feature film debut. He went on to make 4 more films before cancer took his life in 1978. Cazale made 5 films and all 5 were nominated for Best Picture (both Godfather films, The Conversation, Dog Day Afternoon, The Deer Hunter). He was engaged to Meryl Streep at the time of his death.<br/><br/>So the real point here is that if you ever doubt the magic and power of movies ... shut off your phone, close the blinds, take the cannoli, and let The Godfather absorb your thoughts. While you are at it, remember ... it's not personal, it's business (only you shouldn't really believe that).<br/><br/>Thanks to Cinemark for making me an offer I couldn't refuse."

","What is the point of this movie? Okay, I am not thick-headed or something, in fact I am an avid movie follower and have come to appreciate some fine movies because that was what they were- fine! But sadly this movie failed to inspire me. Agreed not all movies need to but the fact that the movie glorifies things like ""killing"", ""gambling"", and a dozen other vices but proudly considers prostitution as evil, point to the epic hypocrisy therein...<br/><br/>Right from the word go, the movie moves insipidly leaving you corrupted and uneasy. The so-called crime lord has principles! Well if you as a filmmaker are going to make a crime lord who deserves nothing but the greatest of the punishments possible, as some kind of a hero on screen; the youth of today will become influenced by the wrong notion and begin to imagine themselves in the same position- as heroes committing a great act in their waywardness. The movie fails on all counts to warn the audience of these things.<br/><br/>And as for the story it is not that great either. No offense to Mario Puzo fans, but talking of the movie I think the subject could have been tackled more intelligently, cinematically...<br/><br/>And as for those who go with the flow and praise The Godfather even though in their hearts, they don't see the movie as that great, take a stand and be truthful!<br/><br/>A better movie than this which handles crime and successfully drives home the motives of gangsters in the most humane way, is ""Once upon a time in Mumbai"", a Bollywood movie.

"itamarscomix","10","2","5","27 September 2011"," Perfect
","It's a difficult word to cope with. It's a word that I try to toss around as little as possible. But there's just no other word. The Godfather isn't necessarily my favorite film of all time, it's not necessarily the best film of all time, but it's just that: perfect.<br/><br/>Very few films can make this claim; very few films work on every possible level, on every aspect of the art of cinema, with every line and every shot perfectly placed, none wasted, none too fast, none too slow. The Godfather is a film that takes its time, sometimes moving slowly, but never so slowly that it loses momentum; it's a film that's incredibly rich and full of emotion and symbolism, but it's also very entertaining.<br/><br/>In the music - Nino Rota's score compliments every scene its in, immerses the viewer, never distracting but always a part of the atmosphere, so that whenever you'll hear it a scene from the film will immediately come to mind.<br/><br/>In the editing - it can be very simple at times, and very intense at others - like the baptism scene near the end. It can be slow and tense, it can be calm and euphoric, and it can also be bloody violent.<br/><br/>In the cinematography - the lighting is never coincidental, always complimenting the mood of the scene, the coloring always expressive and always of importance.<br/><br/>In the acting, of course - The Godfather boasts a supergroup of actors, and almost all of them pull their most impressive performance here - Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton... this is to the credit of Francis Ford Coppola who drove the actors to these performances as much as the actors themselves.<br/><br/>There is no film better than The Godfather. There may be films that are more complex, more original - The Godfather's tale, beneath the complexity of dozens of characters, is a simple story of family, honesty, morality, loyalty and family... most of all family. Even Part II can be seen as more sophisticated than the first film - but it's not 'better', because unlike The Godfather, Part II has flaws, small as they may be.<br/><br/>If you love movies - watch The Godfather. Whether or not you're interested in crime fiction, watch it. If you just want a good piece of entertainment, watch it too. It's a rare accomplishment - it's a film of quality that may be equaled, but can never be surpassed."
"Steffi_P","10","2","5","22 July 2010"," ""It's strictly business""
","There was a time in Hollywood, mostly during the 1960s, where the great motion picture factory lost its way a bit. We saw the rise of the pretentious independent production, and what studio output there was might be eye-catching but lacking in the old magic. Above all they had lost touch with the professionalism that characterised the industry back in its heyday. At last, in the early 70s, the younger generation of filmmakers began to grow up and Hollywood started to get its act together again. The Godfather is one of its great comeback pictures.<br/><br/>Why has The Godfather become such a giant of cinema? Its story has no great emotional weight, no laugh-out-loud comedy, no rip-roaring action, no thrilling suspense. But it is, quite simply, a perfectly written drama. The screenplay adapted by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola from Puzo's novel is a great study of power because it takes a bunch of ruthless mob bosses going about their business, but shows their humanity through their reverence for the family, without ever once losing sight of their amoral coldness. It hooks us instantly with the power of that thought, so much so that it can afford to devote a major portion of its length (a full forty minutes of screen time, from the opening wedding to the notorious horse's head incident) merely introducing us to the way the Corleone world works, before even getting onto the real storyline. The fact that it can do this and still hold our interest shows the solidity of its ideas and characterisation.<br/><br/>The Godfather also sees director Coppola at his very best. Coppola has a lot in common with an ace director of the previous generation, the consistently brilliant William Wyler, especially in his approach to actors. Like Wyler, Coppola fully understands that an acting performance is comprised of many facets – voice, facial expression, body language, distance from the audience – and a director can choose which to show and which not to show, to varying effect. Take that masterful opening shot – we are introduced to the eponymous Godfather in a slow zoom out, gradually revealing his bulky figure dominating the foreground, his back to the audience. This establishes the character as an intimidating presence – no face to be seen as yet. When we do see his face the dimness of the interior makes his stern expression all the more formidable for how hard it is to read. Even when we see him in brighter surroundings with the other wedding guests it is from an objectively distant crane shot. It is only later in the picture that he becomes human to us, and we get to see a little true emotion and softness in his face.<br/><br/>Which of course brings us round to the sterling work of Marlon Brando. True to the gradual revelation of his character, he presents the Don as some kind of monster, with a face like a bulldog and a voice like an alcoholic with throat cancer. But, as over time we see the man showing tenderness for his offspring or torn up with grief, he manages to twist that ugly face into very real expressions. The effect is almost a little like the emoting of Boris Karloff as the Monster in Frankenstein. There is all-round good stuff from the rest of the cast as well. Al Pacino in particular has this brilliantly passive, steely air about him, and the dispassionate way he does everything is a sublime bit of understatement.<br/><br/>When it came to the Oscars, The Godfather of course scooped Best Picture, but it lost most of the awards to one of the other amazing pictures of the early 70s, Cabaret, for which Bob Fosse won the Best Director prize. It seems odd to me, as I feel had the two pictures (or their equivalents) been around twenty years earlier Cabaret, which gives the greatest all-out entertainment, would have been Best Picture, while Coppola would have got Best Director for his intelligent helming of The Godfather. I guess a lot of this has to do with the auteur theory effect, and a general forgetting of just what it is a director does. Thus Fosse's colourful choreographing of cast and camera won over Coppola's subtle thoughtfulness in framing and staging. Still, regardless of what awards it did and didn't get, The Godfather was a real prize for the industry, proving at last that Hollywood was back on top."
"khanbaliq2","10","2","5","30 June 2010"," Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema.
","The film is one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment. When, after ruling for two generations, the Mafia's New York Don (Marlon Brando) dies, his youngest son (Al Pacino) takes over reluctantly, but later learns the ruthlessness and brutality required to maintain his position.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a brilliantly-made film with all the fascination of a snake pit: a warm-hearted family saga except that the members are thieves and murderers. Its position as one of the great films of the last century is secure, in part because it works on so many levels: as a father-and-son story, as an epic account of the Mob's overt power and clandestine business empires in America; and as an apparently authentic glimpse into a closed world, with its own distinct and deadly codes of behaviour."

"Magenta_Bob","8","2","5","29 October 2009"," Epic gangster saga
","Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is an elegant, epic and thrilling work, to a large extent worthy of all its praise.<br/><br/>The cast is very impressive and everyone is doing a good job. Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is iconic even though I find his overly coarse voice and stuffed cheeks borderline comical. <br/><br/>Perhaps the best thing about The Godfather is that, even though the characters are involved in some questionable activities, they aren't really made out to be bad guys; you keep cheering for the Corleones almost no matter what they do. Some people might use this as criticism but I think it is rather refreshing.<br/><br/>Finally, the film is so well crafted in almost every aspect; the sound (particularly in the scene where Michael Corleone kills Sollozzo and McCluskey but also Nino Rota's score, of course), the cinematography (there are some stunning shots) and the aforementioned acting is all top notch. And yet, I think it falls a bit short of a masterpiece even though I have very few complaints. Perhaps it is a bit like with other classic works of art such as Stairway to Heaven and Mona Lisa; The Godfather has been so quoted and praised that it is hard to be completely blown away by it. Nevertheless, it is a solid and unforgettable film that should leave few people disappointed."

","My father made me watch this with him when I was 17. At first I was put off by the seemingly slow pace. But gradually the vast canvas and the gorgeous visuals began to draw me in. I had never expected that an 'old' film would be so beautiful to look at. At the end my father asked me what I thought of it. I replied that it was 'bigger' than anything I had ever seen before, but I also felt that it lacked depth. Thats when my father hit me with it : he pointed out for my benefit that ""you're not allowed to have an opinion on this film."" At 17, I used to think that having an opinion about something was a democratic and reasonable thing.<br/><br/>With this film, Coppola managed to articulate notions & myths about the Italian Mafia, notions that had existed for decades but had never been so artistically depicted before, at least not in films. No mainstream picture before had ever depicted the mafia in anything deeper than black-&-white stereotypes of good and evil. The production design, photography, the performances and Nino Rota's score are so perfectly welded together that you never doubt for a moment that the world within the film EXISTS.<br/><br/>I'm sure intellectuals have a field day with this film. A psychologist would detect seething undercurrents of homoeroticism, combined with a feudal & patriarchal mindset. A film analyst would probably criticise the straightforward storytelling style, as opposed to a twisting & warped narrative format of the noir convention, where the viewer changes what is viewed. A philosopher would berate the film for having no depth or inherent meaning, and its characters for lacking any real consciousness of themselves or the world. The film has one singular idea : the rationalizing of murder by calling it ""business, not personal"", which is appalling.<br/><br/>I still think this is the best monument of popular culture, over time as well as place. It is the ultimate elevation of style over substance, but undeniably the film is tastefully made. There are moments in this film that nobody forgets : the opening marriage scene, the decapitated horse, the meeting of the five families, and of course every single scene that Marlon Brando is in. To my mind, the Godfather is probably the best compromise we've yet seen between art and commerce."
"luke-isherwood","10","2","5","8 October 2009"," Brief comment on a masterpiece not without flaws
","I will keep my review to a minimum as so much has been written on this film. It is a fantastic film (up there with Once Upon a Time in the West as one of the greatest of all). I watched it again for the 8th time after not seeing it for 5 years or so, and had forgotten just how immersive the film is. My only negative comment, and I add this as I haven't heard this criticism before, is that this is one of the few films that would benefit from being a little longer. At times the film cuts between scenes too quickly and speeds through threads looking almost cartoony, which is at odds with the general mood of the film of a slow relaxed immersive experience. In particular consider when Tom visits Hollywood to get Johnny Fontane a role. The sequence seems almost rushed as one minute Tom is in NY then LA and then cut, cut, cut suddenly there's a horse's head.. This happens a number of times in the film and probably resulted from studio pressure to reduce the film's running length. Overall though a masterpiece."

"insomniac_rod","10","2","5","26 July 2009"," Power, politics, leadership, and strong personalities are the main attributes that surround THE GODFATHER.
","I can easily understand why this is considered by many people on EVERY single communication way as the best movie ever made. First of all, I have to say that this isn't a movie for everyone. If you are easily offended by violence then you should think twice before watching it as part of your film culture. I'm not saying it should be avoided because in my opinion; it's the most perfect film ever realized. <br/><br/>""The Godfather"" is perfect on every aspect. The plot is intriguing, very interesting but also very disturbing and cruel at some points. But the movie displays the reality of the horrors that surround mafia and narcotraffic. <br/><br/>It also demonstrates the consequences of display of unlimited power, connections, and how leadership is vital for taking important decisions on any level.<br/><br/>The Godfather's importance relies on it's influence on modern culture and cinema in general. I could go on and on mentioning the most memorable scenes and not make justice to them. (Taking a breath): The headless horse, Brasi's murder, Vito's demise, Michael assassinating the turk and the captain, ""leave the gun, take the cannolli"", ""Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes"", the FINAL and almost heavenly baptism-massacre parallel situations. <br/><br/>""The Godfather"" is perfect. It paved the way for crime films and believe it or not, I'm sure it generated interest in mafias in the real world.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, classic. Marlon Brandon delivers probably the most popular and outstanding performance in cinema. His portrayal as Don Vito Corleone generated a school of acting. Al Pacino plays his part with smoothness and demonstrates his cold blood in the most important family decisions. James Caan is also memorable as the wild, attracted to money son. He is the opposite side of Michael. Robert Duvall is fantastic, he is the most equilibrated character in terms of pace and emotions. Special mention to Lenny Montana for his display as the brutal cold blood bodyguard Luca Brasi and for Abe Vigoda. Also, Peter Clemenza was a key character that could only be acted by Richard Castellano. Diane Keaton was also excellent. <br/><br/>The Direction is just amazing. Francis Ford Coppola created a sandbox where crime and politics were generated like a clockwork orange. The visuals are amazing; the Italian exteriors and the American settings make an excellent contrast on every single aspect. <br/><br/>When I think of this movie; the first setting (the wedding) comes immediately to my mind. That is because it perfectly describes everything that's going on: negotiations, underground business, and mafia's working for their own benefit. <br/><br/>But all these aspects just surround The Don, The Godfather. I'm amazed how all the events are important and relevant in order to deliver the final punchline. <br/><br/>I can't praise this movie enough, what I've said, it's been said by millions of persons. But I declare myself as a die hard fan of The Godfather and I believe that ""his"" legacy will last forever.<br/><br/>Having power has all kinds of consequences."

","Well I'm 15 and saw this movie for the first time recently. I must say although it was well acted, written and directed; it was somewhat boring during some portions of the movie, and there were some points where i couldn't figure out what was going or why it was going on. This was sometimes caused by Brando's almost unintelligible mumbled accent (my only gripe with the acting). It seems like there was just a classic scene, then some boring filler, another memorable scene, then boring filler, and so on. All in all it's a good movie and worth watching.<br/><br/>7/10 definitely a classic, just don't expect and edge of your seat action flick."
"jcajka","10","2","5","11 June 2009"," To the people who hated this movie
","I realize that taste is subjective, but when I read the review of contributors to this site who pan great movies, I wonder about their IQ or their concept of quality. Unless they just love to type their venom on a page or have other emotional problems, it seems difficult for them to understand the quality of a movie <br/><br/>Instead of saying: A lot of people like this film. It is the highest rated film in the database. Maybe I am missing something here. Maybe I do not understand what character development is all about. Perhaps I don't know good acting from bad. Maybe I do not like a certain actor and it is coloring my entire view of the movie. Maybe the movie offends my moral sense and therefore I cannot like it without subjecting my soul to hell.<br/><br/>Or maybe, I cannot put myself in the context of the time the film was made. Sure, the phrase: 'I'll make him an offer he can't refuse!' is trite today. But it wasn't when the movie was made! Although the Mafia was not a new concept to most people, the idea that crime families lived like normal people was a revelation, taken one step further with 'The Sopranos.' <br/><br/>Similarly, one cannot compare 'The Sands of Iwo Jima'with 'Saving Private Ryan.' Although both had good production values of their times, the technology of the 90's made Ryan seem to be a better picture. <br/><br/>To summarize, before you consider yourself another Roger Ebert, read the reviews of the people who liked the movie and try to understand what they saw and why you did not fully appreciate it. Then, sit down at your computer and type, without ranting, a well reasoned critique that may be of use to others."

"Jag85","Null","2","5","14 April 2009"," It truly is one of the greatest films of all time
","Despite the film's now legendary status, I had only watched The Godfather for the first time yesterday. I've seen plenty of later crime films that were obviously inspired by it, so I was worried that the plot might become predictable for me due to my exposure to later inspired crime films. After my disappointment with classics like Citizen Kane and The Shawshank Redemption (both very good films but I wouldn't consider them to be among the greatest) last month, I was also worried The Godfather might not live up to my expectations. By the time I was 45 minutes into the film, I was completely gripped by the film's unpredictable plot and the lives of the characters, and it just kept getting better as the film progressed.<br/><br/>The plot shocked and surprised me at every twist and turn, and the film managed to keep me emotionally attached to the characters without anything ever feeling forced. Francis Ford Coppola's direction was brilliant in this regard, with dramatic events in the film simply shown as matter-of-fact, without any of the over-dramatization you often see in later crime films. The writing by Mario Puzo and Coppola was also brilliant, with plenty of foreshadowing right from the very beginning of the film.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the film which stood out was how it wasn't simply centred around a main protagonist with the others having minor roles, but nearly the entire cast was well-developed to a high degree. Despite the powerhouse performances by Marlin Brando as Vito Corleone and by Al Pacino as his son Michael, they never completely overshadowed the other cast members who were also brilliant in their own right, particularly James Caan as the elder son Santino, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Al Lettieri as 'The Turk', and Diane Keaton as Kay. Even relatively minor cast members like Talia Shire as Connie Corleone and Gianni Russo as Carlo were also very believable. It is one of the best ensemble casts I have seen, with many of the actors later going on to become major stars themselves.<br/><br/>The score by Nino Rota was also incredible. Although I was already familiar with the main theme tune, I had no idea it was from The Godfather. The tune now seemed a lot more powerful after watching the film. Nearly everything about The Godfather is spot-on, with hardly any flaws at all. The only flaw I could think of is the first half-hour being a bit slow-paced, but it really doesn't matter to me anymore seeing as how amazing the film turned out to be.<br/><br/>In summary, The Godfather truly does live up to its reputation as one of the greatest films of all time.<br/><br/>10/10"
"griffolyon12","10","2","5","13 March 2009"," A True Masterpiece!
","Every now and then a film comes along that is something truly special. Within these films everything seems to come together so perfectly, ranging from the acting, to the writing, to the directing. The Godfather is one of those such films.<br/><br/>The Godfather is one of the most endlessly entertaining films of all-time. Each and every time you watch the infamous hospital scene you can't help but get tense. When Michael goes to get the gun out of the toilet, your heart quickens. This all a testament to the film's magnificent director, Francis Ford Coppola. This is Coppola's finest work of his career. Though not only is the Godfather an entertaining film, but it is also the thought provoking character study of Michael Corleone, which is just one more reason as to why Coppola deserves recognition. Though Coppola's true merit as a director can be seen in the many magnificent performances within this film. The stellar cast ranging from Al Pacino to James Caan is awesome, though its Marlon Brando's iconic performance as the Godfather himself that steals the show.<br/><br/>Overall the Godfather is easily one of the best films of all-time, and while it may not necessarily be my number one, it is awfully close.<br/><br/>I give the Godfather a perfect 10 out of 10!"

","MOTION PICTURES having organized crime as the subject matter seem to be forever ""IN"" as fair game for a movie (""Film' if it's a special, 'Top-Shelf'production). In every era we have seen filmed stories of Gangland. Some have been factual(ST.VALENTINE'S MASSACRE), some 'loosely' based on factual material (AL CAPONE-Monogram 1959, THE UNTOUCHABLES-all incarnations) and then there are those that are all fictional(THE DON IS DEAD,THE LAST DON,DONDI).<br/><br/>FINALLY we have a category which is fiction, but not strict fiction; being an original work which, while not being the representation of historical events, it contains fictional events that are inspired by real life occurrences.<br/><br/>THIS is the type of storyline that makes for the best fiction; also this type is the one that makes and needs those disclaimers that appear in the either the opening or closing credits of a Feature Film or TV series episode that say something like: ""THE EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS FILM/TV EPISODE ARE FICTICOUS. NO COMPARISON TO REAL PERSONS, LIVING OR DEAD ARE INTENDED NOR SHOULD BE INFERRED."" <br/><br/>TODAY'S honored/dissected film, MARIO PUZO'S THE GODFATHER(Alfan Productions/Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1972), is perhaps the best example of an exponent of this category of Gangster Film. While we all are aware that the story is not a true one; at the same time we also note that there are many characters and occurrences in the story, both in the book and on the screen, that were clearly either suggested by real people and actual incidents or were out and out caricatures of such.<br/><br/>READILY we can identify fictional characters in the story that were doubtless obvious make-believe versions of denizens from our real world. The main character of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) seems to be a composite character; having taken certain characteristics from both Vito Genovese and Carlo Gambino, New York Underworld Big-Wigs both as well as Dons of two different 'Families'. Carlo Gambino even had been known as 'the Godfather'.<br/><br/>ANY casual gambler or vacationer recognizes that the character of Moe Green, a Las Vegas Casino Operator closely corresponds to the profile of real-life Ben ""Bugsy"" Siegel; who was both an early advocate and promoter of investing in and expanding the already existing gambling in 'Sin City'.(Ben Siegel was portrayed by Warren Beatty in BUGSY (Baltimore Pic./Mullholland Prod./Dessert Vision/Tri-Star, 1991, but that's another story!) <br/><br/>QUITE POSSIBLY the most obvious connection between the factual actual and the all made-up fictional lies in that of the fictional singer. 'Johnny Fontaine' (real life singer Al Martino) has the most widely held opinion of naming 'old blue eyes'(himself), Frank Sinatra as being the leading suspect.<br/><br/>THERE is indeed many similarities both in Mr. Martino's characterization, as well as the story's references to ""That Movie Big Shot"" and Johnny Fontaine's not getting the part in the War Picture that he wanted.* But in the novel, the singer Fontaine has a Comedian Partner! Can you say Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis? Allen & Rossi? how about Brown & Carney, Wheeler & Woolsey, Clark & McCullough, Abott & Costello, Laurel & Hardy, Samson & Delilah, St. Paul & Minneapolis....<br/><br/>ON a personal note; the reported indignation expressed by some Italian-American Civic groups over NBC's premiere network broadcast of the film seemed to be less serious than originally reported; as practically every Italian we ran into that day said something like, ""Hey! The Godfather's on tonight!"" <br/><br/>AND in summary, we admit it, we love those Gangster Pictures. Most folks do. But our only real criticism of the Film and the Puzo Novel is that they both tend to raise the status of Don Corleone to that of being something that a real Gangland Boss would not ever be. By way of a comparison, let us just say that Vito's conscientious and benevolent characterization is an extreme and a sophomoric falsehood. It rings no truer than the persona given to mythical Nevada Senator Geary(G.D.Spradlin) as a completely evil, patently dishonest & ruthless louse in THE GODFATHER, PART II, (1974).<br/><br/>NOTE * The references are thought by many to be of Frank Sinatra's getting the part in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY over Columbia Pictures Mogul Harry Cohn's preference for Eli Wallach. Maybe, but again, maybe not.<br/><br/>AND remember, Schultz, the answer is no about the singer character. He was Johnny Fontaine, not Frank Fontaine (Crazy Googenheim in the Joe the Bartender segment of THE JACKIE GLEASON SHOW (CBS, 1960's)!)"

","The era of the gangster arrived with the foundation of a strong individual who wanted to make all organized gangs subservient to a single power. Although the idea was not totally unique as some historians have accredited it to 'Legs Diamond, 'Dutch Shultzs or it might have originated with Mr. Maranzano, Masseria, Luciano or even Al Capone. Whoever the originator, the consensus leans towards a traditional Italian family which emigrated from Italy and who revised the custom in America of the secret society of 'Omerta.' Influenced by such a society, Mario Puzo developed a dramatic story called ""The Godfather"" about a successful Patriarch, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) from Italy who founded an Olive Oil business and expanded it into other less legitimate areas including, strong arm protection, extortion, prostitution and gambling. Now with the family's fortune expanding and gaining political influence as well, the head of the family wishes to transfer his power to his eldest son, 'Santino' Corleone (James Caan) and retire. However, a new opportunity arrives in the form of an Italian mobster named, Virgil 'The Turk' Sollozzo( Al Lettieri) who wants to start importing illegal drugs. Advised by his step-son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) that despite the danger, there is a fortune to be made in the trade. Refusing to get involved, the Don becomes a target for Emilio Barzini (Richard Conte) and other rival families and is plunged into a gang war, resulting in his own assassination and the attacks of many including his eldest son. That's when his youngest son Michael Corlone (Al Pacino) enters the family business and has a major task ahead. While this immense sage expands over the years and the American countryside, the family develops despite major setbacks, but as Michael promises, 'I'm gonna wait till I become a Godfather, then I will initiate my plan.' The movie has established itself as a monumental Classic and become immensely popular, spawning other similar films and catch-phrases such as ""I'm gonna make him an Offer, he can't refuse."" A dramatic action film which reminds us, a movie can make heroes as well as scapegoats out of arriving immigrants. ****"

","Though totally fictional, there is a reality that is seen very little in films today, and the fact that this was made in 1972 makes it even more special.<br/><br/>Before this film, from at least what I know, crime dramas involving organized crime have always made it black and white; crime was wrong no matter what the circumstances were.<br/><br/>The complexity of a criminal being a truly honorable man (Vito Corleone), and his son (Michael) who has the greatest love for him is just remarkable. That being said, the irony of all that honor and love set inside a world of corruption and murder is very odd, but works quite well.<br/><br/>What I liked about it was that they used situations from real cases, such as an infamous Italian diner scene in New Jersey being similar to the assassination of Joe ""The Boss"" Masseria made possible by ""Lucky"" Luciano."

","A few thoughts and observations on an American classic- I doubt 'The Godfather' was shot sequentially (hardly any movies are) but it sure seems to me that the first scene, the wedding scene, was also the first one filmed. The reason I say this is that none of the actors seem completely comfortable with their characters yet; it's as though they're still figuring them out, unlike later in the film, where almost all the actors absolutely inhabit their roles. The same goes for the direction and dialogue, which contains some heavy-handed exposition that is noticeably missing later on too. (Robert Duvall's Tom Hagen tells his wife at one point that he has to go back to work because no Sicilian can refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day. Oh really? His wife never knew this? She's finding out just now, in the middle of the festivities?) As Sonny, James Caan is still working on his swagger, and even Marlon Brando is shown at his desk, holding a cat and stroking it, as though he's auditioning to be the next James Bond villain. (There are no further shots of him holding a cat.) This early awkwardness soon passes but the next scene is just as confounding, in a different way. Hagen is sent to California to convince a Hollywood producer to give a movie role to Johnny Fontaine, Don Corleone's godson. This scene sticks out like a sore thumb now and has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, despite providing 'The Godfather' with one of its most famous images, that of the severed horse-head in the movie producer's bed. No, it's only when Hagen returns to New York that the film really begins. The first several times I saw 'The Godfather,' I had a difficult time breaking it down into segments and sections, as in what happened in relation to other things going on in the film. This of course is the sign of smart scripting and directorial slight-of-hand, and clever pacing which keeps you guessing. For instance, the different scenes where Luca Brazi is killed, then Don Corleone is shot, Tom Hagen is briefly kidnapped by Sallozzo, and Michael Corleone finds out what has happened. These all seem to happen at roughly the same time, but Michael finds out from a newspaper! Yet one never questions it while watching. There are so many great and famous scenes, it's hard to pick favorites, but I notice now when I watch it, I particularly enjoy the one where Don Corleone and his inner circle meet with Sallozzo, just before the aforementioned violence. It's one of the few times in the lengthy film where we actually get to see the Don at work guiding his empire and making decisions. Not a great deal happens in the scene, but it's a good example of Don Corleone's thinking and helps explain why he is held in such high regard, why he is in fact the 'irreplaceable man', as will soon become apparent. Sonny is obviously to be his successor, and just as obviously lacks the old man's reasoning and negotiating skills. Fredo is just another body in the room and Michael isn't yet ""with"" them. Despite the incredible wealth and influence we've seen the Corleone family possess, this scene and its immediate aftermath show just how fragile and tenuous its grip on power is in dangerous circumstances. The relative ease with which the Don is set up and shot, as well as the quick dispensing of his main hit-man, Luca Brazi (who had been portrayed as almost invincible), proves that Sallozzo was correct, in the short term anyway: get rid of the Don and his empire collapses into confusion. The rest of the film is more or less the laying out of a careful and methodical revenge plotted by both Michael and the old Don, following a major subplot having to do with Michael hiding out in Sicily after killing Sallozzo and a New York police captain. It all leads to perhaps the most famous scene of all in 'The Godfather,' the baptism sequence where everyone who plotted against the Corleones get their comeuppance, from Connie's husband Carlo to the rival Mafia chieftains who hoped to exploit the Corleone family's momentary weakness. That it feels like justice being served says something about how Coppola has successfully manipulated the audience into rooting for the Corleones. The word 'adventure' doesn't usually come to mind when discussing 'The Godfather,' but that's what it is, an astonishing adventure for the characters and an eye-opening look inside a powerful crime family for the audience."
"PeterWilliamson","10","2","5","5 April 2008"," Perfection Has a Name.... The Godfather
","Francis Ford Capolla's The Godfather is perfect, faultless and gripping. This film will really not stop sticking you to your chair. Al Pacino's second feature film and no doubt his best. His character is lovable and thrilling.<br/><br/>It all begins when The Godfather (Marlon Brando) is granting favours, on the day of his daughters wedding. It is a tradition, not to deny a wish. Chaos is caused and problems occur. Problems which cause his oldest son Sunny (James Caan) to take over his role temporarily. Sunny, being the aggressive and annoyed one of all the sons. Causes something else to occur. Each problem causes another. The adopted son Tommy (Robert Duvall) is a lawyer and is capable of making a small portion of the problems disappear. This movie is literally gripping, no matter how tired or annoyed you are. This will still end up being your number one favourite movie; and Al Pacino is Michael, the youngest son, and probably his fathers favourite. He gives a perfect performance. With other brilliant actors through out the film (John Cazalle, Dianne Keaton) this film is, I will say it again, perfect! I STRONGLY recommend this movie to absolutely anyone and everyone. Most probably the best work of the brilliant director Franciss Ford Capolla.<br/><br/>I give it a 110% and an 11 out of 10.<br/><br/>PERFECT!"
"RiffRaffMcKinley","10","2","5","20 January 2008"," Wow (Good Wow)!
","I really don't know how else to summarize the review of such a perfect movie.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" is undoubtedly my favorite legitimate, serious attempt at film-making. Francis Ford Coppola's brilliant direction enhances performances from such top-quality actors as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and more.<br/><br/>It is a violent, tense masterpiece, a movie in the small pantheon with ""Alexander"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (as well as the remainder of its own trilogy) that can hold your attention for three or more hours and never skew boring. If you're still unsure, pay attention to the squibs. Or the brilliantly natural production design. Or Gordon Willis's imaginative cinematography.<br/><br/>Still not convinced? Just listen to this: it's much better than the book. ""The Godfather,"" while very brutal, is probably the greatest American cinematic masterpiece. And if you won't believe this reviewer, believe the people who exalted this film to a 9.1, making it the IMDb's highest-rated film. It is one of few movies on the Top 250 that deserves such a position."
"vovazhd","10","2","5","10 January 2008"," The epitome of cinema
","The Godfather is placed near the top of any reliable best films list. It is an American classic based on Mario Puzo's novel and directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It recounts the ascent of Michael Corleone to the head of his crime family, originally headed by his father, ""the Godfather"" Don Vito Corleone. Don Vito is played by Marlon Brando in a key performance, which actually does not amount to all that much screen time (at least, relative to the whole film). The majority of the film focuses on Michael and his acquaintances trying to sustain an empire that satisfies their vision of an American dream.<br/><br/>The film exhibits masterful quality in virtually every category. The acting is one of those key aspects. Although I'm not a fan of Al Pacino, his performance as Michael is unarguably a great achievement. Marlon Brando is even more iconic and unforgettable as Don Vito. Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton are good supporting actors. In addition, I think Sollozzo and the corrupt police captain are wrongly unappreciated as bad guys.<br/><br/>The camera-work and direction is solid (although nothing groundbreaking). The music is fantastic. Although the main theme is most remembered, I believe the suspenseful music used to lead up to inevitable encounters is more important. It makes the tension come straight through the screen and into the audience.<br/><br/>The movie is a little on the long side, but most of the time the scenes are completely engrossing. It would be difficult for anyone to argue that The Godfather is not a great film. While its not my favorite movie of all time, it deserves its place in critic lists. It is as near perfect a movie as you can expect a human to make."

","This is my personal favorite movie of all time. It's just perfect. I actually hate to give it 10 stars (because there's no such thing as perfect), but I haven't a choice. It's just perfect. If you hate this movie...well, then, that's fine. This is the greatest movie I've ever seen. The settings are amazing, as are the camera angles, and the acting has no spots. The only thing imperfect about this movie is the character Santino. I just hate him. I'm glad he died. Critic's Star Amount: 4 (out of 4) Stars My Rating: 4 (out of 4) Stars You should watch it. It's just perfect. THere are few movies that can even compare to this. I just suggest this...if you only like the film because of the bloody scenes, then you should watch Pulp Fiction."

","This should have won the acadamy award for best movie ever made. It has awesome action. I think that everybody did a great job on it. Marlon Brandon deserved the Oscar he won. He did a great job on his role. My favorite character in the movie is James Cann's role ""Sonny Corleone"". He did a great job in it. Especially when he kicked Carlo's ass. Al Pacino also did a good job in it. I really liked him in this. It is my favorite role of his(this and Scarface).I believe Al Pacino should have won the Oscar for best actor in a supporting role. Francis Ford Copppla did a great job. He brought in great acting assemble for this movie. He pretty much started Al Pacino's amazing career.

","I love this movie! I will gladly be the first to admit, that I have always been fascinated by the Mafia, and that particular lifestyle... It's an incredible ride! It will deliver every genre of film you could possibly want: Action, Drama, Comedy, Suspense, and Romance... The performances in this movie by Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and John Cazale are simply the best acting you will ever see... I've always said if I can't believe the actors in their roles, then I will not recommend the movie to someone, In The Godfather, Everyone performs their roles... Perfectly! I know this is a long movie, but trust me, I have seen it so many times, and it is the only movie that I've ever seen to keep my attention the entire running time.<br/><br/>I am a huge movie person, and I will also admit I'm still pretty young, but what I do know is The Godfather tops my list as my all time favorite movie! I've cried several times at the expanse of the Corleone Family! I wish I could truly sum up how emotionally gripping this movie is, but I just can't, I could try all day, but I would keep saying oh I'm missing this, or I'm missing that... I am also reminded of what Marlon Brando said, and I apply this to my life everyday... ""A Man Who Doesn't Spend Time With His Family Can Never Truly Be A Real Man!"""

","I am an avid gangster film collector. The Godfather is my favorite movie. I watch all three every six months. My mother introduced me to this when I was a teenager in the 80s and I was hooked. Paccino is my favorite actor and I think up until the mid 90s he was the best character actor who ever lived in his error. Mario Puzzo did a great rendition of the book although when you read the book there are some differences as there always is. Mike was that ruthless cunning boss who would not let anything go, even if it was his own brother! You can't help but wonder if his character was based on Carlo Gambino who was also cunning in how he worked his family."
"mcsheehey","10","2","5","26 May 2007"," The Best Film of All Time
","""The Godfather"" is one of those films that everybody knows about. I heard about it for the first time when I was about three years old, and finally saw it at about age thirteen, after my parents gave in. what I mean to say is that it has achieved such universal fame that it's quoted and discussed everywhere, and rightfully so.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" has it all. The cast is classic and the acting universally stellar, the shooting scenes have just the right level of intensity, the lines are all delivered with precision, the plot is enthralling, and the characters are actually interesting to watch.<br/><br/>What is the secret to the success of this great film? That's a tough question, but it's really the fact that everything about the film is done to just the right level. It's never boring, and the plot holds plot twists, but not so many that you grow suspicious of the film.<br/><br/>As I've said, the acting is exceptional. Obviously, Marlon Brando gives a legendary performance as the likable Don Vito Corleone. However, also noteworthy is James Caan's fiery performance as Sonny Corleone, and Robert Duvall' star-making work as the cool and collective Tom Hagen. The only shame about this movie is that Al Pacino didn't win an Oscar for it. His portrayal of the reluctant future godfather of the family who is eventually completely corrupted by power is pitch-perfect. The fact that Joel Grey won it instead for his clown-faced role in Cabaret is laughable and painful.<br/><br/>The bottom line is this. ""The Godfather"" will always go down in history as the greatest film of all time, and for good reason. It's ""an offer you can't refuse."""
"Robert_duder","10","2","5","19 May 2007"," REVIEW #500....a celebration of sorts on a film that is truly a classic in every sense of the word
","Ladies and gentlemen, I happen to think that this is a major milestone in my film review career. This is my 500th review on IMDb. I feel proud, I feel excited and yet now I have 1000 in my eyes and shooting for the stars. Thank you to everyone who reads and enjoys my reviews because I love watching the movies...even the bad ones...but I am excited about 2007's Summer films coming out. Live Free or Die Hard is one of my most anticipated!! To choose the film that I would bestow my 500th review on was actually very simple. I knew it had to be a classic, something perhaps controversial and to me The Godfather was the obvious choice. To some The Godfather is considered the finest film ever made...period. It might be the mostly widely accepted classic in cinema history and there is good reason behind it. The Godfather is also currently the highest rated film on IMDb (currently getting an outstanding 9.8 average.) So let's talk about The Godfather.<br/><br/>For me The Godfather is true brilliance...I won't argue with it and I came into this review determined to nit pick this classic and try to find something slightly off with it. I couldn't do it...I couldn't find a single reason why I wouldn't slap a 10/10 on this...so I did. The Godfather is far more than a 'gangster flick,' it's far beyond Goodfellas, Casino, or The Sopranos because The Godfather is a drama, a deep intense, disturbing, dark drama that draws you into this political, violent, gritty world that this family lives and breaths and has for years. You see a man who grew up in this lifestyle under the most powerful man in the underworld and yet chose to turn away from it but is almost destined to be pulled back towards it and take control of the powerful family. Every scene in The Godfather is done with the utmost care and respect, the characters are so intensely created from the smallest roles, to the biggest and you feel like you're right there. From the streets of New York, to the countryside of Sicily, from brutal murders and assassinations, to marriages, funerals, and births. The Godfather is quite simply an astounding piece of epic cinema.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando because he is Hollywood Elite certainly gets top billing for the film. I admit I have only seen Brando in a handful of films and The Godfather is the earliest work of his I have seen so I have not seen Brando in his 'classic' Hollywood roles. I just don't think Brando should have gotten top billing, that being said Marlon Brand IS The Godfather. The only problem is that throughout the film he is aged, delicate and sickly so that we don't see him in what would have been his prime and yet with every movement and word that Brando does you can envision Vito Corleone as the powerful figure he once was. Brando IS The Godfather...period. Al Pacino is the true star of this film. He brilliant creates the son of Vito Corleone Michael. As a character Michael goes through more diverse changes than anyone else. In the beginning he is a returning war hero, desperate to keep his distance from his family name and family business and yet by the end he IS The Godfather...Don Corleone and single handedly has saved his families future. Pacino is downright brilliant and I love his work but this is one of his truly best performances. Pacino was absolutely robbed by not receiving a nomination or win for this performance when Brando got both and didn't even accept it. Pacino turns in a better and more depthy performance by far. James Caan is also brilliant as the hot headed and easily angered Santino Corleone who is forced into the position of heading the family when his father is almost assassination. Caan doesn't get as much screen time as his character deserved but nonetheless makes 'Sonny' one of the most memorable characters from the film. Robert Duvall turns in probably one of the second best performances in the film as soft spoken, legally minded and intelligent Tom Hagen who tries to guide the Corleone family through the worst of times both diplomatically and strategically. He never dirties his own hands but is always willing to do what necessary to protect the family. Duvall is brilliant as well. This main cast is supported by a brilliant supporting cast including Richard S. Castellano, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, John Cazale, Al Martino, and Lenny Montana (all of these actors stand out from the enormous cast as important and well played characters.) <br/><br/>As you watch the film you might even think it's dragging a little and thinking it's a little slow but then you're so incredibly caught up in every moment and every story of this family that you're completely enthralled. Their are more brilliant and shocking scenes than almost any other film in history including...Michael's first wife's death, the horse head in the bed, the Assassination Michael performs in the Restaurant and the downright poetically disturbing murder of all the five family heads at the end. Director Francis Ford Coppola set himself apart permanently in the history of cinema by making this beautiful, gritty and quietly violent film. Mario Puzo wrote characters that have so much depth and importance and such real emotion to them. It might take awhile to get through The Godfather but every minute is worth it because this film lives up to it's powerful name and is truly worth the title of classic. 10/10<br/><br/>Keep reading my reviews and see you at 1000!!!

"ryuakamrvengeance","8","2","5","7 March 2007"," Good, but not that good
","Let me start by saying that I didn't particularly enjoy the Godfather. I found the film too slow paced, and James Caan was extremely irritable. Vito took FOREVER to recover, and when he did he choked it not long later.<br/><br/>Saying that, I respect the film and Coppola on the effort and technical prowess on show. Al Pacino is brilliant, if a little predictable, while Robert Duvall steals the spotlight if you ask me, with a truly masterful performance.<br/><br/>The final scene will always be remembered, and for good reason, its artistically genius, but I won'y give it away.<br/><br/>This film isn't for everyone, so don't worry if you think you oughta enjoy it just because it's ranked number 1 in the top 250. Just remember that films are always about opinion, and there can never be justifiable official ""Greatest Movie"", so if you don't like it fine, don't let other people hound you down just because they insist that it's the perfect film, because as far as I'm concerned, there can never be a perfect film.<br/><br/>As Peter Griffin once said, ""It insists upon itself Louis""."
"Chris_Docker","9","2","5","23 December 2006"," An offer you can't refuse
","Taking the old-fashioned gangster film to new heights, The Godfather used traditional story-telling freed from the strict censorship that meant bad guys always got their come-uppance. More film noir than thriller, there are no good guys, and we meditate on the small rays of hope within the darkness of corruption, or wonder how far our good and pleasant lifestyles are supported, at some level, by corruption.<br/><br/>In dark, Rembrandt-like backrooms, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and his family grant favours, blessings, and generally run things for their friends out in the real, bright and beautiful world. A bride's father traditionally grants any wish, and petitions come from far and wide as Don Corleone's daughter has a colourful wedding celebration outside.<br/><br/>It's 1945. Things are changing. Narcotics is the big new industry that beckons temptingly, and one in which the other mafia families have already started. Don Corleone is cautious, but his competitors are envious of the control he has over the police and the judges and want him in. Before long, bloody warfare between the gangs ensues.<br/><br/>The Godfather continually contrasts dark and light, external show with violent murky depths, and the devoutness of the gangsters is emphasised. One sequence has a scene of a family baptism intercut with brutal killings ordered by the head of the gang (who is in church). Further similarities to the Roman Catholic Spanish Inquisition might be inferred from a scene immediately afterwards where a confession is obtained from a double-crossing gang member - he is promised redemption but executed anyway.<br/><br/>The double nature of the main characters is convincingly emphasised as we watch Don Corleone play with his grandson in the garden, or his successor Michael (Al Pacino) enjoy the idyllic countryside of Sicily. It is taken to a new level when, in a different situation, he tells a blatant lie compellingly and lovingly to his wife so she doesn't think him a murderer. His gentleness goes hand in hand with his brutal nature.<br/><br/>The Godfather catapulted the career of the young Francis Coppola and revitalised the career of Marlon Brando. A masterpiece of restrained film-making, its biggest fault may be that there are so many characters and details to absorb in the complex family plots for a first viewing.<br/><br/>In a conference over whether to deal in narcotics, one of the arguments that sways the day is that if they don't control them, someone else will step in and do so. By dealing in narcotics at the most powerful level, they can keep them away from children. An argument that should perhaps be given greater consideration by legislators.<br/><br/>If anyone has ever made you 'an offer you couldn't refuse', this is the film that created and popularised the phrase. It was meant quite literally."

"dunmore_ego","10","2","5","5 July 2006"," The Godfather Of Them All
","It has been over three decades since its birth, yet *The Godfather* reigns as the yardstick by which all other gangster movies are brutally scrutinized.<br/><br/>Only twice has its proprietary mien been challenged - with Scorcese's gutshock *Goodfellas* in 1990 and David Chase's superlative *The Sopranos* in 1999. Everything else runs a far, far fourth behind these juggernauts.<br/><br/>From Mario Puzo's book of the same name, Francis Ford Coppolla directs the legendary story of an East Coast crime lord, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in the eponymous role), grooming his eldest son, Santino ""Sonny"" (James Caan) to take over the Family Business, that being, one arm of the Italian ""Five Families"" who run the Eastern seaboard's organized crime. When Sonny is brutally gunned down in an inter-familial dispute, Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), who sought a life removed from the Family's ""business,"" ultimately discovers his familial and business instincts and steps into the breach to take the reins.<br/><br/>Like the movie itself, its characters have weathered the three decades to become icons by which all other movie gangsters are measured; most of the actors in these staggering roles never quite shaking off the specter of their characters  which will surely haunt them far past their own deaths.<br/><br/>These archetypes have become so ingrained in our culture that it is almost impossible to think back to a time when they did not exist; like trying to imagine a world before *Smoke On The Water*, or *Star Wars.* Very simply, if not for *The Godfather* these archetypes would not be archetypes. The movie actually influenced real crime families with its new street vernacular (""Make him an offer he can't refuse"") and manner of conducting ""business"" (that of regarding any means to achieve an end as honorable  as long as the good of The Family was invoked).<br/><br/>The greatest gift *The Godfather* bequeathed the movie-going public was its unapologetic stance on anti-social behavior. Beyond ""Man with No Name"" protocol  where a lone stranger would operate by his own rules, disregarding anyone else's well-being for his own ends - here was a FAMILY, an organized para-militia of sociopaths who followed principles wildly at odds with ""normal"" society's. Yet Puzo, Coppolla and actors boldly offer no excuses as to their characters' existence, motives or actions. After our Gangster 101 schooling with James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson and George Raft, here was a blood-driven, wealth-engined world only hinted at in those previous gangster genre movies, now fleshed out almost against our will; here was a world where our societal notions of right and wrong were utterly reversed, yet which made sense in the verisimilitude of its own universe.<br/><br/>Searing with grand irony, the first line of dialog in *The Godfather* is, ""I believe in America."" <br/><br/>And indeed, these characters are not mindless convenience store hijack artists  they are businessmen in the truest sense of the word. They are also imbued with a strong sense of loyalty and justice. Though *The Godfather* may seem apologist in its stance towards supposedly heartless criminals, telling the tale from *their* point of view allows us freedom from guilt when we realize that ""crime"" is a subjective term. As Don Corleone states, when opting not to murder molesters, but rather land them in hospital like their victim, ""We're not murderers."" <br/><br/>No matter they dabbled in gambling, prostitution, money-laundering and murder, they sought only to be self-sufficient, to keep their families well, and to live comfortably in peace - otherwise called The American Dream.<br/><br/>In setting the tale in the 1940s, Puzo and Coppolla removed us from everyday reality from the outset; in this insular universe we readily accepted The Family's version of morality. It was no stretch to dovetail the authorities' actions in the film with our suspected perception of them in our reality. Matter of fact, it seemed to vindicate our darkest suspicions that the people whom we place our unmitigated trust in for safety from society's savage shadow dwellers are in cahoots with those very shadow dwellers who are trying to subvert our safety.<br/><br/>There are scenes that will be burned forever into your mind's movie wall: the opening tableau of the Godfather presiding at his desk; the head of racehorse Khartoum in Jack Woltz's bed; Michael gunning down the police captain; Carlo Rizzo being bitch-whipped by Sonny; the slaying of Sonny; even seemingly-benign scenes like Moe Greene's meeting with Michael, where he claps his hands together and exclaims, ""You goddam guineas really make me laugh!""  the subsequent bullet through his eye is another mind-burner; and the grand ""cleansing""  scenes of the East Coast bosses being killed systematically juxtaposed over Michael renouncing Satan at his god-daughter's baptism <br/><br/>Through it all runs the unbreakable thread of Family. The opening wedding scene ends on a poignant note of a father dancing with his daughter. Harking back to the familial theme constantly, Coppolla reaffirms our deepest vicarious desires. We are all immigrants to some extent, the bonds of our heritages displaced, fragmented, growing weaker over every generation of X-Box and internet junkies; there seems nothing that can bind the strands of our familial threads. We find affinity in the blood bonds of *The Godfather*, on some level deeper than the span of oceans and the passage of time.<br/><br/>(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)"

Having seen the complete film, but only in segments, watching it from beginning to end, i found myself enjoying this classic film, but often getting board at the same time.<br/><br/>The problem with the film, (if you could call it a problem) is that, its mostly talk. Sure, there's the ocasional gun play, or graphic scene (the horse head is classic) but, compared to scarface, goodfellas, and even the sopranos, it lags by comparison. People want to have a good story and godfather delivers up an offer you cant refuse (im sorry i had to say it), but, its just dull in spots compared to other gangster classics.<br/><br/>Overall i found godfather to be a prime example of storytelling and acting, and it deserves every award and honor its receved, but in my book, it fails to over throw the don of gansta films, Scarface (1983)"

YOU TAPE YOUR NAME IN HISTORY DEAR FRANCIS."
"MaxBorg89","10","2","5","14 March 2006"," Watching this timeless masterpiece is an offer no one can refuse
","Most critics say it's Citizen Kane. Someone mentions Casablanca. Most people in the world, though, think Francis Ford Coppola's gangster story The Godfather is the finest film ever made. It is a tough one to call, and even if I have to say I prefer Casablanca, Coppola's crime opus is a very close runner-up, its greatness being untarnished after all these years. <br/><br/>This epic masterpiece takes place in New York, early '50s. It begins with an ever memorable scene: Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) listens to complaints from one of his associates and, while stroking his cat, accepts to do this man a favor. It's something which reoccurs during the day, since it's part of any Sicilian's code of honor not to refuse any favor on his daughter's wedding day. And whenever asked to do something about any problem, the Don makes ""offers that can't be refused"". It's that kind of attitude which has brought him where he is currently: at the top of the Mafia's power chain. He controls all illegal business in the whole state, and he's ably supported by his lawyer, and adopted son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and two of his biological off-springs, the passionate Santino aka Sonny (James Caan) and the more rational Michael (Al Pacino). The latter is actually a bit reluctant to be involved with the family business, but when other families start attempting on his father's life, he's forced to help his mother and brothers restore order in town.<br/><br/>What I've just summed up isn't but a small part of the film (it's almost three hours long, and I've described approximately the first 30 minutes), which is also partially set in Sicily. The Italian segment is the most poetic and romantic in the entire film, as we witness Michael's first dealings with true love. How come he's in Sicily at some point in the film, I can't reveal. But let me assure you, you'll definitely want to visit those places once you've seen the film. The landscape is a visual delight, and Nino Rota's score contributes a lot to making the movie in its entirety an unmissable gem.<br/><br/>Since The Godfather deals with organized crime, however, it can't be all pretty countryside and romantic moments. Once you have absolute power, you have to fight in order to preserve it, and that's gonna require quite some violence. Don Vito knows this like no one else, and Michael will learn the lesson when it comes to him to run the family.<br/><br/>That's an important theme: family. Behind all its brutality, The Godfather is a remarkable example of how important your own flesh and blood is. It's probably not a coincidence that the film opens with a wedding, when the entire Corleone dynasty is united, and that one of the Top 10 sequences is the one where, during a break from everything underworld-related, Clemenza (Richard Castellano) teaches Michael how to cook pasta sauce, only to be interrupted by Sonny. It's a funny and simple scene, and maybe that's why people still have fond memories of it.<br/><br/>Coppola has made a magnificent Italian-American tragedy, perfectly written, directed and most of all acted. Where would much of the movie's greatness be without Brando's immortal, Oscar-winning patriarch? And what about Pacino, Caan and Duvall, all nominated for their fundamental contributions? It's largely thanks to them that The Godfather remains the gangster opus to top them all."
"PWNYCNY","10","2","5","13 November 2005"," A study in social pathology
","A man immigrants to the United States from Italy and has three sons - the oldest is intellectually deficient, the second is a temperamental bully and hothead, and the third, seems well adjusted and normal. Yet looks can be deceiving, for it is the third son, Michael, who is actually more cunning and more depraved than his two older brothers and proves it. Michael is a merchant of death cloaked in the regalia of middle-class civility which makes him even more lethal. Michael never loses his temper; he dresses impeccably; he's a highly decorated army veteran and has an admiring wife, all of which is mere window dressing masking a viciousness and brutality that is without limit. And what is it that Michael wants? Only to protect his family from ""enemies"" who want to destroy his family. Except the enemies are of Michael's making. Al Pacino's portrayal of the sinister Michael Corleone is one of the great and classic performances in the history of movie making. Mr. Pacino fully and effectively projects every nuance of Michael's distorted and depraved character, from his predatory nature as a merciless and cold blooded killer who shoots two men at point-blank range with whom he is having dinner; to his hypocritical flaunting of religion such as using the baptism of his son as a cover while ordering the assassination of some of his supposed ""enemies""; to his blatant dishonesty such as when he lies right to his wife's face; and to his decision to wantonly murder his own brother-in-law, and thereby make his sister a grieving widow. Marlon Brando got top billing for this movie, but it was Al Pacino who is the real star."

All of Michael's family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo is looking for Mafia Families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don's lawyer Tom Hagen, the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart.<br/><br/>This film is a work of art that remains to this day one of the the best film ever made.<br/><br/>10/10(i wish that i can give it higher)"

Well, that's how I interpret the fact it has been on the top of IMDb since I've looked in here for the first time. What makes it so flawless, what contributes to its eternal shining, blah blah. Maybe it's high time for a change, I'm sure a lot of cult classics have been released since The Godfather has been released. Oh well...<br/><br/>I don't like The Godfather. I simply don't feel this movie. Yes it's gloomy, yes it's about mafia's dirty deeds, and oh yes it's about being a part of a family. And of course it's about Kleenex in Marlon's mouth, and Pacino's hands kissed by sad Italians. However I have a feeling that this movie has spawned a countless number of mafia movies, recycling the same themes and Robert De Niro, and furthermore movies like 60 Seconds or Ronin or The Italian Job, which are merely about how cool is it to be a gangster.

"zooropa-2","10","2","5","24 April 2005"," The Greatness of the Godfather
","During a normal day in the life, a daughter is getting married, which should be the most proud time for a father. It should be the day when it is all about getting together with the family and enjoy the just married couple... yet Don Corleone has some business to attend to, and during this wedding he offers his help to many people, who needs justice the hard way. Vito Corleone has under-the-table-deals which are just as important to him as protecting his family. The opening scene is about twenty minutes long, where the Godfather setting is established. The raw criminal life of gangsters who must take care of the family as well as the family business. A great bunch of stories are entwined in this movie - stories about family(especially father and son), tradition, criminal life, power, all perfectly combined into one great story about the Godfather. It's well instructed, especially the scene where the Corleones are killing the leaders of the 5 families... it's a robotism, but with the sad church choir music and all the killings going on at the same time, it all seems pretty much like a requiem... Marlon Brando's performance as Vito is outstanding but so is Al Pacino as the son Michael. The movie is filled with great acting which includes Robert Duvall's work as Tom Hagen. The greatness about the Godfather is, that it's a perfectly combined story and very well directing as well! Francis Ford Coppola knows exactly how long a scene should last in order to give all the actors the time they need to show how they master their roles. This is not boring, but on the other hand very exciting as it gives the movie quite an artistic perspective. It goes from being a great movie into being beyond great.. It's a cultural and intelligent masterpiece that takes a lot of patience though but what art doesn't require patience?.... bad art!"
"a15haddad","10","2","5","15 February 2005"," Quite possibly the greatest motion picture ever made
","The Godfather. So much praise has been showered upon it, forming a large mountain of critical excellence. It is almost difficult to quantify how many levels this movie succeeds on. I hesitate to even call this a ""movie"" because it is from the time when a movie was an artform. Sadly, these movies are now a dying breed. The Godfather is THE PINNACLE of excellence on the big screen. <br/><br/>You all know that it is a story of the Corleone Family, a large Sicilian Mafia syndicate living in New York and led by Vito Corleone, who is played perfectly by Marlon Brando (I will talk about this a bit later), a powerful Don who demands respect and friendship and offers favors in return. No movie has come close to this one in giving a portrait to organized crime. Not in terms of pure realism or insight, understand. Goodfellas, a great movie in its own right, is a much more realistic story of the way gangsters operate. The Godfather is a glorified Sicilian Mafia tale spun by Mario Puzo and later translated to film by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, showing the near fall from power of the family. <br/><br/>The Godfather portrays so many different moral questions and considerations: how can power corrupt a man, how things look from different perspectives, is a man allowed to live outside of society, can a man reject society without punishment and live by his own laws, should someone be true to their family or to society, and much more. The result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.<br/><br/>To be fair, a healthy portion of this movie's outward success is due to its acting. Never before and never again has there been such a powerful joint acting performance. It's almost insane to think about how amazing it was, how amazing and influential this entire movie is. Most great movies have one memorable acting performance, two if they are lucky. Four actors- Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall- are best known for their work in the Godfather, the latter three using this title as a springboard to fame. All four acting performances, playing Vito, Michael, and Sonny Corleone plus the Consigliere Tom Hagen, are among the best ever. Along with this, Vito Corleone is probably the most prominent figure in the public's mind when it comes to movies. His raspy voice has become the stuff of legends, and has been imitated by almost everyone at one point or another. <br/><br/>Here I will explain why classic movies in general are far superior to today's critical masterpieces. Many people find the Godfather too slow for their tastes. While opinions are different and I do not get mad at people who find other great movies to be superior to the Godfather, people who ridicule this film to be outwardly slow quite frankly do not have long enough attention spans. This is an epic. we are talking slow corruption for maximum effect. Slow unfolding to make it seem more real, not sudden jerks of the plot but carefully constructed twists that are slowly built up and make perfect sense upon further thought. Not to mention that the cinematography is absolutely chilling. Watch the baptism scene and you will know what I mean.<br/><br/>This motion picture also features what is considered by many as the single most powerful scene in movie history- I won't spoil anything, but you will know it when you see it. Not to mention the wonderful soundtrack, an instantly memorable score that does a lot to help the film.<br/><br/>But by saying that I betray the true beauty of this film. The most prominent reason for this movie's place at the top of the all-time greats is that most movies have a few scenes that stand out when you remember them. Everybody immediately knows what they are afterward. Empire Strikes Back has the final battle with Vader. Rocky has the run up the steps. All of these are obvious. But, while perhaps the scene mentioned above is a bit more prominent, every single scene is done with such consistency and perfection. Coppola is simply a genius, or at least was in the 1970s. There are absolutely no hitches in the screenplay. Every scene is equally intense. But the paradox of this is that not only will you be hanging on to every word and totally absorbed into the story your first time, The Godfather gets better every time you watch it! The first time I saw this, I had not been as exposed to the greatest movies ever. I didn't truly understand all the moral depths of this story, but I still thought it amazing simply for the intensity of the scenes, plot, and the wonderful balance between the characters. However, after watching it dozens of times afterward I now understand all of the tiny stuff in the plot that make it what it truly is. All of the quotes and tiny little things about it are simply fantastic. Once again, in this space I cannot explain all of the greatness. I have not even gotten into the plot. To close, every single thing about this movie just absolutely screams quality. It's hard to find any significant weaknesses with this film, except that unlike the book it does not show the perspective from an outsider's point of view, such as the novel did with Kay Adams. But that is simply a tiny nitpick that we would not mention about any other movie. The effort put into everything else is what makes this visible. Everything else- perfection. If you have not seen The Godfather, DO SO NOW! It will stimulate your mind and emotions like no other movie ever filmed before. This is simply the quintessential film experience. 9.8.<br/><br/>""I never listened to the big shots holding all the strings. But I hoped that someday you would be the one holding on the strings."""
"TheNorthernMonkee","10","2","5","8 July 2004"," An apology to F.F.Coppola
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>For the sake of a personal confession, this review of the Godfather is not as neutral and objective as it should be. For that I apologise, but with good reason.<br/><br/>In August 2003, after watching ""The Godfather"" in what I assume now must have been a tired state, I condemned and criticised this film for being overrated, drawn out and dull. Today on the eighth of July 2004, I apologise for such a flawed review. ""The Godfather"", whilst still perhaps not worthy of it's number one slot, is one of the best films ever created.<br/><br/>In this film, we are introduced to the Corleone family. The story starts at the wedding of Connie Corleone to Carlo Rizzi. As is tradition amongst Sicillian families, Connie's father, The Godfather, Don Vito Corleone hands out favours to those who respectfully ask for his help. At the wedding as well are the Don's other children, Fredo (John Cazale), the violent Sonny (James Caan) and the youngest, the war hero, Michael (Al Pacino). Over two and a half hours of film later and the lives of Vito and his family are changed forever as this one Gangland family fights with external and internal problems.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" is a beautiful piece of cinema. With the late Marlon Brando putting in a fine performance as Vito, the film had a figurehead character. Ultimately however, it is Al Pacino who deserves most praise. Rarely can there be shown in a film such a dramatic change in a character over such a space of time. Going from a law abiding war hero returning from the Second World War with medals and a beautiful wife, Pacino's Michael gradually changes in appearance and style as he takes his place at the head of the family. Everything about him is designed to show the change in his character. His hair changes style, his clothes change style, even his face changes mannerisms (although partly due to his jaw being broken by a corrupt police chief). Pacino as Michael demonstrates just how truely awesome an actor he is.<br/><br/>The acting alone is not just what makes this film great. The way in which characters are added and removed from the story is clever. Nobody is too good a character to be written out and everybody is given a chance to play a key role in the events.<br/><br/>The musical direction of ""The Godfather"" is another part of it's beauty. As well as the obvious piece of music which everyone is aware of, the ways in which sound is used to keep our attention at times is superb. The background music and the location from Michael's time in Italy is beautiful. All in all, there's nothing which can be faulted.<br/><br/>When I originally wrote a review for this film last year, I complained of how it was overrated and dull, that is a mistake I now regret. ""The Godfather"" is a beautiful film that I might not necessarily place at number one in the internet movie database all time list, but which I can see why it is there. This film is a piece which everyone should be forced to watch and a piece which, if they pay attention to it, they will love."

Marlon Brando, with cotton stuffed in his mouth, gives yet another ridiculous scenery chewing performance as Don Corleone-the cat sitting in his lap was more interesting. The rest of the cast doesn't fare much better. This is one boring-assed movie. A lot of hand kissing, '40s automobiles, ""family values"", and the most lazy and repetitive score I've ever heard.

","The Godfather is not only the greatest movie ever made but can arguably be considered one of the best acting movies also.  Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert DuVall give mesmorizing performances in this classic about the inside of the crime organization known as the Corleone family. But it also tells the tale of Michael Corleone(played by Al Pacino) who, at the beginning, attempts to get away from the family business and move on his own.  But as the movies progresses, Michael becomes more and more attached to the family, and eventually becoming the successor to his father, Vito Corleone.  The Godfather is filled with a great storyline, beautiful acting, and a gruesome showing of the crime family."

The Godfather has been labeled a `guy's film' and I am generally inclined to disagree based on the fact that I am obsessed with it.  However, upon further reflection, I have to give some credence to this theory since A) My tastes are atypical, B) While most of my friends worship this film as well, they are all guys and C)  It was a virtual testosterone fest at the theater. <br/><br/>Regardless, it's a great film and should be viewed at least once in one's lifetime.

","Well.... I finally got to look at the IMDB voters n°1 movie, the almighty Godfather.<br/><br/>Though it's very far from being an average movie, and I admit I was rather immersed in the story, well... I've seen many better movies than this one, whatever angle I choose: story, screenplay, acting, direction, camera, moral points, invention, anything. I don't get its n°1 rating. I suspect many people praise it out of mere conformism.<br/><br/>Most of Kubrick's movies are better than this, a couple of Polanski's ones too, just to name a few. Other great classics like ""12 angry men"" or ""Network"" easily surpasses ""The Gofdfather"" both artistically and technically by a fair margin, not to mention more courageous, independant works like ""Brazil"" or ""Citizen Kane"".<br/><br/>Excellent movie, for sure, but best movie?

The three scenes I love more than ever are Michael's revenge in the restaurant (greatest scene of all time!), when Michael realises from the panic in his bodyguard's face as he runs off that Apollonia is in danger and when Sonny beats up Calo and finishes him in the gutter.

Young Pacino was at his very best. I don't want to start naming the actors, because all of them put in their best performance. Few men and women that had appeared in this production had ever made a more impressive performance. If there is any fault with the movie it would be the violence. I don't think that the subject could be relayed with any less and still depict the type of people being presented.

The winner of 3 Academy Awards including Best Picture of 1972 and Best Actor, The Godfather is indeed a film that any movie fanatic should see because it contains a brilliant script, powerful acting, and wonderful direction. One of my favorite lines from this film is ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" spoken by Don Corleone, signifying the power of the mob and what it can do to get what it wants.

","The Godfather is the ultimate example of how to adapt a book into a film. Mario Puzo's novel was extremely readable, but didn't seem to lend itself to cinema. It consisted of a whole slew of sub-books, each about a different character, each totally different in feel, each containing pages and pages of backstory and history. Add to this a high quotient of sex and violence, and only the fact that it was selling copiously convinced studio executives to touch it with a ten-foot pole.<br/><br/>It's a good thing they did, because I don't know of any other case where so much has come from so little. Everybody is perfectly cast, from Brando down the the most minute walk-on. No punches are pulled with bringing the book's content to the screen, the production design creates a perfect-looking world for it to take place in, the cinematography captures that world beautifully, and the score emotionally underscores it all magnificently.<br/><br/>This truly is one of the medium's pillars."

Whilst standing vigil with a nervous (!) friend of his fathers on the hospital steps he lights the other man's cigarette.  He seems to be taken back either by just how relaxed HE is or possibly something more deeper comparing the opening/closing of the lighter to the motion made by the trigger of a gun.<br/><br/>Also note a moment shortly after this, following a punch he receives from a corrupt policeman, leaving him with a swollen jaw.  Michael Corleone sits amongst family and friends plotting the murder of two threats to the family business.

"Aidan McGuinness","Null","2","5","27 February 2002"," Very-well made but -shock- it's all a tad dull
","I really like the movie that was temporarily #1 - ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". I agree with a lot of what's in the charts though think some films here are over-rated. And this is what I felt about ""The Godfather"". It's very well made, etc. but it's also a bit boring.<br/><br/>On a production level, it's hard to fault ""The Godfather"" and Coppola's handling of events. There's an intense level of detail, as he charts the rise of Vito Corleone to prominence, and the lengths people go to attain power. The direction is great - there's a real sense of epic-ness here. The city and times seem alive before you. There's a great sense of realism - helped, for example, by the use of speaking Italian in the movies because - hey Hollywood - not everyone would want to, or choose to, constantly speak English. It's rich and lush and has a quality nearly all films lack nowadays in their haste to please the lowest-common-denominator.<br/><br/>The acting is spot on. In fact it's probably above that. It's excellent. Pacino is at his height here - wonderful as the naive Michael Corleone who has to learn the family trade. Marlon Brando's ""Vito Corleone"" has become so infamous that seeing him is almost like watching a caricature (as are many of the lines) but he's on fine form, though I preferred his fresher, more engaging role in ""On the Waterfront"".<br/><br/>And yet for all the unquestionable production values and acting... I found it all a tad dull. I don't have an aversion to the genre - ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Sopranos"" are superb - but I found the pacing slow, almost monotonous in places. There is an attention to detail, and an epic scope, but that doesn't necessarily translate to interesting viewing. ""Lawrence of Arabia"" dragged me into the sweeping sands, yet I wasn't dragged in here to anything approaching the same degree. There's character development but, as we touch up and down upon certain moments in the lives of the Corleones, we're never given any sense of more fluid developments. We see their actions from a distance and find it harder to empathise or care about them. It all adds up to a muted viewing experience for me, and I felt indifferent to his hailed classic.<br/><br/>I can't knock ""The Godfather"" too much, because it has a lot going for it. As one reviewer commented it, even those who don't like it feel forced to rate it highly because they must acknowledge the craftsmanship here. For all that I was quite disappointed by this movie and can only give it 8/10 (and that's because of the talent involved). The ""sequel"" was better, but not by much. Not deserving of #1 in my opinion."
"tveitlan","10","2","5","21 April 2003"," A divine masterpiece of acting and directing...
","When I first saw The Godfather I sat speechless for about 15 mins. The movie just took my breath away. Watching the whole gang, Brando, Duvall, Pacino, Caan and the others, you just, for a few hours, forget you are watching a movie. You are sucked into their world of intrigues, love-affairs and family-business. If there is some out there who hasn't seen the movie, for some VERY strange reason, I can guarantee you, that you have missed out on the greatest movie of all time. Sure Citizen Kane was great, and so was The Shawshank Redemption, but let's be real... There is NO comparison to The Godfather.

","This is the one. There is no other. No other gangster film can come close to the power that is the Godfather. The original gangster films like Public Enemy and Little Caesar can't add up to the masterpiece of the Godfather. Equal to the movie Boogie Nights, the Godfather is about family! True, you got the mob relations like Boogie Nights deals with the Porn Industry, but it has nothing to do with it. The main issue of both films is family.<br/><br/>The struggle of the family within the family. Watch and see how Michael runs the family different that how his father did.

"holigor","8","2","5","27 September 1999"," there is a mystery about this film
","Being without doubt a quality movie (good plot, good acting, good directing) it is mysterious however why it is considered by many people to be the best ever made. The origin of this mystery needs some exploration. <br/><br/>I think that technically the film is pretty well made although not without a flaw. I knew the great Nino Rota's melody long before I saw this movie and I was amazed how it was wasted in the film. Just an intermezzo??? And horribly performed...  <br/><br/>I can suggest two reasons for the too high rating. 1. Americans adore their Mafia. And the film appeals to the desire of a simple man to imagine himself a deadly hero. That would explain also why it does not touch me too much. 2. The film was innovative in the time it appeared in manner I don't understand. Perhaps there were some cinematographic tricks that were revolutionary at the time and used in every other film since (that would explain why we do not see them). <br/><br/>Godfather II impressed me much more because it goes against the first of the mentioned above reasons. No romanticism of the vengeance, no protection of the family any more. I think it was very courageous to show the bare face of Mafia in the country that adored it.  Deadly businessmen of the Godfather II are really horrifying. <br/><br/>I cannot comment on suggestion number 2. But it any case that reason can have only historical significance.<br/><br/>My rating for the film is 8 of 10."
"DanB-4","10","2","5","27 August 1999"," A Landmark Picture
","(WARNING: Plot Spoilers)<br/><br/>
If you have not seen the Godfather, do yourself a favour - skip my comments, and rent it today! I have seen this movie too many times to comment without giving away key elements.<br/><br/>This movie is a cinematic landmark - one of the great achievements of the 20th century. From its quiet opening in Vito Corleone's office, with the the blubbering appeal of Amerigo Bonasera (""Make them suffer as I have suffered"") to the closing of that same office door at the end, when Kaye comes to grips with the man she married, every frame of this film is filled with intrigue, images and treachery.<br/><br/>You cannot view this film and judge its morality - it has none. It told entirely on its own terms. All the main characters are career criminals and the only law enforcement office in the movie is a corrupt cop protecting a drug dealer. To watch the movie, you have to accept its terms. If you do, you will be in for an experience of a lifetime.<br/><br/>The wedding scene at the beginning is brilliant. Slowly but surely, all the characters are introduced, while at the same time, we get bits of information on their personalities and foreshadowing of future events. Note some of the payoffs that this scene sets up. That Paulie Gatto is a traitor (""If this was someone else's wedding). That Bonasera the undertaker will owe the Don a service, to hide his son's massacre from his wife. That the plea of Johnny Fontaine for a movie role will result in him reluctantly agreeing to perform at a casino for the family. And of course, there is the introduction of the fearsome Luca Brasi.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando makes this movie great. Don Corleone is arguably the most famous and most imitated character in movie history. The accent, the hand gestures, the sly smile he give Solozzo are  all a credit to an acting genius.<br/><br/>The score by Fellini composer Nino Rota is one of the creepiest and most famous in film history. It complements the film rather than overpowers it, and gives the Godfather its unique quality. Gordon Willis' cinematography can only be described as perfect.<br/><br/>The movie ends with the famous ""baptism scene"" in which Michael renounces Satan while executing all of his enemies - the baptism is the perfect alibi. In this scene, we learn how Michael views himself - a man in perfect control over his own world, above the law of both man and God. Truly fascinating.<br/><br/>The Godfather also contains my single favourite line in movie history, spoken by Clemenza after the murder of Paulie Gatto: ""Leave the gun. Take the canoli.""<br/><br/>I like Part II even more, because the plot is more involving and the flashback scenes to the rise of Vito Corleone are the best cinematic work ever (imho). Needless to say, these movies are numbers 1 & 2 on my all-time list.<br/><br/>For me, this is a perfect motion picture. **** out of ****."

","well, i worked in a video store for five years and for five years everyone nagged me to see 'the godfather' and for whatever reason it simply never interested me. i love films but wouldn't consider myself a pedant who nitpicks about minor details. a film doesn't have to be entirely perfect for me to enjoy it or feel that it was worthwhile to watch. i like to get lost in a film when i watch it. be it a quick comedy or an epic saga. there are films that have plenty of continuity errors and even bits of really bad acting, and i've watched them several times, because it's a satisfying experience. well, i finally watched the godfather tonight. i finally felt ready to watch it without bias and without towing all the talk and hype behind it into the experience (well, i did the best i could to start with a clean slate, but couldn't always succeed. for example, i'm sure the horse head in the bed at the beginning would have been more shocking and effective if i hadn't heard that scene referenced thousands of times). overall, i have to say that i really wasn't very impressed, and, even before i remembered that it was, in fact, based on a book, i was left with that empty sensation of too much missing information and imbalance of characters that sadly happens with too many adaptations. also -- and as i said, i don't deliberately go seeking out errors, especially during a first viewing, but... -- the editing in so many parts was really bad enough to take away from the movie experience. it was difficult to pay attention to the dialogue because the cut-to's during some of the conversations were so blatantly recorded at different times that i forgot about my own involvement in the film and instead had to sit through these confusing cuts. likewise with the 40's atmosphere. i'll bring 'the hype' into the argument for a moment here to comment only in retrospection, but for all the talk of how classic and what a masterpiece this film is, i would have thought it to be more... i don't know... scrutinised? and there were just too many times when i would find myself involved in a scene, drawn in, convinced, fully attentive, and then there would be a completely random cut, even dialogue cut in mid-sentence when fading to the next scene. so strange. parts gave me the impression of watching a well-financed, well-meaning rough draft. all that said, some of the acting, not all, but some, was in fact, first rate. Marlon Brando really didn't convince me. he was good. but nothing special, i'm almost sorry to say. the wife (i forget her name) who was married at the beginning, she always seemed really out of place and ... i can't quite put my finger on it, but her fits just didn't flow with the film. i thought James Caan did a great job. i've only ever seen him in 'thief' and 'bottle rocket,' so i can't really make any worthy comparisons with other performances. but his hot-headedness was convincing enough. Robert Duvall was great. i didn't recognise him for almost the first half of the film. another acting gem for me was Al Pacino. he, too, i didn't recognise at the beginning of the film. for a few moments i mistook him for Adrian Brody, even though i knew that was impossible. but i was immediately drawn in by ""Michael's"" performance. every gesture and every word was electric. it took me about twenty minutes to realise that i was watching Al Pacino. then, furthermore, i was really impressed by the evolution of his character. that's one thing i think they really nailed solid with this film, from Pacino's acting to the storyline and editing and everything all rolled into one. i came away entirely convinced and ruminating on the life and thoughts of this character. i watched and admired the power he carried in his manner even when he was, in the beginning, insofar as the bloody family business was concerned, innocent. then saw that power unfold and transform itself until, in the end, he was finally consumed by the corruption inherent in the prioritisation of his blood-family's honour. however, apart from this character and a few other performances, there really wasn't enough ""meat"" to this movie to make me want to see it again. i'm curious about the sequel(s), to see where the story goes. but by the end of this first viewing i was mostly just wondering who was going to die next, and i didn't really care. i was plenty intrigued by Michael, but i felt like i was mostly sticking around to see who would be left standing by the time the credits rolled. maybe the whole mafia style depiction thing just isn't enough for me to be able to sympathise or feel anything when the next trench coat gets strangled or shot or stabbed. so, overall, there were indeed a very few classic moments, and some of the acting was really well performed. but on the whole it just didn't chalk up to much for me, least of all a masterpiece."

","A cure for Insomnia, a boring movie. Not worthy of being labelled ""great""."
"Jacques98","10","3","10","3 March 2009"," The irony of being pretentious.
","There is one thing that I've rarely heard anyone point out about the generic list of ""BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME"". You know what they are. No matter what organization or website lists them, the list is almost always the same. And the one thing that the supposed elite movies of all time share in common: As far as story, they're all average. Not a single one of them has even a single scene of outstanding originality, or even flirts with it, for that matter. They're all generic paint-by-the-number dramas filled with pretty moving pictures and filled with people who can pretend to be someone else fairly well. But as far as story goes, these movies are all empty. There are a few exceptions—Star Wars, Pulp Fiction, a couple others—but that is a standard rule. The obsession with unoriginality that the pretentious men and women who chose what films are the best has always bothered me. And what better illustrates this than The Godfather? It is nothing but a generic crime drama, yet it's considered one of the greatest movies of all time? Something just seems wrong with that. Something seems wrong with the idea that the men who truly stand up and make original cinema get pushed to hell by critics, while a generic crime movie sits on the throne of God.<br/><br/>Perhaps the perfect-scored reviews of The Godfather are right. On a technical level, on a storytelling level, on an acting level, The Godfather is perfection. The directing and production value so far surpasses everything from the early 70s, it's almost unbelievable. The storytelling is done flawlessly. I cannot think of a single 70s film where every single kill has so much value and weight. The acting is the stuff of legends. I will give The Godfather all of this credit, because it earns it. But . . .<br/><br/>But none of that dismisses the fact that it is still simply a generic crime drama. No matter how well-done this story is told, it's a story that you've heard long before it was released. Unlike the modern gangster cinema, such as Ichi the Killer or Reservoir Dogs, The Godfather offers nothing new, even for its time. I understand that those examples I just listed are both meant to be taken as over-the-top and unrealistic, but my point still stands. People have created far more original and entertaining crime dramas than The Godfather. There is one subplot that I give this film some creative credit for—the horse—but beside that, this is just copy/paste plotting. If they had used the creativity of this scene more often throughout the movie, this truly would deserve the over-hyped credit it gets. Just because something is realistic does not mean it has to be unoriginal. Personally, I am Italian, and I have heard hundreds of real-life mob stories from my cousins, and they're all infinitely more interesting/creative than anything this film even touched. There is no excuse for The Godfather being as dry as it is.<br/><br/>Some will argue that The Godfather is meant to be a drama about family life, not a thriller about crime. If that is true, and it may hold some truth, then The Godfather excels. Somewhat. As far as realistic emotion of family life, it's pretty solid and mildly cliché-defying. But it's nothing you haven't seen before, and seen with more compelling presentation.<br/><br/>The other major flaw that is inevitable to ignore is the pure boredom that sets in every thirty minutes. I've read reviews stating that this modern generation simply can't relate to gangster films, thus it's boring. I've read reviews stating that the plot is generic, thus it's boring. Etc., etc., etc. All these may be valid reasons, but I think the point is this: The Godfather IS boring. It's filled with pointless conversation scenes that add nothing to the overall film or the generic plot or the drama, so what's the point of even including them? Pretentious-minded reviewers say that the viewer needs to be patient . . . Patient for what? Unlike Ridley Scott's Alien, there is rarely any payoff after the endless buildup in The Godfather. There is no entertainment value. While I'm completely fine with a film lacking entertainment value in order to show honest desperation or to intentionally offend, The Godfather does neither. All the reviews stating that this is a violent movie can be ignored. There is far more graphic violence in PG- and PG-13-rated movies of the past two years than this.<br/><br/>With all the valid flaws I just listed, anyone calling this movie absolutely flawless is in denial. Or just has extremely low standards. While The Godfather is compelling and has masterful plotting and directing, it is simply just another face in the unoriginal crowd when you look at the big picture.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was very influential in cinema—why should that effect how you personally view the film? Just because pretentious ""film buffs"" claim it's flawless, can you really not think of a single film that you enjoyed more? ""CLASSIC"" is just a word slapped onto films that critics are brainwashed into appreciating. It has no bearing on the true artistic or emotional value. It really shouldn't even have any bearing on public opinion, but it does. Imagine with me a world where The Godfather had been critically hated. Do you really think it would still receive the high public ratings that it has now? I highly doubt it. No one makes up their own mind anymore; anyone who does is considered a mindless shock jock, no matter how valid their reasoning is. While the best reasoning I have read for why The Godfather—other than the generic ""good plot, good acting, etc.""—is considered so great is, ""BECAUSE IT IS. SHUT UP."" Maybe what they're really trying to say is, ""I have no idea why it's good, I've just been told so, and I forced myself to believe it."" <br/><br/>4/10"

","Super slow moving and fatiguing to watch considering it's unnecessarily long runtime and formulaic structure. Honestly, you can't expect me to get attached to characters if they're just going to be killed off in 20 minutes of being introduced.<br/><br/>It has a very episodic structure in that things are set up, but never revisited. For example, in the beginning of the film, there is a subplot of one of the family blackmailing a director to put someone in his film. After putting his horse's head in his bead, he accepts. This storyline is never visited again. What was the point?<br/><br/>This honestly put me in such a bad mood, and movies shouldn't do that. I want to enjoy myself during a viewing and be invested in the story, not want it to end as soon as possible.

I did not go in for very high expectations so I thought that after I had watched this movie my mind would be blown but it wasn't and thats really sad. This movie was really original but it doesn't and it helps this movie a lot still this movie is very overrated. I have not read the book. This movie compared to The Dark Knight Trilogy is I'm sorry to say it but a joke. It's not really worth watching it feels like what was the purpose of this movie? To see the underworld? The last 15 minutes are the best thing in this movie but you really got to ask yourself is it worth watching a movie that is 175 minutes long for 15 minutes? The actors was outstanding but so are the ones in as an example The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception or Lord of The Rings Trilogy. When I was going to see Looper I came in with the same expectations but but my mind was blewn! Looper had a purpose but The Godfather didn't.

","While I feel the movie wasn't bad, I also feel like the movie has been given much more praise than it should have gotten.<br/><br/>Well, perhaps this movie was glorious in the 1970s, I am rating it from 2013, and feel like if this movie was released now, it wouldn't have gotten as much attention. For 2013, this movie was mediocre to me.<br/><br/>While the acting from Al Pacino was great, I feel Marlon Brando's acting was a bit too much with his soft slurred voicing of Vito Corleone. It came off a bit weird to me. If anyone spoke like that in real life to you, you would probably think something is wrong with that person.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie was incredibly slow and boring to me.<br/><br/>The restaurant scene was definitely good and leaving the Italian dialogue untranslated added a nice touch. The rest of the movie was just decent to me. The ending felt a bit too easy - to me it seemed like it was all done so easy, making it feel like it could have been done better.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this movie was good, but not great."

"StanleyStrangelove","10","2","6","2 September 2005"," One of the top 10 greatest American films of all time
","Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece tells the saga of the Corleone family. Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of one of the five mafia families. With his son Sonny (James Caan) and lawyer/adviser Tom (Robert Duvall) he runs the family. But the heads of the other families see the Don as too powerful and out of date with the times. They want to get into drug trafficking and the Don wants none of that. Enter Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) as the Don's other son who has returned from the military. <br/><br/>This film is great on every level. The acting, characterizations, dialog and visuals are all perfectly done. For one film to have such a great performance as Brando gives as the Don is one thing. But for the same film to have a second great performance (Pacino's Michael Corleone) is unheard of. Virtually everyone in this film gives an outstanding performance.<br/><br/>This film is #3 on the American Film Institute's 100 best films list, right after Citizen Kane and Casablanca."
"Jahson70","9","2","6","31 December 2004"," Too much hype!!!
","The sequel of this movie is the American masterpiece, not this one<br/><br/>And it's so obvious if you watch the sequel and see how much has gone into it and the fact that it still stands up better than the original.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro is a much better actor than Brando and proves it in this film. Al Pacino is at the top of his game also in this film, so this all adds up to this being the Godfather of American film making.<br/><br/>No competition, Godfather II is the best, the 'Elephant Man' being a close second and 'The Butcher Boy' finishing off my selection.<br/><br/>Who else loves 'Elephant Man'?<br/><br/>Roll on 'War of the Worlds', big up Spielberg."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","2","6","16 July 2004"," Definitely deserves its high rating
","I haven't seen all dramas, nor have I ever seen all movies made that revolve around the mafia, but this is the best drama I've ever seen, and the best movie that revolves around the mafia, by far. Marlon Brando is a fantastic actor, and while I haven't seen any other films with him, I can't imagine that he's done much better work than he did in this film. Al Pacino was also great in the film, and I think it was fairly early in his career. The film is character and plot driven, which is a welcome change from the action-driven films which is the dominant genre today. The film is never predictable, and is free from the typical cliches that pester most dramas. For a crime drama, it's very entertaining and interesting, for a drama, it's very well-paced, and for a film it's just damn good in pretty much every way. The plot is good, very well-written and interesting; I don't think I've ever payed so much attention to a drama, let alone one that takes almost three hours. It just grabbed my attention from the very first frame, the very first words that were spoken caught my attention, and didn't lose it for a second. It has a good pace, it doesn't rush through the scenes, yet it never gets stale or boring either. The acting is great, all the way around, every single actor does a great job. There weren't any that I felt gave a less than great performance. The characters were well-written, credible and well-developed. There weren't any of the characters that I felt I knew too little of, like it is with most new films, even dramas. The direction and editing is great, some of the cinematography is magnificent. The dialog is well-written and well-delivered. The film has some very quotable and memorable lines. The violence is well-made and not overdone in any way; it shows the ruthless killings that were, in fact, being committed by the mafia at the time period that the film takes place in. The film shows, with brutal honesty and without censoring details or violence, how the mafia worked, and how big their influence was in the 1940's. A truly great piece of cinema, worth your time if you have at least a vague interest in crime dramas or films dealing with the mafia. I recommend it to pretty much everyone, especially fans of any of the actors, the director or crime dramas. Also recommendable to anyone who is interested in mafia films. 10/10"
"DeeNine-2","10","2","6","31 March 2004"," A masterpiece
","This is one of the greatest films ever made. Any doubt about that can be dispelled by watching the movie. I missed this when it first came out, and then a curious thing happened. For some reason I thought I had seen the film. One decade and then two went by and I kept hearing what a great film The Godfather was. But I was unimpressed because I thought I had seen it.<br/><br/>I don't know what film I had seen, but it wasn't The Godfather. Seeing this film for the first time over thirty years after the fact of its production is a startling experience. The Godfather is a work of art from first scene to last. There is the most amazing adherence to that fiction which is truer than fact.<br/><br/>I would like to say that I played cards with Mario Puzo who wrote the novel from which the film was adapted and who famously worked with Coppola on the screenplay, but in fact I only played cards with some people who had played cards with Puzo. Ah, such is the effect of celebrity. Puzo became like Coppola something of a legend after this film was produced, and everybody suddenly knew him or played cards with him. Everybody, from the most unsophisticated celluloid fan to the most erudite and jaded critic had walked out of that theater after 171 minutes mesmerized and delighted and emotionally moved by an uncompromising look at not just a Mafia family, but the psychology of families since time immemorial. The truth that we have all lived and experienced was made large on the screen in the form of the Corleones. I can guarantee you that audiences from every culture on the planet would understand the underlying psychology of this movie and take it to some serious extent as their own.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando plays the godfather (the patriarch, of course, or even the warlord if you like) of the past and the present, and then, as must always be the case, comes a new godfather. What is fascinating is who this new godfather is and how he comes to power. The ending of the film is--after so many brilliant scenes and so many psychologically true surprises and so many excursions to Queens and the Bronx and Sicily and Las Vegas (each vignette absolutely integrated into the story of the film)--even more ponderously true and a surprise that sneaks up on us so stealthily that it is not a surprise. And when the credits begin to run after Diana Keaton's tears of realization, we too realize the ""message"" of the film. It is a message that I think would be understood in the Middle East today (and two thousand years ago as well) as I write this, a message of tribal ways and the rise and fall of warlords and the Machiavellian machinations of the prince who would be king.<br/><br/>But it is Al Pacino's performance as the son of the godfather that in the final analysis steals the show as he goes from the intellectual boy who would be a legitimate American success at the finest colleges, etc. to a man wearing the hat of Al Capone. And Pacino makes us believe every step of the way.<br/><br/>Well, I should not say that it Al Pacino who steals the show. In truth this is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece. He would not have the film he has without Al Pacino or Marlon Brandon and certainly not without the novel and script from Mario Puzo, of course; but make no mistake about it. Coppola manicured every scene. He attended to every detail, from the color of the wine to the tires on the cars to the dances and the music to the villas abroad to the sleaze of Las Vegas to the perfect casting of the main characters right down to the extras including both cute and not so cute kids, as indeed life would give us. In some very real sense Coppola lived this movie and it was a part of him, and yet I am stuck by the fact that Puzo invented it.<br/><br/>This is an American classic, an uncompromising work of art that engages, informs and moves the audience--just about any audience--to ask the great questions regarding who we are and what we should do and how we should live.<br/><br/>From the wedding to the funeral to the christening to the priest in Latin voice-over as the final vengeance is planned to that final vengeance (that we know will NOT be the final vengeance), we are glued to our seats as the life of human beings (who could very well be us) passes before our transfixed eyes.<br/><br/>Oscars went to Brando as best actor, and to Puzo and Coppola for best screen adaptation. In a rare show of almost universal agreement among movie goers, critics, and the Academy, The Godfather won the Oscar as Best Picture in 1972.<br/><br/>Don't miss this as I had for so long, and see it for Coppola who can take his place among the greats of all cinema for this film alone.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)"

I found Brando's performance to be hammy, unconvincing and laughable, (how did a guy resembling a giant hamster control this group of poorly-acted gangsters?) Quite literally nothing of any significance occurs in this film, it's just an endless succession of mumbling, shooting, and glaring. I suppose that masochists find it entertaining, everybody else either A; Hasn't seen it, or B; Are lying. The ""special effects"" for the shooting scenes are very 1970's, ie, poor.

But, IMHO, almost all the other major movies about Mafia (especially ""Goodfellas"" & ""Once Upon a Time in America"") are, more interesting and better art too than the bombastic Godfather series. I find even Brando's acting in these movies below his normal standards.<br/><br/>And let me tell you why many people like these mafia movies so much: it's just because many people secretly in their heart admire and envy the ""wild & free"" life style of the gangsters. Just the same reason why Bonnie & Clyde etc. are so popular. Or youngsters love to read the Nicky Cruz biography ""Run, baby, run"" because they find the violent & brutal life of the young gangsters exciting and fascinating, blindly ignoring the fact that the author's message is totally against that. Sadly, it is often the same with movies. You think Quentin Tarantino is so popular among the masses because of his artistic merits? You think wrong."

","Ok, I'm two hours into this film and I just don't get the hype and appeal. I admit my choices in movie are varied (my top five films are ""American Beauty"", ""Donnie Darko"", ""Casablanca"", ""Henry V"" and ""When Harry Met Sally""), but I watched this film with possibly too much expectation. A friend of mine adores this film, and any Mafia film in general, and along with the vast majority of imdb members, he recommended this film to me. The problem is, why?<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong though, before someone starts to condemn me, I appreciate the acting, I understand that Al Pacino performs stunningly throughout, I admit that Marlon Brando is another highlight (although his voice annoys me slightly throughout), but I just don't see why people adore this film. Ok, after reading reviews, the obvious differences between people are blatant. Some people adore this film and consider it the best ever, some dislike it. All that is fair enough. Sadly though, I feel I am slightly more towards the later. I don't dislike this film, it has highlights, but I can't help but feel it is long winded, infuriatingly complicated & at times, ridiculously slow. Graphically, it is superb, acting is tremendous, but I just feel the plot doesn't hold upto scratch.<br/><br/>Perhaps I am a fool, but I just fail to get the hype. Perhaps if I was more of a fan of Mafia films I'd appreciate it more, perhaps. Perhaps if I'd seen it at the cinema in 1972 I'd love it, perhaps. However, after watching it at such a relatively late age of 20 in 2003, I might enjoy this film, I might like a few scenes a lot, but I really fail to understand how it could make it to number 1 in people's lists. I guess in the end of the day, it is all down to opinion."
"jmvcrit56","7","2","6","15 September 2002"," just read that
","So i just voted the Godfather 7/10.  But when I had to summarize it in that one line, i just couldn't do it.  It's impossible.  The movie has been so tainted and vandalized in the industry that it seems that it's impossible for one to point a finger on just exactly how they feel.<br/><br/>Simply put: the Godfather is a good, solid, 3 star (out of four) movie. Yes, the experienced may have been ruined for me (i first saw it with a cold and didn't like it, so i had to see it later, as i knew something was wrong).  I also may be too young (all the commenters say you have to be over 18.  i say you could see the movie at ten and over).  But i feel the movie is a well written, well acted, well balanced movie.  <br/><br/>What's the problem?  Again, I'm speechless.  It lacks a kick, that special kick that so many movies need to have.  Unlike its outstanding sequel, it fails to generate the feeling that the viewer is wrapped in it like a blanket, with the exception of a few scenes.  it best serves as an introduction to a legendary trilogy, rather than just a movie. <br/><br/>
Brando shines as a role that seems written for him, Pacino is great, Caan is head to head with his performance here and with his performance in the gripping Misery (3 1/2 stars out of four).  The script has some of the most realistic writing ever written.  It simply lacks the kick.<br/><br/>If a person walked up to me and asked if they should see it, i would probably slap them in the face, ask what's wrong with them, and steal their lunch money.  But I would also tell them that before they see it, they should be ready to form their own opinion.  Now we come to the ""how it was ruined"" part.<br/><br/>Hollywood generated and ego for this movie.  if you don't like it, or even have a positive opinion like me, you're automatically not considered a movie buff.  I applaud (and send my heart out to) all the movie buffs on imdb that get up off the ground, brush it off, lick their wounds, and say, ""look punk, i didn't like it.""  It's important to form your own opinion, and i'm sure that there are plenty of people that go around praising this movie when they themselves don't think it was that hot.  I do, though, don't get me wrong, it was a good movie.  If you haven't seen it, i suggest you should, though, only for the sake of seeing a so called classic.  <br/><br/>That's it, for those of you looking for the last sentence sum up. Overatted, but still very good.  3 stars out of 4, 7 out of 10"
"Sylviastel","10","2","6","28 November 2001"," Definitely one of the best films ever made
","The Godfather is truly an excellent film with a sensational cast, genius writing, and direction. Without leaders like Coppola or Puzo, the book to film could have been a disaster. The story is well-told in length and detail. Characters are built up and explained well. After Godfather, it must be hard for Coppola to make any follow up movie. This movie has stood almost 30 years and it is still one of the most entertaining addictive movies to watch. You just can't leave it yet until its done. People know the Godfather backwards and forwards. I love the scenes shot in Italy with Pacino and the cast. While they use subtitles to relay the Italian language, the movie leaves you breathless. Pacino, DeNiro, Duvall, Caan, Shire, Keaton, were unknown until this movie was released. We all remember Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski. His performance in this film is equally brilliant and incredible. You can't help but watching this film over and over again."

And Puzo and Coppola knew full well what they were doing, making this movie as unconscionable as they come. And after that I don't care how many monkey movies Brando studied at home, or whether he propped his cheeks with orange segments or thousand dollar bills: this movie is cheap, and it sucks, and please tell me: if Coppola is all that good, why is there nothing coming out of that supposedly great mind of his? Nothing but the same old schtick, the same three worn out pseudo epics, the same three better forgotten films, recycled and recycled and recycled?

My actual score for this film would be 9/10: excellent but not a masterpiece.<br/><br/>It is a very good family melodrama, with very well constructed characters and excellent acting, however, I cannot say I loved this film. It is very good, but nothing really special: It is one of my top 100 favorite films, but not top 50. Why? The main flaw of this film is that it lacks visual art: the truly great films work as pieces of audiovisual art, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey or Coppola's own Apocalypse Now. This film, by contrast, doesn't offer anything besides plot and characters. It is not artistically complete as it doesn't take full advantage of the medium of film.<br/><br/>One problem with this type of film, that is, films restricted by plot, is that by being a film about a family and their petty criminal organization severely restricts the scope and greatness of the film. If, instead, the film was done in a post-apocalyptic setting, where Marlon Brando would be the ruthless leader of a small village in the vast wastelands, and Michael his heir, with a Mad Max 2 felling and more action, it would have been a 10/10 film, because it would have been way more epic. (yeah! :) mundane settings suck: :P )<br/><br/>But, being a film restricted to a petty criminal organization, restricts its greatness: for me a great film needs a great theme and there is little that is lesser in greatness than a gangster theme. It is simply one of those ""american"" cultural constructs that do not fit in may world view: why one would be so interested in the lives of pathetic criminals?<br/><br/>From a technical perspective this film is great, but from an artistic perspective this film is not that great, it is good, but not great. In conclusion: a very good film, but not a great one. Want a powerful drama? Anderson's There Will Be Blood is a way more powerful drama film than this one."

"anthonyfewsterk","10","1","2","21 December 2019"," Blurring morality
","This breathtaking masterpiece tells the story of a crime family through it's rich script and dilemmas. The film has you the minute it starts with the profoundly sympathetic character at the start with his monologue about his daughters circumstances. From start to finish it blurs the lines between good and bad, black and white and begs the question of loyalty, family and power. The crime family with so much power and control cannot control their own family and it's affairs, ironic isn't it? Marlon Brando's performance is the epitome of flawless acting and Al Pacino's acting is seamless and sharp. The film does drag in some parts in my opinion but every film has its flaws and cannot be perfect because perfection is subjective. This film took the books version and perfectly puts it onto film, some say and even in my opinion is better than the book itself."

","Without a doubt, it is the most cinematic triumph of its' kind...the narrative goes beyond the lens, it delivers an all star performance from the gritty dark family crimes of the early 40's .......
The performances from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Robert DeNiro and others were superb.
Let's not forget some of the best lines from any film that every Italian / Italo-American and Gangster lovers still to this day pronounce them with the garb and audacity to catch a laugh.... LEAVE THE GUN, TAKE THE CANNOLI...

","The Godfather is as close to perfection as cinema will ever get in my opinion. I seriously doubt that I will ever watch a movie I love more than this one, Marlon Brando brings his quintessential performance as Vito Corleone, Al Pacino makes Micheals transformation from honorable war hero to ruthless mafia boss haunting and real. Every other actor is perfectly cast as well but those are just the standouts. The cinematography is simply stunning, inventive and revolutionized the way people shot movies. Every single moment in this movie is iconic and the dialouge is simply amazing, the climax is haunting as well. The Godfather is a timeless tradgey of corruption, I could write a novel on it but to put it into one sentence, the reason this movie is so great is because it does not fail in any aspect: the actors , cinematography, story, dialogue, characters, are all outstanding. The Godfather is a film that delivers in every department."

I can not for the life of me figure out why the plot had Michael Corleone hiding out in Italy, taking him out of the action to put him in a marriage that goes largely no where. He arrives back home and I found myself thinking ""Why did that happen? How did that serve the plot?"", a question I have been unable to answer to this day."

","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger<br/><br/>It should be noted that The Godfather was the first gangster/mobster movie I had ever seen. I was 17 years old when I first saw it and it blew me away. Francis Ford Coppola transports you into the world of the Corleone family. He masterfully introduces use the memorable characters and settings that become classics in cinema history. The story is full of twists that you stunned and the flow of the film is elegant and graceful. <br/><br/>The acting is masterful. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, and many others all perform perfectly. They all add to story and are all unique. They are some of the best characters in cinema.<br/><br/>The pacing is perfect. Coppola takes his time creating his characters and settings. The runtime is very long but I found it to go by rather quickly because of the interesting and intense story.<br/><br/>Pros: Masterful storytelling, memorable characters, amazing acting, perfect pacing, and a good runtime<br/><br/>Cons: None<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 10"

"funnygirl94086","7","1","2","12 April 2018"," Good but not great film!
","I saw the film for the very time tonight and while I did enjoy it, I felt it was a bit overrated. There's been so much hype and deconstruction of this film over the last 4 decades, it's hard to approach it with a fresh perspective. Th cinematography was really beautiful and the lighting especially in the indoor scenes really set a glorious mood. I enjoyed the more subtle performances given by Diane Keaton and Al Pacino. A lot of the violence however, seemed gratuitous. The biggest flaw, frankly, was choosing Marlon Brando to play the Don. I love this actor and have enjoyed many of his performances, but this wasn't one of them. I thought he was dreadfully over-acting and ghoulish. It was a gross caricature and how he won ""best actor"" is a mystery to me! All the talk of how he had to ""age"" himself for the character made a mockery of his role with the Kleenex stuffed in his mouth and his put-on gangster voice was just distracting in the end."
"robmourits-34804","8","1","2","11 April 2018"," I (previously) didn't like it
","(I'm Dutch, sorry for my bad English)<br/><br/>
Some years ago I wrote this review for The Godfather:<br/><br/>""Okay, The Godfather is number 2 on the top 250, so I thought I would like it. But I didn't. I want everyone who liked this movie to like it, and please do not care about bad reviews.<br/><br/>There are three reasons why I didn't like The Godfather.
At first, there were many characters, and it was not clear for me every moment if someone was good or bad. Because I couldn't recognize all characters by their name, I didn't understand all the dialogue about other people in the movie. So any time they were just talking, was a bit boring for me.<br/><br/>Secondly, there was a moment in the movie where a man and a woman were fighting at home. Maybe it's just personal, but I really hate family-fights at home, where one of the fighters is much stronger than the other.<br/><br/>At last, the movie is almost three hours long, and if you don't like the movie, that is way too long. I don't say I hate long movies, because I loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Schindlers List and King Kong.<br/><br/>There were also very good moments in this movie. The scene with Don Vito Corleone in the hospital when Michael Corleone visits him was quite thrilling, and the scene where (major spoiler ahead) Michael Corleone shots two people in a restaurant was also very good.<br/><br/>I think I should just watch this movie again, when I have the time for it. Maybe the second time I like it better, because I will probably understand more of it.""<br/><br/>As I said in the last part of my original review I should watch the movie again. After I did that I've decided to change my the rating.<br/><br/>After a second viewing I understood the plot better, the characters were more interesting and I saw why this movie is so beloved. The characters (especially Michael, the main character) are very interesting and the way the story is told is excellent.<br/><br/>In my original review I stated three main reasons why I didn't like The Godfather. The first reason was that I didn't quite understand it. That of course changed after the second time I watched it, because I already knew some things from the first time I watched it.<br/><br/>My third reason also changed. I said that if a movie is not interesting, it makes it worse when it is a long movie. But that wasn't a problem anymore because it was interesting the second time.<br/><br/>My second reason didn't change. I still don't like family fights in movie, but this time I understood the relevance of it.<br/><br/>I still don't think The Godfather is the best movie of all time for me. There are lots of other movies I liked better. But this movie doesn't deserve the 4 stars I previously gave it. 8 stars is a better rating."

","The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather. The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie. Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I'm crazy."

","I personally thought that all the Godfather Movies were excellent, It depicts actual events that took place in the time of the Mobster!! I have to say it never pays to have a hot head, and can't think right, as seen in some of these movies, but rather use your brain and then think out your strategies."
"MaggieJohnson98","10","1","2","17 April 2017"," One of my favorites!
","I know many people do not care for this movie, however it quickly became one of my favorites. The actors gave these characters special meanings and helped to make the ""criminals"" more ""likable"" in my opinion. This movie is one of my ""go to"" choices when I am looking for something more familiar to watch and I honestly can view it every view days with no problem. If you are looking for a ""mafia"" movie that also spends time showing some of the family connections, than this movie is for you."

He need to be fair and discipline.The traitors must be executed even though you are the family members.Really hard to be a godfather. By the way, I vote this movie 10 for the Marlon Brando!Thanks."

","We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of ""The Godfather,"" which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.<br/><br/>The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises."
"maiden-yokohama","8","1","2","4 July 2016"," Sometimes it's too slow for my taste, but after all an enchaining story, with great characters.
","First of all, it's been a while since I decided to watch The Godfather, but somehow I've never had enough will power to do so. I heard people saying it's the greatest movie of all time, but I was still being skeptical about this statement, as I couldn't imagine a movie with such long play time grabbing your attention all over it. When it started playing I could sense the outstanding feeling of the early 50's USA. It just felt natural to be part of this world, as we were born to it. The plot is not to be detailed, as it's one of the most famous movies, but I can assure everyone, this is the strongest part of the film. Of course there are some action scenes where bad people shoot with guns, there are some romantic scenes where beautiful woman make love with handsome man, but all of these give the essential of the Godfather. We learn the rules of this world, without directly being taught each of them. We become the part of the family, and we suffer or win, as the Corleones do. We start to worry about the characters, that feel alive and feel realistic. Our first, probably negative impression are getting overwrite by the deeper, and more considered emotions, which are more likely to be positive. We understand that some things have to be done, no matter what the morals say. Yes, we can live the life of the Corleones, and that's a thing not every movie can provide. The Godfather is not the best movie of all time, not for me at least. But it surely worth watching, not just because it's a legend, but for why it has become a legend."
"tavm","7","1","2","3 July 2016"," The Godfather was a very compelling film to watch though I stop at considering it one of the greatest of all time
","After so many years of only knowing of this movie by reputation, I finally watched this in its entirety on a flight from Korean Air. It's such a violent movie and I was very surprised it was even shown on the plane though there was a disclaimer that anyone younger than 18 should only watch with an adult guardian. What did I think of the film, itself? Well, it's fascinating to watch all the scenes leading to certain killings and the male cast members certainly put their heart into the roles though the female cast members don't have as much of a chance to develop their characters as fully as their opposites. But knowing both Diane Keaton and Talia Shire have parts in the two sequels makes me think I'd get the know their characters better later on. I also read on Wikipedia of deleted scenes restored when the three films in the series were put together for TV and DVD/VHS so maybe that may also be an offer I couldn't refuse to watch someday. In summary, The Godfather was a very good film though I stop at considering it one of the greatest of all time...P.S. I was familiar with singer Al Martino way before his role in this film as my parents owned three of his record albums-This is Love, Spanish Eyes, and A Merry Christmas-that I used to listen quite frequently to as a kid during the '70s."
"PredragReviews","10","1","2","14 June 2016"," ""In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns.""
","The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people (even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.<br/><br/>The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get. The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection. The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable! <br/><br/>Overall rating: 10 out of 10."

Bartek moving van – we gotta settle dis – once and for all. OK, maybe I am going a little over the top, but before the Corleone family hit the cinemas, there really wasn't much spattering screens that defined what went on behind closed doors in 'The Cosa Nostra'; 'The Mafia'; 'The Family' or whatever these folks are known as. From the time Mario Puzo's pen first bled ink onto an empty pages, who would have guessed a masterpiece was about to be born. By the time Coppola's finishing touches on this creation, there could hardly be any doubt. This cinematographic brilliance known as, 'The Godfather' is a story hard to beat. There are those who say the movie is 'overrated'...to them...I say 'Go Watch ""The Birdman.""' Haters are just going to hate like a bunch of crybaby haters. ""The Godfather's"", writing and script are superb; the acting and cast is outstanding and the saga's story-line is unmatched, what else is needed? I like the pace and depth. No super villains and no super cops...just Mob vs. Mob vs. Mob...I love it. Anyways – watch this when you can - or if you haven't already.

","In 1968 I met the great man Marlon Brando with Charles Chaplin after the completion of 'A Countess from Hong Kong'.We all had lunch together. During our meeting I gave him a piece of amber on a leather string which I was wearing and he had admired and commented 'You are wearing the mystical stone ,20 million years in the creation'. He tucked it into his shirt. I have always wondered particularly as I watched Marlon in 'The Godfather' if he kept his promise always to wear it. I was told years later that he did ..but I have no way of knowing. Maybe someone out there knows.I was meeting the two great men in my capacity as an art dealer and they commissioned from one of my artists a portrait of Sophia Lauren in bronze..At 83 I am writing my memoirs to be titled 'SENTENCED TO LIFE'.Sir Charles and I spoke of the similarities of our beginnings..He in a Home for Waifs and Strays ...Me too...His mother confined in a lunatic asylum ..My mother too.'The Colney Hatch Insane Asylum ' in North London ..He then stated 'Remember !

"CinematicInceptions","8","1","2","29 April 2016"," Keeps its touch even if it isn't as entertaining by today's standards.
","I don't think I can safely call this overrated as I'm seeing it forty years after its release. It definitely stands the test of time, since it appeals to both older crowds that have grown up with it as well as younger movie fans like me that have grown up with a completely different breed of genres and story structure and the like. I don't think you could make a similar movie today that accomplishes being both highly respected and highly successful. Not to say that those two qualities can't go hand in hand, but dramas just don't draw huge crowds as much today. It's too bad, because I'm sure there could be a Godfather for this generation, but it has to compete with all the teen book series movies and superhero movies and an endless stream of smaller comedies that take precedence at the box office.<br/><br/>The complexity of the plot is pretty well balanced; it keeps you interested and you'll learn a lot more from your second or third viewing, but you understand the story pretty well the first time you see it. The large number of important characters can get a bit confusing, especially those like Barzini who are not on screen very much but are mentioned a lot and are very important to the plot. The extended runtime allows for lots of development for each character, but the Michael is really the only one with an arc. Characters like Sonny, Kay, Vito, and Tom Hagen have progression but we don't have any real sympathy with them. The family as a whole has an intensified view of what a lot of the American working class sees as right and wrong. Within the family, there are defined boundaries that cannot be overstepped, as seen with Connie and Carlo's relationship. But in the world of the Mafia, there are no such rules and the ends always justify the means. The emphasis on family ties is integrated into the business of the Mafia since family and loyalty is what keeps the business together and keeps it functioning well. This is probably what makes Vito a likable character even though he deals in some dirty business. His work and his family are what are most dear to him, and the nature of his work allows him to work for both simultaneously. Also, he gives respect to those who show virtue, but not to those who just do things out of self-interest as with Bonasera in the opening scene and his refusal to invest in the drug-dealing business. This sort of mentality is not as present with Michael, who is just as ruthless as his father in making ""offers they can't refuse"" and such, but does not hold family trust in as high a regard. Once Vito is gone and Michael has gotten over his aversion to mob life and fully accepted his role as don, he effectively orders Carlo's death, ignores his sister's resulting emotional breakdown, and does not even trust his own wife with the truth of the matter. Perhaps this is the sort of thing that Vito had in mind when he appointed Michael as don; he knew it had to be done, but couldn't do it himself.<br/><br/>I wasn't absolutely wowed by any of the actor's performances, but the entire cast gave a great showing. Much of the dialogue is good. Some obviously is spot on, but the rest is pretty low-key. The conversations are well constructed and it definitely improves the flow of the movie, but it's not something that you notice while watching it. The pace can get a bit slow at times, but then picks right back up again with some shocking event. This was something that I thought was really well done. Things were predictable and unpredictable at just the right moments. Vito's shooting, Apollonia's death, the mutilation of the horse in that guy's bed, and the murder of Luca Brasi are all sudden and shocking and come out of nowhere. Then events like the murder of the other four don's, Apollonia's father admitting his relation to her by denying her existence, and Vito's death in the garden are all intentionally very easy to foresee, but they have to be shown to have the full effect. You could just have Michael come home to Vito's dead body, but somehow it's better to see his final moments.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, it's an interesting watch. It's not terribly confusing, but don't watch it if you aren't into complicated movies. I didn't find it over-hyped, but some people might, so lower your expectations a little. I would suggest watching it in as close to two sittings as possible. One sitting might be too long and cause you to get lost. More than two and you start to forget important plot points. Definitely try to find an environment where you can keep the volume constant so that you can hear the quieter dialogue but don't have to worry about disturbing people during the sudden spurts of violence. On that note, I will warn that there is a fair amount of brutality and blood, some of which might be disturbing and not the type that gets your adrenaline going like modern action movies. So if none of what I've described deters you, definitely give it a shot. Overall Rating:8.8/10."

As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place.

","opularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family ""business."" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible."

","The Godfather is a textbook on cinematic lucidity - an exquisite, cohesive Mafia epic that is rightly hailed as an all-time high watermark of American cinema. <br/><br/>Based on the novel by Mario Puzo, The Godfather constructs a sprawling family saga that tells the story of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the spider at the center of a web of deceit, murder and larceny. When the Don is left incapacitated by an attempted assassination from a rival crime family, the family quickly seeks to fill the power vacuum left by his absence and it is left up to his sons - the hot tempered Sonny (James Caan), meek mild Fredo (John Cazale), adopted Irish son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and the fiercely independent Michael (Al Pacino) - to run the Corleone clan. Hardened by the reprisals taken against his family, the 'white-sheep' son Michael Corleone is drawn irresistibly into the gang warfare, which hints at the beginning of his moral descent. Thus underlines the tragedy of The Godfather, with the sins of the father bestowed upon his children, who if not met by death's hand will be plunged into hellfire for their actions. But, underneath all the slayings and sinister ""offers you can't refuse"" this is an immigrant family drama about assimilation, blood loyalty and honor.<br/><br/>The Godfather has a richly operatic feel to it, thanks to the solemn and stately classicism that Francis Ford Coppola brings to his pulpy material. He doesn't waste a single frame of celluloid in telling the story of the Corleone family. Every scene illuminates the motivations behind each character and dilemma within the family and all the people that surround it. The artistry of Coppola combined with Gordon Willis' spot-on cinematography and Nino Rota's haunting score covers many scenes in a deep veil of shadow, ensconcing the audience in an atmosphere of unconditional involvement.<br/><br/>Each performance is a vignette that fits exquisitely into the whole picture. The character of Vito exhibits the brilliance and innovation of Brando's thespian prowess, creating a staggering mafia figure within a world of stereotype. Brando's restrained motions and rasping speech patterns are stunningly suggestive of power while his actions (courtesy of the script) wield it. His resident power, his sheer innate force, has rarely seemed weaker. As Vito's hesitant son, Pacino rises to the occasion admirably. He beautifully underplays Michael's evolution from returning war hero to the new head of the Corleone family. Caan, gives a splendid portrayal as the hot-headed Sonny while Robert Duvall is steadily efficient as Tom Hagen. Diane Keaton is just right as Michael's oblivious love Kay.<br/><br/>The Godfather will continue to hold a central place in cinema history, an epic which has colored everything made subsequently with its imagery and operatic scope. An enduring masterpiece!"

","Instead of focusing on everything that is extraordinary about The Adoptive parent, a much simpler path for me to judge its quality is on what is awful about it. Each film has something that I don't care for about it, however I can genuinely say that I wouldn't change anything about The Back up parent. There is nothing powerless about it and nothing that emerges as terrible. That is the reason it gets ten out of ten. <br/><br/>This is one of those movies that made me ask why I hadn't seen it prior. The acting from everybody included is extraordinary, Marlon Brando runs over superbly as the leader of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are astounding as his children. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is additionally extremely essential, bringing back memories of the film each time I hear it. The plot must be fabulous for it to get ten out of ten, and it will be, its a long way from unsurprising and the film is the meaning of an awesome epic. <br/><br/>The film is really stunning in the way every demise happens momentarily, and as it compasses ten years such a variety of distinctive things happen and each moment of it is extraordinary stimulation. It's a well- made and enthralling film that is just the first piece of a set of three, yet it remains all alone as a superb film in its own particular right. On the off chance that you haven't seen it, what are you holding up for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't baffle."

","I like it. This is good film and 10/10. Thanks all! I watched all series of this film. The Godfather is the finest cinematic achievement ever. It had the first truly ensemble cast, and writing which matched, if not bettered, its masterful source material. It was a truly original mafia film of its time, imitated by a lot more media as time passed. It was the first gangster film to revolve around the families of the gangsters, rather than the action, which just added to the suspense. The Godfather's essential components from its cinematography, editing, score, directing and writing can be praised to the ends of this Earth, but one thing always stands out for me: the acting. Marlon Brano's Vito Corleone is rightfully seen as the legend's greatest performance; Robert Duvall and James Caan are the two only imaginable actors (who gave instinctive performances) for the roles of Sonny Corleone and Tom Hagen. But Al Pacino, in a brilliantly developed role as Michael Corleone, stands out due to his convincing acting, along with an interesting and cohesive back story. Every other actor is appropriate for their roles, and all are phenomenal in their career best performances. It is by far, the greatest film I have ever seen and my favorite film ever."

","the best American films ever made thank you This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic. Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family. The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for ""gangster movies"", but its influence goes well beyond that."

","This film follows Vito Corleone the leader of a New York Mafia called 'family' having to deal with the consequences of ether moving with the times and going into drug related crime or sticking to the traditional old country ways of gambling. This effects his war hero son Michael who has no intentions into going into the family business.<br/><br/>The Godfather is the best gangster/mobster movie ever made in my opinion. Its simply phenomenal. There's not much I didn't love in this movie a few things that were a bit dated but made the film even more enjoyable to watch. The acting in this film is fantastic by everyone not just the main gangsters like Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) who brings a chilling confidence in everything he dose now its one of the most iconic performances in cinematic history and it shows, its really good to watch. Same goes for Al Pacino as Michael Corleone he was just gripping to watch to see him slowly change from an good guy war hero to a ruthless mafia leader you completely gets you engrossed. Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen was brilliant too, always in the background ready to give helpful advice whenever needed one of my favourites and a really interesting character to watch. Then the less main characters like Talia Shire was amazing in this film she really played her part well. I could go on about each actor in this film but I won't there's just some of the standout performances in this film and I can assure you their are more. The directing still to this day is brilliant to watch its simple but very elegant. The script is for me one of the best written in movie history its got some of the most iconic lines every scripted and to have such talented actors its no wonder this film is so popular. The soundtrack again is so memorable at times it brings chills down your spine with thrill and excitement knowing something truly awesome is about to happen. The only thing I thought was a bit dated was just in one scene when Michaels brother Sonny Corleone played very well by James Caan where he is fighting his sisters husband for beating her and you can clearly see he's miles away from touching him. Like I said tho this just makes this film that bit more fun to watch. Overall this film has some of the best overall acting you are likely to see, some of the most iconic script and music you are likely to hear too. Its a must see for any movie movie watcher, a timeless classic and I hear Part two is even better!"
"zby-new","8","1","2","12 November 2014"," A Multi-generational crime saga film
","The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.<br/><br/>One of the original ""Movie Brats"" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial super stardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" The almost three hours, R-rated saga film (for violence and graphic language) won three Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando refused to accept the award) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola). The other seven nominations included three for Best Supporting Actor (James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Al Pacino), Best Director, Best Sound, Best Film Editing, and Best Costume Design. One of The Godfather's original eleven nominations was removed, Best Music (Original Dramatic Score), when it was determined that Nino Rota's score had been used for a previous film.<br/><br/>Gangster films are one of the oldest of film genres (starring Edward G. Robinson, James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart), emerging as an influential force in the early 1930s (e.g., Little Caesar (1930), Public Enemy (1931), and Scarface (1932)). This gangster film re-invented the gangster genre, elevating the classic Hollywood gangster film to a higher level by portraying the gangster figure as a tragic hero. The rich and enthralling film is characterized by superb acting and deep character studies, beautiful photography and choreography, authentic recreation of the period, a bittersweet romantic sub-plot, a rich score by Nino Rota, and superbly-staged portrayals of gangster violence. Its grim, dark passages and bright exterior scenes are all part of the beautiful cinematography by Gordon Willis.<br/><br/>The Godfather is an insightful sociological study of violence, power, honor and obligation, corruption, justice and crime in America. Part I of The Godfather Trilogy centers on the Corleone crime ""family"" in the boroughs of New York City in the mid-1940s, dominated at first by aging godfather/patriarch ""Don"" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in a tremendous, award-winning acting portrayal that revived his career). A turn-of-the-century Sicilian immigrant, he is the head of one of the five Italian-American ""families"" that operates a crime syndicate. The 'honorable' crime ""family,"" working outside the system due to exclusion by social prejudice, serves as a metaphor for the way business (the pursuit of the American dream) is conducted in capitalistic, profit-making corporations and governmental circles.<br/><br/>This epic story traces the history of their close-knit Mafia family and organization over a ten year period (although the specific words ""Mafia"" and ""Cosa Nostra"" are not found in the film's script - they were replaced with ""the family""). The presiding, dominant Corleone patriarch, who is threatened by the rise of modern criminal activities - the drug trade, is ultimately succeeded by his decent youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), a US Marine Corps officer in WWII who becomes even more ruthless to persist. Family loyalty and blood ties are juxtaposed with brutal and vengeful blood-letting and the inevitable downfall of the family. Romanticized scenes of the domestic home life of members of the family - a family wedding, shopping, a baptism, kitchen cooking, etc., are intertwined with scenes of horrific violence and murder contracts - a total of 23 deaths litter the film. Over 50 scenes involved food and drink."
"anastalukder","10","1","2","8 November 2014"," Epic Stuff
","Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If a film is about Jewish mobsters, it's a ""Jewish Godfather""; if it's about the Chinese underworld, it's an ""Oriental Godfather""; if it takes place in contemporary times, it's a ""modern day Godfather.""<br/><br/>If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.<br/><br/>Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it.<br/><br/>The film opens in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court. It is the wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request on that day."
"anthonymichaelbangert","10","1","2","20 October 2014"," A Classic Movie Masterpiece
","This movie has everything a masterpiece needs. Excellent writing, compelling characters, and a story worth knowing. It tells of the politics of the Mafia in the 1940s, focusing on the Corleone family. Don Vito Corleone is a smart businessman who decides to refuse to get involved with another family's connections to the drug business, thinking it to be morally wrong. When an assassination attempt on his life leaves the Boss in a critical condition, his sons must take over the day to day operations in the midst of the war that has been started. Throughout the film we see the truth behind the violence, the stress of being involved with a powerful family, and the political undertones of Mafia life. We especially see all of these effects in Michael Corleone. He is the youngest son of Don Corleone, and a war hero. However, due to the things happening throughout the story, Michael portrays a man's descent into a different life. Some great things about this movie are first off, the acting. Each person in this movie, no matter how small their role is, has a story to tell and they all tell those stories beautifully. Second, the language. Many scenes in this movie are spoken almost exclusively in Italian. Without subtitles. It added an authenticity unlike any movie I've seen before. Beautifully well done, excellently put together, an obvious masterpiece, even with being very slow paced at times. If you have yet to see this film, do so this instant."

","The godfather is one of the greatest movies ever put together. Francis Coppola directed it in 1972 and integrated brilliant costumes, dynamic plot, detailed set, emotional sound track, and amazing actors involved in every scene the movie was one of the greatest successes of it's time and continues to remain a classic. I was born in 1990 and even though much as changed from when this movie was created to now, it is still a movie I can watch, enjoy, and appreciate because all those things listed above were spot on. This movie falls into multiple genres. Of those the largest is Crime Fiction. This genre crime fiction is the literary genre that fictionalizes crimes, their detection, criminals and their motives.<br/><br/>The costumes not only fit the time in which the movie was set for, but as each set ventured from one location to another they matched the costumes with the location and each scene appropriately. Additionally each character seemed to have their own sort of style they displayed through these costumes. If each character looked and sounded the same, a viewer could easily guess the character by the clothing they wore. <br/><br/>The plot engages the movie beautifully. From the beginning to end it leaves the viewer having a very direct and excellent understanding of what is happening and how it ties in to the main story. Even through watching the movie multiple times and knowing what happens I can still avoid anticipating what will happen next because it is so well established and drawn out. <br/><br/>Matching costumes, characters are captured in beautiful and well constructed sets. Viewers can actually watch the movie and though have never been to where the movie takes place, they are able to visualize and understand exactly where they are. This movie does an excellent job at not just focusing on where the action is but showing a larger portion of the picture to allow viewers to fill in any additional puzzle pieces that normally aren't formed but in some cases with some viewers is absolutely necessary to understand exactly where they are in each scene. <br/><br/>The sound track is very emotional. The symphony sound texture to the music allows background music to be applied to a scene and assist viewers to visualize what is going on and the emotions to be expected while the scene unfolds without requiring the use of additional vocals. This is exceptionally beneficial at the beginning and ending of each scene, as it displays the mood of the scene as it starts out or leaves a lasting effect of whatever just took place. <br/><br/>Last but not least the actors are the people who made the film what it was. Each role was very specific to the actor and very distinguished from one to another. In specific, the Don's sons Michael and Sonny, were extreme opposites. While one was very calm and easy going the other was very hot headed and gung hoe, looking for action and death to those who disagreed with him or stood up to the other family members. <br/><br/>All in all the movie was wonderful from beginning to end ultimately I would not change a single thing or think something could have been done to better the film. I definitely recommend anyone who has not watched this movie already to check it out!"

Because it has real, true, manly life lessons we can all learn a few things from. As movies inspire us but doesn't define us. <br/><br/>love the movie."

","This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable. The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather."
"cleary-joshua","10","1","2","20 July 2014"," A film of epic proportions...
","I must confess, I find it really tricky to watch movies that are considered ""The Greatest of All Time"", because of one enormous fear: What if I don't like it? Sure, you don't have to stick to social majorities when forming your opinion on a film, but I suppose there's a certain reaction that comes when you say something like: ""Yeah, I wasn't so seen on The Shawshank Redemption, actually"". So this was my worry when I finally purchased ""The Godfather"" trilogy on DVD, and sat down to watch the first one. Thankfully, I absolutely adored it. It's a film of epic proportions, following 10 years in the history of the Corleone Family, with excellent drama and beautiful cinematography. And it also keeps you interested for the entirety of its 3 hour run time, which is by no means an easy feat.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" follows Don Vito Corleone (played by the masterful Marlon Brando), the head of one of the most powerful mafia families, and his son Michael (Al Pacino), who is soon to take over the family. We begin with Michael's wedding, which uses brilliant juxtapositions between the bright, happy event, and the dark office of the patriarch, where he hears the requests of his family and friends. It's a great scene because we realise the image that the family tries to send out, and the actual goings on behind the scenes. We also observe the power and influence that the family has in places like the media (involving the head of a certain animal), so that we can then understand how much of a force to be reckoned with they are.<br/><br/>The film takes place over 10 years, and packs a lot of events into 3 hours, from the attempted assassination of Vito, to Michael's refuge in Sicily. Coppola shows us so clearly how life in a mafia family is a dangerous one, where you always have to watch your back and where people are always trying to kill you. Thanks to the character of Kay (played by a young Diane Keaton), we get an outsider's perspective on the family too, and Michael tries to show her that the business will become 'legitimate' soon, although we knows this is unlikely. The greatest sequence in the film is also one of the most famous – the massacre that takes place during a christening, with sinister Bach organ music played over the top. It's a fantastic section because Coppola is contrasting life and death so well, making us aware of the cycle of mafia life.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" is truly one of the great masterpieces of cinema. It's complex and often slow going, but always reaches points which make waiting worthwhile. The acting is totally stunning, which Pacino and Brando shining in particular in their roles, and the whole film is shot with a dark, noir-ish lens. Every part of it is well thought out, particularly its score and pacing, and you can appreciate it at the end as both a great feat of filmmaking, and a satisfying watch. I was extremely pleased to find how much I enjoyed watching this incredible film, and can't wait to tuck into the rest of the trilogy."

"rcolgan","10","1","2","4 July 2014"," ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.""
","The Godfather is often considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and for good reason. It's a timeless classic that doesn't feel like it dated a day, only getting better with each passing watch. It is Coopla's magnum opus, showing the potential that cinema has as a storytelling art form. <br/><br/>It revolutionised narrative as rather than telling the story of one character, Coopla built up a life style by showing these criminals in both their everyday life and when under threat. The story spans 5 years, showing us every detail of how the mafia operates. We see everything from their joy at a wedding to their shaded business meetings where death is talked about callously without guilt.<br/><br/>When violence is used Coppola never holds back. He will show every gruesome detail with faces gasping for oxygen, the blood trickling down their skin and the intense screams of pain of the victims. It is this realism and details that make many of the most memorable scenes as it was one of the first times that a film used such realistic violence. <br/><br/>The film probably has one of the greatest casts assembled to a film with so many memorable characters. Even with a 3 hour runtime, many of these characters don't even play that large a role in the story or even get too much screen time. But the actors get their roles down so incredibly that they build their own character through the way they speak or the hesitance of talking against a powerful figure like the godfather. <br/><br/>Throughout the film doesn't have a single weak performance. But of course the stand out of the cast was Brando. I remains one of cinemas most memorable performances, with his introducing shot alone being one of the most recognisable images in cinema with his calm reaction to being asked to kill a man. He becomes the image of power inciting fear into even his own assassins who stutter when talking to him. <br/><br/>Certainly Brando is the film's most iconic role, though sometimes overlooked is Pacino with one of the most memorable transformations in film going from a respected war veteran to violent crime lord. Far more emotional than his father he is hesitant about violence at first, but quickly becomes accustomed to the violence of his life of crime. By the end of the film he doesn't second think killing his own step brother as an act of vengeance. Pacino was perfect at emphasising this change with both the tone of his voice and rage in his eyes creating the real image of a man who has changed over the years. <br/><br/>But it's not quality alone that has made this film so memorable. What makes The Godfather such an icon of cinema because it represents what all films should try to accomplish, by taking risks that no other film would make. Coppola was never afraid to show the detailed violence or take risks by experimenting with narrative, because he wanted to make his own unique vision on screen. It's for this reason that it has become timeless, representing a masterclass in filmmaking and reminding us all of the innovation that makes us love cinema."

It the best movie about the Mafia. In addition, many have called it the best movie of all time. A sequel, The Godfather Part II, was released in 1974 and won another Best Picture Oscar, too. It was the only sequel to do so until 2003's The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The third movie in the Godfather trilogy, The Godfather Part III, came out in 1990.

","The Godfather is a great movie. From it's writing, directing and of course, the acting. The whole cast commits to their roles but the few that stands out are Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall. My favourite scene is where Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) kills Virgil Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey at dinner. It's one of those rare feelings you have during a scene where you are cheering but feel guilty about it. What's incredible is that every scene is memorable in different ways. This is credit to the writers, Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo and the director, again, Francis. The writing and directing is spot on, but I forgot another great artist, Gordon Willis, the cinema photographer. The film looks amazing, especially on the restoration and blu ray. This is one of the best movies ever made and every film lover should see it."

","I'd never seen the Godfather prior to this weekend. A friend of mine asked how I can consider myself a movie reviewer, when I haven't even seen the film that is widely considered to be the best of all-time. He had a point, so I decided to rent it and my verdict is it. While the Godfather is a tremendous epic drama, I really don't see how it is considered to be the best film ever made. It's a great story, with a superstar cast, which set the genre for all the mafia films that followed, but that in and of itself means the film is going to have problems. As with other mafia films, it's difficult to keep track of who's who in the large cast. It also moves rather quickly and viewers like myself are going to have a very difficult time of trying to follow the erratic timeline of the film. Some parts move at a snails pace, while other just fly by, and what is with the music? The soundtrack is almost as acclaimed as the film, but honestly if I had to hear that song one more time, during this three hour epic, I may have gone out and killed someone myself. For those unfamiliar with the story, it follows the evolution of the Corleone family, as they transition from one leader to the next. The story is fantastic and is the furthest thing from predictable that you will ever find. It is filed with classic scenes and renowned performance from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, but I really have a hard time calling such a complicated story with that much violence, the best of all-time. The Godfather is a terrific movie, and I'm glad that I finally got to see it, but in a word, the film is overrated."

","Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael , Santino and Tom Hagen , his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates. he Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy."
"JoeHumfrey","10","1","2","18 June 2014"," The greatest film of all time
","The Godfather is quite simply the best film of all time. The film really sets of the groundbreaking genre of mafia/gangster films. <br/><br/>This film follows the New York mafia family in 1940's America as they try protect and build upon their empire whilst challenged by rival families. <br/><br/>This film is filled with outstanding performances, Al Pacino plays the role of the son who is against everything the family stands for but throughout the film slowly finds himself going against everything he believed in and consequently joining their ways and eventually becoming the leader of the family after Don Corleone's life comes to an end. <br/><br/>This film marks the start of Al Pacino's outstanding career and is still one of his best performances to this day. Marlon Brando playing the main role as Don Corleone in the film is at his very best and absolutely deserved his Academy Award for his performance. He gives a real sense of realism to the film and shows us the intelligence and pride in the mafia rather than the criminality and violence people stereotype the mafia with. John Cazale, who plays Fredo, gives the performance of a lifetime as he plays the runt of the family, lacking intelligence and bravery and will never live up to his father's aspirations for him. He always lives in the shadow of his two brothers and is seen as inferior to them throughout, Cazale shows psychological realism as we see his struggle to come to terms with his inferiority. <br/><br/>This film portrays the Mafia in a way which we find ourselves sympathizing with the characters despite their criminal antics. Which is astonishing to see due to the severity of their crimes. <br/><br/>Many films such as Donnie Brasco, Casino and Goodfella's have tried to replicate the outstanding way in which the mafia is portrayed in this masterpiece but no film has ever matched up.<br/><br/>With unforgettable quotes and scenes, you will never watch a film so compelling in your life. <br/><br/>With a mixture of outstanding acting, directing, writing and music this is an all time classic. The defining film of Francis Ford Coppola's career. The only film that could ever compare : Part II.<br/><br/>A truly unmissable film."

This probably won't be very popular - but this movie is way way too slow. There is a lot of talking and very little action, which would be OK if the dialogue was special - it isn't.<br/><br/>What saves The Godfather for me is the performances. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in particular - you can tell they are at the peak of their powers and giving the performance everything. Their characters are complex and interesting. Brando as Don Vito Corleone is a criminal but with a good heart. Al Pacino wants to avoid crime but he has a streak of evil in him. The development of the characters and handover of the criminal empire keeps the otherwise dull storyline ticking over.<br/><br/>I've given this movie a 7/10 on the strength of the performance, but I won't be watching it again."

","The Godfather is the finest cinematic achievement ever. It had the first truly ensemble cast, and writing which matched, if not bettered, its masterful source material. It was a truly original mafia film of its time, imitated by a lot more media as time passed. It was the first gangster film to revolve around the families of the gangsters, rather than the action, which just added to the suspense. The Godfather's essential components from its cinematography, editing, score, directing and writing can be praised to the ends of this Earth, but one thing always stands out for me: the acting. Marlon Brano's Vito Corleone is rightfully seen as the legend's greatest performance; Robert Duvall and James Caan are the two only imaginable actors (who gave instinctive performances) for the roles of Sonny Corleone and Tom Hagen. But Al Pacino, in a brilliantly developed role as Michael Corleone, stands out due to his convincing acting, along with an interesting and cohesive back story. Every other actor is appropriate for their roles, and all are phenomenal in their career best performances. It is by far, the greatest film I have ever seen and my favorite film ever."
"irishfreedom2013","10","1","2","3 June 2014"," The Godfather (1972), is a Drama movie about a crime family, but unlike other crime movies, this one shows both the good and the bad of the gangsters.
","The Godfather (1972) was directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who in 1970 directed the successful movie Patton. Although the Patton movie was successful, not even Coppola could have predicted the success that was produced by The Godfather. The movie was based on a novel by Mario Puzo, who along with Coppola wrote the screenplay. The lead role was played by Marlon Brando, and he was supported by great actors, such as Al Pacino, James Cann, Robert Duvall, and many others who put in amazon performances.<br/><br/>The first scene sets the stage for the rest of the movie, and gives the viewer an early insight as to what to expect through the movie. It starts off in a dark room where the face of an old friend of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the old friend was begging Don Vito to help him deliver justice to the two men who had beaten his daughter. Don Vito Corleone was offended that his old friend had gone to the police for help before coming to him. However, when his friend explains he was scared to because he desired to live an honest life in America, but when a judge gives the two men suspended sentences, he knows the only way to punish these men was to go to Don Vito Corleone. It is apparent from the beginning that Don Vito Corleone is a dangerous man, but he is also shown as a compassionate man, when he agrees to help his old friend, but tells him he may one day ask for a favor in return for his help. The favor he asks from his old friend is one that will shock the audience!<br/><br/>That same day, the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter was going on, and after the meeting with his friend, he went out for a family picture. Another soft side of the godfather is revealed as he puts off the family picture until his son Michael (Al Pacino) arrives. Michael shows up dressed in a military uniform and is the only member of the family not involved in the family crime business. An exciting sequence of events changes that, however.<br/><br/>This movie from start to finish is full of excitement and surprises, and it starts when Don Vito Corleone once again shows he has morals and refuses to involve his family in the drug trade. Not all the New York families process these morals, and the bloody feud ensues, which leaves the viewer on the edge of his or her seat anticipating what is going to happen next. This movie is not for the faint hearted, but it shows both sides of a crime family, from the love they share for their children, wife's, and other family members, to the murderous rages, which can be triggered at any moment. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino put in stunning performances' which is supported from the excellent supporting actors.' <br/><br/>With 32 awards, which include three Academy Awards, and 19 nominations for awards, it would not be an exaggeration to say The God Father is one of the best movies of all time. For anyone who has not yet watched this movie, it will provide 175 minutes of ultimate excitement, and leave him or her eager to watch The Godfather II."

"thediggens","10","1","2","30 May 2014"," A Timeless Snapshot of Another World
","The Godfather is rightly regarded as one of the finest movies ever made, and this review won't seek to be a mere repetition of its finest qualities. Technically, thematically and theatrically, the film is an undeniable masterpiece. It took what is an enjoyable, but pulpy, populist crime novel into a deft piece of art. One can only attempt to highlight some interesting observations here.<br/><br/>Watching this again recently with friends who have never seen it before is an interesting experiment. After seeing the film numerous times one forgets that the story and the characters, while never particularly convoluted, are nevertheless numerous, steeped in a subtly defined hierarchy that for the uninitiated is overwhelming, to say the least. Especially overseas (Britain in this case), the younger generation have to fill in gaps that would have been closer to common knowledge upon release in the US. Notwithstanding its wide berth of characters and relationships, the film's central arc, that of Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) descent to Don, is never clouded; Part II, while arguably as good if not better than Part I, suffers initially from juggling multiple arcs that while well-crafted and excellent, are not nearly as accessible.<br/><br/>While all remember the set pieces, particularly the wedding and baptism that masterfully bookend the film, on multiple viewings it's the quieter, thematic scenes that really shine. A personal favourite scene is the last scene shared between Michael and Vito (Marlon Brando) discussing Vito's desires for Michael, which merges duty, family and aspiration in a truly touching scene. One can make a serious argument that The Godfather Saga is really an embodiment of the American dream (note the Statue of Liberty in the 'cannoli' scene background), and Vito's entire outlook captures this. The scene is certainly the thematic backbone of the movie.<br/><br/>What has been occasionally discussed in detail elsewhere, but deserves a mention, is the portrayal of Kay. It's a nuanced performance by Diane Keaton, and the costume design is a fantastic touch. In her scenes where she is most distant, Kay's colours are bright reds and oranges, in sharp contrast to the surrounding characters (the wedding; when she looks for Michael at the compound). As she falls in with the family, her colours become muted. In terms of gender portrayal (something the film almost-understandably struggles with; it never comes close to passing the Bechdel test), Kay certainly fares better as a character than Apollonia, who is little more than an object of desire. Her willingness to be there for Michael is almost questionable however. Yet, ultimately this is a quintessential story about men, in a world where women had not yet encroached as individuals separate from men (it's no accident that the women get a greater role in Part III). One can suggest that the fact that all the women are defined by their male connections is less the fault of the material than it is the reality of the profession and period.<br/><br/>The Godfather, possibly by virtue of being a period piece, has barely aged in 40 years. Sure, the issues it discusses and the world it portrays are transformed, but like a painting it captures beautifully a freeze frame, a snapshot period of aspiration and ambition. It will continue to be adored for years to come."

"Johnnydark_sd","9","1","2","14 May 2014"," The Ten Lessons I Learned With ""The Godfather""
","The Ten Lessons I Learned With ""The Godfather""<br/><br/>Lesson I:<br/><br/>""A truly rich man is one who has powerful friends."" Surround yourself with people as much or more influence, intelligence and power you have. They will be useful to ensure a good view them from society.<br/><br/>Lesson II:<br/><br/>""Do not hate your enemies, disrupts reasoning."" The less they know who your enemies are, the better. There cautiously and methodically based on their reason. In a game of chess the player only announces the ""checkmate"" to finish the opponent.<br/><br/>Lesson II:<br/><br/>""Truly great men were not born great, they became great."" Man must make your destination and never sit and wait for their arrival. Sartre once said:""Man is born, finds himself in the world, and then he sets."" Note that this definition is never final.<br/><br/>Lesson IV:<br/><br/>""Let your friends underestimate your qualities and your enemies overestimate your faults."" Show your real ""I"" for their actions in the world. Words have power, but their actions only make them powerful. Therefore, learn to ignore all the praise and unnecessary harm to his ego.<br/><br/>Lesson V:<br/><br/>""He'll make a great offer."" Always have more than one ace up his sleeve, so you can make anyone surrender to your desires. Learn to create traps for people to enter, even unintentionally, in your game.<br/><br/>Lesson VI:<br/><br/>""Friends and business, water and oil."" Mixing business with friendships is like letting a monkey watching a bunch of bananas, that is, it will not work.<br/><br/>Lesson VII:<br/><br/>""If history has taught us anything, it's that anyone can be killed. "" Treat problems with accuracy and intelligence and you can delete them one by one. Plan your actions always in view the order you want to achieve. Here goes that maxim: ""the end justifies the means.""<br/><br/>Lesson VIII: ""A man who is not devoted to his family, is not a real man."" Put the welfare of his family before everything. As it will be your foundation, its stronghold. If she is not well, you surely will not be. Remember that the family did not constitute just those who have blood ties with you, some friends are like brothers.<br/><br/>Lesson IX:<br/><br/>""Learn to hear all opinions and never tell what you're really thinking."" For most people disagree with us, it is highly recommended listen to what they mean. They can say something you had not noticed, or have an innovative vision on the subject. However, speak only what is necessary. Don't go around telling what you like or dislike, what they do, finally follow this idea: people just need you to know about what is absolutely necessary that they know. Just beyond can harm you in the future leaving you vulnerable in the face of certain situations.<br/><br/>Lesson X:<br/><br/>""Keep your friends close and your enemies even closer."" Nothing to declare war on your enemies openly, it improves your mental alertness. Keep it close so you can confuse it with false information about themselves. Let him think that is part of your team, and then when he least expects it gives the boat quickly.<br/><br/>Extra Lessons <br/><br/>Lesson XI:<br/><br/>""Do favors."" By doing so people will always have the feeling that something should you and one day you may charge them these favors.<br/><br/>Lesson XII:<br/><br/>""He who depends on others depends on shadows."" The focus here is not about not depend on anyone, but, knowing the right people you could tell that in time of need you do not stay in the hand.<br/><br/>Lesson XIII:<br/><br/>""The enemies of your friends are your enemies too.""<br/><br/>Do not take a traitor to his true friends. Learn enjoy them without hurting the friendship. If you are friends with someone just because it is something you should have in common, then everyone who meddle in his way are getting in yours too."

An epic tale of a 1940s New York Mafia family and their struggle to protect their empire from rival families as the leadership switches from the father to his youngest son. one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family ""business."" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare.

","OK so if you have even the slightest knowledge of American film you know about the film The Godfather, and chances are that you don't need me to tell you how great it is. However I love talking about my favorite films, and so I am writing this review mostly just for my own enjoyment.<br/><br/>First let me touch on the acting and the characters. The acting in The Godfather is some of the best acting ever put on the big screen, boasting the two names Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, both of which are acting legends. First let me touch on Al Pacino's performance. What makes Al Pacino's performance as Michael Corleone so incredible is the character's transformation from the beginning of the film to the end. At the start of the film, Michael tells his girlfriend Kate that he is not like his father. He does not kill or steal, which is true in the beginning. However, as the film progresses, he turns into a much different man than he is at the start of the film, and by the end becomes almost the exact opposite of what he was, eventually being the cause of one of the best endings to a film in the history of cinema. I don't need to tell you what that ending is. On the other hand, Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is also incredible for many of the same reasons. His character also changes from the start of the film to the end because in the end, he is the one to make peace with the other families. He, in the end, becomes what Michael was at the beginning of the film. Michael on the other hand becomes what his father was in the beginning, and both actors are able to portray this change so, so well. <br/><br/>One of the best things about The Godfather is that you can watch it over and over again, and it really does get better with every viewing. My first watching of The Godfather, I immediately hailed it as one of my favorites, and every time I have watched it since I have actually liked it even more. Not many films have such a high replay value, and a replay value is always the sign of a great film. I could watch The Godfather once a week and it would never get old, and that is one of the best compliments I could give a film. However there is an experience for the first time viewer when you hear Michael say ""Yes I do denounce him,"" for the first time, and you experience the onslaught that follows that iconic line. <br/><br/>Over all, as most would agree, The Godfather is undeniably one of the greatest films ever made. I cannot pick my top favorite film of all time, but this is definitely in my top 5, and probably in my top 3. If you have not seen The Godfather, do yourself a favor and see why it is hailed as one of the greatest films ever made.<br/><br/>The Godfather obviously gets a 10 out of 10"

","The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema[4]—and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre.[5] Now ranked as the second greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute,[6] it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990. The Godfather was a blockbuster, breaking many box office records to become the highest grossing film of 1972. It earned $81.5 million in theatrical rentals in North America during its initial release,[30] increasing its earnings to $85.7 million through a reissue in 1973,[31] and including a limited re-release in 1997 it ultimately earned an equivalent exhibition gross of $135 million.[2] It displaced Gone with the Wind to claim the record as the top rentals earner, a position it would retain until the release of Jaws in 1975.[32][33] News articles at the time proclaimed it was the first film to gross $100 million in North America,[32] but such accounts are erroneous since this record in fact belongs to The Sound of Music, released in 1965.[34] The film repeated its native success overseas, earning in total an unprecedented $142 million in worldwide theatrical rentals, to become the highest net earner.[35] Profits were so high for The Godfather that earnings for Gulf & Western Industries, Inc., which owned Paramount Pictures, jumped from seventy-seven cents per share to three dollars and thirty cents a share for the year, according to a Los Angeles Times article, dated December 13, 1972.[32] To date, it has grossed between $245 million and $286 million in worldwide box office receipts,[36] and adjusted for ticket price inflation in North America, ranks among the top 25 highest- grossing films"
"awesomesteinberg","10","1","2","24 April 2014"," No Words Can Describe How Good This Movie Is (Except for ""Flat-Out Amazing"")
","When I first went into this movie, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. Sure, it often was on the top of lists of the Greatest Films Ever Made, but that was likely to create nearly-impossible hype. (Which had previously caused disappointment upon my first viewing of ""Citizen Kane"") I had previously found the movie in an article called ""Movies You Hate the First Time but Love the Second."" And it was also three hours long, so it would definitely have its slow scenes. (I was only able to make through the first 90 minutes of ""Lawrence of Arabia"") Cautiously, I turned the movie on. And within minutes, all my doubts disappeared.<br/><br/>For those of you who haven't seen it, ""The Godfather"" is the story of Michael Corleone, the son of Vito Corleone, a powerful Mafia boss. He initially tries to distance himself from the family business as much as possible, but he slowly gets drawn in, until his father passes control of the family down to him. So what is it about this movie that makes it such a classic? (""Everything"" would be too obvious and brief, so I'll try to go into more detail.)<br/><br/>The best part of this movie is, of course, the acting. Marlon Brando is fantastic as Don Vito, so obviously he really deserved his win of the Best Actor Oscar. (Although he infamously refused the award as a protest against Native Americans' portrayals in film) He really sells the fact that he is a powerful man, but also isn't as bad as one would think, and just cares about the family. Al Pacino as Michael is excellent in all his subtlety, as he goes through his transformation from a really nice guy into the ruthless head of the family. (Although from what I've heard, he goes even further in Part II, which I have yet to see) Diane Keaton as Kay, Michael's girlfriend really manages to stand out in her supporting role despite being surrounded by amazing screen legends in the main roles. James Caan as Sonny is fantastic, Robert Duvall as Tom is great, Richard S. Castellano as Clemenza is just as good, I could go on forever, but I need to finish this up.<br/><br/>Another great part of the movie is the script, (Based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo) which wisely knows to focus on and develop the characters, which are very well aided by the fine performances of the cast. The film lets us spend a lot of time with these characters until we feel we know them as well as our own family. (Okay, not QUITE that far, but you get the idea) The way the script handles these characters is brilliant: Despite the fact that they are in the Mafia, they are not necessarily evil. The movie spends a lot of time with them, and they seem like really nice people. (Well, except for the other families) And whenever the characters tell a story, because of how interesting the script makes the characters and their stories, all you have in your head is that story, and it even feels like its own movie.<br/><br/>The film has a really memorable score by Nino Rota; it doesn't have to be big or bombastic, it doesn't need to have a bunch of choir members singing frantically, it is more relaxed and melancholy. The cinematography by Gordon Willis is really beautiful, with plenty of shades of orange that perfectly complement the violence and gore of the different murders throughout the film. (Which aren't terribly brutal, but definitely for ages 14 and up) And the film is pretty well edited as well: Despite its long length, it rarely feels like it is three hours long, and when it occasionally slows down, those moments are really far between, and fairly brief. The only real complaint I have about the movie is that some things happen that I felt could have been explained a little more, but that's just me nitpicking.<br/><br/>So overall, ""The Godfather"" is flat out amazing, I can't compliment this movie enough. Nearly everything about it is perfect, I give it a 10/10.<br/><br/>(But seriously, this only won 3 Oscars? Are you kidding me?)"
"Cutesy2","10","1","2","22 April 2014"," The Oscar-winning 1972 masterpiece about the Corleone family
","THE GODFATHER,"" which has been re-released on its 25th anniversary, is a jewel that still glows across time -- and in the dark. Gordon Willis's cinematography, considered revolutionary at the time, plunged its characters into pools of semi-darkness. Studio executives -- always the last ones to get it -- howled in the screening rooms. But in this saga of an Italian-American family's bid for power, we were watching the American Dream operating in the darkest shadows.<br/><br/>Luckily, America saw the light. The movie, released in March 1972 and directed by an unknown eccentric called Francis Ford Coppola, was a smash hit -- the first film to top $100 million in its initial release. It won three Academy Awards (for Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Screenplay Adaptation). It lit a fire under the careers of Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. It entered the pantheon of American cinema; and it has informed virtually every crime movie in the last quarter century, from ""Scarface"" to ""Donnie Brasco.""<br/><br/>In the story, which Mario Puzo and Coppola adapted from Puzo's novel, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) presides over a tight-knit clan which includes his hotheaded eldest son, Sonny (James Caan), his adopted son and family adviser, Tom Hagen (Duvall), and youngest son, Michael (Pacino), the apple of his father's eye who has -- thus far -- been kept out of the family business.<br/><br/>That business happens to be prostitution, protection rackets and gambling. In a constant struggle for power among New York's rival gangster families, Don Corleone rules with Machiavellian grace.<br/><br/>When adversaries refuse his wishes, he ""makes them an offer they can't refuse."" The procedure is simple: His goons point a gun against the head of anyone who needs persuasion. But Don Corleone is also a benevolent figure who -- in this morally relative underworld -- rights the wrongs of his friends and relatives.<br/><br/>Into this world comes Michael, the returning war hero (the year is 1946), who finally agrees to take his father's mantle and run the family. His ascension is the stuff of American cinematic myth. Standing before his father, who lies in a hospital bed after barely surviving an attempt on his life, Michael kisses Don Corleone's hand and whispers, ""I'm with you now.""<br/><br/>Coppola, then in his thirties, reluctantly heeded the advice of his friend George Lucas to make this picture. To him, this was a commercially unpalatable project that had nothing to do with his personal ambition: to change the way Hollywood made movies.<br/><br/>How wrong he was. There are volumes that could be written -- and have been -- about the movie's uniformly powerful performances; its precedent-setting editing by William Reynolds and Peter Zinner; Nino Rota's haunting score; and Dean Tavoularis's evocative set design. But Coppola must get most of the credit.<br/><br/>With Puzo, he forged an epic tragedy about America, capitalism, family, greed, treachery and love. He showed us -- with almost Shakespearean gravitas -- the errors of hasty vengeance and the wisdom of assured leadership. He gave us a great American picture, full of incredible images and lasting moments. There are too many to choose from, but I leave you with two here: When Michael -- hearing about the assault on his father -- scrambles into a telephone booth to call the family, his girlfriend (Diane Keaton) waits outside in the cold. It's clear that she's literally being kept out of the picture. Much later, when a door is closed between her and her husband -- as he conducts family business -- this estrangement is not only reconfirmed, it sets us up for ""The Godfather, Part II,"" a movie that achieved the impossible: to equal its predecessor."

","The Godfather Review by FUTURE TV (Al Carlson)<br/><br/>The Godfather is a film considered by most to be one of the greatest ever made. From The American Film Institute to as voted by users on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) it is consider to be one of the best. As a film that ranks as high as other masterpieces including Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction and 12 Angry Men, The Godfather is an exceptional piece of cinema excellence that is flawless and is simply the pinnacle crime drama.<br/><br/>The Godfather revolves around the Corleone's, an Italian family with deep roots in the New York City mafia. The head of the Corleone's is Don Vito Corleone, a man who takes care of his family and demands respect in return. His son Michael however, who just returned home from World War II, doesn't want to become involved with the family business. The Sollozzo's, a family of drug dealers, confront Don and request protection in exchange for profits from the Sollozzo's drug sales. But Don declines the offer, for he is against selling narcotics. The rejected offer starts what turns into an all out mafia war between the two families with Michael diving deep into the mafia lifestyle.<br/><br/>The characters are portrayed by a legendary all-star cast including Marlon Brando as Don, Al Pacino as his son Michael and James Caan as Don's oldest son Sonny. The casting for this film has been considered by many to be the best casted film in history for their astonishing performances. All three main actors were nominated for an academy award, but only Marlon Brando won an Oscar for best actor in a leading role. It's fascinating to watch how these characters change over the course of the movie, with one in particular changing drastically.<br/><br/>Directer Francis Ford Coppola, being raised in an Italian-American family in New York, understood Italian culture exceptionally and made the film very authentically. Everything from the wedding dances to the cuisine to the terms used by the characters in Sicilian come from Coppola's first-hand knowledge of Italian-American culture. Italian composer Nino Rota did an outstanding job making the soundtrack for the film, despite not getting the Oscar for best music (but he did win an Oscar for his work in the sequel, The Godfather: Part II). Virtually everyone recognizes that iconic trumpet solo once it starts playing. He also wrote the score for another great Italian film 8 1/2. <br/><br/>This film should be immediately followed up by it's sequel, The Godfather: Part II, which also won best picture. The series still holds the title of most best picture awards for a film series to this day. They're both flawless crime dramas and have earned their titles as some of the best pieces of cinema ever. I will guarantee you won't be able to see this film only once, as it gets better after continual viewings. There is really nothing more to add other than if you haven't seen this movie yet, it's about time you did. The Godfather is a movie you can't refuse."
"nasarkkhattak","10","1","2","9 April 2014"," A masterpiece
","Mario Puzo creates a magnificent movie - a must watch, especially for the crime lovers. Though, not crime, but politics. In this movie, a complete world of the underworld is shown. Don Vito Corleone, the head of the Corleone family, and almost the most powerful leader in the five families that make the main pentagon of the underworld. Vito Corleone has his two sons - Santino Corleone and Michael Corleone. His consigliere, Tom Hagens, who is also said as the brothers of Sunny and Michael after he was adopted.<br/><br/>The main feature over which a director should notice is developing character for actors in a film. The guy Mario Puzo did this majestically. He developed the character of Sunny Corleone as emotional, from the start after he hit a photographer while he developed a calm character for Tom and Michael both. Another flamboyant work done by the director was that Michael wasn't so emotional and like aggressive. But the director showed that a little of his father genes went into him. And he got paranoid with the passage of time. That's the work of a brilliant director that you show reality.<br/><br/>Vito Corleone makes his way through the five families and everything is going calmly before the Don is attacked at a time. His bodyguard Paulie was bribed and he was shown as sick, therefore, the Don didn't take Paulie with him and took his another adopted son Freddie. But Freddie is not so cunning and is shown as less intelligent and less clever. The gangsters attack and Freddie's gun falls as the Don is buying fruits. Hence the Don gets shot but he is still not dead, he survives.<br/><br/>Michael handles the responsibility with Tom and goes on."

","The Godfather is a not just a film but its a movement, it defines the past of the Italian American culture. A past that many American Italians are ashamed of but a past that I think the American people should know about. Any Italian could tell you that the principles of family that are portrayed in this film reflect the traditions of the old country. Family comes first before anything, this is a value that is passed down from generation to generation in the Italian culture, it was good to see that Coppola portrayed this in such a strong manner. It takes filming to a whole new level and changed the way we see films. Brando, Deniro and Pacino are genius! The acting compliments the impeccable work of Francis Ford Coppola. In my books this is a must see film, the book is not so bad either. The work of Coppola makes a long film seem like minutes."

I wish i could've been in those years when the life was a lot more tougher than it is nowadays.

"thesouthfamily2-552-707097","10","1","2","3 January 2014"," Don't ever take sides against the family
","Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can understand just by the way the characters look at each other and talk to each other. Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so ""The Godfather"" becomes something of a rarity. So much so that ""The Godfather"" (played brilliantly by Marlon Brando) himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael (Al Pacino), who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprise. Pacino plays Michael close to his vest; he has learned from his father never to talk in front of outsiders, never to trust anyone unnecessarily, to take advice but keep his own counsel. What else can I say about this movie that no one else has said: it's a classic and for good reason."

In between the scenes we got to know that all the visitors came to attend the wedding of Don's daughter.It would have been very important occasion in any father's life but even at this occasion also Don shows his generosity and kindness who came to his asylum. <br/><br/>This film shows how man is hunger for power and how a man turned violent to protect his family.<br/><br/>THE GODFATHER is best of all his genres not only for its story but also for performances,editing,cinematography and above all for its direction.

It stars Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, son of Don Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando in his greatest performance. Michael at first tries to stay away from the family business, but after his father is almost assassinated by rivals, he volunteers to murder the responsible, and after his father dies he takes the family business leading to the second installment in the Godfather trilogy. My favorite part of the movie is the baptism scene, which showcases both Michael's descent into darkness, and Francis Ford Coppola's great talent in directing.

"adam-moore1308","8","1","2","29 December 2013"," Certainly overrated but still a great film
","This film is often regarded as perfect including the acting which is renowned as some of the best in the history of cinema. However I was quite underwhelmed by the performances except for Marlon Brando who is truly captivating whenever he is on screen (which is surprisingly not that often considering he won best LEAD actor for his performance.) Even Al Pacino's performance is both emotionless and forgettable in my opinion. I'm not going to waste time talking about everything that makes this film good because everyone has done that. What I am going to do is just mention some of the reasons why, overall, I was disappointed in the film. My first problem with the film is that I often found the story stretched thin by too many characters and occasionally found myself confused by the many unfamiliar Italian names that kept popping up. The first two hours of the film are exceptionally entertaining, well made and expertly written. However it is around the two hour mark where what was making the story so captivating is almost completely resolved and we are then forced to sit through another hour of a film that is no longer all that interesting. The three hour run time of the film is certainly unnecessary as even though seeing Michael take over the reigns of the family and watching Vito die is still great stuff it feels like it could have been covered in 15 minutes instead of adding another hour to a film that felt like it had already ended. I do understand that my opinion will not be popular but I felt that I should mention my problems with the film and stop some people being brainwashed by its 9.2 IMDb rating and then instantly saying that its a masterpiece so they could be accepted even though they may have found parts of it boring. I don't know... Perhaps my expectations were too high."

","It captures a dark world,at it's darkest and most violent,yet there are moments of beauty sprinkled throughout.This is what I enjoyed about The Godfather.I'm not a huge fan of mafia themed films,but I will give this film credit for presenting it with such realism.We get lost in it's realities and we forget often throughout the film that it is,in fact just a movie and that it is all play acting.I was wowed by how well casted it was and how well suited for their characters each actor was,in particular Marlon Brando.For all of it's dark theme and violent content,The Godfather still manages to come out looking like a true masterpiece."

","This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 41 years old and has aged well.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic."

"rmj012","10","1","2","24 September 2013"," The Ultimate Perfection.
","""The Godfather"" is the perfect film. The 1970s was the greatest decade in the history of motion pictures for turning out masterpieces. Above all else, what captures the viewers in this movie--arguably the decade's premier masterpiece--is the stark dichotomy of family bonds versus terrible betrayal. ""The Godfather"" causes viewers to be enthralled by the harshest possible realization of moral relativism that could possibly be imagined. But admittedly, it is our connection to and fascination with the Corleone family--every bit as dysfunctional, violent, and disturbing as one would picture an organized crime family to be--that makes this film only more beloved and respected as the years pass on. For example, when fans of the film discuss what they love about the movie, the expected level of disturbing violence in it is rarely mentioned as being remarkable. What fans remember most is the great writing and the spectacular performances. Fans are thrilled to see a dark side of American life from a distance and that very few people ever see all while they root for their beloved Corleones. ""The Godfather"" has stood the test of time, and it always will."
"harm246","9","1","2","22 September 2013"," A Must See
","I recently watched the film The Godfather directed by Francis Ford Coppolla and based on the book by Mario Puzo. The film stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall. The film takes place in New York in a post-World War II setting. The films is a stirring drama filled with poignant moments throughout.<br/><br/>This film follows the lives of the Corleone family who is one of the five organized crime families that control the city and state of New York. This film takes you through the good and the bad sides of an organized crime family. The film has moments where you forget that this family is a mob family who commits murders like others commit minor traffic violations. Some of the more memorable scenes in the movie include the very opening scene in the movie when The Godfather (Vito Corleone) is sitting in a dark home office setting where he is receiving any guest to his daughter's wedding who has a request for him. Apparently there is an old Sicilian tradition that says that a father cannot refuse any reasonable request on the day that his daughter is to be married. Why haven't I been invited to more Italian weddings? I'm getting really tired of dealing with my wife telling me to clean up after I make a mess. Where is a Godfather when you need him? Another scene that caught my attention is a meeting that the Corleone family has with a man by the name of Sollozzo. This man has an offer for the family to begin moving the family into the drug business. The scene gets me because you would think that a mob boss would be up for whatever if it means making money, but not Don Corleone. He almost seems like a respectable business man who would not do anything that has to do with drugs. This scene is pivotal as it sets in motion the events of the rest of the movie. Upon the refusal of Sollozzo's offer he sets up an assassination attempt on The Godfather's life which is carried out but fails as the Don lives through the attempt. After the assassination attempt there has to be a reaction from the family and to everyone's surprise this gets Michael Corleone involved in the family business that he swore he would never be involved with. Michael's involvement leads him to carry out the assassination of Sollozzo and the chief of police. This act of vengeance leads Michael to a yearlong hide out in Italy while the rest of the family and their associates go to the mats for a bitter mob war. There are many other moments in the film to be seen and the film moves in a very unpredictable way that has to be seen rather than told in a film review.<br/><br/>One of the best aspects of the movie is the background music that plays at certain times in the movie. It is nothing that is going to blow you away, and it isn't anything that you are going to recognize unless you are familiar with some sort of dark orchestra that I have never heard of before. The movie plays music at the right times and it does an amazing job of building the suspense of the scenes where it has been included. One example is toward the end of the movie when Michael's nephew is being baptized and the movie is going through a series of parallel cuts and the music does an amazing job of building the suspense during this scene. This is a classic example of someone doing their homework and realizing that sometimes music can be done to the point of overkill. No worries of that here just a great job by the sound crew.<br/><br/>Another fine job in the movie is the acting. The cast of this movie was brilliantly put together and each character is played absolutely brilliantly. From The Godfather down to the Mafioso's who work for him each character is played with precision and by men and women who seem to fit the roles that they were cast for as if they were leading their normal lives. The casting crew gets a round of applause from me for the job that they did with this film.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a film that will stand the test of time when it comes to motion pictures. With a brilliant plot and a moving storyline this movie is one of the best that I have ever seen. The characters portray a group that seem for all intents and purposes to be a real family who love and care about one another while going about their daily lives of committing murders and breaking the law. This film will be one of the greats of all time and it will leave viewers with a sense of wanting to be a part of a crime syndicate like the Corleone family. I encourage anyone who enjoys movies that tell a story in a moving and powerful way to go and see The Godfather. I promise that you will not be disappointed and you will be begging for more by the time that the movie is over. My overall film rating for this movie is a resounding 5 out of 5 trigger fingers because I think that they work better for this movie than stars or thumbs. Go see the movie and enjoy!"

Marlon Brando for me gives the stand out performance in a fantastic cast. The film is captivating from start to finish. There really isn't enough praise I can give for this film, it really deserves its name in the greatest films of all time, if not THE greatest. The film does a brilliant job at immersing you into the story of the Corleone family. You will struggle to find a film as engrossing and powerful as this one. I only wish films of today where made with such passion and brilliance. 10/10 a must watch for any film fan."

It 'a film that appeals to all ages, however long, is full of twists and ideas more than interesting. My favorite character is Don Vito in which the wise direction of Francis Ford Coppola has allowed us to create a character that would become an icon of international cinema.

If you saw the movie, try and book of the same title by Mario Puzzo ... simply help visual memory to ""see"" the characters ... the book is very good and worth reading after you see the movie. Marlon Brando's performance is magnificent, it's the perfect actor for the role. The storyline is as good, and the whole cast has done its job and actors including Duval, De Niro and Al Pacino. Not very often blends so well a movie. In the second part of the movie was pretty broken thread by death character Don Vito Corleone. Al Pacino seemed too young for the part."

"yellowcab643","10","1","2","19 July 2013"," The Godfather is an OK flick.
","I see that this show is #2 on the list of successful movies at IMDb so it would be impossible for me to more flatter it. I saw this movie when I was in Junior High School. My parents were all about Law School at the University and my feeling was this was a hero movie about an outlaw. <br/><br/>There is a frightening scene in this movie about a horse's head being found in the bed of the Godfather's enemy's bed. Crossing the Godfather is forbidden, per Se, and he defends his Italian Mafia friends with a machine gun. And, I think it looked like a foreign film because it takes place in a rich castle on luxurious estate. <br/><br/>The Godfather character in this film was a likable, ""regular person's"" advocate. I had Italian people in my family (as well as Gangsters in my school). By the way, as a result of my literary studies, I have found God is synonymous with dog so Godfather is a derogatory slang term."
"aniku_matador","10","1","2","11 July 2013"," amazing
","The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake."

"donuthaters12","9","1","2","7 July 2013"," Coppola's Iconic Film
","Regarded as one of the most important and influential films of the century. This film has definitely changed the way gangster films are created. Back in the golden days of cinema, gangster films were notable for their violence and profanity. The Godfather changed the way contemporary gangster or crime films are approached. I don't want the review of this film be based on the film's impact but rather focusing on the film on its own.<br/><br/>The film's story is based on a novel by Mario Puzo and written for the screen by Francis Ford Coppola. Puzo's novel has been, before the film, has been a commercial and critical hit. I have not read Puzo's novel but Coppola's writing for this film is definitely entertaining. The film may have metaphors and deep layered themes but to me, it wasn't something I was looking for, as the story of this family is so damn entertaining that it did not need to be layered to be interesting. The strongest areas of this film focuses on the structure and functioning of the family business. The film also depicts the rise of Michael Corleone and how different he becomes when he becomes involved in the business he never wanted to be in the first place.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola has created the most acclaimed films of all time and all seem to be confined in the decade of the 70's. Each one of those films, aside from the Godfather sequel, is completely different from one another and at least one will appeal to a person. Coppola focused a lot on the culture and family aspect of this film which made this something unique. Though different from previous gangster films, it did not sacrifice on the areas that makes it exciting like the violence and tension. It still focuses on the competing families and the betrayal that is familiar in the genre. Brilliant direction has allowed every scene to be important in driving the story, there is no scene that does not drive anything for either the characters or the plot.<br/><br/>Gordon Willis' cinematography feels like a picture or a video from an old camera that has aged. The film is dominated by a golden hue that gives the film that feeling of age.The film successfully feels like a period film and immerses you in the time period of the 1940's. Scenes like the wedding and the baptism are breathtaking. Willis has added in the film's lasting power as there are very few films that captures a moment in time so well as what he did for The Godfather and it's sequel.<br/><br/>The film may feel slow to some people but I feel that it's important as it allows for characters to develop and the story to have more breathing room. The film is driven in detailed and intricate performances rather than spectacular and grand moments.<br/><br/>How many of you have watched this film or at the very least heard the theme and gets stuck on your head for hours after you've heard it. As I am writing this, it's playing in my head. The score is something that would be heard in funerals or some other sad dramatic moment. The score is stays faithful to the film's cultural roots and at the same time making it something that sounds from a classic gangster films. Due to the film's score being so memorable and effective, it has become something composers of films in the same genre to go back to, in creating their scores.<br/><br/>Iconic role played by an iconic actor. Vito Corleone can never be pictured played by another actor aside from Marlon Brando. The actor has played characters that are typical from leading actors and so seeing him in a character that was definitely at least 10 to 15 years older than his own during production, was a revelation. He embodied this respected and vulnerable man, and without a doubt outshone every actor in this film. Pacino was great as Michael but I felt he shows more of his acting capabilities in the second and third film. The entire cast works well together and each performance can be labeled as their most strongest in their career.<br/><br/>This is one of the best films from Coppola. I cannot say this is his magnum opus because other films he has written and directed, Apocalypse Now and The Godfather Part II, are equally as powerful. The Godfather is an example of an amazing story, brilliantly acted and excellent direction in adapting an already iconic novel."

Michael goes from a nice guy that doesn't want to be like his family to a cold and menacing crime lord rather quickly and without any real buildup.<br/><br/>2. Sudden time jumps without you even noticing until one of the characters points them out or you just have to realize it by yourself. I mean come on at least give us some indication that some time is going to pass.<br/><br/>3. Did I miss something ? When did they say that Connie and Carlo have had another baby? I don't know maybe it is my mistake but I'm going to point it out anyway.While Michael is still in Italy we can clearly see that Connie is pregnant and is soon going to have a baby.And after Michael returns home the movie jumps forward a few years where we can clearly see that Michael has a 3year old son.But then in one scene Michael is asked to be a godfather to Connies and Carlos son! I was like WTH ?! I had to Google it to find out that they have had another son."
"joakim-vassvik","10","1","2","27 June 2013"," The Godfather indeed!
","As much as I would like to do justice for this movie - there is little I can say that will help people understand the grandeur of this film. The Godfather sends you through a riveting journey into the life of one of the five great families. And with a cast as breathtakingly awe-inspiring as this, you are bound to be on the edge of your seat from the very first wedding scene.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is in itself fantastic, but it should not go unmentioned how it is not only a good movie - but a very realistic depiction of the harsh life of the criminal organizations, and their internal structure based mostly on nepotism.<br/><br/>The soundtrack (which is too often ignored as an important aspect of storytelling in these reviews) by Nino Rota perfectly underlines the true sadness of this intricate storyline."
"stephen7272","8","1","2","20 April 2013"," The Sicilian Way doesn't work in the Anglo-Saxon world
","If you lived in Sicily over the last 3,000 years you'd be pretty used to death and devastation by now. Sicily is bang smack in the middle of three prominent pre-Christian empires: the Greek post-Alexander Hellenistic empire, the Roman Empire and the Carthagian-Lavantine Empire. All three of them fought tooth and nail for 3 centuries to control Sicily. And I haven't mentioned yet the tyrants who used to rule Sicilian cities such as Syracuse, for whom the Greek engineer Archimedes worked. Then came the bully-boy, Normans, the Hapsburg Empire, Napoleon, Mussolini, the Nazis...oh where does it end?<br/><br/>In other words, dying, or threatening others with death, is just something else to do on a Sunday afternoon in Sicily. The Sicilians also learnt how to barter with their masters of the day, and how to subjugate their own.<br/><br/>Transfer all of this to a quiet neighbourhood of New York City, and it's like trusting King Kong into the city to clean the windows of the Empire State Building. <br/><br/>The Godfather, adapted from Mario Puzo's novel, shows how capable the Sicilian Mafia are at subduing the authorities to run their own profiteering rackets. But what's interesting is how after the Godfather was shown, how the authorities decided they had had enough of being manipulated by Sicilians. It wasn't long before they put every effort into suppressing these usurpers. The US authorities regained the role the Greeks, Romans and Carthagians had once held.<br/><br/>Sicilian management is impressive, but not as impressive as good old Dutch-Anglo-Saxon mastery of all things profitable.<br/><br/>A point of interest, the decapitation of the horse-head scene in this movie has its foundation in Roman Chariot racing on The Field Of Mars. One of the winning horses would be sacrificed, it's blood mixed with the bodies of the unborn children and its head nailed to the door of the Forum."

I'm pretty sure it could have been shrunk down to 2 hours.<br/><br/>There are some really good scenes in this movie. The hits that are made on various people were really well done for it's time. Don't get me wrong, you could see the blood wasn't real, but back when this was made i am pretty sure they didn't have the effects and make up we have now.<br/><br/>The story was really good, but it was a very slow paced movie. It took a while for the movie to get going. There is a lot of dialogue and if you listen to it properly and get into the movie you will enjoy it.<br/><br/>The Corleone family is a family you don't want to mess with. They take no prisoners. If you are their friends they will look after you, but if you get on their wrong side, you won't live long enough to regret it.<br/><br/>The casting was really good. Marlon Brando played the Godfather, Don Vito Corleone. This was the best role he has played that I have seen so far. Al Pacino played his son Michael. A brilliant performance. He looks so young in this film... I nearly didn't recognise him. James Caan played another son, Sonny. I am not a huge James Caan fan, but he did well in this movie.<br/><br/>The Godfather is not the best gangster movie I have ever seen. I think Goodfellas is still the best in my opinion. But I can understand why this is a classic. This was probably the first big gangster film.<br/><br/>I loved the soundtrack too... the theme to this film is legendary. I have listened to it a lot. Slash plays it on guitar really well at his concerts.<br/><br/>I will give this film a 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>A good movie, but a mission to watch due to the length. I will be watching The Godfather Part II very soon.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204"
"Keith-berry30","7","1","2","30 September 2012"," The Gother Father Review
","The Godfather The film The Godfather takes place in New York and some parts of Italy during the mob era in the late 1930's and '40's. The story begins with a mob boss Don Vito Corleone, also known as the Godfather, who conducts ""business"" out of his office. The scenes that take place here are where most plots and deals are being prepared. Usually trouble is being made when scenes take place here. Corleone is asked by a New York gangster, Sollozzo, for protection in exchange for profit from the drug trafficking business. Advised by his adopted son and family lawyer, Tom Hagen, and since he is not fond of drugs, Corleone decides to decline Sollozzo's offer. Following an assassination attempt on Corleone conducted by Sollozzo, his oldest son Sonny takes over the family business. Soon after this assignment to power, Sonny is assassinated. The next in line is Corleone's youngest son, Michael, the main character, who is a World War II hero. Michael had vowed to never become part of the family business but is slowly falling into the position due to his brother's death. After he is involved in a mob killing, Michael is forced to move to Sicily, where his father was born, until everything calms down. A movement that is frequently seen throughout the film is hand gestures. These are usually made as a signal for help, to kill someone or used to get a point across. An object that is seen often during the film is a gun. The gun represents quick resolution and necessity for survival.<br/><br/>Although this film is a classic, it isn't well written because the scenes were scattered. It was also hard to follow and I had to watch it twice in order to understand what was happening. In addition, it was very lengthy. It seemed like there pointless scenes in the film.<br/><br/>In The Godfather the viewer is able to see the different groups of people throughout the movie. One of the main groups in the movie is Don Corleone and his sons. Another group is the heads of the five families. These men would meet during movie to negotiate money, territory and other things that involve mob concerns. A different group in the film is the rest of the family. These people are important because the mobsters cherish, protect and believe family comes first against anything.<br/><br/>In the film little things are the cause of big things. For instance, when Don Corleone decided to decline from Sollozzo's offer, the consequence was the hit that Sollozzo put on him. Another example is when Sonny's sister was beat by her husband Sonny decides to go after him but ends up trapped at the toll booth where he was assassinated. A similar example is after Sonny is killed, Michael becomes head of the family business. All films are uncanny. The Godfather is my MLK film, therefore it is uncanny.From the film I learned that even though you are in a ""family"" business you still are not able to trust anyone fully. The message of this movie is that when conducting a business there is always someone out to get you. Especially when you are at the top you have to watch your surroundings and who you decide to trust because once you at the top the only direction you can go is downward."

So looking forward to part 2!<br/><br/>I loved Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) for he was the Godfather and his wisdom and ways were just brilliantly thought out. His love for his family and ability to keep peace within the Dons was great! Vito had his priorities right and was unfortunate to get shot leaving his sons in charge.<br/><br/>The beginning was superb as you got insight to how the Godfather worked and then the events that happened after with the numerous shootings, the loyalty tested, the reluctant son becoming the Godfather and the war between the mobs was just well written and put together. I loved every minute of it! It is an offer you can't refuse!<br/><br/>I would recommend it to any adult and young adult that have a love for movies. This movie is a classic and has every reason to be. The people will need to set aside time to watch it, but once they do, it is worth it!"
"Pierre_D","9","1","2","18 May 2012"," When humanity takes a back seat to the business, you have The Godfather.
","Once again delving into IMDb's Top 250, we come upon The Godfather. Long since clichéd in its use of ""Offer you can't refuse"", the horse incident and its view of the mafia, Godfather remains compelling 40 years after its release.<br/><br/>Vito Corleone is on his last legs. As he enjoys his daughter's wedding, the cesspool of mafiosi politicking makes hay behind his back as his sons vie for control of the family and a monopoly over their section of New York. We see the brutality and efficiency of said underworld at is pinnacle when Corleone convinces a movie producer to give a friend of his a part by beheading his prize horse and leaving the ""note"" in his bed. Any attempt at normalcy is doomed as families are torn apart by violence, secrecy, jealousy and anger as husbands gamble human freight to gain more influence in their inner circles.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando is excellent as the Corleone clan's ""eminence grise"", who wryly dies of natural causes while one of his sons is gunned down at a toll, ostensibly for his actions toward other clans as well as his wife. Betrayals are repaid with quick deaths and the juxtaposition of Michael in a church forsaking violence and hatred (Satan) while eliminating his rivals in the background is chilling.<br/><br/>The epic lasts a good 10 years as we see the evolution of mafia reach from simple prostitution and bribery and gambling to include illicit drugs, somewhat half-heartedly. At the end, Michael Corleone stands alone as Godfather and alone as husband, betraying his wife's trust to keep silent his actions with the Corleone clan. The Godfather is still an epic, sprawling masterpiece that doesn't seem out of date in 2012, scary a thought as that is..."
"The-Sarkologist","7","1","2","3 March 2012"," How a reluctant criminal becomes the Godfather
","This was the biggest grossing film in 1972 when it was released and I am told that it follows closely to the Mario Puzo novel of the same name. The movie is followed by two sequels, which at first I believed were a part of the novel, but later realised that in fact they were separate. They seem to all meld together into one epic, though I will treat them all as separate movies, though I will refer back to the previous films occasionally.<br/><br/>In this movie (which I believe to be the best) we watch the internal and external struggles of the Corleone family and how things slowly change in the life of young Michael Corleone. Michael (Al Pachino) is the central character in the film, though the others of his family, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), Sonito Corleone (James Caan), and Tom Hagan (Robert Duval) are of importance. Looking at the cast though, there are some very competent, and surprising, actors that appear in here. In fact I was surprised to see Diane Keaton (who plays Kay Adams, Michael Corleone's wife) in the film, but then I only just recently saw it for the first time.<br/><br/>This movie is a tale of epic proportions and we watch here how Michael changes through the events of the movie. In the background of war and violence in the streets of New York, Michael, who wants to remain distant from the criminal ways of his family, yet feeling ties of loyalty to his family, is slowly pulled into it. The turning point comes when he is in the hospital to find that all of his father's guards have vanished and he has to make a decision to remain apart from the criminal aspects of his family, or to dive in and save his father's life.<br/><br/>I guess one of the major things here is that you are what you are. No matter how much Michael tries to deny his family's business, he cannot escape the inevitable fact that it is criminal. Even though he could simply walk away from him family, he feels loyal and devoted to him, and even though his father his a criminal, he loves him.<br/><br/>Another interesting thing that I read was in regards to the treatment of women in the film. The film is divided into spheres: the domestic and the business sphere. In the movie all of the women are in the domestic sphere and are not allowed to enter into the business sphere. The movie also details violence towards women to force them into that domestic role. We have the woman that is talked about at the beginning who is violently violated and the man seeking justice. We have the young Corrie who is married at the beginning, kept away from the family business, and beaten up when she refuses to work in the domestic sphere. We have Michael's first wife who is learning to drive, only to be blown up when she starts the car and finally there is Kay Adams, who at the end of the movie is shut out of the business end of the family, after being lied to by Michael.<br/><br/>The movie also deals with respect, in a little bit. At the beginning, Marlon Brando gives a monologue regarding how the man petitioning him only comes to him when he is in trouble, and is never treating him as a friend or even a Godfather. It is not that he does not want to help him, but that he would like to be a friend to the man as opposed to somebody who is only visited when there is trouble.<br/><br/>This movie is epic in proportions, but it is too detailed in places. It is long, and even though some long movies, such as Thin Red Line, are good despite their length, others are simply way too long to really want to sit down and watch. In fact, it took me a while to actually sit and watch these movies because of their length."
"minneswanson","10","1","2","30 November 2011"," The Two of Us
","I recently watched the 1968 French film ""The Two of Us"" directed by Claude Berri, which tells of the development of a relationship between an anti-Semetic old man in the country who becomes the guardian of a young Jewish boy during World War II. (Actually, the title of the French movie translates better to ""The Old Man and the Boy"".) To me, it appears that the scenes in ""The Godfather"" where Vito is an old man in a garden playing with a young boy with a spray can were very much informed by this French film. The film would certainly have been available to Coppola and Brando during the filming of ""The Godfather"". Although it may be stretching things a bit, the actor who portrays the old man in the French film has a very distinct chin, and it may be that Brando came up with the idea of putting tissues in his jowls from observing that actor. I wonder if others have spotted these similarities."

And the first film is the pearl of that package. I drew my expectations extremely high before watching this classic. Unfortunately I had to fall. I didn't get the grain, that cutting-edge I was looking for. Fortunately the fall wasn't that high. I still liked the movie a lot. It was a great picture. A massive film in its genre. I like good mafia films. But I don't fancy them that much. But like I said, in its own genre this picture is a front runner.<br/><br/>The cast is the strongest part of the movie. Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) as The Godfather is like a fist to the eyehole. He is just so boss. At the same time he is so wise and calm. Robert Duvall, Al Pacino and others give a very good contribution, but it is Marlon Brando who shines throughout the movie. The line 'the man who does not spend time with his family, is not a man' is epic.<br/><br/>There are lots of classic music in this movie. Some parts of the movie are in Italian.

"GoWallAndBeal","8","1","2","8 August 2010"," Good, very well-made film, but somewhat overrated
","I think The Godfather is very well-made and a good film on the whole; very well-acted, well-scored, and had effective dialogue, but I think it's somewhat overrated.<br/><br/>This is the story it TRIED to tell........<br/><br/>Michael Corleone is the son of Sicilian Mafia Don Vito Corleone. Unlike his siblings, he wants nothing to do with the family business, and his father wouldn't have it any other way. After getting back from WWII, he wants to shield his girlfriend Kay from his family. But when a rival to Vito named Sollozzo comes along, a chain of events is set into motion that culminates in Vito's life hanging in the balance. Although he wanted nothing to do with the business, he decides to kill those who are a threat to Vito out of love for his father. By so doing, he forced himself to live in exile in Sicily for 3 years, where he learns more of the family/Sicilian tradition, and gets married. Soon after the death of his new wife Apollonia, he was able to return to the US and is reunited with Kay. Only he isn't the same man who she knew from before; he is very much a part of the family business, and indeed is the actual head of the mafia. He wants Kay to marry him, but not so much because he loves her as because of his newly-found Sicilian beliefs in the importance of family. He is now cold and ruthless in the way he deals with his enemies, and by the end of the film, he became the very sort of person that he wanted nothing to do with at the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>This is how the story came across to me..........<br/><br/>Michael Corleone is the son of Sicilian Mafia Don Vito Corleone. Unlike his siblings, he wants nothing to do with the family business, and his father wouldn't have it any other way. After getting back from WWII, he wants to shield his girlfriend Kay from his family. The movie does a dismal job in establishing this, and also does a dismal job in establishing the Michael/Kay relationship. Other than a few lines in the opening wedding scene, we never really got to know Michael back when he was a good man, and we hardly saw any of Michael/Kay together back when their relationship was healthy. So then he kills Sollozzo & that cop, runs to Sicily, then gets hit ""by the thunderbolt"" of Apollonia, whom I found to be very annoying. So we get a montage of Michael's life in Sicily (seen while some very nice music is playing), and all of a sudden he wholeheartedly embraces the Sicilian way of family, mob, etc. Michael comes back to America a changed man, and the film finishes with the process of his transformation being complete, but because of the poor job the film did in establishing who he was prior to the events of the movie, and how the change itself actually happened, Michael becoming what he once opposed ended up having very little impact on me.<br/><br/>Still, a good movie on the whole, with some great scenes like the restaurant shooting and the front yard talk between Michael & Vito."
"FleurDeLis777","9","1","2","1 February 2010"," Chef d'oeuvre in the history of cinematography
","I watched the movie for the first time yesterday. I have heard about it growing up, everyone constantly quotes the famous ""Godfather"" but it wasn't until yesterday that I understand why this movie has gained so much admiration, and maintained this strong momentum throughout the years. A chef d'oeuvre is an understatement, it is by far the best movie I have ever seen, and I have seen many good movies.<br/><br/>The directing is breathtaking, especially the scenes in Sicily, they're so strong – they take you to another world, a world of traditions and values while haunted with violence and power. I loved how Michael Corleone met his first wife, how he went to ask for permission to see her again. It was such a pure and innocent relationship, and the Sicilian background strengthened the purity in the relationship. It is very interesting to see how purity and power meet.<br/><br/>The acting is so spectacular and the chemistry between the characters is very strong. All relationships are so beautifully depicted: the husband / wife (Michael and Kay), father / son / grandson, father / daughter, brother / sister, etc. The character of Connie was particularly interesting in my view, and how it was able to evolve from the oppressed wife in the first movie, to the rebel in the second, and finally the head of the house in the third, and the person who held the family together in a time of tension. The strongest character however and the most captivating in my view is Michael. His extraordinary ability to talk to people, to negotiate while maintaining calm and this poker face of his makes you fall in love.<br/><br/>Finally, the music adds a very strong touch to the movie. In takes you back in time, and blends your emotions with those of the actors. It was amazingly played in the very last scene of Godfather III, in the opera house. The scene is very sad, but it gave me tears to the eye not because of sadness for what has happened but for emotion on the artistic beauty of it.<br/><br/>You will fall in love with the movie and with every one of the characters. You become addicted to power and greed. Francesco Coppola is really able to submerge you into this wonderful experience. experience."

","The Godfather is a masterpiece in terms of cinematic achievements which boasts near flawless acting most notably from Brando at his scene stealing best. The film is brought to life with a strong script and a haunting score from Nino Rota. If you care for films, make sure you get out and see this. It is brutal without being unnecessarily graphic and moving without being unnecessarily sentimental. We build up a fantastic relationship with the characters and we care an awful lot when something important happens to them. It has been said that this film ""gets better as time goes on"" but I am not so sure of this as the general taste of the audience is not for this kind of film. It is a refreshing break from the mind-numbing trauma that is Transformers and other heartless Hollywood Blockbusters. One of the greatest films of the 70s? No. One of greatest films of all time!"
"velvoofell","10","1","2","29 September 2009"," An Impressive Study of the Banal Slide to the Dark Side.
","The core of 'The Godfather' may be pinpointed in one scene. The youngest son of the Corleone crime family, Michael, wrestles with the possible fate of his and his family's fortunes as he sits across a restaurant table from the gangster, Salazzo, hungry for the power of the Corleones and the police chief in his employ. He looks down, wide eyed in thought but also at the raging fires of the abyss as he contemplates whether to flee the scene and secure the downfall of his family or kill the two figures who most immediately threaten his family and interests. A train's wheels on the track become the wailing of the damned as Michael pulls himself out of these thoughts, pulls out a gun and kills them. <br/><br/>So begins Michael's inexorable slide into powerful evil. In exile from is double murder charge, in Sicily, he is able to flex fledgling muscles of power and suffers not a little tragedy. These are inoculations, tinctures of the life he will embrace when he returns to America. It is as if his soul feeds on these morsels to steel itself for the trials and tribulations of the rank of Don.<br/><br/>The wise-cracking college kid who displayed some bemusement at his family's business returns to embrace it more vigorously and more purposefully than his father ever did. His father became a powerful criminal out of necessity, Michael does it as if to prove his mettle, that he can be greater than his father and combines traits of his brothers - Santino's rage and warrior spirit, Fredo's duplicity and Tom Hagen's cunning - to achieve his goal.<br/><br/>As the door finally closes on Kay at the end of the film, the door closes on the Michael she fell in love with all those years before."

Throughout much of the movie you feel like you're with the characters. You feel like your in the same room with the Mafioso's. Marlon Brando was perfect as Don Vito Corleone. I don't really think his performance could have been any better. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone was great, almost as good as Mr. Brando's (and that's saying something). <br/><br/>Its hard to explain how great of a movie the Godfather is. You just have watch it and see for yourself. There's just something about it that makes it so believable. The scene with Michael in the bar was amazing. I thought it was the greatest scene in the whole movie. (a runner up would be the horse-head scene). There was so much tension leading up to the scene. It was almost like a mini climax. The scenes in the hospital were also very suspenseful and well-filmed. These scenes were so suspenseful that I think I jumped just when a nurse appeared.

"johnnyboyz","8","1","2","10 March 2009"," It's still as fresh and still as enthralling even now.
","Such is the outlandishness and exuberance of The Godfather, that it is able to branch one of its more lower key characters off onto a tangent that is detached from the primary narrative strand based in New York, in the 1950s and sees the film revolve around the Corleone Family; and have this character shifted to the Italian island of Sicily as he lays low; meets new people and ultimately feels raw human emotion. He learns this through falling in love and suffering a sudden tragedy, an event that shocks both him and us, the audience. Such is the grand scope of the film whilst the character is Michael Corleone, the actor is Al Pacino and the film is The Godfather, a setting up of a grand tale revolving around an organised crime outfit in the latter years of the 20th Century.<br/><br/>Michael is, of course, laying low because of the organised hit on certain individuals he put himself up to back in New York. I think up to that point, Michael had been a character involved, but not in a particularly spectacular manner, in the film but that consequent event and 'hiding' embeds him into 'the life'; it is his own point of no return that captures the essence of loyalty to one's family when the chance arises to show your worth, but at the same time acts as a demonstration of how easily it is for these people to, despite telling most involved that they're 'straight', get involved in the nastier side of life that others close to them are ultimately involved in.<br/><br/>The series' sprawling, but in a good sense, study of life in crime several decades ago begins with 1972's The Godfather and at the rather distinct locale of a wedding, perhaps signifying what all weddings should signify: a beginning, a new beginning as the long and unknown road lies ahead  there will be good times, great times but bad times as we advance into the supposed unknown. Such is a synopsis of either Mafia life and the healthy-one-minute-dead-the-next ideation of life in organised crime as well as life following marriage as you venture off into the next chapter with 'the one' at your side. The scenic and pleasant setting of the wedding sees the film immediately establish a juxtaposition of the pleasant; of the upbeat and of the enjoyable clashing with the fact behind closed doors, despite the occasion, gangsters lurk discussing sordid prior activity and acts of brutal retribution in light of these acts.<br/><br/>Initially, I think we're supposed to assume the film is about the very man sitting in his office; listening to stories delivered by people who do not (cannot) demand, but crave, action. The Don, Vito Corleone (Brando), sits and listens to whether the situation demands attention. Eventually he deems the immediate opening tale worthy of such Mob retaliation but for a favour in the future. There is a certain nonchalance, an establishing of power in these first scenes, that being before it branches out into the wedding and then into life amongst the Corleone family itself. Additionally, it is said that Vito has contacts in the music industry while a certain humane side to Vito is brought through via the fact it's established he brought into the family an orphan off of the street.<br/><br/>But while Vito is the most powerful and the most inspirational character in the film, it isn't necessarily about him. Indeed, early on his adopted son Tom Hagen (Duvall) is engaging with others more than most others, a right hand-man for Vito and a lawyer all the same as he hears and helps deal with the issues and problems that arise for the family. But no, the film isn't really about him either rather it is about organised crime as a whole and how it engulfs these people and what they do. Too much happens in the film to list here, but it is a film driven not by pre-figured plot routines but by acts of honour, betrayal and the realistic decisions made by characters we believe are true to life or 'real'. They act on impulse but stay true to the consistency of their mindsets with Michael's sudden urge to take part in an organised 'hit' acting as a particular event, not because Michael is any sort of protagonist and must propel action, but because prior events to do with a targeted and consequentially injured character and Michael's attitudes to this injured character have built up a certain antagonism within Michael's usually cool mindset.<br/><br/>Amongst all this, Michael's romance with a woman named Kay (Keaton) is slotted in rather nicely and, like everything else, is developed at its own pace with assured direction from Coppola. The film doesn't really posses an overly complicated narrative and the events are told in a linear format, but the achievement is in getting across this epic sense of progression. It is the getting under the skin of a lifestyle that we watch, the emotional and natural progression of a family, only difference being that this family are a New York based Mafia organisation but with an equally fascinating tale to tell."

After the patriarch of the family got shot, the youngest son Michael joins the family business for vengeance.<br/><br/>The acting is definitely not overrated. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan all delivered marvelous performances that will be remembered forever.<br/><br/>The score by Nino Rota is probably one of the most famous and the one that is stuck inside your head for months.<br/><br/>One thing I have against this movie is that this movie is very long with boring scenes stretched in.

The perfection achieved in story, the drama and tension and stakes and the unbelievable performances by the entire cast, from top to bottom, add up to a theatrical experience, journey really, that achieves the potential we all hope for when we go to the movies. Amazing work that more than stands the test of time. I wonder if film producers and studios and directors today might take a cue from the film making process that was in place for this film. The freedom that Coppola had to put together his creative team, including many unknown actors in lead roles, even Brando at the time was considered un-hirable - was so critical to the success of the film. And yet today studios and producers think filling up their movies with ""names"" is the key to good film making, or film selling rather. But isn't film selling predicated upon having a good film to sell? So why not let the filmmakers fulfill their vision with the right characters, not the right names. We just need look back to films like this to see that part of what made them so great was the ability to fill them with actors that we could really believe were the characters they were playing. Not movie stars dressing up to sell tickets. It's just not the same out there anymore."

","The very best film of the seventies. The very best film of the 20th Centuatry, the very best film of all time. Most definitely. While it's not my favourite film, (Pulp Fiction is the No. 1) It's in my opinion the best. The story is brilliant. The scenes whether the baptism scene or Sonnys death scene or that horribly grisly scene which involves one man one bed and a certain part of a horse, are memorable. The acting is superb. Marlon Brando's best even when he'd already played Terry Malloy and Stanly Kowloski (Two of the very best performances ever). Al Pacino's, despite what many Scarface fans might say, best performance he is great in Part One yet he is chillingly stupendous in Part 2. The list goes on. James Caan, Diane Keaton, John Cazele all shine in their own great light. Many people talk about this film but they can never sum it up right. Neither can I. It may not be the most realistic Mob film, Goodfellas would be the most in my opinion, it portrays the Italian mob so well, if anybody told me it was much different i would eat my hat. The funny thing about this is no matter how brilliant this film is the book is much better. If you haven't read or seen this film you haven't lived. Period..."

A few days later I decided to watch the rest of the movie and started to realize the movie's greatness.<br/><br/>If you get past the first hour the movie is highly entertaining with great dialog and great acting. Al Pacino is one of the greatest actors in American History in my opinion.<br/><br/>Watching the movie the second time made me realize that this is probably one of he greatest movies ever. The character development is excellent and you understand that more upon the second viewing.<br/><br/>In summary, if you haven't seen this movie don't expect to be blown away the first time watching.

","This movie is solidly in the top 5 of ALL MOVIES that have ever been made and you could easily make a strong case for it being the best movie of every movie ever made. It was based on Puzo's best seller and the adapted screenplay from Puzo's work is absolutely sublime. It features one of the most stellar collection of actors every brought together for one film, with the performance of Brando leading the way. The cinematography is superb from the opening fade in back shot over Brando's shoulder {cat in lap} to the doubting stare on Diane Keaton's face as Al Neiri closes the office door in what works as what cinematographer's refer to as a closing wipe. Using the closing door to ""wipe "" the scene and end the movie, makes it one of the more recognizable and memorable endings to any movie.<br/><br/>Sadly, younger people who grew up on movies that use special effects as a crutch, will not be able to comprehend that movies that are driven by a great plot line and outstanding acting are actually superior to effects driven movies.<br/><br/>Giving this movie a 1 out of 10 deserves no less than one year incarceration for re-education training using another great 1970's movie approach in plot, the Malcolm McDowell forced open eyelid rectification in a "" Clockwork Orange"" , until the realization sinks in that movies like Spiderman or Jurasic Park while being very good are mere shadows to the great classics in movie history."

","Up until I saw the Godfather, I did not truly understand what was a good movie. This is the best movie of all time. After initially watching the movie, I sat down and watched it again and appreciated the film even more. This movie is filled with classic scenes and classic lines. Marlon Brando is outstanding as Don Vito Corleone and equally good is Al Pacino. The scene in which Michael kills the policemen and the drug-lord is one of my favorites. The sound of a train builds and you can feel the intense passion of Michael Corleone. The transformation of Michael Corleone into a Don at the end of the movie is moving and underlies the central theme of family in the movie. Furthermore, the art direction is unbelievable with the footage in Italy and the wedding scene, both of which shaped film direction for latter generations of film makers. This movie is truly a gem and the best film of all time. Two thumbs way up!!"

"coolfasho-1","10","1","2","25 May 2007"," Under a mask of corruption lies the face unity
","The Godfather, as so many before me, and so many after me will stipulate and emphasize is more than a family's way of life through crime. It not only projects the ironies, debacles, rises, falls and basic aspects of corruption but reveals the true meaning of family. Yes, it might seem odd and disturbing to allude to a people of invidious and ulterior principles to 'family', but when we characterize the word as an interface of love, commitment and connections through blood, no other type of portrayal is more symbolic than the Godfather. I will not bore and weigh my comment down through superfluous lines of the general story of the Godfather as so many others have done (and in better terms than I could possibly ever write). Rather, I will address a controversy which has spread amongst all fans of this enduring classic around the globe. In what way is the Godfather a reflection of family? Well.. to begin with the Corleones are family through blood. On a less literal level how does the Godfather epitomize the moral ethics of 'family'? The main component of a strong and progressive family is commitment. People may generally say 'Everyone knows that the most important part of a family is commitment', but this is where they are wrong. Most relationships in America are based on love or in a more ephemeral sense, infatuation. Commitment seems to be the more onerous and tedious part of love, simply because it is harder to sustain. In order to sustain a commitment one must be accustomed to routine. In order to get accustomed to routine it is imperative to have and hold an interest. Interest is where most love relationships break down because it simply cannot last. Most people are far too capricious to maintain an interest in anything (even as important as keeping a commitment in order to raise a family) for too long. This is where the forbearance of the Corleone family is outstanding. Through profitable business exploitation and singularly successful organized crime the Corleone's omnipotent infiltration of businesses often invoked anger in affiliate mafia groups seeking status elevation which ultimately resulted in the assassinations of Don Vito and Santino Corleon. Even at the breach of these two losses Michael Corleone readily steps up to the plate as the new Patriarch with rigor to supplant his former indifference. In just bloated proportions to 'ordinary' families in which commitment sacrifices time and money, commitment for the Corleones demands a greater sacrifice which is never too great for them to give. This is a sacrifice of life and security. Where the normal American family finds a sanction away from crime, the geography of their bounds is dwelled on by Corleones"

","Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the aging Don of the Corleone crime family, the strongest of the five Mafia families in New York City (Barzini, Tattaglia, Cuneo, and Stracci are their rivals). He has four sons: Santino ""Sonny"" (James Caan), Frederico ""Fredo"" (John Cazele) Michael (Al Pacino), his adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), who serves as the family consigliere, and a daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Sonny is the underboss of the family. With Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano) and Salvatore Tessio (Abe Vigoda) are the caporegimes. Soldiers under Clemenza and Tessio include Paulie Gatto (Joe Martino), Willy Cici (Joe Spinelli) and Rocco Lampone (Tom Rosqui), and more. Michael wants nothing to do with ""the family"" and attempts to legitimize himself by going to college and the army, while his brothers are trying very hard to establish their names in the city through the Mafia underworld.<br/><br/>The Corleone family soon become engaged in a ten-year war against the other families. They nearly slip from power. But they stand their ground and fight for their power.<br/><br/>The Godfather is based on the bestselling novel by Mario Puzo, who co-wrote the screenplay with director Francis Ford Coppola. The movie remains about 90% true to Puzo's masterpiece of a book, only tossing out flashback scenes (which are instead moved into The Godfather Part II) and killing off two characters that weren't killed in the book.<br/><br/>The Godfather has earned its place in cinema history, it is considered a landmark film. This is a movie about family and careers. Not an accurate picture of a gangster's life, but still one of the greatest movies based around the Mafia. For an accurate look at mob life, watch Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas or Mike Newell's Donnie Brasco. The movie also started James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Al Pacino's careers. All of these men are accomplished actors now.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando earned a well-deserved Academy award for Best Actor because of his superb performance as Don Vito Corleone. The movie also earned Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay. The movie certainly deserved all of its awards.<br/><br/>I, as well as many others, hold the film in high regard.

","The Godfather<br/><br/>This is one of the greatest movies ever made. Second only to Goodfellas and tied with The Godfather Part II this is the 2nd greatest movie ever made.

Although I like the book better, it doesn't make the movie any less.<br/><br/>Acting: While the plot is great, the acting is probably the strongest point in the entire movie. While I Goodfellas is just barely superior, the acting in The Godfather is superior to Goodfellas. Marlon Brando gives a very convincing performance as Don Vito Corleone(aka The Godfather) and won the Academy Award. James Caan also gives a great performance as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone which got him an Academy Award nomination. Robert Duvall: Academy Award Nomination. The biggest surprise however when this movie was released was Al Pacino. He's my favorite actor alongside De Niro and he shot to stardom overnight with his performance as Michael Corleone, giving a sympathetic yet chilling performance. Also got a nomination and should have won.<br/><br/>Genre/Quality: As a crime film it is a great movie. The only thing that made it less of a crime film than Goodfellas is that Goodfellas gave a more realistic and gritty look at the crime world. It isn't until Godfather Part 3 that it shows the complete dark side of the mob. This one in some ways seems to glorify it. The quality is great. Francis Ford Coppola decolorized it a bit giving it a more realistic tan look. Some of the greatest scenes ever were filmed in this movie. Finally the music is fantastic.<br/><br/>If Goodfellas had not been made, this and The Godfather Part II would have been the two greatest films ever made.<br/><br/>10/10"
"s_saib","9","1","2","24 April 2007"," For me, 'The Godfather' will always be the greatest, dominant Mafia Epic of all time
","""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" <br/><br/>Mario Puzo's 'The Godfather' is an epic, masterpiece. I mean it IS a forever classic! 'The Godfather' has influenced various films of today, like 'The Departed' and 'Smoking Aces'. Don Vito Corleone represents the true qualities of becoming one of the most established, respected figures in society's minds. <br/><br/>Just after the release of the 1972 epic (which achieved 10 Academy Award Nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster films"" were being judged by the style and look of this one, in particular. The strong performances, the director's unique technique and an excellent script, I believe, all play a role in 'The Godfather's' success worldwide. <br/><br/>Italian-American director, Francis Ford Coppola introduces every major protagonist with a distinctive, complex individuality. Take Corleone for example, played by Marlon Brando. To me personally, he is seen as the most complicated gangster. He is not a killer, nor does he ever mix business with personal issues. He puts family first and doesn't like any weak people. Brando's performance as Don Corleone won him an Oscar and acknowledged him as one of America's greatest film actors.<br/><br/>All men can relate to and understand Corleone's responsibilities of power he permanently has in his family, and how he juggles life as a father figure as well as remaining the boss of his inherited family business.<br/><br/>The film opens on the wedding of Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). The wedding scene is a rather good indication, of how the Don's power expands over everyone in his world, from a regular next door neighbour to a killer. His son Michael (Pacino) has just arrived back from the war, in time to see his sister's wedding. Michael is portrayed as the younger, mature and quiet gentleman of the Corleone family. Given the chance as a husband, to take care of his wife, Kay (Keaton), he doesn't intend to become a part of his family's business and just wants to live a normal life. However, being the oldest in his family, gives Michael more responsibilities, which undoubtedly he can't escape from. Being a part of a big family, running a family business, enables Michael to have more family connections. The mise-en-scene and the cinematography are more dark and realistic. Even the sepia tinged colours are reminiscent of the year it is set in. In most Gangster films, the colour black is portrayed as being highly significant and is effectively manipulated in this case. For example; Corleone's main meeting/office room, where he makes all of his decisions: by having Corleone slightly hidden in pitch-black darkness, Coppola immediately creates that sense of enigma, sinister and chilling characteristics to Brando's Corleone. <br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola's themes in 'The Godfather' include family responsibilities, father's inheritance, the need to earn respect and the influence of power. <br/><br/>'The Godfather' is ideally aimed at a wide audience, except children of course; frequent Mafia violence for males, to a light-hearted, romantic tale between couples, for the females. The film effectively plays on the psychological mind, human feelings and emotions, which audiences can still accept and relate to, today.<br/><br/>In comparison to other gangster genres, it was the first to introduce the gangster trilogy, with the film's continuous complex narrative that differentiates the importance of family. The representation of Italian ethnicity in 'The Godfather' was also new and innovative, under the conventions of a gangster film. <br/><br/>I enjoyed watching this film in particular as well as the others in the three-part gangster saga. The Corleone family story seems so uninterrupted, if watched all together, in one go. I just love how the dialogue, comes out of the characters' mouths so truthfully. I even feel that as a whole, 'The Godfather' proves to be the greatest trilogy in cinema history. <br/><br/>I'd have to say with pure, 100% Method Acting performances from both Brando and Pacino; this has got to be on the list of must-see films, without a doubt!"
"MrWilliams1987","10","1","2","23 April 2007"," The Epic Trilogy
","In the beginning, The Godfather was the classic from the beginning. Francis Ford Coppola's epic masterpiece features Oscar winner Marlon Brando as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Coppola paints a chilling portrait of a Sicilian family's rise and near fall from power in America, and the passage of rites from father to son. He masterfully balances the story between family life and the ugly business of crime in which they are engaged. The Godfather along with the other films in the trilogy, had a strong impact on the public at large. Don Vito's line, ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse"" was voted as the second most memorable line in cinema history in a 2005 poll, called AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes by the American Film Institute. It is often used in a humorous way. Reports from Mafia trials and confessions suggest that Mafia families began a ""real life"" tradition of paying respect to the family don by kissing his ring, in imitation of the ending scene of the movie. There is no evidence of this custom being mentioned prior to the movie."

While The film may not have all the action and cool tones of Goodfella's (which I very much so enjoyed) The godfather is clearly a better film with a much more fascinating plot and classic moments. The Godfather is a film where I would make no changes whatsoever weather it be acting or story the film is essentially perfect. I would recommend this film to anyone regardless of their taste in film."
"mjohnsonx","10","1","2","11 February 2007"," Utterly brilliant!
","This is probably one of the most nearly perfect films ever made. A dark and twisted version of the ""immigrant to America makes good"" story is wonderfully presented. No small amount of credit for the quality of this movie should go to Mario Puzo's original novel. That novel helped make terms like ""make your bones"" and ""have a sit-down"" and ""capos"" popular. Francis Ford Coppola likes to dump on the whole ""gynecological repair job"" section of the novel but that seems like petty griping compared with the way that book gave him a can't-miss blueprint for the film. Coppola's change of the closing ceremony to a baptism instead of a confirmation was inspired but for the most part the book is so closely followed Puzo practically deserved a co-director credit.<br/><br/>This film proved you don't need constant footage of guns blazing to make a successful and memorable gangster movie. The fact that it nicely retains the source material's sub-text ensured its greatness."

","The USA have reached a point of no return in 1972 that is going to lead them to their final defeat in Vietnam and their tremendous decline in the world. At this moment too the consumer's society has produced a new need in western societies, the need for some artificial paradise that could compensate the materialistic narrow-mindedness of modern life, the lack of spirituality in mass consumption. This paper tiger of a paradise is brought by drugs. The drug market explodes, and first of all in the USA. The mafia is confronted to this problem in New York and elsewhere. The older generation of the Godfather refuses this evolution and that brings some kind of confrontation among the five families or clans and the police of course that tries to put their hands on the profit without soiling their fingers. At the same time the Godfather is brought to realising that he has to let a younger generation take over. First an agreement is reached about drugs : drug trafficking will be accepted but regulated. No drugs to minors and in schools, and drugs in priority to the dark ones, the blacks in an attempt to keep this « cancer » contained in the most hated community in the US. This though is not enough to pacify the streets of New York. The Godfather's death is the signal for one of his surviving sons, appointed guardian of the business by the godfather himself, to take over. It is done in the most typical method of the mafia : the five families are decimated at their heads, including the Corleone family. The new Godfather eliminates his brother in law who is responsible for the death of one of the brothers. Brutal, ruthless, pacifying for sure for a while but the promise that with time vengeance will bring strife again. The depicting of power in a feudal system like that of the Sicilian mafia based on the signoria, on the absolute autonomy of each family and their right to defend their territories and their interests by any means including killing, including children and women. Francis Ford Coppola takes a very visible pleasure in this depiction that he complacently shows in its very minute details of cruelty and viciousness.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"

","In 1940's New York, Vito Corleone is the head of a powerful organised crime syndicate, but he is ageing, rival gangs are vying for control and the new racket - narcotics - offends him. Fiercely protective of his family and business interests, what does his future hold ?<br/><br/>For me, this is the ultimate revivalist picture - nobody had made a gangster movie for ten years and from out of nowhere Coppola made this stunning, sweeping, moody and evocative classic which not only smashed box-office records but became (and still is) the definitive gangster film. Aside from the incredible style, what appeals to me most is the grand tragedy of the movie; although he's a crook, we can't help but admire Vito's world-weary pragmatism, moral code and love for his children, and shiver at Michael's descent from innocent to avenger to cold-blooded killer. Vito's acute sense of failure, particularly in the garden scene, is as heart-wrenching as any of the (memorable) action or suspense scenes. The whole movie is a catalogue of stunning sequences though - the opulent wedding-party, the horse's-head-in-the-bed, the deserted hospital (my favourite), Sonny's bullet-ridden death on the causeway, the assassination in the cafe, the final montage intercut with the christening - all simply breathtaking. The performances are sensational, with many great little bits by the lower-order players (Marley as the bigoted studio boss, Lettieri as the kingpin, Castellano as the cheery Clemenza, Montana as the unfortunate Luca Brasi), but for me, Brando is the heart of this film. He's not my favourite actor - he's a bit pretentious in his angry young man roles and totally loopy in his later ones (see The Missouri Breaks), but this is a masterful performance. He makes the Godfather both real and mythical, simultaneously open-hearted and enigmatic; a rare lead role of a thoughtful old man who, despite all of his courage, power and intelligence, the world ultimately passes by. It's a sensational piece of acting. His line, ""I refused to be a fool, dancing on the string held by all those bigshots."", sums up both his character and the genius of Coppola. The richness of this universal theme is beautifully enhanced by Nino Rota's gorgeous, melancholic score, and the sheer quality of the amazing imagery. This is an incredible tapestry of a picture; an unprecedented critical and commercial success, the grandfather of all movie-brat blockbusters, the most influential crime story ever filmed and an unmissable treat for all connoisseurs of great cinema. Scripted by Coppola and Mario Puzo, from Puzo's bestselling novel. My two favourite pieces of trivia - the writers censored the word mafia from the screenplay, and the baby in the christening sequence is the director's daughter and respected filmmaker in her own right, Sofia Coppola."

","The Godfather is a story surrounding an organized crime family named Corleone in the 1940's. The patriarch, Don Vito Corleone, his loyal son Sonny, his daughter Connie who marries the abusive Carlo Rizzi, and his legitimate son Michael who is not involved in the family business. When Michael returns home from the war and Don Corleone is nearly killed by a rival gang, he slowly finds himself being sucked into the life. Though many people will say The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time, it's not. To tell you the truth, it's not an exciting movie at all. It's not action packed, and not a whole lot happens in its 3 hour running time. However, it is a brilliantly made film with some amazing acting, and portrays the most realistic view of the mafia in film history.<br/><br/>Let's start off with the acting. Al Pacino who is now recognized as one of the best actors of all time got his start as Michael Corleone in this film. The movie mainly focuses on his getting sucked into the family business. Al Pacino plays the role brilliantly showing both his tempted side and his reluctant side. All of the supporting actors in this film are awesome. There are really solid performances by James Caan as Sonny who has the coolest scene in the film, and Robert Duvall as Tom. Of course, nothing bad can be said about the late Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone. This is Brando's most famous role and for good reason. His genius portrayal will go down in history as one of the greatest acting jobs of all time.<br/><br/>The realism of the film is what also makes it good. This is the most realistic view of the mafia you will ever see on film. Most mafia films portray the action side of the story with all the hit men and explosions and gunfights. The Godfather doesn't show a lot of that. It focuses mainly on the business side of things. It shows how serious mobsters really are about their jobs.<br/><br/>So, even though The Godfather isn't the greatest film of all time, it's one of the best made.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","What more could be said about the Godfather (1+2). The legacy of mafia crime family dramas begins and ends here. The lines of dialogue have been forever embedded into the American culture and film discourse. Pacino, Brando, Dinero, Keaton, Caan, and the whole cast fit the bill with impeccable conviction.<br/><br/>The morals and themes of the pictures have such a profound impact unlike any preceding film. It empathizes with a traditionally antagonistic side of society and shows its varying dimensions. Men who steal, rob, and murder do so for reasons other than their own personal self-indulgence. They believe 'the life' is for the greatest benefit for their family, but then take it too far. <br/><br/>Films up to this point had a narrow view of the motivation of the accomplices in organized crime. The Godfathers enlightened the film going public about the motivations of the mafia, crime and crime families but doesn't defend it. It merely observes the chosen and or inherit ethics of life in the crime family."

Castellano, John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, John Marley. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola.<br/><br/>Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I don't think in all my viewings of movies have I seen such excellent direction, acting and writing. ""The Godfather"" is so brilliant in almost every way that I don't see how anyone could NOT call it a masterpiece. Michael Corleone, one of three sons of his mob boss father Don Vito, returns home from the war for his sister's wedding. Soon after his return, Don Corleone is wounded in a mob hit and Michael wants to strike back. Michael eliminates a corrupt cop and a competing mafioso in public, and escapes to Sicily. While Michael is gone, the Corleone family begins to fall apart.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando gives a powerful and influential performance that is the best of his career with the exception of ""Last Tango in Paris"". Al Pacino also does very well, and he continues to do so in the later two installments of the trilogy. James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton also give great performances for the supporting characters. Coppola is smart with the directing as he doesn't make the film necessarily about shootouts or pure murders, though there is a big amount of violence, but instead he shows how it affects the people who have something to do with them. It is a series of ""family"" events that build up to a devastating ending. Nino Rota's eerie score highly adds to the atmosphere of the film.<br/><br/>This film, it's sequel and ""Apocalypse Now"" were the only true modern classics that Coppola made, and launched the careers of Al Pacino and Diane Keaton, two of Hollywood's finest actors and two of my favorites. It is everything that films like ""Scarface (1983)"" tried to be and should have been, and without this film I doubt that ""Once Upon a Time in America"", ""Goodfellas"", ""The Untouchables"" and many others would have ever been made. ""The Godfather"" is the definite great film that should be viewed by anyone who calls themselves a cinematic movie buff. 5 stars out of 5."

","This and Godfather II is my favorite of this trilogy. Since the time young Vito arrives at Ellis Island and gets his name changed to Corlione to establishing his Cosa Nostra empire is a human drama told in a grand scale. This is truly a story driven movie. Not the kind of ""fluff"" that people talk about these days where they take a picture, make the cinematography shot in low lighting, have couple of angry or troubled characters (mostly out of self pity) running around and calling it a serious and story driven plot line. The cinematography of this movie is beautiful, people are not overtly ""angry"" or ""troubled"" in any ways (their troubles, and angers are more real), but this movie has a real story to tell(!). This is the expensive original of the cheap imitation people are trying to hock around these days as story driven entertainment.<br/><br/>There were days when few great film makers were trying to make money to make their passion - the movie - come into existence, not the other way around. This movie is one of them, and its substance shows. If you watch this movie, you will be treated to the best directing and acting money can buy. A true Gem of a Holly Wood movie making."

It just is. From the opening conversation about respecting the Godfather to the closing moments when Michael is made Don, the whole film just seeps with brilliance.<br/><br/>The drama is well rendered and some moments are quite touching.

In the film, there is one sentence""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man."". Family is always the best support. I think one of the reasons of the success of the Corleone's business is their good relationship of the family. every time they did their job, they have a good plan.<br/><br/>The movie has the best actors, they can show the characteristic of the character, the whispering of Marlon Brando(the godfather), the smart and wise of Al Pacino(Michael), the stable of Robert Duvall(Tom)...<br/><br/>The only weakness of the film is too long, nearly three hours, some of it was quite bore.

","The Godfather is as beautifully directed, photographed, designed, edited, scored, and performed as any American film -- it is a masterpiece in the broadest sense; a colossal accomplishment for Francis Ford Coppola in the decade he virtually owned as a popular and artistic filmmaker.  Indelible scenes need only a word or two to ignite the memory: the baptism, the horse head, Sonny's fate, the restaurant murder, and the list goes on.  Brando and Pacino are fantastic, but I love to praise the work of James Caan and Robert Duvall.  Their roles might be smaller, but I couldn't imagine the film without them.  The fury with which Sonny unleashes the brutal beatdown of Carlo is palpable, and I adore the brilliant impartiality and distance kept by the camera (it seems to hover in medium shot just far enough to keep the children playing in the opened hydrant in frame during the course of the pounding) as well as the other onlookers who know better than to get in the middle."

"exterminator_99","10","1","2","24 March 2002"," Tour de force
","Often imitated, never bettered and perhaps only equalled by ""Goodfellas"", Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" saga remains for many the greatest crime story ever put on celluloid.  Epic, sprawling, grandiose and exquisite, the Corleone story has become part of modern popular culture and has inspired a whole new mentality regarding gangsters' and the role of organised crime in modern society.  While the fabric of the real mafia has worn in recent years, ""The Godfather"" series remains the most romantic and nostalgic depiction of a society living above the law.  It's a tour-de-force for just about all involved, none more so than the director himself.<br/><br/>Coppola had made seven unsuccessful films before he contacted author Mario Puzo, whose novel about a fictional Sicilian  American family of crime had become a best seller.  Urged on by his heritage and commitment to creating a film that would match his huge ego, Coppola sat down with Puzo (when he could pull him away from the Black Jack tables of Las Vegas and Reno) and re-wrote the story.  The result was a screenplay of supreme quality, eschewing the soap opera, meandering work of Puzo's novel for a tight, taut and fluid narrative.<br/><br/>The legacy behind Coppola's involvement on the film belies belief when we consider how well the film turns out.  Paramount, by all accounts, despised Coppola.  Through the entire film's shooting a standby director was waiting to take over as Coppola's head was constantly on the chopping board.  It was at Coppola's insistence that Marlon Brando, who had not made a decent film for a good decade, be cast as Don Vito Corleone.  Paramount wanted Frank Sinatra.  Coppola also had to convince the studio that a young Al Pacino, 26 at the time, should play Michael Corleone, the aire to Vito.  Studio executives thought Pacino lacked depth and was too small and scrawny to play the part.  James Caan, who eventually played Sonny, was pencilled in early as Michael.  Things could have been so different.<br/><br/>The story is based around the final years of the reign of Vito Corleone (Brando), a Sicilian immigrant who had formed a powerful empire of crime in New York.  Now a man with powerful connections in the political and legal systems, Corleone is almost untouchable.  His family consists of three sons; tough, aggressive eldest son Sonny (James Caan); weak, feeble but good-natured Fredo (John Cazale) and smart, quiet and distant Michael (Pacino).  He also has an adopted son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), who also acts as the family's legal advisor  the Consilari.  The youngest child is daughter Connie (Talia Shire).  Sonny is next in line to take over the family business when Vito's time draws to a close, but his aggressive nature could be his undoing.  When Vito denies capital assistance to Virgil The Turk' Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) for heroin trafficking, things take a downward turn.  Michael assumes the role of Don and in the process the cracks in the family empire begin to appear.  We witness the painfully slow collapse of the Corleone empire, as Michael's friends turn into enemies and the honour and code (Omerta) of the past becomes virtually non-existent.<br/><br/>Brando was awarded the Oscar for Best Actor as Vito and it is well deserved. He is utterly convincing and memorable, despite the numerous parodies on the character.  But it is Pacino who shines as the ever-insular Michael. Starting out as idealistic war hero and ending the first film as power corrupted mafia boss, Pacino's portrayal of the youngest Corleone shifts seamlessly along.  Pacino is at his best when his character is faced with a personal dilemma, not one associated with business'. <br/><br/>
Of course the entire cast is brilliant.  James Caan commands the first third of the film as Sonny.  He is pure aggression, an old school tough guy who acts first and thinks later.  Robert Duvall is solid as Hagen and is at his best in the early scenes involving studio hotshot Jack Woltz (John Morley). Diane Keaton is excellent as Kaye Adams, the WASP whose life is changed forever when she agrees to marry Michael.  In the limited screentime allocated to her character Keaton gives it her all and is a far cry from the characters she became associated with in her Woody Allen films.  Other actors of note include Richard Castellano as Capo Regime Peter Clemenza, Abe Vigoda as Tessio, Richard Conte as Don Barzini and Sterling Hayden as corrupt cop Captain McKluskey.  Even the minor characters in the film are memorable.<br/><br/>The production design by Dean Tavoularis is exquisite.  The Don's den is brilliantly lit, or more so unlit.  It consumes its inhabitants in the shadows, and the Don himself moves with stealth around his cavernous headquarters.  Complementing the design is the brilliant cinematography by Gordon Willis.  The film is shot with a soft yellow filter, giving it an aged feel.  When the film relocates to Sicily, Willis opens up the screen and fills it with breathtaking surroundings and the quaint, quiet environment of the tiny villages where the saga all began.  Then when the film returns to the United States and Michael begins his ascendancy to the upper-echelons of power, Willis turns down the colour and presents Michael as an almost dead character, stripped of life and feeling.  It's a great touch and is best emphasised when Michael woos Kaye, albeit without an inkling of charm, back into his life.  He gestures Kaye towards the car, which resembles a Hearse more than a limo and her life in his downward spiral begins.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" smashed all box office records before it and spawned the blockbuster': one film from one studio that would be able to crush any of its opponents.  The film took home three Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Actor (rejected by Brando) and Screenplay from Previously Published material.  With Coppola now on top and Paramount in his corner the stage was set for the next chapter in the saga.  But that's another story altogether"

Al Pacino is the doomed Michael who will one day take over the family business.  Try as he might to avoid it, it is his destiny. The cast is outstanding, the script is top notch and what other film could spend the entire first forty minutes at a wedding?

The Godfather is the definative story of the Mafia and it's bid for legitimacy and respect from Political allies and Law Enforcement groups eager to sympathize in order to capitalize. While the show is informing us, or rather reminding us of time honoured liaisons between the law makers and the law breakers in mid 20th Century America, with scenes of Movie Producers waking up and finding parts of a horses' anatomy sharing satin sheets, employees of the Don getting garrotted in public bars and  front seats of company vehicles, the hazards of stopping your car at toll booths, and Police Captains choking over bits of lead during their meal, we learn also of the significence of that well worn cliche..........'Give him an offer he can't refuse.'  Yeah..... bloodthirsty stuff indeed, but apparently stuff we all enjoy watching, particularly when it's directed by guys like Francis Coppola and embellished with stars like Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton and Robert Duvall.

","We won't know until about twenty years from now whether the films we watch in the nineties are classics. Personally I think only three can justify such a title so far - Schindler's List, Shawshank Redemption and La Vita e Bella. Three movies without anything missing. Of all the movies in the seventies only two can fill the classic criteria and they share similar titles. Godfather 1 and 2.<br/><br/>People can argue about Jaws and Star Wars but those movies scripts were rubbish. They were all about spectacle. No movie could compare to the quality of the Godfather. In fact the Godfather blows its closest rival out of the water: its closest rival being its sequel.<br/><br/>The Godfather is unlike any movie I ever saw. It begins with a great scene as a man comes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) to ask for his help in hurting a guy that has raped his daughter. It is Brando's daughters wedding day and the man who has come to the Godfather never gave Corleone any help before. Brando refuses. It is a brilliant scene introducing us to the world of the Corleone's. We see how ruthless the Godfather can be but we also see his loyalty to his family. It is a scene that will be hard to match in cinema history but Coppola goes on to deliver even more spellbinding scenes. This is the beauty of the Godfather - every single scene is fabulous. No other film can compare to its class.<br/><br/>Some people argue that the Godfather part 2 is better. Not a chance. It's good but it can't compare to this movie."

","Without the Godfather cinema is missing its backbone.  Often heralded as the greatest movie in history, I would not dare disagree.  This is the only flawless material this world has ever made.  The script could not be better even if Shakespeare wrote it.  The direction could not be better if Spielberg directed it.  The acting could not be better if a gun was held up to the head of each actor.  Marlon Brando gives the single greatest performance by an actor this millenium, winning the best actor oscar hands down.  It just goes to show the entire world no actor has ever been better (On the Waterfront, A Streetcar Named Desire, Viva Zapata...)  Al Pacino was also stunning in his early career and showed signs of becoming the best actor of his generation (which he is, just barely ahead of De Niro and Hoffman).  James Caan and Robert Duvall also put in stellar performances which garnered oscar nominations for them both.  The Godfather should be studied in school to show what the partnership of perfection and complete mastery can do for a picture.  This movie is not at all matched by it's sequel or any other movie for that matter.  I would give my left arm to go see it on theater (c'mon i can't give my right arm i need that to press play and watch it at home).  No accomplishment by Da Vinci in innovation or Van Gogh in art can match what the Godfather has done for cinema.  Nearly number one on every single famous list in the world its an inspiration.  Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) shows such insight and power in leading a family I wouldn't mind letting him run America as President.  I own three copies of this movie one for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I recommend this movie for anyone who can breathe.  rating/10.  PS contact me for any more recommendations on movies, they don't call me the ""tree of knowledge"" for nothing."

"Danimal-7","10","1","2","2 September 1999"," A very good movie about very bad people
","Throughout history, well-intentioned men have committed many horrible crimes in the name of their mother countries.  THE GODFATHER is about a well-intentioned man named Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) who learns to commit horrible crimes in the name of his family.<br/><br/>The Godfather is Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who heads one of the most powerful crime families in New York.  He has three sons: hot-tempered Santino (James Caan), weak-willed Fredo (John Cazale), and Michael. ""Michael,"" significantly, is the only Anglicized name of the three.  Michael is the only son who fought for the Americans in World War II, and the only one who wants nothing to do with the family crime business.  He is something of an outsider to his family.<br/><br/>But Michael is devoted to his father.  And when Vito is severely wounded in an attempted assassination by drug dealer Virgil ""the Turk"" Sollozzo, who thinks Vito's heir apparent Santino will be readier to deal with him, then Michael saves his life.  Later, Michael murders the Turk and his hired police bodyguard, knowing that he will have to flee to Sicily for breaking the unwritten truce between the police and the Mafia.<br/><br/>The saga of Michael's rise to head the Corleone family is one of the most fascinating stories ever told on screen.  It is hard to tell a good story about evil, but Coppola succeeds, principally because he shows the sincere devotion to family that lies behind the characters' deeds.  Michael is slowly corrupted into a cold-hearted killer, not by laziness or indifference or any other vice, but by his defining virtue: his love for his father and brothers!  Likewise, Santino comes to grief as a direct result of his only redeeming feature, his devotion to his sister.  This tragic irony suffuses the film.  The viewer thus can forgive the characters somewhat for their crimes, because the life they have been born into gives them a choice between violent crime and abandoning their loved ones.<br/><br/>Nino Rota's sad, haunting score is superb, and his Siciliana theme is beautiful and tender.  The supporting performances are superb, particularly Abe Vigoda and Richard Castellano as the Godfather's tough but genial caporegimes, Robert Duvall as the ""consigliere"" or Mafia lawyer, and Al Lettieri as Sollozzo.  Luca Brasi unfortunately disappears too quickly; his role was more fleshed out in Puzo's original novel.<br/><br/>Enter a world where murder is ""not personal.  It's strictly business.""  You will never forget it.<br/><br/>Rating: **** out of ****."

In fact, I consider it to be the best film I have ever seen. The last poignant moment of the movie with Michael Corleone in reflective mood, is in my opinion, one of the classic scenes in cinematic history.  That one scene has always remained with me and I always associate it with this movie.

The acting is great, the script is good and the directing is OK, but that doesn't make it the best movie ever made. There's almost no foreshadowing in it, there are no major twists in the plot thus making the storyline actually a straight line and there's nothing in the movie that surprises you.

None of the characters are likeable. All the big moments of the movie build up to nothing more than ""Let's shoot him"" and then they do. That's it. That's all that keeps happening throughout the movie, in between long drawn out dialogue scenes. And the story's not even told very well - so many long conversations that don't really convey anything of any significance; so much pointless stuff happens that doesn't really add to anything to the plot.<br/><br/>The movie dumps like 20 characters onto us all at once at the wedding scene at the beginning of the movie and then expects us to keep up with which Italian guy is which for the rest of the 3 hours. I constantly had to pause it to search on the Internet for their names to figure out who they're talking about, which ones are Al Pacino's brothers, which of them are family, which are his in-laws, who is not related to the family, who works for the old man, who works for the rival families, etc.<br/><br/>I'll give this film 1/10, not because it's quite that bad, but because it's been severely overrated and deserves to drop down a few stars.<br/><br/>The one good thing here is the music is good, I'll give it that."

","Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family ""business."" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug- trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisers Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare. Once Michael has been groomed as the new don, he leads the family to a new era of prosperity, then launches a campaign of murderous revenge against those who once tried to wipe out the Corleones, consolidating his family's power and completing his own moral downfall. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather was followed by a pair of sequels"

","I found the godfather to be slightly growling and over long, however I am not a gangster movie fan. You cannot put the Godfather down for it's immaculate acting and terrific set design. Marlon Brando was absolutely fantastic and never failed to shock with his brilliant performance. Al Pacino didn't impress as much as I thought he would, however, he carried off the performance with style. The hidden details within the Godfather are subtle yet enthralling. Attention to detail is duly noted and can be seen in many of the scenes, including where Michael makes his first killing. The change in character is subtle yet powerful and you can't help but wonder whether he's doing it because he wants to or because he feels he has to. all in all, The Godfather was a good FILM however I found it slightly dull but may appeal to another audience."

","The Godfather supremacy has been broken by the Ring.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a wonderful film, but it is not the best trilogy ever, at least not anymore. Let me give you a hint why the trilogy of Lord of the Rings is better than the Godfather trilogy. Godfather part III a big time loser!!!<br/><br/>You don't even have to be a fanatic filmgoer to see and realize that. The movie was clumsy and boring to a point that it was almost clear to me that Coppola wanted desperately to make his trilogy without having a clue of what he was doing. That reminds me of another 80'ties character called George Lucas (see Star Wars-saga). Maybe Coppola was trying to take the quote from Alfred Hitchcock a bit too literally, when he said that style in film is to plagiarise yourself. Godfather III is a recollection of scenes we saw before in a different outfit, adding some cheap cosa nostra crap that did not work, like the fake set-up scene with the helicopter. This is the moment where by unbelievable coincidence the Godfather and Sonny's son came out without a scratch. This is not the same kind of realism I saw in I and II. While Return of the King is the climatic moment of the trilogy, Godfather III was its lowpoint.<br/><br/>This is Hollywood wanting to sell tickets the cheap way, betting on a sure thing.  And what about the story? What is it? Financial corruption at the Vatican? It is nothing more than an expensive soap-opera. So what if he did it the traditional way. He should of realized that he had no good story.<br/><br/>
It is not because the actors from the Godfather trilogy received Oscars for their performances and probably LOTR not is because the actors from the first trilogy did a better job than the others. It has nothing to do with it. The whole show is not about rewarding talent, but to uphold a tradition of celebrating those who are loyal to the spirit of Hollywood. LOTR has but conformed to one tradition, the one from Middle-Earth, in a galaxy far far from Hollywood.<br/><br/>Let's not forget however to point out that Coppola is responsible for putting his daughter in the film who given us a stunning insight in how bad acting can be. Fortunately for her she has proven, she is much better off directing films. Even Pacino doesn't bring a good performance. While in Godfather II he brought us a believable and likeable anti-hero, while in part III he doesn't do anything else than shouting.<br/><br/>There are unforgettable scenes in the Godfather trilogy. But so there are far better scenes in LOTR, and probably in a way future generations will get inspired in how to make a sensible symbiosis between technique and story, in the same spirit of Hitchcock and Welles, who both were neglected by The Academy of Motion Pictures. If you talk about memorable scenes, look at how Peter Jackson brought us Gollem. It brakes again new boundaries for visual effects and surpasses even the matrix by far. Phantasy has never been that real since ever. And the examples could go on and on.<br/><br/>Part III doesn't bring anything new, while LOTR innovate at every turn. LOTR is not the typical Hollywood film. In fact, it is not a Hollywood film at all. But It is a pure refreshing experience and a great motivation for a lot of young filmmakers."

A movie where the main actor is just a normal man. And, yes, he acts normal and looks normal. But the power that can come from a normal man explodes in this movie (Rockaway). The people who rate The Fighter or the Godfather with high ratings or liked it any are people with a low IQ. They probably like these types of movies because cuz they like crime, like the Godfather. The godfather is trash. This little dude in (Rockaway 2007) this movie mostly uses intelligence to take down the mob and its godfather. I cannot stand the movie the godfather because America is praising crime and gangsters. This movie shows how one mans determination to stop a gang of thugs is expelled mostly with intelligence training determination and more. I cannot stand the Oscar and academy award panel- they do not know how to judge films. I will sing to everything good when the day comes and people stop admiring trash like The Fighter and The Godfather. I get a kick out of the movie Rockaway because the character can be a good role model. He is not a criminal, drug addict, and he isn't stupid. When we watch The Fighter, or The Godfather, you see top American actors committing crime, drugs, and utter stupidity. But in Rockaway, a regular American, or hispanic, not sure, man comes back to town to take down the entire Russian mob. He even takes down the Godfather of the mob while he is blind, after his eyes were taken out. I am thankful that I am not stupid enough to be excited when the bad guys (mobsters) win. I am the type of guy that likes to go to work without the mafia trying to get in my way. Mobs and gangsters and their movies just don't excite me, but seeing this high rating, helps me to understand why there is so much crime in America and why most people are too scared to go outside haha."

First things first the movie looks like crap Gordon Willis' Cinematograpthy is absolutely appalling, the editing is just bizarre it looks like it was made by a film maker trying to simulate tension or sadness and tragedy but had no ideas how to use the tools an experienced director would have used, the music made me want to smash my brains in and James Caan as an Italian American gangster was just ridiculous it would be like getting Danny glover to play Maculay Culkins character in home alone, but then again as someone who has seen a lot of the movies produced by Coppola like Peggy sue got married, tucker the man and his dream, the cotton club, Finnians rainbow, the rainmaker and many more poorly filmed dated badly written pieces of forgettable rubbish I should have expected the godfather to be as appalling as i found it, but as everyone who has ever seen the godfather who happens to be a film buff and not just a normal guy in the street who will watch the occasional movie they tend to drool over this muddy looking scrappy overlong bore fest. All in all I would say this movie should probably be destroyed so morons can't talk about how it is the holy grail of all movies ever made."
"alg11297","1","3","16","28 December 2018"," Over rated is an understatement
","I saw this film when it first came out. The book was a wildly popular best seller and everyone seemed to have read it. Trying to watch it the other day on TV I can't imagine anyone being able to follow it. Too many characters, too many subplots, and a very slow pace. I've been watching films my whole life, and frankly I can't tell a good screenplay from a good performance from a good director. I do know that if I like the plot and the story engages me I'll be sure to like the movie. In the Godfather, scenes and characters come and go with no discernable point. I believe it's a lack of continuity or flow. Brando calls in Luca Brasi to keep an eye on someone. Luca is then seen in a small apartment in sideview getting dressed and then packing his gun. Then we see him go into a bar or restaurant that we've never seen before. In a flash there's a knife in his hand and a wire around his throat. Apparently the character was introduced for the soul purpose of getting murdered. Pacino and Annie Hall are having a meal in what looks like a hotel. She has the most impossible hair style I've ever seen in any movie bar none. They seem to be saying good bye and next we see Pacino walking down a street and into a dark building that we've never seen before. He seems to get agitated and notices that in one room a half eaten sandwich on the table and the other rooms seem deserted. Running up and down corridors we now have no idea where he is or what he's doing. Suddenly he opens a door to what looks like a apartment and we see Brando lying on a hospital bed. Out of nowhere a nurse appears. The audience has no clue that this was a hospital. All it would take was a sign saying Emergency Room or Surgery. Then to involve the plot suddenly a dozen police cars appear in front of the building. The Captain says he was the one who told the guards and detectives to leave. And now he shows up with more. And all this is just a plot devise to have Pacino shoot him and the other mobster.
There are countless meetings in this film that could have easily taken place over the phone.
The cars, the costumes, and the scenes all seem very accurate. But this film is like an endless dramatic story without end. Doesn't it remind you too much of the ending in Apocolypse Now with the same director years later?"
"hemansparks","9","3","16","30 September 2006"," Worst piece of movie-making I've ever seen
","Basically I thought that this movie was a piece of crap. In no way does Marlon Brando portray a decent mafioso. I'd rather watch Ray Liotta in Goodfellas. Speaking of how horrible this movie was, Al Pacino is probably the worst actor I've ever seen. Everyone talks about how great he was in Scarface. I mean I have to give him credit, he did go on to become a superstar with great films such as: Any Given Sunday, The Merchant of Venice, (and let's not forget) The Recruit. Talk about an amazing movie, add Colin Farrell and Al Pacino together and you'll get something Jesus couldn't even come up with. I mean seriously, how many times did they shoot Don Corleone and he was still alive? I just don't buy that. As an aspiring actor, If I would have read the script for The Godfather (part one, two, or three) I would have laughed and wiped my browneye with it. Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola for making a horrible movie. I recommend this movie to no one. If you are one of the millions who support this movie, I hope you burn for eternity. Check out Public Enemies if you want to see what a real Gangster movie is like."
"j_swade","4","2","9","18 July 2004"," An offer you can't refuse
","One of the jewels in the crown of the 70s cinema, The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family. Itialian immigrants, caring people, and mafioso. From the first frame in which you see Marlon Brando's face lit from in front and above like a dark angel to the last frame of the last film in which Al Pacino's wineglass falls out of his hand as he slumps, the family gone and destroyed. <br/><br/>The Godfather is the holy trinity of mob films. Every film after it has its influences in it, and, much like some people look towards the Star Wars trilogy for an answer to every question, many people do so for The Godfather."

","I do not understand the hype and legacy this movie enjoys. This is an average film at best, and if i had to choose a better mob movie then i would go with Goodfellas every time.<br/><br/>The film follows two story lines. There's Marlon Brando as ""Don Corleone"" and his dealings with the organized crime business. And then there is Al Pacino as ""Michael Corleone"" and his decent into the business, and how it corrupts and transforms him into a monster. You would think that by this description the movie must be tense, and interesting right? Well your wrong. The movie is boring, drawn out, and lacks any tension, or excitement. Not only that but i don't know if i was so bored that i just missed half the dialogue, or if it was never there to begin with. I was perpetually confused by the stuff happening in this movie because I wasn't getting any info as to what the characters were doing, or what was being set up.<br/><br/>If you really like mobster movies then by all means watch this film and talk about how awesome it is, but beyond that just look for a better movie, because there are a lot of them."

","In 1945, at his daughter Connie's wedding, Vito Corleone hears requests in his role as the Godfather, the Don of a New York crime family. Vito's youngest son, Michael, who was a Marine during World War II, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a famous singer and godson to Vito, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to Los Angeles to talk the obnoxious studio head, Jack Woltz, into giving Johnny the part. Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name. It stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone, focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss."
"philosovelociraptor","6","1","3","13 May 2016"," A triumph
","Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business.<br/><br/>The Godfather, which opened at five theaters here yesterday, is a superb Hollywood movie that was photographed mostly in New York (with locations in Las Vegas, Sicily, and Hollywood). It's the gangster melodrama come of age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesn't (or, at least, shouldn't) pay.<br/><br/>It still doesn't, but the punishments suffered by the members of the Corleone Family aren't limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. They also include lifelong sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power, but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in."

","The godfather is widely regarded as the greatest film ever made in the history of cinema.Widely considered a milestone,the movie inspired countless films. It might be a shame to admit but i hadn't seen this movie until 2015.After nearly 42 years of its release i finally got a chance to watch it.After watching the movie i found its story to familiar.It is because i have watched countless movies which are directly or indirectly inspired by this film and i must say that this movie was far better than those rip- offs. The movie has a great story.It shows the transition of a reluctant family-man to a crime family boss.The screenplay is absorbing.The cast is wonderful and everybody is peerless in their respective roles.In short this film is superb and wonderful.But i can't consider it as a great film.I don't know why it is called so?May be it had been a very original story during 70's but now it is not so.I am not a film scholar,neither i am a movie buff nor a cinema aficionado but i have seen many classics of World cinema and i found some movies which are far better than this one. I am not saying that this is not a great film.It is great,after all so many people like this and so many can't be wrong.This is a respectable movie after all this movie has influenced countless films.This movie might be great but not the greatest ever. This is an excellent example of mobster film.Positive points of this film are its evergreen story,its soulful musical score,its engaging screenplay,nice direction,great dialogs and amazing acting.The only negative point of the movie is its slow pace and overlong runtime.<br/><br/>So at last i want to say that it is an awesome piece of art and everybody must watch it.May be due to time difference or due to cultural gap,i was unable to grasp it completely. 7.9 out of 10 is my final rating."

It is due to this that I have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let's start from the beginning. The film opens to four words, 'I believe in America', it's crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the film's ""threshold"". This is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film, and believe me, there are a lot.

","The Godfather is probably one of the ultimate gangster/organized crime movie, a story where aging patriarch Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) gradually tries to transfer control of his crime dynasty to one of his sons, in the midst of a war between the feuding gangster families.<br/><br/>Filmed with a much dark and eerie atmosphere, the cinematography captures the grimness and sinister elements of the gangster era, like a film-noir movie. The plot goes at a steady pace, capturing in detail the height of Don Corleone's life from his daughter getting married to the many people turning to him for advice and help in dealing with the nefarious activities occurring in their lives. The suspense builds when the Corleone family clashes with their rivals, resulting in exile, murder and revenge. In addition, Nino Rota's mysterious music score compliments the film well.<br/><br/>A lot of characters appear in the movie, but Marlon Brando and Al Pacino were the best in my opinion, delivering their iconic gangster roles with much precision and brilliance.<br/><br/>Back to the plot, it does go at a very steady pace and sometimes it does tend to drag the movie to the point of borderline boredom. But overall, it's a pretty good movie, very dramatic and sinister - perfect for crime drama movie fans.<br/><br/>Grade B"

I was ready to rate The Godfather 5 stars when I came across a review from someone with similar feelings that said they watched the film again with subtitles. So I thought why not try to watch this disappointing film again with subtitles. What a difference!<br/><br/>The second watching with subtitles completely change my experience of The Godfather.

The acting of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is incredible, and this movie has immersed me in the world and created a level of suspense and anticipation that I have not felt before with any other piece of cinema. Without spoiling any of the plot, the twists and turns and overall composition of the movie is spectacular; although it is 3 hours long, you end up never wanting it to end.

It's a genre that doesn't generally feature giant explosions and shoot-outs, because the conversations are where the real action is happening. If you don't like that kind of movie, you're not going to like The Godfather. I seen this movie before but I use to think its was boring but now I become a little mature and give a chance again and now I know that I was wrong about this but I just sit and watch the whole movie and it was great. I even watched part 2 and part 3. The Story is great and Acting is great too. You need to sit down and watch this movie carefully but its not for everyone. So Far its one of the best movies I seen. Plus it got great actors like Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall etc."

","One of the best movie ever made. It will put you in the set and be a part of the Corleone's family. Live inside the movie with the cast and share their memories and their feelings of love, hate and revenge. The acting of Don Corleone and his magnificent voice while stroking a cat at the beginning its a mental picture that will reappear in your head every time someone mentioned the name - Corleone. Inspired from actual events that happened from the 20s all the way to the 60s wrapped around in 3 lengthy but brilliant movies. The movie starts with an introduction to the family which portraits Corleone's family as a very close, respected family that want to try and stay away from trouble."

","Francis ford Coppola's 'Godfather'....this along with its 1974 sequel is movies at its very best.....this is a near perfect movie...I know this has been said a number of times by a lot of people but for once I feel most of them are right. There are a lot of memorable scenes which stay with you long after you have seen it...and I think that is the reason why this is probably the best movie on organized crime, because it haunts you long after you have seen it. Marlon Brando as don Vito corleone is excellent, for which he well deservingly received an Oscar. Al pacino's Michael corleone for me is the most memorable character in the whole of film history, both cold blooded ruthless villain and a tragic hero at the same time, pacino mostly emotes through those eyes of his and his subtle, measured yet explosive performance is responsible for why people keep going back to godfather and try and interpret and justify each of his character's nuances...separate mention for the memorable sequences which Coppola designs...the sepia toned photography and nino rota's hauntingly beautiful score. After mentioning so much, I still remain doubt what makes this movie so great and arguably the greatest motion picture of all time...I guess that is the way with iconic movies...you never know what's the best thing in it yet you keep going back to it again and again...like an offer you can't refuse!"

","The Godfather is a prime example of a film by a genius who tells a story through his own perceptions and knowledge that prevails to be one of the greatest films ever made..The unflappable tenacity of the man the Director Francis Ford Coppola to display his vision of a time that is seated now in the American mainstream an imprint of Americana, the look, feel and archetype of a time incredibly captured on 35 mm...I have gone back in time to see this great film several times and with each journey I take whilst watching the film I am taken through the story of a mans view of our world and a time once where cities were governed by a darker underbelly of ruthless street thugs posing as upstanding citizens and living by a credo of Family love and death and violence.

"mustafaoenal","10","1","3","16 January 2015"," Francis Ford Coppola's Masterpiece
","One of my favorite movies, in conjunction with part II. I can't say much here, but one outstanding element is the thoroughly believable though dramatic transformation of Michael Corleone. How does one who has always steered totally clear of his family's mafia ways, is an ivy league graduate and has returned from WWII as a Marine war hero become a ruthless, murderous gangster? Coppola achieves this tragic fall with remarkable subtlety and skill. Now that his buddy Lucas is done with Star Wars, it's interesting to see that Darth Vader fell due to the same tragic flaw: desiring as much power as possible in order to keep his family safe - even if it means becoming a murderer. (The Godfather is an infinitely better film than any Star Wars flick, though I'm a sentimental fan for life.) The other element I find most compelling is Pacino's projection of intense power and charismatic strength. His quiet words are more terrifying than the yelling and machine gun of any action hero (or even of Tony Montana). I can't help admiring his character, even though he is a criminal. His performance is so intense and convincing, I actually can hardly watch Pacino in anything else. Music, cinematography, acting, dialog, etc. are all phenomenal. It is a near-perfect film and the greatest modern tragedy I've seen."

","For me.. This is the best movie ever.. A great story, super stars actors plus awesome acting.. It shows deep inside the world of Mafia in Italy and how it moves to New York (USA) early 1930th.. The way Don Vito rolled the Mafia (including all families) and how he was at one side killing and smuggling for the Mafia (Family) benefits, he was on the other side helping (Poor) people to have what they are looking for!! Don Michael is an excellent story too, the realistic man who was serving in US Army during WW2 1945, turned to be at the critical time to unify his family killing all enemies and keeping them all under his umbrella as a new Godfather!

Everything about the movie, from the plot, score, lighting, cinematography and neo-realistic nature appeals to that part of me that craves for expression via film making. I particularly adore the way don corleone was lit throughout the movie. I also got the opportunity to see the behind the scenes footage shot by a fresh out of college guy and it gave me more insight into the thinking behind the final project. Finally, for a seemingly low budget movie; when the budget is compared to some other movies made in the same era, i must say it's a winner any day, anytime. Every time i conceive a new score or soundtrack for any of my movie projects, I always hear the soundtrack of the godfather i my head."

","Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a ""family"" of New York who is happy because Connie (Talia Shire), his daughter, married Carlo (Gianni Russo). But during the party, Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto) is seen in the Don Corleone office asking for ""justice,"" revenge actually against gang members, who brutally beat his daughter because she had refused to have sex to preserve the honor. Vito discusses, but the arguments of the Bonasera sensitize and he promises that the men who abused Bonasera's daughter will not be killed because she was not, but will be severely punished. That's the best film of history, a lot of people don't lie. Vito but makes it clear that it can call Bonasera some day to return the ""favor"". Outside, in the middle of the party, is the third son of Vito, Michael (Al Pacino), a very decorated Navy captain who just returned from the 2nd World War. University educated, sensitive and perceptive, he is hardly noticed by most of those present, except for a college girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), who has Italian descent but he loves. However there is someone who is well noted, Johnny Fontane (Al Martino), a singer of romantic ballads that causes screams of the young people who border on hysteria. Don Corleone already had helped him when Johnny was still in early career and was bound by a contract with the leader of a great band, but Johnny took off career and he wanted to do a solo career. To be his godfather Vito went to see the leader of the band and offered $ 10,000 to let Johnny go, but had refused the request. Just take the pieces of this master piece, like unforgivable actuation, bring proud to family and power. Still hope that one day came a film that compare with this. A realistic and chocking picture of as mafia do their job at 40's. A master piece of incalculable value. Marlon Brando has a perfect actuation, leaving a stone in the cinema as the most respectable and acclaimed character by the public and critics."

To have your wife being killed at the moment you found out she had an affair. It's was also really unfortunate that he was near the crime scene with a gun. He seemed guilty. His first years in the prison were also very hard for Andy. At the moment he's doing better, I felt better. Then the story continues to have an unexpected turn.

"abed-nama-92","10","1","3","15 December 2014"," The acting may have been better
","The acting may have been better than the acting in the original. Robert De Niro gave a perfect subtle performance as Vito Corleone. His portrayal was powerful and breathtaking. When I think De Niro I definitely do not think subtle and smooth but that is exactly what he was in here. It is definitely one of his top three performances in his career. The depth in his portrayal was able to justify the Vito Corleone that Marlon Brando portrayed in the first. Al Pacino gave a very strong performance playing Michael Corleone. In here we get to see more of the tough decisions that have to be made and the consequences of certain actions. Al Pacino perfectly displayed the amount of thought and struggle that goes into and comes out of every action you make; the way it affects relationships, family, power and influence. Diane Keaton was not really given a lot of room to act in the first but in here she is very good. She did not play the stereotypical wife who always stands behind her husband but rather the woman with a mind of her own who is willing to go after what she feels she deserves. Robert Duvall again to me was the glue to the movie. Just having him in there kind of makes you feel safe. John Cazale also had more of an impact in here than in the first playing the half-witted brother always needing to be bailed out. A lot of these characters sound so familiar and stereotypical but in The Godfather Part II every character is played out with such extraordinary depth. Everyone from Talia Shire who gave a fine performance to Lee Strasberg all the way down to the kid who played young Vito Corleone were perfect. Part II seems to me to be more of a character study than the original."

He smuggles gold but he won't deal in drugs and prostitution rackets because that's ""infamita"". He won't hesitate to kill a few Tattagilas because the world doesn't need them. He is angry with the establishment but that won't make him kill innocent people.<br/><br/>The Godfather stays true to Mario Puzo's book. The dialogues are the same as well.<br/><br/>What makes The Godfather special is that it's not a gangster film but a film about people who happen to be gangsters. At the end of the film you'd feel to take Coppola's hand and call him the Godfather."

","That lasting popularity isn't a fluke; the ""Godfather"" films stand the test of time because these aren't just movies, they're cultural touchstones.<br/><br/>When writing about The Godfather it's impossible to ignore its subsequent sequel, which could have coasted off of its predecessor, but instead enriches everything that came before. The Godfather Part II delves into the background of Vito's rise to power, establishing the foundations of the family's bribery, theft, corruption and murder. Meanwhile, Michael Corleone is a shell of his former self.<br/><br/>The film spans decades between young Vito (Robert DeNiro) climbing the socio-economic ladder of New York City and Michael seeking a way to legitimize the family in Nevada. As each move is made to push the Corleone name into the neon-lit streets of Las Vegas, Michael is stymied at every turn by Miami boss Hyman Roth.

I suggest this movie to everyone. This is actually a serious movie with a serious message. It is a powerful film, but I doubt I will ever want to watch it again.

","It goes without saying that this is a classic for the ages. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Mafia Godfather Don Corleone is one of the if not the best performance I have seen from an actor in a movie. When you add the young Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and so many other amazing supporting actors & Movie Magic truly happens. I felt like I was in New York at the height of the Sicilian/Italian Mafias reign the first time I saw The Godfather and am still captivated and entertained every time I watch this Movie. Mario Puzo is a wonderful writer and Francis Ford Coppola really knows what he is doing behind the camera this is the perfect storm a great movie making."

Al Pacino's performance is mind blowing. When you're watching you feel like you're one of the members in the family. Marlon Brando's quiet and confident mafia boss character is impressive. The soundtrack of the movie is delightful. All characters are correctly fitting to the script and is developed beautifully. Francis Ford Coppola really made a good film out of Mario Puzo's novel.

","The Godfather is without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen. I'm going to be one of those annoying people and say that the book is better than the movie, but the movie was still great. I've seen this movie multiple times and each time it gets better and better. I appreciate the fact that the movie stuck to the family business more than the book did, because that was one of the weak parts of the book when they talked about that one girls vagina for a couple chapters. Both the movie and the book were great though and I would recommend them to absolutely anybody who's looking for a good mafia movie that has an actual story and isn't just a bunch of random shooting."

","The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.<br/><br/>Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap- operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.<br/><br/>But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl."
"mccorm14","Null","1","3","4 May 2014"," This is a great movie!
","Spoiler:<br/><br/>The film takes place in the 1940's Mafia era of New York as it follows the Corleone family and their rise to power.<br/><br/>The movie has an award winning cast that includes Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone), Al Pacino (Michael Corleone), James Caan (Sonny Corleone), Robert Duvall (Tom Hagen), and Diane Keaton (Kay Adams– Corleone). <br/><br/>I think the main theme of the film would be power and responsibility. We can see this throughout the film in the scenes with Michael and Vito talking in the hospital, Michael having the bosses killed off during the baptism, and finally the end of the film, when we see members of the ""family"" recognizing Michael as the new head of the family. <br/><br/>In the beginning of the film, we see that Michael doesn't want anything to do with the organized crime side to his family. We see this when he is talking with Kay, he tells her that it's not who he is. As the film progresses, Michael slowly becomes entangled in the crime side to his family. After Vito is shot and is in the hospital, and Sonny is killed, Michael knows it's his responsibility to watch over his family. <br/><br/>After Vito passes away we see Michael taking control and his rise to power. I think the best scene that shows this is the baptism scene. We see him sitting in the church listening to the baptism, then we cut away to the other bosses being killed off by the Corleone family. You know that Michael is the ""head"" of the family, but this is not confirmed until the final scene. As the camera pans out, you see members of the family kissing the hand of Michael, acknowledging that he is the new head ""Don"" of the family. <br/><br/>Even though the film is about the Corleone family, the film focuses on Michael. This focus shows how he changes from a quiet soldier returning home from war, to the head of the top crime family in New York. Another movie where we see this kind of theme, would be the film Goodfellas. With Goodfellas, you see the rise to power of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and how he takes responsibility at the end to protect his family.<br/><br/>I think the lighting plays a key role in the theme. Several scenes are shot with low-key lighting to bring the dramatic intensity of the scene. A great example of this would be when Michael, Sollozzo, and McCluskey are driving to the restaurant. The lighting is very low, focusing on the faces of the men. The scene shows Michael meeting on behalf of his family, taking responsibility and trying to stop the attempts on his father's life.<br/><br/>Another technique that plays a key role would be the camera angle. A great example of this would be the subjective viewpoint at Louie's restaurant before Sollozzo and McCluskey are shot. The camera angle puts us in the conversation, showing the intensity of the situation. When Michael shoots both Sollozzo and McCluskey, it shows the power of the Corleone family and Michael taking responsibility to protect the family. <br/><br/>As I watched The Godfather and recognized the theme, I could only sum up the move by saying that ""Power and responsibility can be a deadly combination"""

","Having only been born 14 years after the release of The Godfather, I don't know if audiences at the time realised just how influential the film would become in later years. It has been homaged, parodied and copied so much - Don Corleone's husky voice and prominent chin especially - that it's a miracle it's managed to hold onto its status as one of the finest pictures Hollywood has ever produced. It's also rather astonishing that the film was ever made at all, given the troubled production amidst a meddling Paramount (who pretty much held a gun to director Francis Ford Coppola's head throughout). But watching it again, 41 years after it was made, it's just as beautiful and thrilling as it was when I first saw it.<br/><br/>Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the Sicilian head of the Corleone crime family. His eldest son Sonny (James Caan) is his short-tempered and hot-headed heir, the polar opposite to the youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who is college-educated and has just returned from serving in World War II. When the Don refuses an offer to invest in the booming drugs trade by drug baron Virgil 'The Turk' Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) - who is backed by Corleone rivals the Tattaglia's - he is gunned down and almost killed. With his father in hospital and still in danger, Michael finds himself slowly being drawn into the family business he vowed to stay away from.<br/><br/>Head of Paramount at the time Bob Evans said he wanted to ""smell the spaghetti"" and hired the relatively inexperienced Coppola, who is of Sicilian heritage, to direct the film, in order to give the film authenticity. From the opening scene, it is evident that the gamble paid off. The wedding of the Don's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), is a textbook guide on how to introduce characters to an audience. This long, gorgeous segment of the film establishes the Corleone's sense of family importance. They are all cold-blooded killers, perhaps, but they are loyal and have a code. It's also fascinating to see the hierarchy within organised crime, something that seems embedded into our conscience now after countless films involving 'made' men and capo's.<br/><br/>But it's a combination of many elements that makes The Godfather so great. The patient, controlled approach, Coppola and novel author Mario Puzo's celebrated, Oscar-winning screenplay, Nino Rota's powerful score, the subtle dark comedy (""leave the gun, take the cannoli"") the magnificent set-pieces (Michael searching for the gun in the cafe restroom is still nerve-jangling) , and perhaps most of all, the acting talent on display. Brando, Pacino and Robert Duvall (as adopted son and consigliere Tom Hagen) can boast career-defining performances from the picture, and can celebrate film careers spanning decades and countless awards. There's little I can say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said, but this is one of the true undisputed classics of American cinema.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"blazesnakes9","10","1","3","27 November 2013"," The movie to conquer all movies
","Movies are made for a lot of reasons and can inflict human emotions to the audience. Some tend to be classics because a lot of people enjoyed the movie and raved about it. Others don't go far to be known. In my opinion, movies that are classics are going to stay for a long time. Movies that don't fare well will be forgotten. But, what about movies like The Godfather? Is that movie is going to be around for a long time? Absolutely. Is it for all generations to see? Absolutely. Without a doubt, The Godfather is the leader to all of the great movies. The movie is adapted from Mario Puzo's best-seller and it tells the story of a family. Vito Corleone is the head of his family. He is also the head of the family's business. His family deals with different situations that are dealt with in their own style and fashion. In other words, they are the Mafia. When Vito's son comes home from the war, he decides on his own behalf to not get involved in his family's business. Michael Corleone, Vito's son, decides to live his own life while his family deals with their own problems. But, when one of Vito's sons, Sonny, played by James Caan, is killed during a mob hit, Vito decides to take revenge against the people who killed his son. Meanwhile, Michael becomes aware of his surroundings and starts to see a downfall of his father's empire. His father is severely injured in the streets after being gunned down and Michael starts to wonder who's going to watch over the family. In other words, who's going to be the next godfather? As the movie progresses, I was suddenly starting to see a change being done to the movie and also to the movie industry. This rise and fall story is told very beautifully and is directed with a focused look at a world where family sticks together and carry out their jobs and fall down and suffer the consequences. This movie has a lot in store and has a lot of feeling about the underworld of the mafia. We even see that even though Michael does become who he is in the end, we know that for a fact that the choice was one that couldn't be refused. The Godfather is a film to be hailed. It's portrayal of the Italian mob is not stereotypical. Instead, the movie focuses on a family that is doused with honor, pride, lust and life. People do get hurt in these drastic situations and those wounds do hurt in a way that you've never felt before. For me, this film speaks louder than the words that are being said. It is more than a gangster movie. It is what the movies are meant to do, which is entertain us at its best and greatest. The performances by Marlon Brando is excellent. He really leads a very well-casted movie that include Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone, Robert Duvall, as the family lawyer, who is Irish and the supporting role of Diana Keaton as Pacino's love interest. All of the acting in The Godfather is phenomenal. This is the movie that made Al Pacino a star. He is that great of a legendary actor to star as Michael. Director Francis Ford Coppola said that in several interviews involving his film, he said that The Godfather was the hardest film to make. With a ballooning budget and a casting problem with the role of Vito Corleone, Coppola suffered most of the time and even was afraid he'll lose his job. In my opinion, he should be proud of the film he made. Even though it was troubling to make, in the end, it paid off. Not only being in the top 10 grossing films of 1972, but also allowing us to see a movie that's worth watching and worth looking at. It is also fill with style and power that in the end, we are starving to see it again. The Godfather took home 3 Oscars, including Best Picture and spawned 2 sequels. As a movie buff, all I can say is that The Godfather leads behind other classic movies like Citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia and Casablanca. Like those 3 other movies, it's the power and story-telling that grabs us out of the movie theater and puts us into the spotlight with well-scripted characters and various stories that emerged out of the family. The sheer critical praise of The Godfather continues to seen and even though it's been 41 years since the film's release, this film isn't going to die. The epic scope and vision of this underworld is going to live on and keep this classic pumping. The Godfather is the best film of 1972 and yet, one of the greatest movies of all time. ★★★★ 4 stars."
"C22Man","10","1","3","29 October 2013"," One of the greatest films ever made
","The Godfather is easily the shining star in the crime genre and 'epic' films in general. It is seen as one of the greatest films of all time and it's pretty simple to see why. Everything about it is magnificent, the story is one of cinemas finest, the characters are dynamic and well developed, the music is timeless and it captures post-war America/organised crime era like no other. <br/><br/>The story follows the Corleone crime family, the aging head Don Vito wishes to move his family into modern times which corresponds with his youngest son Michael returning from the war and his daughter's wedding. The Don is approached to do a deal with drug dealer Sollozzo, but turns him down which leads to his own fatal shooting. This leads to the aggressive Sonny talking control and Michael, who was set to lead a normal life, being dragged into a mob war that changes the family like no-one could have imagined. The story is brilliant, it's never straightforward and will always keep you guessing as what will happen to the characters. It takes you on a journey, starting at one place and ending a million miles away, but making sure that everything flows and makes sense.<br/><br/>Every single cast member nails their role, which is some achievement given the massive amount of characters. Marlon Brando gives one of cinemas greatest characters as the aging Don, everything from the way he speaks to the way he moves is perfectly done. Al Pacino got his breakthrough and he commands the screen. The way he manages to show the subtle changes in the seemingly calm Michael are excellent, he becomes more twisted and less humane as the film goes on. After all it is mainly based on the changes he goes through. James Caan is also brilliant as the hot-headed Sonny, his great screen presence works wonders in showing a man who can't control is anger. Robert Duvall deserves equal praise as the reserved and smart Tom Hagen, a nice alternative to the others. Everyone else is great, from Richard Castellano and Abe Vigoda as Vito right hand men to John Cazale as the frail Fredo to Al Lettieri as the menacing Sollozzo to Diane Keaton as the gentle Kay. <br/><br/>The look of the film is fantastic, the cinematography is dark and dimly coloured which helps to reflect the era perfectly. The music is equally fabulous. The main theme is one of the most recognisable of all time and the music does carry an authentic Italian feel. The depth in which Coppola goes to study these characters has to applauded too, giving some of the most well developed characters on the big screen. The way they are different and sometimes polar opposites , the way Sonny lacks control and is aggressive whilst Michael is very much in control and distant. This fascinating aspect helps develop events greatly. The violence makes more sense here, it's done to shape the characters views and set off new events instead of just being there for the sake of it. That idea is what also elevates the film, everything is done for a reason and fits in perfectly with the story giving most of the events much more weight and meaning than usual. The film also excellently sets up events, such as Michael warning Fredo not to side against the family and the move to Nevada, that would be explored in part II. <br/><br/>There's not one bad thing about the whole film, one of the few films where that can be said. The Godfather remains incredibly gripping and intriguing all the way through thanks to the epic story, acting and directing."

","Godfather, which is an adaption of a book by the same name, is one of the finest movies ever made. Both The Godfather and The Godfather Part II were selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990 and 1993, respectively. International critics routinely list these two among cinema's pinnacle achievements, sometimes considering them as one work. In the decennial 2002 Sight & Sound poll of film directors, the pair was ranked as the second best film of all time. Previous Mafia movies had looked at the gangs from the perspective of an outraged outsider. In contrast, The Godfather presents the gangster's perspective of the Mafia as a response to corrupt society. Although the Corleone family is presented as immensely rich and powerful, no scenes depict prostitution, gambling, loan sharking or other forms of racketeering."

His face was cold with majestic contempt. But there was something false in all this that Amerigo Bonasera sensed but did not yet understand.<br/><br/>""You acted like the worst kind of degenerates,"" the judge said harshly.

""You acted like wild beasts in a jungle and you are fortunate you did not sexually molest that poor girl or I'd put you behind bars for twenty years."" The judge paused, his eyes beneath impressively thick brows flickered slyly toward the sallow-faced Amerigo Bonasera, then lowered to a stack of probation reports before him. He frowned and shrugged as if convinced against his own natural desire. He spoke again.<br/><br/>""But because of your youth, your clean records, because of your fine families, and because the law in its majesty does not seek vengeance, I hereby sentence you to three years' confinement to the penitentiary.

He used his white linen pocket handkerchief and held it against his lips.

He let them pass without saying a word, pressing the fresh linen against his mouth.<br/><br/>The parents of the animals were coming by now, two men and two women his age but more American in their dress. They glanced at him, shamefaced, yet in their eyes was an odd, triumphant defiance.<br/><br/>Out of control, Bonasera leaned forward toward the aisle and shouted hoarsely, ""You will weep as I have wept--- I will make you weep as your children make me weep""--- the linen at his eyes now. The defense attorneys bringing up the rear swept their clients forward in a tight little band, enveloping the two young men, who had started back down the aisle as if to protect their parents. A huge bailiff moved quickly to block the row in which Bonasera stood. But it was not necessary.<br/><br/>All his years in America, Amerigo Bonasera had trusted in law and order. And he had prospered thereby. Now, though his brain smoked with hatred, though wild visions of buying a gun and killing the two young men jangled the very bones of his skull, Bonasera turned to his still uncomprehending wife and explained to her, ""They have made fools of us."" He paused and then made his decision, no longer fearing the cost. ""For justice we must go on our knees to Don Corleone."""

"antagonist117","10","1","3","15 August 2013"," Endless new details and interpretations keep this near-perfect film fresh
","Because it opens with a wedding, each new viewing of ""The Godfather"" feels like a happy reunion with familiar characters. And each time it is bittersweet because we know what will happen to all of them in the end. But there are seemingly endless new details to uncover, and film writers have provided a steady stream of new interpretations to consider. Count the times that doors close on women, shutting them out of the macho world of the cosa nostra—a phone booth door, a bathroom door, a study door. Notice, as writer Pablo Villaça does, how the color of Kay's clothes change from bright red to dull beige as she gets pulled further into Michael's toxic orbit. Look at the way Vito Corleone and Tom Hagen reflexively touch their faces, cuffs, and collars after difficult conversations, a nervous tic that Michael, in his coldness, does not seem to share, and which seems significant only because everything in this dense production seems purposeful and meaningful. Consider, like historian Bruce Schulman, whether Michael—an American war hero with an American girlfriend who ultimately cannot escape his Sicilian roots—is a metaphor for failed cultural assimilation. Maybe some of these observations are stretches, the products of our obsessive love for a movie that director Francis Ford Coppola reportedly considers a studio film and that Orson Welles called ""the glorification of a bunch of bums who never existed."" There's some truth in those criticisms, just as there is truth in the paeans and the deep analyses. Maybe there's no such thing as a perfect movie. But ""The Godfather"" looks, sounds, and feels very, very close, even the Nth time around."

I must say this is the most inexplicably overrated piece of trash I've ever seen.

In some parts the acting of Marlon Brando as the 'Don' and Al Pacino as Michael do put up good performances which again add's to that verisimilitude to not only the story but to the other characters that are within this film. Although these small film aspects can add to your experience of watching the Godfather, non of this excruciates from the fact that these good factors do have harsh limitations which evidently create more problems throughout the duration of the film.<br/><br/>Even though I did say from the start that the tempo and the duration of the scenes and music is perfect in introducing the characters and some of the story aspects, this is all it does unfortunately. As it gets near enough to the middle point of the film, the whole story and tempo falls flat on it's face and in most parts of when they are talking to some other gang leaders does emphasise this point that sometimes in the film, some of the story elements don't really add up to which personal for me creates a lot of boredom. Another sought of example of this is perfectly clear when the character of Michael is in Italy to lay low from the killings that he committed... I find that the Italia sequence is a complete waste of time and primarily add's to this excuse of being nearly a 3 hour film which really it shouldn't be. This sequence just kills the flow and intensity of what will eventually happen; it postpones the inevitable in some fashion. Although again I did say that the acting from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is exceptionally fine, the majority of their performances not only add's to this lack of entertainment, but in a sense just makes me want to never watch this film ever again. Marlon Brando speaking with a husky voice and cotton in his mouth is incredibly ridiculous. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone suddenly turns, from a principled man who doesn't want to have anything to do with murder, into a ruthless criminal. What? This character has no depth, no consistency whatsoever. His relationships with women are so poorly portrayed, they add nothing to his development.<br/><br/>If you want to see a good gangster film then personally I recommend watching 'The Departed' as it does have the same sought of Genre and does everything right in terms of it's interesting story telling between these two men which at times does have lot's of quirky but violent scenes in which is done perfectly right rather than have old men constantly talk non stop about mundane meaningless ideals.<br/><br/>I give the Godfather a 7/10<br/><br/>Alex Rabbitte"
"zardoz-13","10","1","3","10 June 2013"," The ""Gone With the Wind"" of Mobster Movies
","Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" truly qualifies as the ""Gone with the Wind"" of gangster movies. The first installment in the Oscar-winning trilogy covers decades, mob wars, romances, intrigue, and treachery. Specifically, ""The Godfather"" received three Oscars. First, it was voted Best Picture; the Academy recognized Marlon Brando as Best Actor, and Coppola shares a Best Writing statuttee with Mario Puzo. Clocking in at a robust 175 minutes, ""The Godfather"" cast Brando as the seasoned Don Vito Corleone, with Al Pacino elbowing his way right behind him as the youngest son Michael. James Caan makes a lot of fuss as Pacino's older brother Sonny, and the ever dependable Robert Duval is cast as the consigliere for the family. Interestingly, Caan, Duval, and Pacino all competed for Best Supporting Actor, and Coppola was up for Best Director. Dean Tavoularis' production designs, Warren Clymer's art direction, and Philip Smith's set decoration are all sumptuous. The best scenes include Michael's massacre at the restaurant, Carlo and his wife smashing dishes, Sonny's ambush in the causeway, Brando's death scene in the tomato patch, and the finale with the elimination of all of Michael's enemies. The screenplay deserved an Oscar. The least shall be first as Michael demonstrates during his meteoric rise to power. The dialogue contains quotable lines and several interesting characters who aren't relatives of the Corleone clan. Gordon Willis' shadowy, straight-on photography captures the treachery of the crime syndicate. Of course, ""The Godfather, Part II"" surpasses it in every respect, and it deserved the six Oscars that it garnered."
"Sonic_Ocean","10","1","3","16 May 2013"," The Godfather perfectly encapsulates the essence of cinema
","I had a rough time watching The Godfather, because all the universal acclaim was completely clouding my judgement on the movie, because instead of being able to watch the movie with clarity, all this time I was looking at the opinions of the general public as the basis of finding clear reasons why to like this movie. I know everyone praises the performances, the film's structure, and every subtle nuance, but listening to those opinions gave me the idea I should be looking at these details so I will see why this movie is so great.<br/><br/>But to my realization, I wasn't trying to find any qualities that I, MYSELF, would love about the movie. I was too busy trying to find the details of what other people liked. I was watching based on the details other people hyped up too much. That's why I have to say, you have to watch The Godfather and put the hype completely behind you and just watch it for what it is just how you would any other movie. If you develop a true opinion of the movie, not based on the hype, then that's what really matters, whether you love it or hate it.<br/><br/>I ended up watching The Godfather for the umpteenth time. Now, before this point I really didn't have an opinion on the movie. I honestly felt it was bland and didn't give me that sense of urgency a lot of my favorite movies give me, but I didn't hate it, but I also didn't love it. But this time, it clicked somehow. I enjoyed it, oddly. I honestly found a certain quality that is very hard to create in films.<br/><br/>And that certain detail is how beautiful this movie is. Behind all the murders and the brooding feel of the film, there is a lot of beauty. It's atmosphere is something that contrasts so heavily with its dark plot. And not only visually, but this is also evident in the execution of the acting performances, and the mood of the story. After watching Apocalypse Now and The Godfather II, I finally started to understood Francis Ford Coppola's style of storytelling. Despite The Godfather being a gangster film, it's very subtle and does not have any melodrama. I feel this is something people cannot get past, because with its legacy as a movie, they expect it to be something more in-your-face that will give you an emotional hit-in-the-gut feeling, but to one's realization, he or she will realize it is not those things.<br/><br/>I mean there is a beautiful score, but it too is very subtle. The movie actually benefits from silence and just let the characters most of the time direct the emotion of the plot. When watching this, I cannot believe how the actors were able to execute this difficult-to-accomplish feat. If you were to tell me how I would expect one of the best ever movies to come off as, I would've given you a narrow-minded answer. Now I realize how much film is just as open-ended as music. We cannot just experience or enjoy an album or a film one time and expecting to gain that satisfaction thinking we know it from the inside out. If we watch a movie a second time, we can discover subtle nuances that weren't obvious in the first viewing, almost as if we're watching it from a completely different angle. And that's the beauty of i Despite how subtle The Godfather is, it really is a sophisticated film with repeated viewings. Is The Godfather my favorite movie of all time? I don't even know if I have one particular favorite, but I would place it in my top ten along with Citizen Kane. My advice would be to find certain qualities that YOU would like about The Godfather and not to base it on the opinions of people telling you what is so awesome about it, because film is more open-ended than that to build expectations. We all have things that we personally love. What is the best thing about the movie? For you or anyone else, it could be the acting, the story, the settings, or some subtle nuance that everyone is ignorant of. I personally love the mystical feel of the atmosphere and I think that is better than telling someone its the best movie ever just because it is. I like to listen to personal opinion, because of the individuality aspect to it. And The Godfather is way more rewarding if you watch it as an individual and judge it on your principles of what makes a good film and not to trust someone else's certainty that is the best movie ever. It's okay if you still don't like the movie, but what is crucial is you give complete clarity in forming an opinion that is completely your own based on what is important to you, most of all. I don't see what other film lovers see in The Godfather, I only see what I love about it."
"phbasketball6","10","1","3","5 May 2013"," One of the Greatest Films of All-Time
","One of the best films ever. After winning an Oscar for Patton, Francis Ford Coppola became notable in Hollywood. The Godfather, Francis Ford's masterpiece, places him on the map as a respectable director. The direction was great by Coppola and the adapted screenplay by Coppola and Puzo was amazing. The wedding scene in the beginning introduces the characters and shows their importance.<br/><br/>Don Vito Correlone (Brando) is by far the most respected character in this movie. This is shown in the beginning during the wedding of his daughter when follow Sicilian?s pay their respects to him and asking for favors. Vito shows a moral life when he feels disrespected when a family friend decided to go to the police first. He also shows moral when he is against drugs because it's a crime with victims.<br/><br/>Michael Corelone (Pacino) who is Don Vito's youngest son seems to be a nice and noble kid especially when he is treated like a war hero and seem to be a protagonist. Michael seems to not be interested to be a part of the ""business"" but later on it seems like he was force to. Towards the end of the film when Michael lies to his sister and wife and closes door on his wife it seemed like it was the beginning of a new villain within Michael.<br/><br/>Sonny (Caan) who is Don Vito's eldest son seems to be the next Don. However, he has his flaws especially being known as short-tempered and eager. He flaws would soon affect him and the chances of becoming the next Don.<br/><br/>The middle child which seems to be the least important one is Fredo. Fredo (Cazale) is the child that seems not to gain any respect from anyone within the family. He is also known as the ""weak"" one within the family.<br/><br/>Tom Hagen (Duvall) who is the Don's adopted son is the right hand man for the family and he is the brains for them with all of the connections.<br/><br/>The only daughter in the family is Connie (Shire), she is nice and tired of the mafia life and she is extremely gullible. She marries an abusive person but is gullible enough to stay with him and defend him.<br/><br/>Kay (Keaton) who is Michael's girlfriend gets pushed around starting when Michael says he would never get involved with his families work but as we all know this isn't true. Michael's work for the family slowly tears apart his relationship with Kay. The ending of the film can easily be considered the greatest with Michael becoming the ""Godfather"" in two different ways.<br/><br/>This movie shows the life of a Mafia man, the scary and painful times. The acting by the whole cast with the likes of Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Cazale, Keaton, and Shire was amazing and was one the best of performances by them in their careers. Brando himself put up one of the greatest performances by an actor ever. Pacino has his best performance in his career which also starts it off."

","The Godfather is an outstanding movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. There is no questioning the sheer brilliance of this film, it is a perfect example of how movies are very much an art form, the beautiful set pieces and skillfully written dialogue are just two examples of that.

The cast deliver some of the best performances ever witnessed, from the masterful acting of Robert Duvall, the engaging James Caan and the raw emotion of Al Pacino, they all showcase career highlights. The star of the show is, without a doubt, Marlon Brando, an actor with so much range and versatility, he is spellbinding as the Don, every word, every movement, has meaning, a well deserved Oscar win. An engaging story, pitch perfect performances and gorgeous direction, The Godfather is a must see for all moviegoers. <br/><br/>A young man is forced to take control of an organised crime ring as a result of his father's decreasing health. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Marlon Brando"
"buck4821","10","1","3","30 September 2012"," Can't believe it took me so long to watch this
","The Godfather is a beautifully written piece about the inner workings of a mob family between 1945 and 1955. The main storyline is about a mob Don, Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando, and his two sons, Sonny and Michael, played by James Caan and Al Pacino respectively. Michael starts out as an outsider, with no interest in joining the ""family business."" The ""family business"" is a term that is used frequently and carries heavy significance. Whenever they talk ""business,"" they often use the phrase, ""It's not personal, it's just business."" They use it to convince not only society and the surrounding people but also themselves that what they are doing isn't as violent as it actually is. Using the family business ideal and constantly reminding themselves that what they are doing is business, not extortion, racketeering, and murder, helps them to cope with the violence and the guilt that comes with such activities. <br/><br/>I think that one of the things that helps this movie along profusely is the acting of the mob members. The transformation of Michael portrayed by Al Pacino is the reason that this movie works. Michael starts out as a college kid with a girlfriend who wants nothing to do with the family business. He shows respect to his family, but declines interest in the illegal aspect of their business ventures. Once things start spiraling out of control, he proudly steps into any role they need him to fulfill, even if it means he has to leave the country for a few years. Once he returns, he continues to develop into a leader, with the calm contentions of his father and the intelligence and youth of a new generation, all the way until he replaces Vito as the Don of the Corleone family.<br/><br/>Coppola uses doors as a symbol of the clear separation between the men's ""family business"" and the women's family business. Whenever the men are about to discuss their ventures, they close the door to the outside world, both for security purposes and because they are the only ones who have the authority to make those decisions. While the men talk about that business, the women cook, clean, and tend to the younger children, clearly separated from the men's work, usually by a door.<br/><br/>The biggest key to being an effective don in a mob is being respectful. In the meeting of the five families, Don Vito swears on his grandchildren's life that he will not break the peace they have decided upon, and hugs the don who had his son killed. Seeing those two men hug even after they had each other's sons killed clearly indicates that respect is something that is vital in this criminal underworld. <br/><br/>One of the big moments in the movie is when Michael decides to do whatever is necessary for the family by agreeing to shoot Sollozzo in the diner. Michael changes his beliefs toward the family business in order to help his family. Later when their sister calls Sonny and says she's been beaten again, he rushes out the door without taking any bodyguards with him in order to protect and defend her. Later when the Corleone family is trying to buy the casino in Las Vegas, they ask Johnny Fontane to sign a contract to help their business, and he signs it without a second thought, because they are like family. Seeing these acts of family loyalty makes it clear that family is the one thing that people of this time believe in above all else.<br/><br/>One of the best things about the Godfather is since it was an ensemble movie with many stars and lead characters, there is a constant fear for the characters safety. In some movies, there are only one or two main characters, so you know that they aren't in any harm or real danger until the end of the movie, and even then rarely. In The Godfather, several of the Corleone family members, rival members, and family friends die throughout the movie, even some of the big stars. Don Vito gets shot, survives, and then suffers a fatal heart attack later. Sonny gets gunned down in the street by a rival family. A supposed family friend, Sal Tessio, tried to set up Michael in a deal with the Barzini family, and they kill him. Seeing important named characters die throughout the movie makes it seem more realistic and more fearful of any dangerous situation they talk about.<br/><br/>The biggest underlying struggle throughout the entire film is corruption versus loyalty and trying to make the best choices for the long term that will benefit you and that you can be at peace with. Corruption of loyalties, business matters, and family is rampant throughout the film. Sal Tessio gets paid by Barzini to try and get Michael killed. Carlo, Corinne's husband, baited Sonny into the open so Barzini's men could gun him down. Even the Corleones are guilty of using corruption to their advantage: They murder and mutilate the prized horse of a filmmaker so Johnny Fontane can get a part in a movie. The internal struggle of each character trying to stay devoted to their family while staying on top in the business is enticing to be a part of for a few hours."
"ruxandrasilvia","Null","1","3","10 May 2012"," Incredibly bad
","The first question that came to mind when the ""legendary"" movie finally ended, was this: ""Has everybody gone mad?"". ""The Godfather"" is amazingly bad, start to finish. Al Pacino's talent is wasted in this sorry excuse for a film. No character development, no real plot, no redeeming value whatsoever! Just a bunch of low-life criminals and their self- importance. Fascinating, indeed! <br/><br/>There is no real conflict here, and nothing that viewers can relate to. The ""mythical"" figure of Marlon Brando is completely ridiculous. What is it that we're supposed to think is so great about this character? An arrogant murderer who speaks with cotton in his mouth. Big deal! Bad guys are fun when some good guys are there to challenge them. <br/><br/>There is no consistency in character development, if there ever was one in the first place. Michael Corleone suddenly turns, from an apparently moral person into a cold-blooded killer? You've got to be kidding... <br/><br/>The whole ""family tradition"" is meant to suggest that we're witnessing some kind of royalty saga. All these characters are despicable and one- dimensional, so why would I be interested in anything that happens to them? The level of violence is unacceptable, but I guess that makes for ""edgy"" cinema in the absence of artistic vision.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" must be the most overrated piece of trash cinema I've ever seen. It is a long, boring, disjointed and pathetic attempt to deliver an uninteresting story."
"higherall7","10","1","3","2 May 2012"," The Mystique of 'The Godfather""...
","Now I have seen 'THE GODFATHER' and its sequels a number of times and can even recite the dialog of whole scenes word for word. I took my father to see it on his birthday back in the seventies, because I thought he would get a kick out of seeing someone who, like himself didn't speak much, but when he did, made it count. I think he fell asleep here and there during the film, but then, he was just a man holding down a full time job and taking care of his family.<br/><br/>I remember first reading the novel, which I rated as a cultural curiosity somewhere in quality between 'THE DAY OF THE JACKAL' and 'MANDINGO'. The film we enjoyed because of Brando's at that time offbeat performance and the strong ensemble cast. When I went to see 'NOTHING BUT A MAN' with my friend Donald Mack, besides him commenting to me, ""-this ain't no movie, this is real-"", I remember Ivan Dixon telling Gloria Foster in the movie that he was turning out to be just like his father. The manner in which Al Pacino portrays Michael Corleone you see this process of transformation rather than hear the character tell of it. Though in the original screenplay that I was fortunate to read recently, Michael does indeed tell his father, ""-and now I'm just like you.""<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola has made many interesting statements about this unlikely and serendipitous masterpiece he has wrought. Some of the reviewers have compared it to 'DEATH OF A SALESMAN' complete with a spaghetti dinner, and Coppola himself once compared Don Vito Corelone to King Lear, a man whose void will be hard to fill ere his Kingdom is to be kept from collapsing. Michael, as we come to discover, has the cold Machiavellian cunning, Santino has the muscular viciousness, Fredo the sweetness of a kindly sense of compassion, and Tom as the adopted son the calm deliberation for moderation, and yet not one of these individuals has all these attributes so harmoniously blended into their personality as the Don himself.<br/><br/>And who is this Don Vito Coreleone? A man alone with his own thoughts who well realizes he could have been more than he is given an uplifting childhood environment and better circumstances. A natural leader who is even something of a statesman to hear Mario Puzo tell it in his novel, who yet and still played by Brando is a walking shell of a man able to offer his family nothing beyond their material success other than an incremental spiritual decay. Should you doubt this, review the endings of 'THE GODFATHER-II' and 'THE GODFATHER-III again. <br/><br/>Now that I look back on it, I don't believe 'THE GODFATHER' would have become the success it is today were someone else to have acted Brando's role. There is an intelligence and a liveliness to all the portrayals from Diane Keaton to Robert Duvall to James Caan and others, but there is something haunting and understated about Brando's performance in this film that speaks to the mystery of unfulfilled human potential. Of all the performances that I revisit in this movie from time to time his is the only one that seems to have grown in stature over the years. Sure, I understand better now what a tight spot Michael was in with the death of Santino, and now sitting at his father's funeral, watching Barzini shake hands with his colleagues as though he were the heir apparent, he realizes that he is just the next item to be checked off on the list in a power struggle he inherited more than signed up to fight. That is, unless like Telemachos, he can carry out the plan he and his father designed before Don Vito went off to his grave.<br/><br/>I know my girlfriend at the time felt cheated and disappointed with Brando's performance. She wanted more of Stanley Kowalski's animal vitality or the roaring declaiming of Brando as Mark Anthony in 'JULIUS CAESAR'! But I understood, even though I was not at first viscerally affected by it so much, what Brando was doing. <br/><br/>The acting that Brando does in 'THE GODFATHER' is the acting of personal presence altitude. The power of his portrayal comes not from what he says or does, but from what he doesn't say or does. It is an understated performance that evokes and causes you to add your own connotations to what he is doing. Here is a self made man who somehow worked himself through material success from something to nothing and is puzzling to himself how he got there, but he is not going to let you see him doing it.<br/><br/>I know and have read how Pacino and many others thought he should have been nominated for Best Actor honors along with Marlon Brando and whether he should have or not is more than I know. All I do know is that there were times when the action got hot and furious, and that I was tensely waiting for Don Vito Corelone to appear again, not say or do anything particularly, just appear, and somehow by just appearing stabilize the narrative and bring some kind of sense and order to his surroundings. There are people like that, you know. I remember when I would watch 'Young Abe Lincoln' there was a point in the story where Lincoln played by Henry Fonda would not be physically in the scene, and yet you could feel his shadow over the entire proceedings. <br/><br/>Brando's Don Vito Corelone is the moral inversion of all of this. When he lays his plans with his son Michael, you glimpse the roles that Brando could have played; Socrates, Ernest Hemingway, and even Black Elk. The roles of idealism that James Coburn berated him for not playing. And who can say there wasn't time, there just wasn't time?"

It is a film that teaches you all the possible lessons in life, having at the same time such a powerful and emotional background story.I have never felt such strong emotions from watching a film before as I did when I saw The Godfather, it takes you in it's world and grasps you by the neck, indulging you in a story that you forever wished you could be a part of yourself. The Godfather is what the true mafia is about, Francis Ford Coppola takes the term ""mafia"" and really put's it into context by showing us nearly every possible situation involved within the mafia and how it has it's affects on family and friends.

","One of the most seen movies of all time. Very few are those who haven't seen it or those who don't value it. The Godfather came to life in 1972 by the hands of Francis Ford Coppola transferring Mario Puzo's novel into the screen. It stars Marlon Brando (Don Corleone), Al Pacino (Michael Corleone), Diane Keaton (Kay), between others. The plot describes one of the five families of organised crime in New York around the late 40s and the first half of the 50s, the Corleones, more specifically the transition of power from Don Corleone to his son, Michael. Marlon Brando has one of the best performances I've seen, if not the best. It's amazing how he managed to incorporate the old gangster. Many people appreciate more his way of talking, this is not what makes it unique though, try to notice his facial expressions and you'll see it. Al Pacino also comes in great form but falls to second layout because of Brando's marvel. Coppola confines himself to the family and mixes it with the sheer and simple life that gangsters try to attach to their family, but many times fail to. Godfather is a great movie, probably the best related to mafia you've seen and will ever see, with many other unsuccessfully attempts movies (though strangely over-rated) such as Scarface, but that is a whole different story."

","Often cited as the greatest film ever made, I can't 100% agree with that but along with it's immense sequel, it is certainly ""one"" of the greatest ever made. Like all celluloid masterpieces, it doesn't date. Sure some cinematic techniques alter, sound, lighting, colour and camera-work vary over the years, perhaps they're improved in general but these are transitional and often just fashionable points, not a reflection on the quality of a film.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a ground breaking film. Slow, complex and often with no attempt to educate the audience into the ""whys"" of what is happening, you're simply invited to draw your own conclusions into the right and wrongs of this world and the characters within it. But the story itself is pure genius. Vicious yet measured, vengeful yet honourable, people centred yet set in a world where self appointed royalty are all powerful. It's a ride, rarely if ever bettered.<br/><br/>Sometimes a star makes a film, other times a film makes the star (and actually that might be true for Al Pacino here) but in The Godfather we have a film that is the star itself. It's not really possible to pick out stand-out performances without citing them all. That is what makes it one of the very best of all time and a must see for anyone with the slightest interest in the history of Cinema."

"Red-Barracuda","10","1","3","4 October 2011"," After this the gangster film would never be the same again
","The gangster is the unacceptable face of the American myth. He is the antithesis of the western hero; he is not society's saviour but its public enemy. The 1930's gangster film was rooted in headlines of the day; it was a resolutely contemporary genre. The first gangster cycle responded to the restrictions of Prohibition and the effects of the Depression. These gangsters defied harsh economic realities and in doing so became anti-heroes of the people. Their defiance of authority made them relevant and popular; they were the dark side of the American dream.<br/><br/>In the first cycle of gangster films, the criminals were positioned as alien to the WASP norm. These Italian and Irish gangsters were separated by their ethnicity. The Hays Code soon came in to try and combat these films. It forbade the vilification of ethnic groups and banned films focusing on criminal behaviour. This shifted emphasis to law enforcers. It was hard therefore to truly make gangster films. The genre was pushed to the margins and remained out with the mainstream for a long time. In the late 60's Bonnie and Clyde changed all this. Its mix of violence, New Hollywood style, anti-authoritarian stance and counter-culture relevance brought the gangster film right up to date. The scene was set for The Godfather.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola's film was the first epic gangster film. It made it a durable genre. But it was significantly different to the 30's gangster movies like The Public Enemy. It was not a rise and fall narrative. Don Vito Corleone begins the film at the height of his powers and dies peacefully while playing with his grandson; he does not die in the gutter. Neither does he exhibit the brash over-reaching arrogance that typified the 30's gangsters. He treats his position within the community as a responsibility and he has moral limits. The film does not end with the fall of the crime family; it climaxes with Michael Corleone at the absolute peak of his powers. The changes to censorship now allowed for a narrative to focus on criminals, in the case of The Godfather it went as far as virtually eliminating every other point-of-view; in this film people out with the crime family are the aliens. Where the 30's gangsters were at odds with society, the gangster here is the power structure. The Corleones are the good bad guys. When this film was made Vietnam had destroyed the certainties Americans had about their country. The Godfather seemed to say if American society is rotten, organised crime is only part of the problem, sometimes the solution.<br/><br/>The film stressed the universal theme of loyalty to the family. This helped cloak its critique of American society in a conservative framework. It not only put the gangster back in the centre of film narrative but it also stressed ethnicity in a positive way. They were no longer apart but important members of the establishment. The law enforcers depicted here are more corrupt. They act in a criminal way but without any moral code. In many ways it is a transgressive film.<br/><br/>Acting is great across the board. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall stand out particularly in a true heavyweight cast. The story unfolds beautifully with a fantastic script to propel it. Coppola holds the whole thing together with some brilliance. He doesn't really do anything fancy but just lets all the superlative components at his disposal do their thing and ensures they all connect together into a film of huge class. The Godfather is a masterwork and remains a primary reason why the era of the New Hollywood will always be cherished."

","IMDb Top 250: 2 The Godfather is the single greatest film ever made. A lofty claim, but so far there is not a single picture elsewhere that I feel deserves that title. And you're going to find out why.<br/><br/>The Godfather tells the sprawling tale of the Corleone family, a mafia family after the Second World War. Over the course of the 2 hours and 50 minute epic, you will see the best drama, characters and atmosphere to ever grace the screen.<br/><br/>It starts with the Godfather Waltz theme, an iconic piece. Just like that, the stage is set for the most Italian film ever. I believe it was the producer who wanted Coppola to direct because he was Italian. He wanted audiences to ""smell the spaghetti"" watching this film. Anyway, we then cut to a man's face, talking to an unseen figure, pleading to him for justice. Emotion drips off every word. Every scene in the Godfather has purpose, every line of dialogue has meaning. The camera switches to the other side of the table- Marlon Brando sits, hair slicked, moustache, rose in suit, cat on lap, in all of his glory as Don Vito Corleone, one of the most iconic characters ever.<br/><br/>Have I said 'iconic' a lot? Much of the Godfather is. The Don himself, Michael's rise, Sonny's temper, the offer you can't refuse.<br/><br/>The setting is very important to the Godfather. 1946 New York is wonderfully put together, as well as the hills of Sicily and for a short period of time, Las Vegas. Every scene is full, no scene is filler. Inside of each scene is dialogue- lots of it. But you'll hang on to every word, because of the content and the flawless delivery. Action in the Godfather is sparse, but like the hits shown, short and brutal. You'll be kept on your toes. Anyone can die at any moment, and they do. The pacing is perfect.<br/><br/>The characters are some of the greatest compiled in a film, and any of the major characters could carry a film on their own. The Don's mumble, appearance and honour are perfected by Brando. Pacino convincingly, slowly shows what being in a mafia family can do to even a kind boy who isn't a part of it. Tom Hagen is the logic and calm in the sea of guns and violence. And Sonny, with his temper and tongue steals scenes.<br/><br/>Perfectly executed, the sweeping story is so well interwoven you might not get it all on the first viewing. It all makes sense though: everything happens for a reason, and everything is explained. From the beginning wedding, to the diner, and ending with Michael's transformation, the plot of the Godfather is one of the best.<br/><br/>I hope I've convinced you to see this masterpiece, or if you've already seen it, see it again. No amount of talking can equal to actually seeing it. Better than Shawshank, better than its own Part II, The Godfather is the best movie ever made and you cannot say you love movies until you've seen the Godfather. See this movie, and order a lasagna. 10/10"

You wonder, will you ever be able to watch another film without using The Godfather as a bench-mark. You won't be able to help yourself.<br/><br/>I hadn't seen the trilogy until recently. I have now watched it twice in the space of a month. The whole film is gripping. I hated characters, loved others, and felt the very conflict the whole film was about. You wonder what you would do. You search your soul. No one should die without seeing this film."

","So I have finally seen one of the most iconic films of all time. How does it feel? Like I accomplished something. One has to be keen on not having huge expectations when one watches films of this grand respect and stature in history. How was it?<br/><br/>The film does start slow, and from the first appreance of Brando to be honest I couldn't understand him much. However, over time goes by I was more and more interested in him. I was shocked when several scenes played out, and I am surprised that this isn't Brando's film. This is Pacino's film. Pacino is completely mesmerizing in his approach and character, and he is the one who has a transformation. He is somewhat of a bigger lead character than Brando. The entire cast is outstanding, and you really get to appreciate the script when you can really see the film with subtitles and realize how great the dialogue is.<br/><br/>Ready for Part 2!"

Then he finds out it's a bad idea because he gets shot... don't worry he didn't die.. not yet anyway. Michael his son decides to take care of him while he is the hospital..this in turn leads Michael to decide he wants to be part of the family business. He gets a sucker punch from a crooked cop. That leads to him being mad so the family want revenge. He meets them at a restaurant and for those of you who have seen the film.. you know what happens. Anyway Michael goes into hiding in Italy.. he then comes back years later and marries his old sweat heart Kay. He is now the boss of the family.<br/><br/>That tells you a lot about the plot but I think it is necessary to let you know what you are in for if you want to know about this film. I will now tell you about the cinematography it is gorgeous views on location in Italy out in the country.. also the look in new york all dark and sinister is great feel for the film.. I also love when they go to Las Vegas near the end and Michael wants to get a gaming license in Nevada. This is historically accurate in a sense that the mob made Las Vegas what you see today (the vision came from Bugsy Siegel.Now the music is the most amazing score I have ever come across in my life.. it is just fantastic.. You just have to watch the film to experience to this whole arc of family, loyalty and greed is one of the best portraits of the mafia you will ever see. <br/><br/>In all this is a great film about family and how you can't get out of anything you love.. because once your in the mob there is no way out except you know what <br/><br/>I love this film I rank it number 3 on my all time list.. and I just love it..

"jake-law123","8","1","3","6 June 2010"," A movie you can't refuse.
","Living up to the edge of this film is what each mob film stands for. This is the film that started the mob genre in my opinion. A classic story in its own mind, and a perfect hit to cinema. Based off the saga by Mario Puzo, director Francis Ford Coppola's first chapter of the epic legacy that lives on as The Godfather. The tale of a crime organization in the 1940s that go into a struggle for power when the leader is shot and hospitalized in a conspiracy, though continuously tended by his trusted sons, played by some of the now famous actors ever, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Al Pacino. Terrificly follows the novel, with solid editing and setting, and outstanding performances by everybody. Fits elements that put you into the shoes of a true mobster, dealing with real mandatory things in a crime family, jobs, deaths, and deals. Marlon Brando as Don Corleone is a magnificent performance that really gets into the character of a true mob leader, making offers people can't refuse. Coppola's best work ever, and one of the greatest films ever made!"
"skinny_pigeon","10","1","3","31 May 2010"," The only Film without a mistake.
","Undoubtedly the best picture of all times and perhaps the only movie without a plot hole in the history of film making. Not a single scene or a line is unnecessary in the whole film. The direction, casting, plot, music, cinematography, acting, lines, everything seems just perfect. Al Paccino and Brando simply were born for their roles. But please don't bother to watch this epic film if you do like movies with extreme violence, sense less killing, unnecessary car chases and the hero fighting ten people at a time with bare hands. This film is totally in a different league, you simply cannot compare it to any other crime or gangster movie ever made. The way Al Paccino transformed himself from a subtle, educated and sophisticated Italian American into a typical Italian mafia boss, is without a doubt one of the best performances of all times."

"KevinFullerton1990","9","1","3","23 April 2009"," A Great Film That You Should Definitely Watch.
","*****Spoilers Ahead***** 'The Godfather' is a film that everyone knows about. It is the type of film that is so heavily ingrained within popular culture that every reference, parody, and outright copy is almost a culture unto itself. It is because of this that even if you have not had the pleasure of viewing Francis Ford Coppola's master work, you feel like you have. It is also because of this that a surprising number of people never get around to watching 'The Godfather'. Afraid that they'll be entering a world of endless Mafia cliché and hackneyed dialogue, they steer clear of this gem of a film. A few days ago I was one of those people. Now - after picking up the box set for the meagre sum of fifteen pounds – I would count myself as one of the lucky portion of the population who has seen 'The Godfather'.<br/><br/>For the uninformed the story of 'The Godfather' is, on the surface, simple gangster fare. The film, set in the late forties, follows the trials and tribulations of the Corleone family – one of five mobs in New York – as they try to stay on top as the supreme power in the city. What actually comes is a complex tale which carries weighty themes such as the corruption of innocence, the loss of the American Dream, and the cyclical nature of a life in crime.<br/><br/>What struck me most about 'The Godfather' was how sedate it was when compared with other pieces of cinema. A few nights before, I watched 'City of God', a film about child gangs in Rio De Janeiro. This film, although slick and well presented, ultimately didn't leave much room for reflection on what is a very heavy and ugly subject; It left me feeling cold. It tried to point out the horrific state that Brazilian slums were in, but was so desperate to look good that it almost missed its own point.<br/><br/>In stark contrast, 'The Godfather' is nothing if not thoughtful. Every scene, although well directed, never tries to point out its own style in any kind of pronounced manner. This could be more to do with older directorial styles but it still stands out. In a time when films revolving around gangs are nothing but frenetic gun-toting festivals of violence, blood, guts, and vague subtexts, it is refreshing to see a film that presents its concepts and central themes in a way that allows the viewer to actually digest them. Any on-screen violence that does happen is necessary to move the plot forward and is exactly the way cinema violence should be – blunt, seemingly real, and uncomfortable to watch. It is as though the film has sat you down and said ""This violence here. You see that? Pretty nasty huh? You don't want to see it again, do you? No? Good. Now listen to what we have to say about the flawed nature of the American Dream."" It actively makes you despise the brutality of a life in crime by making it feel relentlessly vicious.<br/><br/>This is illustrated in one scene involving family member Michael in a café. His task is to kill the two men opposite him. A train can be heard outside. As the noise of the train becomes louder and louder we see Michaels hand in his pocket, desperately toying with the gun. His face is tense and sweating profusely. The train grows louder and louder still, its cacophony overwhelming to the viewer, and you can feel the tension that must be welling up inside of Michael until he eventually pulls the trigger in what turns out to be a fairly botched assassination. Not only does this type of abhorrence to violence help make you acutely aware of the horrid nature of the 'family business' but it also drives Michaels story along as he becomes more desensitised to this type of brutality whilst he climbs the ranks of his business before becoming the patriarchal figure that he had, at one time, no desire to be. By the end of the film, a killing is nothing in the eyes of what was once an honest American citizen with unfortunate family ties.<br/><br/>I mentioned in the opening paragraph that 'The Godfather' is a film that is referenced so much that it is easy to pass it by whilst still somehow feeling like you've watched it. Although you still kind of get that feeling on viewing, it feels more like a welcoming friend than a cliché ridden hammy mess. From the iconic music to the infamous line ""We'll make him an offer he can't refuse"", from the horses head in the bed to badda bing badda boom. No matter how many parodies of 'The Godfather' you may have seen - and there are a lot of them – these moments that we all know of never detract from a full viewing. When everything is in context and being performed by an astonishingly good cast you forget about every other crappy gangster film you've ever seen and just get sucked straight in.<br/><br/>In conclusion, watch this film. No matter who you are or what films you usually like, watch this one. Even if you don't enjoy it, it's worth just experiencing such a beautifully made film. If you can pick up the Coppola restoration then it's even better to look at. Do it now. Watch it!"
"sand_man002","10","1","3","14 October 2008"," Indeed a great start to one of the greatest trilogies ever!
","The Godfather is indeed a great start for the trilogy and a great movie alone. The thing that I admired most about this film is the extensive quality of story, you always know whats going on if you listen carefully. It's really dramatic without getting too dramatic which is the fine line between effective and ridiculous, and The Godfather balances on that line perfectly. Cinematography is a part of what gives this movie classic status, the camera work gives the Godfather a slightly sinister effect with the shadows which is more apparent in some scenes set at night.<br/><br/>Performances are top notch from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and of course John Cazale. There much more great performances. The score of The Godfather is probably the best of all time. It helps the drama and settings. The Godfather's sets are really accurate for the time it is portraying and the Italian family environment. Overall this three hour crime family epic is great cinema that is only beaten by part two in my own personal opinion."

","People lately have been having heated debates about TDK and the Godfather. Which is better? Everyone has their opinion, and I start my review with a Latin proverb: De Gustibus non Disputandum est. This means you can't argue with taste.<br/><br/>My opinion is that the godfather is a movie of great quality, however, there are other movies, TDK, for instance which are more entertaining. <br/><br/>Its similar to how in high school, they make you read all those dreadful ""classics"" To Kill a Mockinbird, Fahrenheit 451, The Great Gatsby, Macbeth, Hamlet... etc. Even though Harry Potter might be exponentially more exciting than this list of classics, it doesn't have that much literary value. Was it an enjoyable read? Of course. But I won't be telling my grandkids all the lessons harry potter taught me."

","Wow, this is a great film. Repeated (and I do mean repeated) viewings have not changed its power to fascinate and enthrall after all these years. Like the great Greek tragedies, Godfathers I and II just speak the essential truth about humanity and familial relationships in a way that everyone can relate to and can use to understand their own lives. Great art has the power to do that. All of the elements - screenplay, cinematography, acting, music - come together just about perfectly. Perhaps it is because of an accident of time and place and circumstance, like Casablanca, but it is hard to imagine this film being done any other way, or being remade by anyone else, with another cast. Truly one of the essential movies in the cinematic canon."

I believe strongly that, this movie has a special place for everyone. Godfather makes clear the distinctions between conflict of interests and the power of mafia.<br/><br/>I muscularly claim that, this movie is the best movie that ever made. Francis Ford Coppola made the novel of Mario Puzo become a masterpiece of art. The Corleone family is so perfectly portrayed that while watching the film you may think that you are a member of the family.<br/><br/>What about the characters of Godfather This is the fact that, we cannot see the heroes of this film in the street. I mean this is not the film that completely fit the life. The all characters of the movie are extraordinary. And therefore it is very hard to create these heroes behind the camera. That is why Marlon Brando (Don Vito Corleone), Al Pacino(Michael Corleone) or James Caan (Santino 'Sonny' Corleone) made their life job. In reality, goodhearted Don Vito Corleone has already become the symbol of the dark side of the underground. What is interesting is that, Don Vito for whom everyone feels admiration is the mixing of the bad and the good.<br/><br/>The details in this movie make itself very gripping which is the excellence of The Godfather. For example the way of speaking of Don Vito Corleone is really unforgettable. The performance of Marlon Brando really deserves a great appreciation.<br/><br/>What is also very interesting about this movie is that, this is the turning point of the drama & thriller in the movie history. Today, you can see several imitations of this movie.<br/><br/>All in all, from the director to the actors, this film certainly deserves to be best film that ever made. .

Like, for instance, when the movie mogul wakes up to find his prized horse's head in his bed. Just thinking of the horror of that actually happening to someone, you know he's not going to go against the Godfather's wishes. And the moment Michael pulls the trigger to kill the drug kingpin and the police captain which means he is no longer an innocent bystander and is fully ""in.""

The movie is still so great, that this blunder is forgivable. But, at least for me, it will never be the same again. If you read any further, you may be as disappointed as I was.<br/><br/>When Michael decides to try and kill Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey, he assumes that the three will be alone in a restaurant without further protection from the Sollozzo family, so Michael will be able to walk away after shooting them down. This assumption is completely unfounded; for all the Corleones know, the place could have been packed with Sollozzo men. The whole plan revolves around the idea that they will be able to find out the place of the meeting in advance, which was to be unilaterally chosen by the enemy. Well, in the event, the Corleones do find the name of the restaurant. They still assume their victims will have no protection, and now they know where the three will be. What could be easier than sending a couple of men there to do the deed, instead of planting the gun for the inexperienced Michael, which is patently a riskier approach? No group of thugs would have overlooked this. In the movie, the option is not even mentioned."

Many argue it is the finest example of such a medium. Both The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II won Best Picture in the years of 1972 and 1974. The films spawned continuously growing numbers of so-called ""gangster flicks"", most of them not having the same delicate, operatic beauty of Francis Ford Coppola's classic. At present, and forever more, the film will consistently rank among the most flawless; perfectly illustrating an era when American cinema really was at the top of its game.<br/><br/>Charting the rise and fall of a ruthless family of high-class society members who have made their fortune through crime, The Godfather remains a story which enthrals and grasps the imagination of viewers from all generations. It is an essay of violence; nevertheless, some accuse the film of being a study of family, rather than of gangsters. Being that, technically speaking, the film uses ""gangsterism"" as a means of driving the film's key motifs, such as that of dedication and reliance to one's family. Kicking off with the wedding sequence the film details an Italian-American family's ascent into an intensifying success (and failure) through organised crime. After returning from the war, a reluctant Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) makes his best attempts at distancing himself from his Mafia ties. Unlike the rest of his brothers, he feels obliged to live a fruitful life as a law-abiding citizen, but due to obligations and regard for his family he soon becomes more inclined to ""join the family"" because of a number of pressing commitment and loyalty issues.<br/><br/>Arguably, the theme of ""violence breeding violence"" is one which has been wildly overdone throughout cinema history. Yet The Godfather is a work which uses the theme to the best of its extent. The depiction of cold-blooded brutality within the picture has not lost any of its raw and painful pragmatism. Indeed, it is the ""matter-of-fact"" nature of the film which makes it unquestionably powerful. Since the violence portrayed is not particularly graphic, but presented in a way which strikes the viewer due to the what seems like- prolonged nature of the appearance. Essentially, much of The Godfather oozes a sense of unequalled menace, not due to the violence, but the scale of operatic themes conveyed through such an awe-inspiring sensation of film-making splendour.<br/><br/>Every element participates in creating the finished version of a film, and The Godfather is a primary instance of even the most intricate details being perfected to a point of enabling the film to become entirely flawless. The masterpiece provides viewers with performances which remain unmatched in their scope, and rank among a league of their own. How the performers utilise their characters, while serving as a means of polishing the film is truly exceptional. Renowned actors, such as Marlon Brando, James Caan and Robert Duvall offer performances of such inconspicuous allure that they soon become almost unrecognisable from that of their character. To detail the performances would take a lifetime, being that there is such a considerable amount of material to analysis within career-defining performances, which offer more and more with each and every viewing. The performances are deliberately faultless so as to be valued and studied as each year goes by.<br/><br/>The legendary and widely celebrated baptism scene coveys editing in a manner unlike practically anything made prior and following the film. A sequence crafted on an acrimonious feeling of guilt; permitting the work to become even more emotionally engaging and terrifying in its momentum. Cutting from the ""false"" commitment of Catholic oath, to the hiring of vicious contract killings it conveys the deepest feeling of tentative regret and unholy guilt. Gordon Willis' foreboding cinematography is a genuine accomplishment of epic proportions. The cinematography is the kind which has evidently stood the test of time, letting viewers relish the profound and unique aura of the elegantly gracious camera work through long, ominous takes and fragile pull-backs. It is of such sophistication that The Godfather compels its viewers to feel the impression of being in the company of an auteur. Next up is the score, remaining one of the crucial tones to the picture. Composed by Nino Rota, the score enhances the emotive style that the film follows throughout the duration.<br/><br/>I have been watching The Godfather for many years now and it remains one of my unquestionably favourite films. Cinema has endured decades of revolution since The Godfather was first released, but The Godfather still stands tall above nearly all the gangster films which have followed in pursuit. A gangster predecessor which is slightly greater than that of The Godfather is Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas; nevertheless, that is still a debatable opinion of my own. I cannot begin to stress just how deserving The Godfather is of its appreciation, since it is a film which is deservedly identified and credited as a slice of perfection. To think that in 1979 Francis Ford Coppola released a film more superior than The Godfather (the film being Apocalypse Now); I believe this unmistakably puts his auteur status into glaring perspective. All this is much more than a fleeting glimpse of cinematic heaven, considering the viewer becomes just like one of the characters, a controlled puppet for a game, which -in the case of the film- does not manipulate, but engages."
"michael_the_nermal","10","1","3","16 July 2007"," An Excellent Work of Movie-making by Copolla
","Some spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>If you rent the ""Godfather"" DVD and listen to Copolla's comments about the production of the movie, it seems, from his view, that this film was plagued from the start with needling from Paramount studios. He was supposed to film ""The Godfather"" on the cheap with limited resources and constant input from the studio as to what he could do. He was regarded as such a bad director that he was almost fired from the task. His photo director (somebody with more knowledge of movie-making can correct me) thought Copolla didn't know what he was doing with what he thought were odd camera angles. It is the greatest irony of all that this movie became a timeless classic and propelled not only the fortunes of Paramount Studios in 1972, but launched the careers of Copolla as a director, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton as actors, and revived the once-glorious but then-moribund career of Marlon Brando (as you all know, he would later enter a second period of professional and personal decadence).<br/><br/>Copolla was blessed with some of the best actors possible for this movie. Al Pacino was great as the mostly-taciturn but wily and cunning Michael Corleone, the true protagonist of the ""Godfather"" saga. I personally thought he, rather than Brando, should have won the Best Actor Oscar. Michael Caan gives his all as the bombastic and violent Sonny, Michael's older brother. Diane Keaton's performance has been called relatively weak, but I think this is not a fair assessment. She is very good as the naive and rather innocent girlfriend of Michael. Despite cries of nepotism in the casting decision, Talia Shire, Copolla's sister, does well as the battered and frantic sister of the Corleone clan. Robert Duvall is absolutely excellent as the ""brains"" of the Corleone family, Tom Hagen. Of course, Brando's performance is what will be most remembered of this movie, even though he is not on the screen as much as Pacino or Caan. He chose to be creative as the mumbling, aged, and rather stoic leader of the mob family. He is seldom over-the-top, which one may see as a relief to the stock character of the angry, vengeful gangster (Caan fulfills that role to the nines).<br/><br/>Of course, overlooked are the performances of the secondary characters (whose names fail me, precisely because they never achieved fame and fortune on the scale of Pacino, Brando, Duvall, Keaton, or Caan). The guy who played ""The Turk"" Solozzo is a wonderful actor, and convincingly plays the character of the slimy drug-dealing antagonist. Sterling Hayden, who portrayed the loony ""Jack D. Ripper"" in ""Dr. Strangelove,"" also is quite good in his brief role as the evil police captain. I honestly can't be a fair judge of the characters of Fredo Corleone or the infamous henchman, Luca Brazi, as their time on the screen was rather brief. Still, for what it's worth, they did the best they could with what little screen time they had (John Cazale's Fedo would play a much more significant role in the ""Godfather"" sequel).<br/><br/>The movie does have its fair amount of stylistic or memorable violence, but the screen in not chock full of nonstop guts and gore. Copolla's creativity as a director, and his use of stylistic devices, such as the frequent use of running children, dark, gloomy backgrounds, and music juxtaposed with violent images, makes this a highly entertaining movie. The characters are actually deep and make an impression on the viewer. This story is not Marlon's, but rather Pacino's, as we see his character grapple with his decision to join his family's criminal empire after his father is gunned down. We see him, based on his not-so-reluctant decision to murder the man responsible for shooting his father, Solozzo, slowly and credibly evolve from war hero who is not a member of the rackets, to being the ruthless head of the criminal empire. Copolla and Pacino keep us engaged in the story the whole time, with very few abrupt halts in the in the flow of the story.<br/><br/>In short, this is the little film that, in spite of the huge problems it faced, payed off big in terms of box office receipts and critical acclaim. No movie buff should miss this masterpiece; average joes will love it too. Highly recommended."
"TheHande","10","1","3","2 July 2007"," The quintessential mobster film
","The Godfather is a movie about gangsters. But more importantly, it's a film about gangsters that are also real people, with real relatives and family. The Godfather has all the makings of brilliant movie.<br/><br/>The casting is classic with Marlon Brando's unforgettable interpretation of Vito Corleone and the level-headed and dark character of Michael, played by Al Pacino also in the film's two sequels. Aside from great characters the story, pacing and structure of the film has been designed in a way, that even after 2 hours of watching the same movie you still don't feel exhausted like you would with the 2+ hour epics of Peter Jackson.<br/><br/>The movie is also incorrectly said to be dark and gory. Certainly the darkness is warranted, but the gore is set in the film rather sparingly and I would reckon the gore in the two later films much more disturbing, even if it's not as extensive. The violence is here to remind of us of the gritty reality of the film's world and it works in a same way as the great family-celebrations bring out the happier and lighter side of the life of a gangster.<br/><br/>On all levels The Godfather is a brilliant picture. It's brilliantly acted, cast, directed and written. It is a movie with an old-timesy feel that feels fresh each time you watch it."

"mdn02","8","1","3","26 April 2007"," Brilliant, but not the 'greatest movie ever made'
","The Godfather has been timelessly voted the best movie ever, over and over and over again, but its not!!!! However, do not let this opinionated view fool you, it is a fantastic film with nothing wrong with it. This films ranks up with the other most over rated films in existence, such as Star wars: a new hope and Apocalypse now.<br/><br/>The films starts off at a wedding, the daughter of the infamous 'Godfather' is getting married, and we soon find out that on this day of all days, no father can refuse a request. More subplots follow and some interesting dialog is put forward, until the Godfather is gunned down by a rival family. However, he does not die but is in injured, along the way his son dies, and the son of the man who tried to kill him dies. The Godfathers youngest son Michael has to flee the country as he is the one who killed the rival family members son, The godfather is upset as he wanted Michael to be the legitimate member of the family. The plot goes by and Michael returns, and along with the Godfather they kill all the head members of the leading rival families. This is not the best plot summary in the world but it will do.<br/><br/>The film is flawless, as many people constantly state. The acting is great, although Brando should not have won a best actor Oscar? All the other 3 should not have even been nominated for best supporting actors and actresses. But besides this, the give great performances. The script is where most of the talents truly lie, a brilliant story of the Mafia and how it operates, filled with loyalty and betrail this is a film which takes you on an intense and emotional ride. But this film is very very boring in some places, for instance when Michael is hiding out in Italy. Now im no shallow person who has to have action and explosions in movies to feel satisfied, but for a film to be crowned the greatest ever you have to love every bit of the film completely, and everyone will admit there are very boring bits in this. However still a great film. In my opinion, if you really want to a crown a film the best ever, you should look to titles such as Terminator 2, Shawshank Redemption, Master and Commander: The far side of the world, Lord of the rings trilogy"

"joe_alonzo65","10","1","3","23 January 2007"," I have a new favorite movie
","For some inexplicable reason, I've always put off seeing this movie. I remember trying to watch it a couple of times when I was in my early teens, but being unable to get into it. I'm 21 now and have finally gotten around to seeing this cinematic masterpiece, and it has now assumed the top spot in my personal list of favorite films.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is just so well done. The story is a modern epic. What's amazing is that I found myself literally on the edge of my seat for the entire three hours that this movie runs. Not once does it lag or draw out unnecessarily. Personally, I always feel that the longer a movie is the, the better, as it leaves more room for character and plot devolpment, but even in the best of the 170+ minute movies I've seen, there's always a few scenes that you feel could've been cut short or cut altogether. That never happens in The Godfather.<br/><br/>The characters, particularly Vito Corleone (Brando) and Michael Corleone (Pacino), are so dynamic and have such rich backgrounds; this is the key to a good story, IMO. The dialogue is classic, as you'll no doubt recognize many of the lines and expressions that have been incorporated into our modern vernacular.<br/><br/>There's so much more I wish to say about this movie, but I believe I'm running short on space. I'm a young man who doesn't always agree with critics and older audiences as to which films are truly classic. I've never been swayed to like a movie because others say it's great. So the fact that a 34-year old movie still has this kind of appeal to a younger audience is quite telling. I strongly encourage anyone of any age to see this movie. This is the pinnacle of American cinema."

"dwpeak","10","1","3","19 January 2007"," Legendary
","Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather,"" will remain an icon in movie history forever. It gives the audience what few films ever have; flawless and poetic storytelling. The script by Mario Puzo and Coppola (based on Puzo's masterful novel) is beat-by-beat perfect. It is also a study in the form of directing at its best. The legendary performances hold nothing back. It is the kind of movie that film students should be required to watch, because it is one of the few examples of flawless film-making in world history.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" tells us the story of the aging Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Don of an organized crime family in New York. The film is about the decisions he makes for family, love, and business. Whether or not that business is legal. Just as equally, it tells the story of the Godfather's son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), who doesn't wish to become part of his father's dirty business, but finds it hard to choose between right and wrong when it comes to family, pain, and suffering. Ultimately, the film is a tragedy. A tragedy about two family members who love one another, their wives, and their children, but are corrupted by the life around them. This film is also about that ""life"" around them, and the people organized crime affects. No matter what country. No matter when. It takes its toll.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando, in his Oscar-winning performance, gives us one of the best on-screen performances of our time. Do not make the mistake, however, of thinking he is the main character. He shares the spotlight, very much so, with Al Pacino's Michael. Pacino gives us a career-making performance that will make your eyes widen. It's almost hard to believe he about lost his job, but with Coppola's persistence, the producers agreed to keep him on. Robert Duvall plays the family's lawyer and adviser, and adopted son to Vito Corleone. He gives one of his earlier, best performances in this movie. James Caan hits all the right notes as ""Sonny,"" Michael's brother, who handles his power with rough hands. A man, who, if he feels is right, will let you know about it. Whether by talking or through violence. Who can forget Diane Keaton? She plays Michael's wife. Who starts out in love, but may end up confused and startled. A terrific performance. There is also Talia Shire as Sonny and Michael's sister, Connie. She may make several mistakes, but is open, and worried about her life to come.<br/><br/>Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola derived a fabulous script from a fabulous book. The dialogue rings true. It is deep and emotionally complex. It gave light to a gangster picture none had ever seen before. It was drafted like no other.<br/><br/>Coppola is a rare storyteller. As director, he lead us into a world few knew about back then (or now), and did it accurately. His vision is tremendous, and few can even imagine what it must be like to have his talents.<br/><br/>Overall, the picture, without a doubt, is a masterpiece. If you haven't seen it, and are doubtful of all of its awards and reviews, thinking that it might be overrated; don't. If anything, its underrated. Amazing."
"tubkas","10","1","3","19 January 2007"," Worthy of its Oscar
","This was a classic that won best picture, and it was a long movie. This length was actually a necessary evil, however, as a lot went on during the course of the film and it's multiple reversals as well as requiring the time to not only introduce a myriad of characters, but fill them out to be real people.<br/><br/>It took about 45 minutes for this film to pick up some steam and start going due to getting everyone introduced, but being a drama based on a book, the direction changed a few times during the course of the film. This slow start is at once alleviated on a second viewing, however, since knowing the characters the second time around, you ""get"" everything a lot more clearly and the momentum is obvious from the get-go.<br/><br/>Vito Corleone is the Godfather, not only of the Corleone clan, but of many of the people he has come into contact with over the years, particularly in the Italian community. He creates many give and take relationship with a lot of people, and follows through on them. The first part of the film focuses on Vito and his reign as Don, then the focus shifts to between his sons, Michael and Sonny when the Don runs into a bit of trouble. Once Michael is placed center stage as the main character, and even on a first viewing, this was the point where the film really got into its groove and took off.<br/><br/>It got a little slow while Michael ran off to Sicily, and that all seemed like a big side story we could deal without, but it allowed Sonny's reign to come and go, which was not necessarily a pleasant thing.<br/><br/>The characters, as I said, were numerous and well-rounded, and it's just astounding how well they were drawn throughout the film. Granted, the length of the film allowed this luxury and a shorter film likely would have dropped all those little moments which make these fictional characters seem real, but it worked so well.<br/><br/>It ended up being a solid film and certainly worthy of its Oscar. However, this movie should only be approached if you're in the mood to be thought-provoked."

","THE GODFATHER is an example of how stories change over the years. In Washington Irving's LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW, we had the headless horseman. In Mario Puzo's GODFATHER, we had the headless horse.<br/><br/>In all seriousness, there is only one other movie I have given a perfect 10 to so far, and that's TORA TORA TORA. It took me a while to appreciate this movie. The first time I saw GODFATHER, I saw more blood and gore than I remember ever seeing in any movie before, though it's pretty tame by today's standards. My mind wandered quite a bit during it and I came out of there kind of glad it was over. Then, several months later, I heard the soundtrack and I liked it so much, I thought I would give this movie another chance. It has come to be my all time favorite movie. And the music is still great. The mellow, folklike soundtrack provides a nice balance to the violence that goes on throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola is faithful to the book and tells the story very well. Watching the way certain scenes are set up is like watching the workings of a fine Swiss watch, it is that good. It gives depth and insight into the workings of the Mafia that no other movie before or since ever has. The point of view this story is told in is controversial, ie, they give you possible justifications for some of the things they do, and it almost makes you sympathize with the characters. The most telling lines in the story is when Michael comes back after hiding out in Sicily for the murder of a police officer and a bigshot in a rival family. He is talking to Kay, telling her he has decided to go into business with his father, and tells her that his father is no different than anyone else who is responsible for people's welfare, like a Congressman or President. Kay states that is naive because Congressmen and Presidents don't have people killed. Michael then fixes her with that patented stare (Al Pacino was perfect in this role) and says, ""Who's being naive, Kay?"" That is a very chilling moment, as is Michael's transformation from wholesome American war hero to the head of one of the most powerful Mafia families in the country. Another telling moment is when Michael meets with his father in the garden and they are discussing business strategies, and the Don says, ""I don't apologize for my life. I did what I had to to protect my family, and I refused to be a fool for those pezzanovante who were holding the strings."" In conclusion, you will have a tough time convincing me that there is a Mafia movie anywhere that is better than THE GODFATHER. 10 out of 10."

The film was as brilliant as I had expected, and more.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" thrills right to the core of the world of Italian-American (gangster) families after the second World War. In the year 1946 the Corleone family has a powerful position in the under world. The family's head don Vito Corleone (just amazing Marlon Brando) has connections and relations in politics, police forces etc. But he also has enemies. There is also four other families wanting to have as much power as they can get. The first big trouble emerges when don Vito refuses to take part in narcotic-business. There is conspiracy and vengeance bubbling underneath.<br/><br/>One of the most fascinating themes in the movie is Corleone's youngest son's (Al Pacino) struggle of being part of the gangster family. Don Vito does not want Michael to involve family business but the blood is thicker than wine. Michael says he is not going to become like his father but in time he will realize that his destiny is to become the Godfather.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola's magnificent directing and amazing script of the author Mario Puzo makes ""The Godfather"" very enjoyable and thrilling to watch. Also the talented cast (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall etc.)is like a cherry on the top of delicious ice-cream portion.<br/><br/>The film is really capturing.

First, it is loving your family and depend on them. You always protect them from every dangerous situation, and it doesn't matter how to do. You can do it legally or illegally. Second thing is always being calm and strong-minded. If you are calm and strong-minded, you will be able to protect your family. This movie teaches people it. You must watch this movie if you never watched it before. If you watched it before, you must watch it again and again, so you can understand the thought of this movie."

","This is perhaps my favorite film of all time. No other picture of its kind is even comparable. It's such a great film that I almost find it difficult to write about. From the cast to the cinematography to the music, this movie leaves you absolutely mesmerized throughout.<br/><br/>The Godfather is not just another ""Mob"" picture, it is a portrayal of family, life, love & loss. It has just the right elements to captivate any audience. I was probably 12 or 13 years old the first time I viewed this film, and I never grow tired of watching it. The cast really, really made this picture. This movie has perhaps the best cast of characters and acting of any film ever made.<br/><br/>I would love to review each character individually, but I can't. The entire cast no matter how large or small the part, is amazing. This movie is both a classic, and has aged well in the process. I would recommend this film to everyone, no matter what your movie genera preference is."

","The year is 1970. F.F. Coppola has just directed ""The Rain People"" (1969), a good, but not great, movie, starring R. Duval and James Caan. Coppola is then offered to direct the Mario Puzzo best-seller, ""The Godfather"". Coppola accepts, but has his own suggestions for the leading roles: Marlon Brando shall incarnate Vito Corleone -the ""godfather"", while an unknown actor, someone called Al Pacino, is suggested for the most important role in the film; he'll play Michael Corleone, the second son of Vito, the soon-to-be godfather. Paramount isn't very keen of either suggestions. They'd prefer George C. Scott for the leading part and Dustin Hoffmann or Jack Nicholson for the role of Michael. Pacino is discarded for the unforgivable crime of being ""a midget"". Brando, the unconventional ""bad boy"", is out of question. Coppola finally got his way. Thankfully.<br/><br/>Also starring are former collaborators -see the ""Rain People""- R. Duval and James Caan, while there are also a few Coppola-family members contributing: Talia Shire, Coppola's sister, stars and Carmine Coppola, Francis' father, writes the music, along with long-time Fellini collaborator, Nino Rota. Sophia Coppola, the director's daughter, also known as a director herself, makes also a snapshot in the movie -she's the girl who's being baptized at the end of the film.<br/><br/>These were only unnecessary information. The point lies elsewhere: ""The Godfather"" is probably the best American movie of all times. It's not the flawless cinematography, nor the mesmerizing acting by all the actors. And it's not the simply breath-taking music score, or the amazing plot. It's the summary of all the above. It may sound childish, but I will say it: Everyone did their job splendidly.<br/><br/>To start with, the plot is fascinating. Brando is the mafia godfather, a Shakespearian figure, who dances on the edge of life and death and has to pay. It's notable, that the audience feels sorry and sympathy for him, although he is a sheer killer. ""We're not butchers, despite what this undertaker thinks"", implies Vito in the beginning of the film. Simply brilliant: A killer is thought to be one by an undertaker. Does it get any better? Apparently, yes. Vito is shot nearly dead by a rival family and Michael appears on the screen. Revenge, business, interest and death are the ingredients of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Secondly, the acting is just sublime. Brando makes the best performance in his career -it's a draw with ""Apocalypse Now"". Caan is excellent, so's Duval. But the key-performance is the one from Pacino. He tries to evolve from a shy-idealist-soldier-boy to a coldblooded-evil-adult. And he succeeds. It's simply one of the very great performances ever.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the music can't get any better. Written in the motives of Fellini's movies, Rota did his best. Can't get bettered.<br/><br/>Finally, and most importantly, the cinematography stands above any criticism. There are so many memorable scenes: Brando's shooting, the wedding sequence, the Turk's murder by Pacino -this one's the key-scene of the film, the Sicily sequence, the scene in the garden between Vito and Michael, the ""double"" baptism, followed by the murders etc.<br/><br/>It lasts more then two-and-a-half hours. But it doesn't show. It's so unique, so fascinating, that you're gonna ask for more. Are you searching for a flawless film? Stop searching; you're in the right place. Highly, no, hugely recommended.<br/><br/>Thank you."
"ashish-verma-82","10","1","3","6 September 2006"," The Best movie of all times
","The best way to describe The Godfather is flawless in every way that a movie can be flawed. It exceeds expectations of what should be put into a movie from everyone involved.<br/><br/>Coppola directs The Godfather with obsessive precision. Every shot is shown in its own way for a reason, and if something is put into place, it has a purpose. The cinematography for such a small-scale story is breathtaking. The shots of small, old-style Sicily villages and rain-soaked, film noir-ish New York streets are immensely innovative.<br/><br/>With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando creates a personage that will be remembered for ever... The line ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" has reached legendary statues. Brando's Don Corleone is the moral center of the film: a tough, wise, feared old Sicilian who has risen to become an all powerful leader in an empire of Italian-American organized crime.<br/><br/>Al Pacino's gradual and subtle transformation is the heart of the film. From a gentle man to one of the most cunning, ruthless, and cold-blooded man ever to come on the screen, he has learned from his father never to talk in front of outsiders and always keep his own counsel. His commandment: ""Never to take sides against the Family."" Although there may be no overt condemnation of the moral position of the Mafia, there is implied criticism of its bloodier deeds. All the characters, whatever the crimes of which they may be guilty, are careful to pay lip-service to the Catholic Church and its rituals. Throughout the film (indeed, throughout the trilogy as a whole) the traditional ceremonies of the Church form a backdrop to various criminal activities. ('The Godfather' begins with a wedding and ends with a baptism). It seemed to me that Coppola was using these scenes to make an ironic contrast between the values of organized crime and those of Christianity, especially at the end of the film. Michael, already a 'godfather' in the metaphorical sense of a Mafia boss, becomes one in the literal sense of a baptismal sponsor. Shots of him taking vows on behalf of his godchild to reject the works of the devil are intercut with shots of his enemies being gunned down on his orders.<br/><br/>This is the first and most powerful installment in arguably the best trilogy in the history of film. This movie alone has paved the way for epics and single-handedly created new standards for film-making excellence."

He sees that he can bring it to an end, and that he must do it. Even though he will have to assume a role immersed in this terrible world, and appear to do terrible things.

","The Godfather had many in awe during its prime, and it still does today. One of the greatest organized crime films ever created, let alone one of the greatest movies ever created, it shows that anything goes as a mobster in the Itlian mafia. Al Pacino became world famous for his role as Micheal Corleon, son of Don Vito Corleon (Marlon Brando), as he prepares to take the family business from his father. As an Italian myself, I can greatly appreciate what this film is trying to do... show what life is really like as a mobster, and what they practically do. Forget the mobster movie flops, or the Sopranos, this movie shows it all. And to follow it up with an even greater sequel is incredible. It's a masterpiece, a must-see by far."

","I have watched this movie twice in my life. The first time maybe I was too young to understand, however capable of grasping the tension of Brando's and Pacino's outstanding performances..Complexion and variety of feelings and emotions were all over the place...Simplicity is I believe what great performances are all about..A slight move of the hand(like the one that Brando touches his cheek at the first scene or the look at Pacino's eyes in the scene of the baptismal while on the same time resetting his empire)..One of the greatest Greek actors, Dimitris Horn, said that ""Actor means internal light"", and in this film we found a -two- truly great example(s) of Horn's quotation.....The second time I was to see how contemporary a film ""The Godfather"" also was- what we could call classical...Vito Copleone's character could , quite ironical and strangely, set an example to the modern rulers of the world, with the 'dignity' with which he faces his enemies and 'runs his business'... on the same time, through the lovely portrayal of the family life of the Corleones, Francis Ford Coppola, I believe , manages to comment on the sadness and tragedy that lye underneath every,ostensibly, ordinary life...The best part of this extraordinary film is I believe the way Mickle Corleone descends into his personal Adis, as (personaly) I cannot make out whether his choices are affected by the duty he feels he owns to his beloved father or from his own nature- intrigued by adventure, power and hate...The best thing I believe is that I'll never understand.American is used to explain everything to its viewers.

"Malexolson","10","1","3","4 August 2006"," The Greatest Mafia Movie Ever Made!
","How can you doubt it? From the very moment the picture started, I had goosebumps. Marlon Brando gives an excellent Oscar winning performance, that I can't imagine anyone else playing Don Vito Corleone. Not to mention its Oscar nominated actors in supporting roles, Al Pacino, James Caan (who should have won), and Robert Duvall. The directing is absolutely spellbinding, the cinematography is terrific, costume design is great. To me, there is no better mob movie that explains the troubles of a Italian family in crime. I have many many favorite scenes, especially everyone else's favorite scene when John Marley finds his prized horse's head in his bed. There's that, and when Michael sends his guys to whack Moe Green and others during his baptism. The saddest scene in the film was when Sonny gets murdered, I know he was an ass-hole but he was cool too, it upset me so much I almost couldn't watch it anymore. I think the only scene that grabbed me was the very beginning of the film, when a man asks for ""justice"" over his daughter. I don't know why it always got my close attention, maybe it was because it was the very first scene in the movie, but ever since I was hooked on seeing that first scene whenever I would watch it. People often say that the best thing they get out of this film is Al Pacino as Michael, but I sort of disagree. Al Pacino launched his career in this movie, but the key element in this movie is Marlon Brando. This is the best and my favorite performance he has ever given in a movie, mainly because it was the first movie I have ever seen of him. I can honestly tell ya, that there is nothing like The Godfather. Ever! 11/10!"
"Roger_Sterling","10","1","3","6 July 2006"," An offer you can't refuse.
","Is The Godfather the best movie ever? Does it deserve #1 on the top 250? That's up to you. I don't think it deserves it, but it DEFINITELY deserves a spot on the top 250. Only a fool couldn't see why Marlon Brando won the Oscar for best actor for his role as Don Vito Corleone, even though he turned it down. This probably won best picture easily, but I wouldn't know. To tell the truth, The Godfather should have won all 11 Oscars it was nominated for. Al Pacino and Robert Duvall were amazing in this movie. Some people call it the best of The Godfather series, and even though I haven't seen parts II and III, I don't doubt them.<br/><br/>The most memorable parts, scenes that have been copied countless times on TV and other films, are the toll booth scenes where Sonny dies and the cutbacks with the baptism of Connie's baby and the murders of the leaders of the other 4 families."
"Lt_Coffey_182","10","1","3","28 May 2006"," An example of how films should be made. Perfect.
","There is nothing I can say about this film that hasn't been said already but that's not going to stop me praising this film. Simply put, The Godfather is one of the best films ever made and is often considered to be the best by many. For an explanation, it's impossible to pick any one reason as this is a near perfect film with all elements set perfectly in place.<br/><br/>A very important part of The Godfather's iconic status is Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone. His profile from the first film has provided a symbol which represents all three films, despite Brando only being in the first instalment, and an icon that commands respect. Brando appeared long finished as an actor, his looks diminishing and his status being lost but his classic performance in The Godfather put him firmly back on the acting map, where he now has a permanent place. His performance is excellent in this film, despite his mouth being crowded by moth balls! OK, so you can't hear every word he says, but you don't need to when his body language and non-verbal cues say so much for themselves. The character of Vito is very powerful, yet very frail and Brando puts these two qualities in perfect juxtaposition. A classic display, which still gets talked about 30 years on. Al Pacino whose film career was just beginning with this film, is also fantastic and ensured that wherever the film was plot wise, that powerful displays were on show at all times. His character transformation is compelling and his storyline with Diane Keaton is intriguing to give Godfather a more personal atmosphere and also to provide a much deeper plot. This film is seen as a landmark for acting, with Brando winning an Academy Award and with Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duval all receiving nominations.<br/><br/>Central to the films core is the plot which is so intensely dramatic, that two hours does not seem enough to justify such a story. There are dozens of relationships involved in this story and there is an assassination plot and both Michael and Vito Corleone have their own separate storyline. All of these are done fantastically, ensuring the audience can have full empathy for all the characters and also be thoroughly entertained. Mario Puzo is clearly a gifted writer and does a fantastic job of portraying criminal organisations and what goes on in these families, a true representation or not, it makes for a fantastic film. Whilst his success in film was mainly limited to The Godfather series and Superman, Puzo must be gifted to write such material and was definitely worthy of the awards he won. The Godfather is a prime example of what is missing in most of today's films; a character driven plot. This film shows that you do not need explosions and high octane chases to keep an audience gripped and that a quality script and fascinating characters are enough to amass an audience.<br/><br/>This is all wonderfully brought together by Francis Ford Coppola who, because of this film, has left his mark on the film world for eternity. It is the atmosphere he builds in this film that makes it so effective. Everything is dark and bleak except for when Pacino is exiled but that ends in tragedy. Coppola does brilliantly to emphasise the point that the world of criminal organisations is not a nice place and that no matter how safe you feel, your fate is waiting for you just around the corner. The film contains very little in the way of set pieces, instead everything appears very intimate, highlighting how personal the Mafia can be. The uncompromising nature of the film must have been very shocking at the time as there is a lot of violence that would have been skirted around at the time.<br/><br/>The classic score to The Godfather is also integral to the film as it compliments all the visual elements on the screen. The sophisticated appearance of the Mafioso for instance and the general demeanour of the higher ranked gangsters are emphasised by the slow classical music.<br/><br/>This film is responsible for most of the post modern approach to film making and acting and his also the landmark to which other crime movies compare themselves. The Godfather's image and style live to this day and will for generations to come. The first of a fantastic series, Godfather is an example of how films should be."

","This must be, if not the, one of my favorite films of all.<br/><br/>This masterpiece directed by Francis Ford Coppola is great, and the novel written by Mario Puzo is similarly magnificent. What I especially enjoy about this film are the dialogs. I believe that the best example of this would be the ever-lasting quote by Don Vito Corleone is ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" Another wonderful thing about this movie is that, despite the Paramount Executives, Al Pacino got the part for Michael Corleone, and ultimately made Pacino famous. The casting was exceedingly good: Bobby Duvall, Jimmy Caan, Talia Shire, Al Pacino, and Marlon Brando."

","It's not my personal #1 movie of all time, but after finally watching it I can understand why it's usually regarded as the greatest by so many. It can seem a little dated at times, but for a film that is over thirty years old it still stands up. Slow and deliberate, the movie shows that if you have an attention span of longer than 30 seconds you don't have to have action in every scene. Which is why when something does happen it is so shocking and unpredictable.<br/><br/>I was surprised at how little Brando was actually in the movie. I thought Pacino was much more impressive, but there's no denying Brando's presence on the screen.<br/><br/>My favorite quote: ""Leave the gun.....Take the cannolis."""

"bval-3","10","1","3","27 July 2005"," The Godfather governs absolute
","There isn't much that hasn't already been said concerning the excellence of The Godfather. Nonetheless, I present the umpteenth dissertation on why not giving The Godfather four out of four stars is about as unjust as sentencing an innocent man to death.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 effort is truly an epic for the ages. The acting, directing, cinematography, score, and script are all of the highest possible calibermaking the near three-hour running time more of a blessing than an inconvenience. The Godfather is not only the Don of all Mafia melodrama, but it is also the standard grade of superiority for critics and filmmakers alike.<br/><br/>Based on Mario Puzo's bestseller of the same name, the story begins in 1945 at the wedding of Connie (Talia Shire), the daughter of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). Even on his daughter's day of celebration, Don Vito still manages to take care of ""business."" After a few men grace his presence and ask for a few favors  revenge, a leading role, etc.  the Don unites with his family for the ceremony. His youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who has recently returned home from war a hero, brings his new love Kay (Diane Keaton), and the Don's two older sons, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), along with his ""adopted"" son and confidant Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), also come to celebrate their sister's special occasion.<br/><br/>With each of the five major mob families straining to gain ground on one another, the budding industry of narcotics presents a forum for a few to achieve a competitive advantage. However, it is Don Vito who declines Sollozzo (Al Lettieri), the drug supplier, of his offer to commence an involvement in narcotics trafficking. His son and heir apparent, Sonny, obviously disagrees with his father's choice  seeing that drugs are the wave of the future  but the Godfather does not concede. Don Vito understands that the drug industry is a cutthroat business where friends are few and far between. It is this rejection that spirals the Corleone family down a brutal one-way street that will both cost the five families many lives, and allow a new Don to emerge.<br/><br/>Al Pacino plays the supporting role of Michael with fire in his eyes. His transformation, from a civilian to a Godfather in both senses of the term, is the film's main and most dynamic storyline. In almost every sense, Pacino steals the thunder out from under Brando; nonetheless, Brando's role is perhaps the most iconic role in all of cinema. His character, styled after real life mobster Frank Costello, is one of the films many highlights.<br/><br/>Despite an unmistakable missed punch, a few continuity issues, and an abundance of character roles to keep straight, The Godfather remains one of the most influential films in cinematic history. Not only will Brando's husky whisper continue to be copied for generations to come, but also the only fruit that shares its name with its color will always signify an impending death or violent incident.<br/><br/>Aside from all of the orange metaphors, The Godfather's resounding themes on the duality of man  love and hate, good and evil, loyalty and betrayal, and family and violence  allow it to emit an atmosphere like no other film. The Godfather is the utter embodiment of the ultimate ""guy film"", yet whether you are a male or female or a frequent or infrequent moviegoer is not dependent on how much appeal you will hold towards this first-rate pulp crime drama. Regardless of your status, you will be taken aback by its magnificence.<br/><br/>On The Internet Movie Database's website, The Godfather is listed as the number one favorite movie of all time, and on The American Film Institute's chart of the ""100 Years100 Movies,"" it is listed as the number three greatest film. First or third, there is no question why The Godfather holds a spot on a myriad of Top 10 lists, mine included. It is a seminal classic that will only continue to steamroll sovereignty, praise, and admiration."

","It is quite different from ordinary mafia movie. Of cause there are a few bloody scenes in the movie. But that is not the main point. The all time classic aimed at family life. That makes the mafia movie full of humanity. Although they are mafia, they are still human beings. They also cherish family though the way for protecting family is violent. That is the most attractive place for the movie.<br/><br/>As to the director Francis Ford Coppola, he did a great job(in fact Paramont prepared to replace him anytime. Lukily they did not do so). He is an Italian. Maybe Italian emphasizes the importance of family. When he directed the movie, he successfully made the cast like a family. No wonder he still could gather the same cast to shoot Godfather the third after 16 years.<br/><br/>As to performance, Al Pacino is unforgettable though he was a rookie. Marlon Brando deserved the Oscar award (best actor). Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton also were great. As to the music, still great.<br/><br/>A mafia classic you absolutely should not miss. 9/10"

"residentunknown","10","1","3","8 June 2005"," Copolla's Masterpiece
","Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic, all ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one.<br/><br/>If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.<br/><br/>Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it.<br/><br/>The film opens in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court. It is the wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request on that day. So the supplicants come, each wanting something different - revenge, a husband for their daughter, a part in a movie.<br/><br/>The family has gathered for the event. Michael (Al Pacino), Don Vito's youngest son and a second world war hero, is back home in the company of a new girlfriend (Diane Keaton). The two older boys, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there as well, along with their ""adopted"" brother, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the don's right-hand man.<br/><br/>With the end of the war, the times are changing, and as much as Don Vito seems in control at the wedding, his power is beginning to erode. By the standards of some, his views on the importance of family, loyalty, and respect are antiquated. Even his heir apparent, Sonny, disagrees with his refusal to get into the drug business. Gambling and alcohol are forces of the past and present; narcotics are the future. But Don Vito will not compromise, even when a powerful drug supplier named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) arrives with promises of high profits for those who back him.<br/><br/>Don Vito's refusal to do business with Sollozzo strikes the first sparks of a war that will last for years and cost many lives. Each of the five major mob families in New York will be gouged by the bloodshed, and a new order will emerge. Betrayals will take place, and the Corleone family will be shaken to its roots by treachery from both within and without.<br/><br/>The Corleone with the most screen time is Michael (it's therefore odd that Al Pacino received a Best Supporting Actor nomination), and his tale, because of its scope and breadth, is marginally dominant. His transformation from ""innocent"" bystander to central manipulator is the stuff of a Shakespearean tragedy. By the end, this man who claimed to be different from the rest of his family has become more ruthless than Don Vito ever was.<br/><br/>Despite the likes of Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Scarface, ...And Justice for All, and Scent of a Woman on his resume, Pacino is best remembered for the role he created in The Godfather (and subsequently reprised in two sequels). While this is not his most demonstrative performance - indeed, he is exceptionally restrained - the quality of the script makes Michael Corleone notable.<br/><br/>Next to Humphrey Bogart's Rick from Casablanca, Oscar winner Marlon Brando's Don Vito may be the most imitated character in screen history. The line ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" has attained legendary status, as has the entire performance. With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando has created a personae that will be recalled for as long as motion pictures exist.<br/><br/>Family responsibility. A father's legacy. The need to earn respect. The corrupting influence of power. These are some of the ingredients combined in Francis Ford Coppola's cinematic blender. They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries.<br/><br/>Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families. The word ""Mafia"" conjures up images of the sinister and mysterious - scenes of the sort where Luca Brasi meets his fate. Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience.<br/><br/>We come to The Godfather like Kay Adams - outsiders uncertain in our expectations - but it doesn't take long for us to be captivated by this intricate, violent world. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told. Yet that last haunting image (Kay's shock of recognition), coupled with Nino Rota's mournful score, leaves a crater-like impression that The Godfather Part II only deepens."
"tylerdurden111111","10","1","3","1 June 2005"," Definitely one of the finest movies ever made
","Francis Ford Coppola has done some brilliant work, but he has never been better than in The Godfather and the sequel. This is a complex story set in New York City in the era just after World War II. It involves the Corleone Family, an Italian-American family that has thrived in the U.S. as the father of the clan (Vito Corleone/Marlon Brando) turned to organized crime to gain his slice of the American Pie. I won't get into the plot too much for fear of invoking the ""spoiler"" rule, but the essential plot revolves around a dispute between the Corleone Family and one of the other crime families over Corleone's unwillingness to engage in the illegal drug trade.<br/><br/>Although the movie is strictly Hollywood fantasy in its treatment of the American Mafia (it is NOT this glamorous), the Godfather does play on some real life plot twists in the history of the mafia. For example, Carlo Gambino, the head of the most powerful of New York's Five Families for decades, did in fact have a strong moral and practical opposition to the drug trade which led to his famous edict of ""deal and die"" for those under his command.<br/><br/>The plot is a modern version of a Shakespaerean or Greek tragedy as the family patriarch(s) rationalize their actions in the name of protecting the family. It's a classic plot line that has been around for centuries, but it has never been better than in the Godfather. The direction is fantastic and the acting is unreal. Brando as the father is flawless, and Al Pacino and James Caan are brilliant as the sons. Also, the supporting cast is also first rate. Look for great supporting roles from Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Sterling Hayden and a host of other talented actors.<br/><br/>Anyone who doesn't love this movie is either lying or just trying to cause trouble. 10 out 10 for sure."

","I know because I knew a mob guy. This is Hollywood's glorification of the worst possible life to choose. Phenomenal acting, but the life of a mob guy is violent and depraved (and often broke). The most realistic mob movie I have ever seen is Donnie Brasco. This is what mob life is really like. Mob life is about a million miles from being romantic. Carlito's Way is another realistic (more or less) look at street crime life. you watch this movie for the phenomenal acting, not for realism in any way. Hollywood loves to capitalize off stories of gangsters, glorify it up a bit, and package it as if it were real. What's real is busting your hump, not making enough in a month so you have to sell dope, and wondering if there is a gun at your head every second of the day. to be honest, I'd rather sell staplers."

","I don't know why,but since i know about myself i loved mob movies.There is something interesting in the way of a mafioso to the top,and his fall.So it is not a miracle,that The Godfather trilogy is my favourite movie. The Godfather trilogy is a magnificent saga about the Corleone family and it's way to the top of the American mob.Afcourse and their way into the high society of admired people.But,behind this story lies one more story,as complex as the first,about higher values,family,love and respect.It is very interesting to see Vito Andolini's(Marlon Brando) way from his departure from Sicily,where he was on the run because local boss Don Cicci wanted to kill him because he thought that Vito is going to take revenge on him for killing his father and brother,to New York's ''Litlle Itally'' where he is living like a bum.Although Vito had a really small wage,he bought a pear every day and brought it to his wife to show his love,respect and gratitude.Later,Vito became a very wise man and the king of the Mafia. God never gives without taking.Don Vito in one of his wars with the other families lost his oldest son,Sonny(James Caan).So, today we all know a old Mafia saying:For revenge always kill the brother. It means that you never kill the man that brought you harm,but you should kill someone that is closest to his heart.It will hurt more.On this way Vito's youngest son (Al Pacino) and his ''grandson'' (Andy Garcia) will lose their wives.And there is one more thing that the movie shows the best.What money can do to a man!When their parents die Michael kills Fredo because he let him down.Horrible,but logic.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with great actors.James Caan is a real hot-head,old school wise guy.Al Pacino is also great as a man that doesn't want to meddle into family business but then becomes a killer.MARLON BRANDO is.... i really can't find the word to describe it.He made the most known role in the world as the rightful Don.Marlon magnificently paint a portrait of a man who doesn't forget the friendship shown to him and is willing to help anybody that respects him.If somebody shows hate to the Don,he makes him an offer he can't refuse and deals with him quickly.The words that illustrate how much is Brando a good actor,are the words that Nicholson spoke on Brando's funeral:''Now,when Marlon is gone,all we actors will rise a few steps above''.<br/><br/>A unmissable classic"
"wrcong","10","1","3","8 February 2005"," Simply extraordinary
","That two word summary captures my bottom line feelings about this film: simply extraordinary.<br/><br/>This is, of course, Francis Ford Coppola's greatest film achievement to date. I frankly doubt that he, or anyone else, can surpass this film, although he gave it a pretty good run in ""Godfather II."" Part of what sets this film apart is that Coppola took one very well known star in Marlon Brando and surrounded him with an ensemble of lesser known actors. The result is that many of those lesser knowns were catapulted into stardom themselves, particularly Al Pacino (Michael Corleone) and Diane Keaton (Kay Adams). John Cazale is perfectly cast is the ignored middle child, Fredo Corleone, and James Caan turns in a memorable performance as the hot-tempered Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone.<br/><br/>The subtle undertow of this film is that Coppola and Mario Puzo crafted a brilliant script that draws the viewer into a level of empathy with a family of cold-blooded killers. The Corleones are, after all, a family under siege after the surprise attack on the Don, the abduction of Tom Hagen (Duvall) and the murder of the Don's most trusted assassin, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana). The family draws closer, with the estranged son, Micahel, returning to rescue the family business from chaos. It becomes easy to lose sight of the fact that Coppola has the audience ""rooting"" for one set of ruthless murderers over the other set.<br/><br/>The climax of the film occurs when Michael orchestrates the final revenge of the family for the murder attempt against his father, the murder of Sonny, the physical abuse of his sister, the abuse of Fredo and disrespect shown for the Corleone family in Las Vegas, the murder of his Sicilian wife, and against the traitor within the family business. Those scenes are controversial on many levels, not least of which was the juxtaposition of a number of the murders with the baptism of Michael's nephew.<br/><br/>This film is a masterpiece of movie-making. You owe it to yourself to see it."

","As just a drama film, the Godfather is excellent, with it's engaging storyline, well drawn characters, tight script, and all the rest of the clichés. In the genre of the Gangster film it has no peer.<br/><br/>Where so many gangster pictures seem to just be commentaries on how quirky they are and how explosively violent, this film has so much more to say and explores the lives of it's characters from every perspective.<br/><br/>We see the aging Don playing with a grandchild. We have the family member who wants nothing to do with the life of a wise-guy but whose love for his father and murder of his wife by rivals draws him in. We also see a gangster using violence not to solidify his position or intimidate, but simply acting violently to mistreatment of his sister.<br/><br/>The film has such depth of realism and is so far above and beyond the scope of most gangster fare."

","Few other films revel in their sheer pompousity as 'The Godfather.' I must say that I do not dislike this film; it is a classic and deservedly so, and still one of the best gangster movies. Its just it tends to take itself too seriously, and you can't really relate to the characters. Don Corleone is not as violent and ruthless as expected (he fails to take revenge after Sonny's death). It would have been more thrilling to watch the Godfather carry out a brutal payback executive or unparalleled brutality.<br/><br/>The film was too slow and long for my tastes, and lacked action and suspense. The best scenes include the scene where Al Pacino has to kill an enemy of the family, near the end when Don Corleone dies and of course the memorable 'Machine-gun death' of Sonny."

","Probably I have seen this film 3-4 times and always enjoyed it. The merit of the film is obviously its plot, but the director Coppola did an excellent work to unite several good actors/actresses in this production. Al Pacino was starting at that time, and he did superb work as Michael, James Caan showed his abilities as Sony, Robert Duvall and Marlon Brando were excellent as usual, while Diane Keaton and Talia Shire did what was required from them. The film goes from New York to Sicily then back to New York, it certainly made the small village of Corleone very famous, many tourists coming from America may ignore the existence of Greek ruins in several parts of the island, particularly in the town Agrigento, but they do know that Corleone is there. Another admirable aspect of the film is that those actors representing Italians of Italo-Americans talk either in English, in Italian and even in Sicilian dialect. It is not my intention to describe the plot of the film here, but it shows that each of the families has an affective feeling to its relatives but is cruel at the time of punishment, no matter if it is a relative or not."

","I've never seen the Godfather before but Richie said he was `tired of watching Snooker Legends' and wanted to watch a proper film. I watched it and thought is was good. The colours weren't as nice as the ones in Prince of Tides' but it was a decent film with a beginning, middle and an end.<br/><br/>The story is about a mafia family, and how the all American' son gets drawn into being the head of it. This part is played excellently by Al Pacino (Michael Corleone), with my favourite scene being one of the last when he has to avenge the death of his father. It's got to be one of his best performances to date and I can see why Channel 4 viewers voted him the world's greatest actor. Although it's an ensemble piece with a very impressive cast, they are all given a chance to give some great performances, giving each character in the film a real sense of depth.<br/><br/>The film is slow, which I think works to its advantage. Francis Ford Coppola tries to keep everything as realistic as possible and that includes the pace at which everything unfolds. It also makes the violence that bit more shocking when it happens.<br/><br/>Richie likes this film a lot. He says that the characters in this film are his heroes and that one-day he'll be like Don Corleone. I don't think he meant fat with a funny voice though, but because he hates being a nurse. He also says that this film shows you how important respect is and that I should show him more respect, starting with giving him my PC. I told him that I needed my PC to write my film reviews, but he told me that it could cause a psychotic resurgence', and that my film reviews were pathetic (he had only read my Escape From LA' one though).<br/><br/>Richie has also had to sell some of my pink pills to his friends so that he can expand his turf'. I'm not sure what that means; maybe he's getting an allotment or a back yard. Anyway, Richie will be over this weekend to pick up my computer so I guess that this will be my last review.<br/><br/>So to summarise:   The Godfather (1972) - Starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and Abe Vigoda - Written By Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo - Based on the Novel By Mario Puzo - Directed By Francis Ford Coppola - MPAA Rating: R <br/><br/>I rate it a 10/10 a must see film"

As (almost) always, the book is better than the movie.  Please do yourself a favor and pick up a copy somewhere, and if you aren't ""hooked"" by the second or third page I would be amazed.<br/><br/>One advantage of the book is it goes into much richer and more vivid detail than the film does (a lot of material from the book was used in the subsequent Godfather movies as well -- there's no way a single movie could ever capture that much detail).  It's a delightful and utterly satisfying tapestry.  If it sounds like I'm reviewing the book more than the movie, it's probably because it's a long time since I've seen the film -- but I re-read the book often because it's a work of literary genius and by far the finest work of fiction ever written on this subject.

Brando's voice, Pacino's youthful look, Duvall's innocence, and Caan's brutality all drew me in and it never bored me.<br/><br/>In only his third film role of his long and brilliant film career, I saw Al Pacino's attitude gradually change for the worst. First Pacino was the war hero, then he gets into the Corleone family business he becomes a changed man and starts to climb the ladder in the family business.<br/><br/>
I also saw the innocence of a young looking Robert Duvall that I felt compelling and most interesting to watch. Also, the way that all the scenes of violence were orchestrated I could tell it was accurate or Francis Ford Coppola and the rest of his crew spent time researching the accuracy and made it as close to accurate as possible. <br/><br/>Everything about this film was disturbing and that is what made it so darn good because it was so true. As great as the ""Godfather"" series was, the first ""Godfather"" could have stood on its own without making sequels. By the end of the first part, two family members have died, and one makes a significant climb in power inside the Corleone family; for the answers, you must watch the film. <br/><br/>This was a great film and I first saw it in my college film class and since I loved it the first time around I re-rented it.

Granted the performances and the casting was quite powerful for its day, but still as much as this film has held itself up over time, on my top one hundred list, this one goes somewhere in the low 70's.<br/><br/>If there were any redeeming qualities about this film it would be the screenwriter's ability to create a script from an already existing body of work and turn it into a living breathing thing as Mario Puzo has done here. The script is so finely nuanced and fine-tuned that at times as the story unfolds it as if we are watching a great symphony orchestra play.  The different plot-lines and instances just sweep over us. <br/><br/>
The Godfather is not a film for children to see at all.  Yes, it is a film about an Italian family in the mafia, but still it is a very ""talky"" picture.  There is gratuitous violence that abounds within it but, it is so deftly plotted that it doesn't really stick itself out there like it was just put in the film just to be in it.  The film goes from one end of the spectrum to the other.  In one scene, these people are sitting over a nice dinner that's spread before them, in the next people are lying there with blood spilling out of their brains.  In this film, there is no happy medium to be found at all.  Marlon Brando gave the performance of the year in 1972 but, however I still think his best performance of his career was 1951's A Streetcar Named Desire.<br/><br/>The Godfather was nominated for ten Academy Awards, winning three (Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay).  Bob Fosse beat Francis Ford Coppola that year for his landmark direction of the film version of the musical Cabaret.<br/><br/>So, all in all, you either love this one or you hate it.  My question is: What's the big deal?  It's a film!<br/><br/>My rating: 2 stars"

","The Godfather is the best movie ever, also the best adaptation from a book, Francis Ford Coppola did a great job on knowing what to put in, and what to put out. I would like to point out that characters in the book have the last names of some of the people part of the movie, Anthony Coppola is one character obviously the relation is with Francis Ford Coppola, I forgot the first name but there was a Mancini as one character, the relation is the guy who did the them song's name is Henry Mancini. Also the producer did a great job of picking all Italian people, I heard somewhere that they almost picked Robert Redford for the job as Michael Corleone, somewhere on television, once I heard this I new it was one of the worst picks ever, I don't know how the producer could've picked that but the rest of the cast is tremendous. This is also great because nobody thought of the mafia underworld idea until Mario Puzo came out with the book, nobody knew how to make the book into the movie, and some people didn't think of making the book into the movie. A lot of people say the second one is better than the first, I would say no on that, because there's nothing better than the oringinal, the second one was excellent, but not as good as the first because it was as entertaining as the first, the things that almost bored me was the family situations, family crisis, not a lot of action, and shooting. In the first one the kills were more out of no where, and surprising me, like when the man went to take a leak, and on the way back the guy killed the guy, a brilliant set up. This movie is tremendous and wonder why would anybody give it a one, because I saw on the voting charts there was a 1.6, for the ones, maybe they don't recognize the excellence, and art of this movie, but I would like to say the movie is brilliant, I gave it a 10, and I hope you do to."

But, no matter how many times they showed it on cable networks, I refused to watch it when it would be edited and cut to pieces.  Finally, I rented The Godfather and it was even better than all that I had heard from everyone.  <br/><br/>Although I think Al Pacino has the potential to be a great actor, I haven't cared much for seeing him in movies because he always seems the exact same. However, in The Godfather he was different (yet still the same).  I saw much more versatility in him...from young and full of ideals to finally finding his place in the family business.  He wasn't his usual over the top ""HOOHA"" thug like in so many movies.  Quite refreshing.  Marlon Brando has always been one of my favorites and his performance was fantastic...fitting right into his role like a hand to a glove.<br/><br/>The Godfather has become one of my all time favorite movies and the more I watch it, the more I discover what I hadn't noticed in prior viewings.  To me, this is a timeless piece that only gets better with each time you watch the movie.  It definitely has lost none of its appeal in the years gone by.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, The Godfather earns a 10 out 10 stars; and of course, is a DEFINITE must see.

","Critically acclaimed for it's unflinching look at the Mafia world, The Godfather Part I took him three academy awards: Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted screenplay. Marlon Brando (in his Oscar winning role) as Vito leads a powerful cast, who all do superbly in their roles. Al Pacino and James Cann provide excellent support as two of Vito's sons, and honorable mentions are Sterling Hayden and Robert Duvall. Francis Ford Coppola's powerful direction really flushes out everything in this film. Instead of telling the viewer what to feel about the characters, he lets them rather get involved in the storyline. The script too is amazing, detailing very particular things about the life of the Mafia, and also showing how corruption can even get to the nicest of people. The photography is very 70's style and shows the era the film takes place in very well. It's also noteworthy that this film started about every cliche in mafia films today. Whether it is lines such as ""Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."" or just the assassination scenes, it all came from this film. It's a startling and bold achievment in filmaking, but Coppola could have also made the connections between certain characters a bit more apparent. Best film of all time? Not quite, but still close. 9.5/10"

Michael could just die in the middle of the movie and I wouldn't feel nothing. And another thing is the length of the film, 175 minutes is just too much, and don't think I can't watch long movies, I hadn't any problem with Lord of the Rings and even Titanic.

The Godfather has the best of all the qualities for a movie = great directing, great writing (not as good as the book), excellent acting (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert DuVall), and all that jazz, but I still don't think it is the best movie ever made.

","If Francis Ford Coppolla never got his way, it's difficult to imagine just how The Godfather would have turned out. Should the studio have persisted on rejecting Al Pacino, Marlon Brando and fired Coppolla himself, the greatest film ever would surely never have prevailed.<br/><br/>The film boasts a heavyweight cast to which nothing will ever compare. Of course, at the time of production, there were few stars on the set. But since the film's release, each of the principal players have established themselves among the world's acting elite.<br/><br/>Mario Puzo's original novel, The Godfather, provided the basis for the movie, though it was skillfully reworked to make a smooth transition to the screen. Both the book and film have more to say than simply tell a story about crime. The complex layers of plot are woven into a exemplary insight into family, honour, revenge and love, when tainted by the deviance of the underworld.<br/><br/>Visually, it's a spectacularly-shot film with many a thought-provoking image and beautiful music. But the real quality of the film-making process is the ability to bring out a feeling of pathos from the audience towards the Corleone family. There may be a lack of morality from virtually all of the central characters but, as is often the case when the film concentrates on the lives of certain individuals, whether they conduct themselves correctly are not, we are right behind them all the way.<br/><br/>The Godfather legacy led, two years later, to the most successful sequel ever made. Lightning never strikes for a third time, but despite the criticisms, The Godfather Part III holds its own as a solid gangster film.<br/><br/>The true mark of a genuine classic is the ability to survive the test of time - something The Godfather has done with remarkable ease."

I think Al Pacino was the best of all of them. Everyone else was great too. Diane Keaton was the only one who i did not care for. She just didn't really fit in.<br/><br/>The acting is definitely a plus in the Godfather and so is its Directing. It also has one of the best scripts ever written.

"billcody","9","1","3","2 September 2002"," Very good, but not #1.
","Like Citizen Kane, the Godfather is extremely influential, but more than a bit overrated. Coppola has essentially one trick - intercuttung violence with religious ceremonies. In the first two Godfather films this is an extremely effective device. Unfortunately, some of the other parts of this film are not quite as well thought out. The scenes of Michael in Italy are too long and underdeveloped. Appolonia falls for Michael in a way that only happens in the movies so the audience has very little emotional investment in her or her death. Most people would say I'm nitpicking, but to be honest there are more than a few films that I have enjoyed more than the Godfather.<br/><br/>
Having said that, this cast (Fred Roos is the greatest casting director ever) and crew might be the best group of talent ever assembled for one film.  They went on to make some of the greatest films of their generation both in front of, and behind the camera. If you don't believe me, just check their individual credits."
"Arthur-23","Null","1","3","6 July 2002"," A great, but flawed, morality tale
","Since its release in 1972, The Godfather has become firmly embedded in popular culture due in no small part to Marlon Brando's mannerisms, exaggerated jaw line, and the film's rhythmic dialogue. It has therefore rightly earned its position as a classic in American cinematic history. However, its fame may have had an unfortunate and unintended side effect of glorifying organized (as opposed to disorganized, indiscriminate) crime by raising it to an almost ""noble profession"" for some. Despite the sociological impact, the film's music, cinematography, and authentic period cars and clothes were very effective. While the film has a clear and unmistakable pace at which dialogue is delivered and scenes are developed, which succeeds in holding the viewer's attention, the pace is undeniably slow and the film is long. Yet the characters are interesting and the film will hold your interest.<br/><br/>At its core, this film is about an Italian-American family trying to modify its business practices to survive in an uncertain and rapidly evolving world but in the process continues its tradition of ""violence as honor,"" while aligning itself to religious principles it does not share for in the ""Godfather's world"" another religion in practiced, a religion which revolves around money, power, and honor of family and turf. Make no mistake, this is a good film and Francis Ford Coppola deserves credit for his direction and screenwriting, but in my view it does not earn the 10/10 that thousands of IMDb voters have given it for the following reason: When the plot is boiled down to its essential elements, it's just a story about one highly dysfunctional family confronted by a changing society, the demise of an old world, and relentless problems with neighbors and neighborhoods. This is a common theme used in many different ways in innumerable films before and after The Godfather's release, so this aspect does not differentiate The Godfather from many other films in Mafioso and other dramatic genres.<br/><br/>
For me, a fundamental problem existed with the subplots of honor and family. While there is a strong ""honor code"" which everyone in ""the family"" is compelled to hold to great esteem, i.e. respect for the family, its traditions, its business interests, and the expectation and necessity of showing the utmost respect for the head of the family (which is certainly not uncommon among Aboriginal, Semitic and East and Southeast Asian traditions), when it comes right down to it this is just a thin veneer to cover all of the nasty deeds the family is involved in, e.g. corruption, racketeering, gambling, intimidation, and retaliatory murders to even the score. Except for drugs and prostitution, most crimes are well within the inventory of the family business, despite early protestations to the contrary by Michael Corleone (played by a young, almost unrecognizable Al Pacino) whose personality is transformed over the course of the film's trials and tribulations only to have him emerge as a sadistic aspiring re-builder of the Corleone empire.<br/><br/>Without giving away the plot, an aspect of the film appeared obvious in its intent. One of the key reasons for Don Vito Corleone's 45-film-minutes of slumber (the result of being comatose after an attempt on his life) was to serve as a device at mid-point to summarize early plot developments courtesy of 'Consigliore' Robert Duvall for both Brando's and the audience's benefit. This seemed intentional to underscore the significant impact of events in the first half of the family's saga to those of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>
The Godfather is an interesting and deservedly controversial morality tale about one immigrant family's traditions and its continuous power struggles, but because of plot and thematic elements mentioned above, I give it an 8/10, which isn't bad at all."

","This movie is one of the most famous in the history of cinema, but I can't see the reasons. It's true that Marlon Brando plays like a god and that Al Pacino begins to show why he is one of the best living actors... but there are too many dialogues that choke the breath of the movie. There are also some ""holes"" in the screenplay: for instance, why do we see one of the Godfather's sons (Al Pacino) first like a shy guy and then like a determined and blood-thirsty beast? Only because they killed his sicilian wife that he forgets soon to marry another girl? The direction of Coppola is flat: I don't like the way he just throws away the ""crescendo"" of some thrilling scenes and the way he doesn't emphasized the story. Besides after some killings we get to know their ways, so the last killings are ""phoned""... we exactly know what is going to happen and so the surprise goes wasted. Only in the final Coppola succeeds in finding a beautiful alternated editing where he shows the deep contradictions of the members of the Mafia: Michael Corleone is in a Church where he swears to renounce the Devil and in the meanwhile his men are making a massacre. So: a good film but not a masterpiece as many people think."

","The Godfather is a good movie.  That's where it stops.  It is not a great movie in any way.  Marlon Brando gives the worst performance in the movie, being at best pedestrian in his role, and at worst immensely boring. (Laurence Olivier should have won the Oscar for Sleuth or Peter O'Toole for The Ruling Class) Mercifully, the supporting cast was excellent - Duvall and Pacino especially.  Caan was good as Santino, but suffered a bit in overacting his rages.  Part of the problem with this film is the book it came from - the book is about 450 pages long, and has a complete story for just about every character on screen.  Unless Coppola wanted a 10 hour movie, he just couldn't do that, which I understand.  I'd read the book shortly before seeing the film, and I have a lot more respect for the book. I would like to see Part Two, given that a lot of people say it is better (I can easily believe that).  I gave The Godfather 8/10, because, as I said, it is a good, but not great movie.

The seamlessness of the story and the richness of the distinct characters make it such an enjoyable film to watch that I am in awe every time I view it.  I have watched it in whole or in parts dozens of times, and it is simply one film that I will never tire of."
"Howlord","10","1","3","23 April 2002"," Great American Tragedy (SPOILERS)
","I suppose it's difficult to qualify exactly what formulates a tragedy.  Are tragedies about fate, disillusionment or death?  Are they about language? Must the plot adhere to a strict set of rules?  Must the climax come in the third act?  Well, my concept of a tragedy is when the flaws of one or more of its characters destroy a high goal.  In the case of the Godfather, this goal is the prevention of Michael's entry into the family business by making him a true American; the tragic flaw is Michael's inability to forego vengeance.<br/><br/>Certainly many efforts are made to prevent Michael's tragic fate.  Michael himself seeks to evade becoming like his family.  When telling Kay about how his father released Johnny Fontaine from a band contract by making the band leader `an offer he couldn't refuse,' Michael says, `That's my family Kay, not me.'  While the rest of his family wears tuxedos at the wedding, Michael wears his dress uniform.  While his family talks about the drug business with Solozzo, Michael and Kay go shopping and go to the movies. <br/><br/>
By the time Michael saves his father in the hospital, it is already clear that Michael has no desire to be involved in the family business, but the attempt on his father's life is the first revelation of Michael's tragic flaw.  In the scene where Michael agrees to kill Solozzo and McClusky, Hagen tells Sonny that he is taking business matters personally.  When Michael agrees to kill them both, Sonny accuses him of the same.  Of course, a central irony of the Godfather is the fact that the family is the business, ties of blood and ties of money become inseparable.  Sonny's accusations are correct, Michael is taking the matter personally, the only major difference between Michael and Sonny is Michael's calculating patience.  This difference is painfully obvious by the end of the film.  Sonny dies because he carelessly charged after Carlo when he discovered that Connie was beaten after his initial death threat.  Michael waits for the perfect opportunity to have Carlo murdered, never allowing Carlo to suspect his motives.  After his betrayal, Tessio asks Tom Hagen to `tell Michael it was strictly business.'  Hagen replies that Michael knows.  Despite the fact that murdering Tessio and losing his knowledge of the Bronx is bad business, Michael has him killed.  This is further evidence that Michael is not acting out of his business interests, but his inability to forego vengeance.<br/><br/>Kay is a very important figure in this tragedy, I say `figure' because to Michael, Kay as a person is irrelevant.  Kay's value to Michael is her lack of connection to his family.  She is from New Hampshire, so he most likely met her at Dartmouth (he went to college while his other brothers learned the family business). At the beginning of the film, Michael has Kay appear in his family photo.  He tells her everything about his family and while his family is planning, he is spending time with her notably shopping at the store `Best & Co.' and watching a movie about a nun.  These details are significant because Michael views Kay as a better sort of person than his family; he sees her as a figure of salvation.  When he returns from Italy and has entered the family business, Michael tells Kay that he has to marry her.  `The old way is finished.  Even my father knows that now.  In five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.'  Michael sees Kay as a figure through which he will achieve that legitimacy.  When Kay asks Michael if he had Carlo killed Michael's reaction is the exact opposite of what he would have told her at the beginning of the film.  Instead of telling Kay everything and defying the old rule of never letting women know about the family business, Michael told her all of his family's stories willingly and with complete honesty.  In this scene, Michael reveals not only that he won't let Kay know about his affairs, but lies he finally agrees.  The final shot of the movie, the closing of the door as a wiping fade out is significant because it shows Kay's separation from Michael.  She has literally and figuratively been removed from him, salvation rejected.<br/><br/>Easily the most telling scene on this film's tragedy is the scene in which Vito tells Michael that he `didn't want this' for him.  He tells Michael that he wanted him to be a Senator or a Governor.  This is interesting when compared to Michael's rationalization of his work to Kay in which he suggests that all men of power are the same.  Vito dies in the very next scene of natural causes, but with the knowledge that the son for whom he had such great hope had been damned. The scene immediately following the death of Vito is the baptism of Michael's nephew, which is brilliantly cross-cut with the murders of the heads of the five families and Mo Green is a sequence in which holy water is crosscut with blood, renunciation of Satan is juxtaposed with acts of murder and the sacred is connected to the vile.  Vito's way of doing things is finished.  Vito openly told the heads of the families that `I forego the vengeance on my son' and `I will not be the man to break the peace of this day.'  It is Michael who breaks the peace.  Vito was a reluctant Godfather who spend his life running `harmless vices' and declaring that `we're not murderers' when refusing to hit the men who assaulted Bonassera's daughter, ultimately has a cold, calculating man who rationalizes murder as his successor, defying all his hopes for the future."

There are so many truths in the film to real gansterism. like the raspy voice of don Vito is like that of Frank Costello's voice. The wedding at the start of the film is like the Bill Bonanno wedding and even the plot to kill the heads of the five main families at the end of thefilm is taken from Joe Bonanno so i think Mario Puzo knew a lot more about the mob than maybe we all first thought.

This movie is without a doubt the best movie ever made, and you haven't lived yet if you love movies and haven't seen these films."
"daniel_cooper_dww","10","1","3","9 January 2002"," Far more deserving than FoTR
","In many ways, this is less of a Hollywood film and more a Greek tragedy. The fall of our roguish hero, Michael Corleone, from hotshot son of a crumbling mafia dynasty, wishing to break free from his roots, going to College and then joing the Army.<br/><br/>As he returns, and the safety of his world is broken away, it comes down a simple choice. Dishonour his family (who are massacred along the way) and surrender, or fight back and take over for good.<br/><br/>Coppola's films might not have the same drive of their narrative most films have, but what they make up for is some of the best and most simple cinematography, great characters and great acting, and for an all star-lineup... well."

Francis Ford Coppala has made the most memorable movie in movie history. That's a croc that Pacino didn't get best supporting actor, or Coppala getting best director.

"brad_pitt","10","1","3","19 May 2001"," no doubts, the best of all time
","This film is basically the closest anyone is going to get to movie perfection. Coppola really hit the jackpot Puzo's novel and made the most out of it, I mean, many directors get their hands on some great stories and all they can do is mess the whole thing up. However, Coppola stayed true to the original novel, thanks in part to Puzo himself collaborating in the process of the screen writing, but also was able to give the movie his own feel, similar to what he did with Apocalypse Now. Also, visually, Coppola manages to show the 1940's mafia environment in the most stunning, and real, fashion.<br/><br/>WARNING:SEVERAL SPOILERS ALL THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE COMMENT<br/><br/>The scene were the Don gets shot really shows what i'm talking about, and obviously the whole wedding at the beggining does the job of putting you in the environment perfectly, also it is a great introduction of all the major players. Also, the whole section were Michael is at Italy, it is downright beautiful, a great contrast to all of the violent stuff that happens in New York, all of this beauty ends with Michael's return to reallity, his wife's death. This then will make Michael the man that he becomes toward the end of the film, and through the other two films in the saga. Another great example of the ""horror"", is the scene with the decapitated horse is a showstopper and illustrates why Coppola is a genius. However, the heart of the film is in the perfomances themselves. Every single one of the characters is played to perfection, even after reading the novel, there is just no other way I can think of Vito Corleone, but by thinking of Brando. He is the Godfather, period. Well, so is Pacino, who shows that this is only the first of his many great performances. What can I say, to of the greatest performances in one film. The rest are not less great, Caan is convicingly stubburn and hotheaded Sonny, Duvall is great as a contrast to Sonny, always being more practical and reasonable (similar to Michael, yet lacks the superior IQ, and the coldheartedness), Cazale portrays the wimpy Fredo as what Fredo really is, whimpy. Diane Keaton plays great as the naive Kay, who in the end will finally realize what she has gotten herself into, but only too late, and all that is left is to accept her fate and learn to live with it. Shire is also very good as a drama queen, but not much else. The rest are just great mafiosi. Finally, to cap it all off, the music is beatiful. It is the trademark of the film, it is so famous that I know people that can recognize the music as the godfather tune, but have yet to see it, hey, even Slash used to play it live. Basically this film is perfect in everyway, ever since I saw it for the first time I compare every film to it, as a measuring stick, and to this day haven't been able to find a better one. This is one of those films that is not good enough to watch once, but to watch as many times as possible, it gets better everytime. After this, all the other films, are just that, other films."
"green5463","10","1","3","19 May 2001"," If not perfect, then as close as a movie can come.
","If this movie is not perfect, then it may be as close as a movie can come. The people who made this movie excelled in every facet.  The writing, direction, and cinemetography are all superb, and there isn't a bad performance in the film.  Coppolla captures the look and feel of New York in the late 1940s, then introduces us to an underworld of his own creation.<br/><br/>The opening scene, the wedding of the daughter of Don Vito Corleone, is the longest wedding scene I've seen in any movie and not a moment is wasted. Virtually every character and plot twist that appears later in the movie is introduced here.  When the baker mentions to the Don the Italina POW his daughter wants to marry, we never see the boy, yet he shows up at the hospital later in the movie, just before Michael's introduction to McCluskey.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando's performance in this movie is so strong, his presence and his character so dominate the picture, that for twenty years it never occurred to me that the title character was not Vito but Michael.  It was not until I was an adult that I realized that the tragic conflicts in the picture were Michael's and not Vito's.  Vito's time and world were fading and it was time for him to leave with it.  Michael subordinates his personal dreams of achievement outside of the family to serve the family when it needs him. Once he's drawn into the family concerns, he is trapped.  As he takes on the responsibilities of family leadership and grows as a man, his options outside the family diminish and he loses the freedom to be the man he had hoped to become.<br/><br/>One of the things movies give us are the images that stay with us.  This movie is full of them:  Sonny's beating of Carlo, the mass murder interposed with the baptism at the end, a disconsolate Fredo on the curb, Vito in the garden with his grandson, and of course, the horse's head.<br/><br/>
This movie gives you something new each time you watch it.  Rent it this weekend."
"lazcarez","10","1","3","10 March 2001"," The best of the best. Perfection at a glance.
","I believe that ""The Godfather"" is a masterpiece, an excellent movie which I have seen about 6 times. I have not gotten bored by watching it, thus I wait for a next opportunity to watch it again. The problem is that now I feels like a 90 minutes movie instead of a 171 minute film. But it's still great. I saw the three movies in one day, and let me tell you that the movie changed my life. My mind thought differently and I began to feel stronger, better self confidence. I'm not saying that I started to kill, but I can relate to this film. Probably I'm not the only Godfather fan with this feeling. I can confess that I've not read the book, but before I die I will read it. I recommend this movie to anyone that hasn't seen it. It's worth it. I wish I were born before the movie came out so I could see it at a movie theater. I am waiting for the DVD version, and I hope it comes out soon. So I guess I will have to buy a DVD player!!! But for now I enjoy it in VHS digitally remastered. The acting is incredible, like if the actors were real, like if the Corleone Family really existed or does exist."
"Jimmy-14","10","1","3","20 January 2001"," A masterpiece that will stand the test of time...
","It is no wonder why The Godfather is consistently ranked #1 by registered members of the Internet Movie Database.  It is quite simply a great film in every respect.  I won't rehash all the points that affirm why this picture is an undisputed classic that will be as relevant 50 years from now as it was in 1972.  <br/><br/>The sequels, Godfather Part II and Part III, complete the story.  Part II got the praise it deserved becoming the first and only sequel ever to win a Best Picture Academy Award. Unfortunately, Part III suffered from too much anticipatory hope that germinated from the 16 years between the two films. In other words, the film was held to a standard that would be impossible to achieve.  It was masterfully told and with the same attention to detail given the earlier films, but a fair assessment was not to be given.  Al Pacino's performance was outstanding, especially in the final scene with his reaction to death of Mary.  It is a stunning and thoroughly heartbreaking expression of grief from a father who has lost a child.  I wrote about Part III because many have dismissed it as a lesser film not up to par with the others, but this is criminally unfair.  <br/><br/>One last comment about The Godfather films -- some have suggested that the films are too long.  Well, that's just a stupid thing to say.  It's like the King in Amadeus telling Mozart that his composition has ""too many notes"". Mozart asks, ""which notes would you cut""?  The Godfather films are too complex to be shortened to accommodate those with a short attention span. <br/><br/>
The DVD versions of the Godfather Trilogy are supposed to be released in Fall of 2001.  I can't wait for all the extras.  It'll be an offer we can't refuse."
"mhasheider","10","1","3","17 January 2001"," Movies that are made like this are hard to resist watching.
","If there was one valuable and simple lesson that I learned from watching ""The Godfather"".  I learned that movies that are made like this are hard to resist watching.<br/><br/>This film was based on the unforgettable novel by the late Mario Puzo and it was wonderfully adapted into the story that was written by Puzo himself and Francis Ford Coppola, who directed the film.<br/><br/>The film is like the book itself, it's extraordinary and respects the subject that it focuses on.  Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are terrific in their roles and there are several scenes that left me both surprised and in awe.  Some of the violent moments aren't only graphic, but very grizzly as well.  The baptism massacre, one scene where Sonny (James Caan) is setup and is shot up like a piece of Swiss cheese, and another scene where Vito (Brando) is shot in public and Fredo (the late John Cazale) can't even shoot the two hoodlums best illustrate how ugly living in the Mob can get.<br/><br/>Besides the other film that was directed by Coppola (""Apocolyspe Now"") that I deeply cherish, this film has a great supporting cast and I've mentioned a few of those key actors.<br/><br/>Even Coppola's daughter, Sofia, who would later star in the third ""Godfather"" film and have also directed her first film (""The Virgin Suicides""), is unbilled as the baby that is baptised in the church before the unpleasant massacre starts."
"bvourvoulias","8","1","3","29 November 2000"," A review you can't refuse
","Yeah, yeah. It's a fine movie. Overlong, but that's only because of the pleasingly languorous pacing. Still, it ain't as good as everybody makes it out to be. And can anybody justify casting Marlon Brando, James Caan, John Savage, and Robert Duvall as the brain-trust of an Italian mob family? (Thank God for Pacino.) The casting director should have been made to sleep with the fishes."
"Chris J.","10","1","3","5 November 1998"," Superb but Part 2 even better
","Marlon Brando's stunningly rich and complex portrait is just one of the many perfections this modern classic has to offer. But--Part 2 is bigger, better, richer, and better in every way. Not to diminish what a stunning achievement this film is.  One perfectly realized scene flows after another, building one on top of the other. A moment of family and togetherness here, a crescendo of violence there, betrayal, duty, honor.  It follows most of the rules established in early 30's gangster films like Scarface, Public Enemy and Little Caesar but is not limited in what it can show and attempts to tone down the melodramatics to a more realistically paced level.   Nearly flawless.  Some of the finest casting and ensemble acting you will ever see in a film by a brilliant director at the top of his craft.  It makes no apologies for forcing you to care deeply for characters who are violent, selfish, greedy criminals.  It makes us believe that at times there really is honor among thieves.  Somehow these people's class system seem fairly acceptable to us--though ultimately cruel, and doomed to end violently.  An essential film. On of the top 50 films of all time to be sure."
"Mr. Blockbuster","10","1","3","23 September 2000"," Not #1
","When I saw that The Godfather ranked number 1 on the IMDb top 250, ahead of The Shawshank Redemption and Schindler's List, among others, I knew I had to see it.  I rented it and watched it through a couple times.  I'm having trouble figuring out why this is everyone's favorite.<br/><br/>It's a well made film, probably top 50 material, but it really wasn't a intoxicating, compelling, or moving experience for me.  It isn't just a difference in taste, because I also saw The Godfather Part II, and that is one of the greatest films I've ever seen; top five material.  I just never got into The Godfather's storyline.  It's well made and all, just not the best, in my opinion."
"FlickJunkie-2","10","1","3","8 September 2000"," An enduring classic
","Often mentioned among the greatest films of all time (#3 on AFI's top 100), `The Godfather' brings us an intimate look at a Mafia crime family.  America has always had a romantic fascination with organized crime and this film takes us inside `the family' like never before.<br/><br/>The script is nearly flawless.  The dialogue is engaging and emotional and the pace never lets up.  The story is mesmerizing.  The characters are so carefully and intimately developed that we can't help but get emotionally involved with them.  Though the violence is graphic and disturbing, it is never random or gratuitous and always has a direct link to a vital plot element.<br/><br/>However, the appeal of this film goes beyond its great script to the characters and the actors who played them.  The ensemble has such amazing chemistry that it hard to imagine they are not actually related to one another.  They have such charisma that we fall in love with every member of this band of ruthless criminals, despite their moral decadence.  We come to understand that they are immoral by our standards, but not amoral, since they have their own codes of honor that they take very seriously.<br/><br/>Though this was more of an ensemble piece than the sequels, two actors clearly stand out, namely Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.  Brando was already an established superstar at that point, although he hadn't had a meaty role in a few years.  His performance as Don Vito was powerful and commanding. Outstanding as he was, it was probably not his best performance (See `On The Waterfront', `A Streetcar Named Desire', or `Mutiny On The Bounty'), yet it is the one for which he is most famous.  Brando redefined our notions of the mafia patriarch from that of a ruthless dictator, to a shrewd diplomat who only wielded power when absolutely necessary.  He presented him as a potent but sympathetic character with a cunning mind and an astute understanding of the human dynamics of the other families.<br/><br/>Pacino, in contrast, was a fresh face with only two films to his credit at that time.  Despite his lack of film experience, he delivered a tour de force performance portraying a complex character that required a great deal of range.  Michael Corleone starts as a goody two shoes and is ultimately hardened into a cold-blooded crime boss, with a touching romantic interlude along the way.  Pacino shined in every scene and established himself as one of the truly great actors of our time.<br/><br/>Other standouts include Robert Duvall and James Caan, who was brilliant as the hot headed Sonny Corleone.  Caan's performance was raw, brutal and visceral, yet he somehow was able to render Sonny a magnetic and charming character with a strong sense of family loyalty.<br/><br/>This film was nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1973 and won three, including Best Actor for Brando and Best Picture.  It is one of the very few videos that I actually own.  It is hard to imagine that anyone born before 1982 hasn't seen it yet, but if you haven't, you should make it the very next film you see.  It is an utterly perfect 10."

The film does go on for a bit (about 3 hours) it can be watched in two sittings if you want to.

","I got a laugh from the people who found this film to be unoriginal, lukewarm, or not up to the standards of other mob films or tv shows.  ""The Godfather"" is the grand daddy of them all! Coppola and Puzo practically invented the genre of ""mafiosi as Shakespeare"".  Given how subsequent films and tv shows have run with these themes (even done them to death) most of what you're left with in this film is acting and craftsmanship.  But man o man.  It doesn't get better.  ""Shawshenk Redemption"", in contrast, was a good installment of the Hallmark Hall of Fame."

","Totally superb from acting to directing to plot to dialogue.  Definitely in my top 10 list and a joy to watch over and over again.  To be fair there are a few negatives.  At times it is difficult to understand what Marlon Brando is saying.  Also, having read the book, there are some interesting characters and sub-plots that are hardly developed in either this move or the sequel.  The character of Luca Bracci was never fully appreciated in the movie and he appears almost to be a buffoon.  In the book he is an incredibly feared individual that had wiped out some competing mobs single handedly.  You could say he was the Michael Jordan of hitmen.<br/><br/>The character of Lucy was just seen as a tramp used by Santino in the movie where she was a fairly interesting character as well as Johnny Fontaine.

There are also incredible performances by Al Pacino and James Caan, who play Corleone's two sons, Michael and Sonny. Diane Keaton also gave a magnificent performance as Kay.<br/><br/>Winner of three Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Actor Marlon Brando (although he refused to accept it because of the discrimination against Indians), ""The Godfather"" has become a staple in my house.

At least I personally can't imagine anyone not being touched. The story's so good, the acting is amazing, the movie is incredibly well made and the music is beautiful.

"apboy2","10","1","3","13 January 2000"," Close, but not the greatest
","""The Godfather"" is a visceral achievement in moviemaking and has a rightful place near the top of any list of the greatest films ever made. It seizes your attention, doesn't let go and takes you down the road promised to immigrants to America -- before taking a turn in which we confront the prejudices, mistrust and other roadblocks to the realization of their dreams, and how they went on to create success on their terms. But I have to put it near the top, not AT the top. That honor, on my list, belongs to ""The Godfather Part II,"" for a reason that it's hard to fault Coppola for. In ""The Godfather,"" I found Michael to be too far outside the family at the beginning of the movie. While not renouncing his father, Sonny or their enterprise, Michael seems to be more of an observer in an Army uniform with his white-bread girlfriend nearby than a family member PLANNING to immerse himself in the life his father and brother have chosen. Obviously Michael is drawn closer to his family as it becomes threatened with, then targeted by, violence. This is understandable but, to me, not foreshadowed by the life outside the family that he had chosen a few years earlier and seemed to be comfortable with. Of course, ""Part II"" gives a much fuller picture of how Michael got to where he was in running the enterprise, and heading the family. But we already know all we need to know about his motives and choices -- courtesy of ""The Godfather."" This deeper, more realized character of Michael in ""Part II"" is the reason I rate it ahead of ""The Godfather"" -- but not by much."

In part II, F.F.C. tells two stories: Vito Corleone's acension to power and Michael Corleone's new life as the new Godfather.<br/><br/>I'd give them both an 11 out of 10."
"Arkaan","10","1","3","31 December 1999"," A true masterpiece (spoilers)
","From the wedding scene, the ""I Believe in America"" speech, and the horses' head in the bed, there has not been a better film.  While you may think this designation is undeserved, you would be wrong.  Few movies have slipped into society like this one has. The opening wedding scene ranks as one of the most effective introductions in film history.  We get to know all the characters, from Don Vito Coreleone (Marlon Brando, in a masterful performance) to his sons, Michael (Al Pacion), Sonny (James Caan), and Fredo (John Cazale). <br/><br/>
  Several scenes from this movie will remain in your mind for quite a while. Marlon Brando's wheezing death, The baptism sequence cut in with several murders.  The beginning wedding sequence, and the ending.  The dialogue is perfect, thanks to an incredible script by Mario Puzo and Coppola<br/><br/>Everything about this film is on target.  Nino Rota's beautiful score is one of the best, with the ""Love Theme"" ranking as one of the most famous pieces of film music ever.  The performances are all first rate.  Though Marlon Brando won the award, it is really Al Pacino who is the lead actor, and deserved the best actor Oscar.  James Caan also finds the right note as the aggressive, impulsive Sonny.  The cinematography and art direction are perfect.  And all this comes down to Francis Ford Coppola's masterful direction.  There is no way Bob Fosse deserved the Oscar over Coppola.<br/><br/>
  Is this film better than Citizen Kane?  Tough to say. Both were ground-breaking classics that utilized new technical and narrative techniques.  I would have to say yes, because the story here, about loyalty, family and honor, had more impact on me than the rise and fall of Charles Foster Kane."

I believe every person should sit down and watch not only this film, but the second and third ones as well.<br/><br/>Coppola and Puzo collaborated to create a beautiful artistic picture. Although an organized crime family is depicted, the real story is about family, and love.  Michael's struggle is well documented, and as he attempts to stay away from the family business, his love for his father causes him to become a criminal as he attends to his father in the Don's greatest time of need.<br/><br/>As it turns out, Michael proved to be the ideal choice for the next Don, and now the story begins to unfold.

What makes this movie the classic that it is is the ""life"" brought to the screen by this group of fine actors.  After seeing the film, I don't think that anyone could imagine Don Vito Corleone being played by anyone other than Marlon Brando, who is possibly the greatest actor in film history.  Same with Al Pacino in the role on Michael.  The cold hearted and hot headed bastard that is Michael could not have been portrayed better by any other actor.  James Caan as Sonny and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagan....these men were born to play these parts.  Even Talia Shire, who I really don't care for much as an actress, delivers one hell of a stellar performance.  Diane Keaton, too.  It's performances like these that you only see once in a lifetime.  These actors and actresses create real lives for Mario Puzo's characters, each with such distinct personality that after watching the film, I refer to the characters by their first names, almost as if I know them.  The characters are portrayed so well that one could create a mock situation in ones head and accurately determine how a specific character would respond to it. Don't get me wrong, I love the story line here, but it's acting which makes this film a classic."
"fritz-17","10","1","3","26 September 1999"," Quite simply, the finest story ever put on film.

","What a truly special movie this is. Despite its violence, heavy content, and length, I could literally watch it every week. This film contains some of the most tragic, well-devoloped characters in the history of American cinema; they are simply unforgettable. Then there are the masterful performances, the beautiful cinematography and art direction, the wonderful script, etc., etc. In short, this is one of the most perfect stretches of celluloid ever."

","The 'Godfather' is certainly a very good movie and i enjoyed it very much. But in my humble opinion there are many movies that are better than this one and its sequels.It is certainly overrated because people tend to concentrate too much on american films here. The acting of Marlon Brando is very good and makes this film something special.But anyway, at some point i got a feeling of watching some kind of soap opera because except for Brando's part the rest of the characters remain relatively flat. The music to this film is very good and contributed much to its fame. All in all i would be prepared to say it is among the best American films of the 70's."
"CalDexter","10","1","3","19 March 2004"," The Mafia Masterpiece you cannot refuse!
","The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made. A complex and detailed gangster epic from 1946 to the late fifties on the Corleone family 'business'.<br/><br/>It stars Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, the most powerful lord of the Cosa Nostra, approaching the twilight of his life, the Don and his family come under attack from a Turkish gangster called Sollozzo who is angry at the Don's refusal to give him legal protection for his new drugs business, and so a war begins between the five families of New York city over a period of five years. Slowly the Mafia Don's reluctant son Michael (who is a decorated soldier) takes over and later self-discovers that he was always destined to be a man like his father.<br/><br/>This is really what the heart of the story is all about, a man who wanted to be honest and good in life but because of terrible circumstances takes over an Empire and becomes a figure he always denied.<br/><br/>The cast and supporting players are all excellent but the standout is Al Pacino.<br/><br/>Ten Out Of Ten."

"cal-brady","3","2","11","4 November 2012"," Very Little To Offer
","Here's how the arguments go for liking this movie go: The Godfather is a great movie because it's a hallmark of the genre. While gangster movies before this had been wall-to-wall violence and only loosely strung together by a plot, The Godfather was able to move away from that tradition by having a plot-heavy mobster movie. The performances were all superb and the characters all felt real.<br/><br/>However, what this argument fails to recognize is that the plot moves at such a slow pace that it's difficult to give a damn about it. This is quite honestly the slowest paced movie I've ever seen, and it would have been improved a thousand-fold if an hour or so had been cut. It's not that I hate slow movies--a slow pacing can work brilliantly--but The Godfather? No, it doesn't do it.<br/><br/>As for the cast and performances, they're really not all they're cracked up to be. If indecipherable mumbling is your thing, so be it, and in that case, this movie is the best thing ever. In reality, though, half-mumbled lines don't really do anything for me, and because of that; all the characters seemed to be fairly one-dimensional as a result.<br/><br/>I can see how you could like this movie. On a technical level, it did move away from the traditional three-point lighting which was common in earlier films, and the plot was definitely something other than what had been dealt with in mobster movies before then. But the content of the plot was somewhat devoid of any real interest--or at least it was for me--and the characters came off as being one-dimensional as a result."

","Everyone's saying this overrated film is one of ""the greatest films of all time"" - NOPE! I'm saying it's Groundhog Day!<br/><br/>WHY?? Because that one is a GOOD film - with meaning, creativity, fun, likability, and enjoyment. Unlike this, it makes you WANT to do fun things like it features, when watching it. Watching ""the Godfather"", I feel, ""No, I don't want to do or watch these things"".<br/><br/>Most of this film is rather just boring & confusing! Everything is shot in the dark (or with a dark filter); you have to make sure you've got something else to do while viewing this *masterpiece.* It's way too long. And it's certainly NOT ""flawless"" - I've spotted a WHOLE bunch of flaws with this flick, that they'd have to be put into many notes! Remember, no film is without flaws. A summary of the flaws with this film are confusing story lines, corrupt characters, crime, violence, some filthy language, bad attitudes, even the false cult of Catholicism being featured, rudeness, mind-aching distressing corrupt plot inconsistencies, or scenes that just don't make sense or just annoy the bazzerk out of you!<br/><br/>I couldn't care less if almost all critics everywhere have given it glowing reviews, I don't care if it's generally considered a ""masterpiece"", and I don't care if it has a 9.2 out of 10 on IMDb. I can't believe I fell for such a deceiving look. I'm sad that they've refused to see how horrible it is. The fact is, films have quite the tendency to be either underrated or overrated these days. Seriously, this should be turned around! All the attention towards the ""Godfather"" series should be given instead towards ""Groundhog Day""; all the awards given to the ""Godfather"" series should be instead towards ""Groundhog Day"". It's THAT good! Please check it out!<br/><br/>And plus, Marlon Brando's brought into this flick, and given one of the stupidest accents in film history; sounding so nauseated and drunk, with his chin thrust out so far, it makes me think he's turning into Jim Carrey. This film's also one of the biggest reasons why I don't care about Al Pacino as an actor; how he almost always seems to have a fetish for hardcore violence, swearing, and playing all-round unromantic, unpopular, and unlikable characters.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly it was this flick that started a whole film career of mistakes for Al Pacino - I guess he's kind of cool, just not as much as people make him to be.<br/><br/>Though to be fair, I do give credit to this film for not including one f-bomb at all.<br/><br/>But overall, I think this is certainly one of the worser movies I have seen, and I'm GLAD I didn't watch it growing up.<br/><br/>2/10<br/><br/>PS: I'm a movie buff who tries to like every film I see."

Off course we must mention Al Pacino's dear friend (also from Dog Day Afternoon), who plays his older brother Fredo, John Cazale; an amazing performance, that he will top in Godfather II. I also need to mention that Johnny Fontane, played by Al Martino, is most likely based on, or at least inspired by, Frank Sinatra... And we need to mention the iconic music, the only score that ever came close to Ennio Moricone's music. In fact the maestro, Ennio Morricone, performed that tune more then once.

","The Godfather(1972): A review One of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes, The Godfather is one of those rare movies that get everything right, transcending limitations and setting new benchmarks. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola from a screenplay structured by Mario Puzo, The Godfather is an American crime film starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as leaders of a fictional New York crime family of Italian descent. The story primarily is centered on Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) and his transformation from a family outsider to the apparent heir to the title that is The Godfather, initially held by Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando). <br/><br/>The beauty of the screenplay is not in its simplicity, but in subtlety. The Godfather, is that the story is played out entirely in a closed world. The audience is sucked into admiring the characters that are essentially evil. The movie portrays the Mafia, from the inside; its structure, its functioning, its virtues and imperfections included.<br/><br/>Now coming to the performances of the lead actors - Marlon Brando, Al Pacino. <br/><br/>Vito Corleone, as the Godfather, is the moral centre of the movie. He understands that liquor, gambling and even women are crimes that the world has a place for, but drugs is a strict NO. Marlon Brando, plays one of his more memorable characters in the suppressed, authoritative Sicilian.<br/><br/>Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone, is brilliant. As the story progresses forward, we see Michael move from a soldier in love and one who undermined his family business, to the loving son who sought to protect his family, and eventually turned into the one thing he never wanted to become. <br/><br/>In the end, an articulately brilliant movie that captivated the audience from the start and does not let them drift, due its brilliant screenplay and acting. No wonder then that it features as one of the best movies in cinematic history."

","For years, I never wanted to see The Godfather because something always told me it was slightly overrated. Film fanatics have praised The Godfather (and it's sequel) as two of the best films ever made, and I could just never understand what could be so good about it. So, last year, I felt it was time to finally give the trilogy a go. And you know what? Everyone truly is right. It really is one of the best films ever made.<br/><br/>The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family. The Corleone's are a Sicilian family involved in organized crime. When the Don, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in an Oscar winning role)is shot in the streets (he lives), he asks his son Michael (Al Pacino, in an Oscar nominated role) to take over the family business. Michael never wanted to be in the family business. He always dreamed of just staying away from it, and living a peaceful life with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton). But once he takes on the role of the Don, he realizes that there is no going back, and nothing can ever be the same.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a film that mainly focuses on two main subjects: family and betrayal. Both subjects are depicted beautifully. Director Francis Ford Coppola and his screenwriter Mario Puzo (who also wrote the novel) have made what is easily the best movie about family ever made. But yet they take the family movie to a whole new level.<br/><br/>The Godfather is three hours of pure perfection. Every actor here nails it, especially Brando. Brando is an actor that we beg to see more of. Even though the film mainly focuses on Pacino's character, it is obviously Brando's show. But even though it is Brando's show, it is also sort of everyone's show. Hell, it could even be considered James Caan's show, because while he is in it, he steals the show.<br/><br/>The Godfather is easily one of Francis Ford Coppola's best films. Yes, it is an amazing movie, and it isn't even his best movie. This is one of the greatest movies ever made. I can't quite say it's my favorite movie ever, but it is certainly up there somewhere. It truly deserved best picture, and screenplay. But why the hell didn't it win best director? That Oscar had FFC's written all over it. If you haven't seen it, see it before you die.<br/><br/>A+"

Then, Al Pacino becomes his father to continue his work. Al Pacino's character becomes even more ruthless a godfather than Marlon Brando. Robert Duvall, the family lawyer, gives a brilliant performance as one who at first comes off like a lamb but is really a lion in disguise. Diane Keaton plays a predictable character but gives an OK performance. The musical score is memorable.

"classicalsteve","10","1","4","19 February 2011"," America's Closest Equivalent to a Tragic Italian Opera
","The opening title and scene of ""The Godfather"" is one of the most striking in cinematic history. The lone trumpet invoking the tragic melody which has become so synonymous with this film is the equivalent of the tenor voice from an Italian opera, lamenting the loss of a loved-one in song, similar in style to a theme by Puccini or Verdi. Strangely, this sort of aria would have occurred towards the end of a traditional opera, usually at the death of the leading lady. But here the grieving music begins the story, as if tragic moments have already occurred, although they will continue to occur, a fundamental part of the story which is to follow. The beginning of the film is in actuality the middle of the larger epic of the Corleone family in America.<br/><br/>The first spoken words are neither from the Godfather himself nor from one of those in his inner circle. The voice is an outsider. He is not only an outsider of the inner Corleone family but someone not originally from America. The first voice we hear is an Italian immigrant, ""I believe in America."" This is a story about American immigrants, and how they have attained great financial and political power in the United States which might not be possible elsewhere in the world.<br/><br/>Based on the original book by Mario Puzo (who also co-wrote the screenplay), ""the Godfather"" lives up to its name as both a title referring to a specific character and simultaneously a position of someone wielding great power within a particular social context. When the film begins with Signore Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto who will be ever-remembered as the first voice and face of ""the Godfather""), the Italian immigrant requesting a favor from the Don on his daughter's wedding day, we assume the Godfather is Don Corleone (Marlon Brando), which is correct by and large. But as the film progresses, we see the rise of his younger son Michael Corleone who at first disassociates himself from the crime activities of his family. But even he cannot help but be dragged into the dealings of his family. By film's end it is ambiguous to which the titles refers, an individual person or a high-power position, not unlike a nobleman from the time of the Italian Renaissance.<br/><br/>Strangely, traditions are portrayed in this film which have their roots centuries before the incarnation of the United States. All the main characters, with the possible exception of Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), are Catholic-Italian. The church, presumably on the outskirts of New York City, is in an architectural style similar to the medieval Gothic cathedrals of France and Italy. At the wedding at the beginning of the film, Italian songs are sung with traditional instruments. Only when a Frank Sinatra-like character, Johnny Fontane (Al Martino), appears at the wedding, do we remember we're in America in the 1940's and not a little town in Italy in the 19th century.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" chronicles several intertwined stories which was certainly highly innovative when it was produced. The very beginning of a plot concerns Sollozzo ""the Turk"" (Al Lettieri) who is a high-stakes heroin peddler who wants to use the Mafia families to sell his goods. He has already convinced the other Mafia families that drugs are the future but needs the Corleone family because of their political and law-enforcement connections. Don Corleone declines his offers at a meeting. But Satino ""Sonny"" Corleone (James Caan) makes a fatal slip, letting Sollozzo know there is slight ambivalence in the family about getting into the narcotics racket. Don Corleone becomes a target, and Sollozzo hopes by getting him out of the way, the Corleone family will reconsider their position on the illegal drug markets. Eventually this leads to an inter-Mafia war among the five New York families.<br/><br/>The other story concerns Michael Corleone, his relationship with Kay Adams, presumably a WASP, and his initially tenuous relationship with his own family. Although Marlon Brando was top-billed for the film and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone has much more screen time. The film is really Michael's story, about his gradual involvement in the family business. Several of the most memorable scenes involve Michael Corleone rather than Don Corleone, not the least of which occur in the home country of Sicily when Michael is in exile.<br/><br/>Maybe a dozen films in existence could be characterized as perfect, nearly flawless, from beginning-to-end: Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Gandhi, Schindler's List, and Malcolm X, are a few which come to mind. ""The Godfather"" not only deserves a spot, it may be at the top of the heap. Every scene, even every line, furthers story, character, and even the world of the Corleones. Each of the other actors aside from Brando and Pacino could have won an Academy Award for their efforts, including James Caan, Talia Shire, Al Lettieri, Diane Keaton, and Robert Duvall. In fact, Pacino, Caan, and Duvall were all nominated for Best Supporting Actor, maybe the only time in film history three nominees from the same film were in the same category. ""The Godfather"" is one of the bona fide epic masterpieces of cinematic history, an opera without the singing."

","'The Godfather' left me in many emotions. Lucky to witnessed such cinema? Yes, but my summary says my current expression. Does Power Always Get It Right ? <br/><br/>'The Godfather', known to be one of the greatest films ever made, is a stab on it's viewer. Francis Ford Coppola has directed it with his instincts, he knows that Mr.Vito Corleone & Family do not exist in real-life. What embodies in an otherwise great film, are it's performances. Late Marlon Brando is stunning as The Godfather. 'THE' actor inside him buries his past and beings a fresh journey here. James Caan as Sonny, is another astonishing performance.<br/><br/>'The Godfather' not only personifies power, but also it's MAJOR disadvantages. Let me end this review, this way: If a 1000 plus word review justifies this masterful depresso, I better inform you, that, even a half-page review is a near-perfect respect."
"estebangonzalez10","10","1","4","18 September 2010"," Copolla made us an offer we couldn't refuse
","¨I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.¨ Many people consider the 70's to be the Golden Age in Cinema, and if that is the case then Francis Ford Coppola had a great deal to do with it. During that decade he directed The Godfather Part 1 and 2, The Conversation, and Apocalypse Now; he also produced American Graffiti, and wrote the screenplay for Patton. During that time he won 5 Oscars and was nominated for another seven. At least one of these films is on everybody's favorite movies list, and The Godfather is considered by many critics to be the best film of all time. Despite being nominated for eleven Oscars it only took home three (Best Picture, Best Performance by Marlon Brando, and Best Screenplay), just one more confirmation that a film can't be judged by the amount of awards it receives. The Godfather deserves much more. It is a movie that has transcended time and is enjoyed by everyone even decades after its first release. It was the first of its kind to portray the mafia from the inside and Coppola does a great job at romanticizing them and making us root for these criminals. How does he do it? By showing us the mafia as a strong and united family that supports each other; portraying the good guys as bad (there are corrupt cops and politicians); and making Vito Corleone stand out from the rest of the criminal families by not wanting to get involved in the drug business. He completely romanticizes the Corleone family and has us rooting for them from the very first scene thanks to a very intelligent script co-written with Mario Puzo who had previously written the bestselling novel. The script is amazing, the performances are great, and the direction from Coppola is just superb. All these elements combine perfectly to create this classic masterpiece.<br/><br/>We are introduced to Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) in the opening scene. He is head of one of the five New York Mafia families, and is attending his daughter's wedding. The wedding serves as a great excuse for Coppola to introduce all the characters because the entire family is gathered at the wedding. Vito is the Godfather for many of the people invited and he is treated with a great deal of respect. Tradition has it that no Sicilian can refuse requests on their daughter's wedding day, so Vito is attending some of his associates who are in need of favors. His sons Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale) are in the family business along with Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the family lawyer and consigliere, who was adopted by Vito at a very young age and is like a son to him as well. His youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), a World War II veteran shows up with his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) and is talking to her about his family. This conversation also serves as a perfect excuse to hear anecdotes about the family's criminal life and we are informed at once that Michael is the only one who is not involved in the family business. He has decided to stay away from the criminal lifestyle and is respected by his family. The entire plot takes place inside the world of the Corleone family and during a time where significant change begins to take place. Vito will have to make an important decision whether or not the family should protect a wealthy man named The Turk (Al Lettieri) who is trying to bring heroin into the city, or stick to the harmless gambling and alcohol business. He better think things carefully because his decision could have consequences.<br/><br/>The Godfather is without a doubt a masterpiece and the cast has a great deal to do with it. James Caan and Robert Duvall had worked with Coppola in his previous film, The Rain People, and now they returned again with significant roles. They give great performances, but who really stands out in this movie is Marlon Brando who really becomes the Don. He gives one of the most memorable and all-time best movie performances in film history. Al Pacino hadn't made a significant movie before and the transformation he goes through in this film is incredible. His character is the one who experiences the most change if we recall his first appearance in the wedding and his last one in the Baptism scene. The screenplay is also very well written, the story completely hooks us from the very beginning, the characters are unforgettable, and Coppola just did a great job with the direction as he immersed us inside this world of crime. Of course we know that the mob world isn't anything like this and it has been romanticized by Hollywood, but Coppola managed to make us care for these criminals who actually don't see themselves as the villains. Nino Rota's score is just amazing and breathtaking; it helps build the suspense.The Baptism parallel action scene is one of the best ones in film history and has since been imitated endlessly in most action films, although never with the same effect. This is required viewing for everyone, one of the greatest achievements in film history.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

It's funny actually, I knew this was one of the most famous classics before I saw it. I knew it is considered among the top 10 films almost everywhere. Yet everyone I know has either referred to it as the most boring film in history or never even bothered to finish it. Now that I've seen it I can't help but think, what a pity. Today we are given so much garbage, that when a real film comes along, we are suddenly confused. We don't understand it, we miss the points, and we fail to see the subtext in it. It saddens me that that is what the film business has become, when we fail to see a masterpiece when it comes along. Francis Ford Coppola made a timeless film with the godfather, and he should rank among the top ten, no the top five directors of all time. Stanley Kubrick once said: ""Coppola sure got it right with The Godfather"". And I dare todays director to ""get it right"" in the future.<br/><br/>I give this film a 10/10."

","All right! Let me start by admitting that I should have watched this a long ago instead of waiting until now. Just never got around to it.

The story of the aged leader of a mob family that transfers his powers to his son intermixed with the lives of the family members and their actions.<br/><br/>Used as an example for a plethora of films that were to follow it, used as a starting point for games. It's been used for everything, but nothing and no one ever came close to touching this film. It's a work of art - a truly and completely compelling story worked into a great looking film with strong playing actors, making for a film that constantly breathes what is trying to depict: life with the mob.<br/><br/>For the rest I have nothing to add.

","So many have already said what this film has. It has an amazing set of actors. The cinematography is as good as it gets. It is intense, gut wrenching, edited flawlessly. It takes an outstanding book and cranks it up a notch. It's hard for me to comment because, as a rule, I don't like movies about organized crime. First, I fear the reality of it. It holds a power in this country that we must always be aware of. It is in so much of our world, more than we realize. I feel at times that glamorizing these individuals is destructive. Nevertheless, I have to put that aside because this is the subject matter and at no time has anyone so masterfully put on screen the portrayal of these thugs, who see themselves as family as Coppola. I got the shivers walking out of the movie. Unlike horror movies where it's over and done with (with the exception of ""Deliverance"" which I will never get out of my mind), this haunts one for days after. I watched this again a few weeks ago, and what we have is a milieu that separates itself from out mundane existences. These people choose to live in a violent world of their own choosing. One issue that always gets me is, how do they enjoy the fruits of their ""labor""? It seems that a hell on earth is created for them. The unfortunate thing is that they push that hell onto their victims in the name of family."

","The Godfather stands as the ultimate film in the Mafia and gangsters genre. I don't think it could have been improved in any way. A very interesting story, tremendous action scenes, great special effects, outstanding performances, strong direction, not a single sequence in excess, a good soundtrack, perfect timing, details carefully attended to, well defined characters, etc, etc.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando's acting is perfect. In a cast with such top actors as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, James Caan and John Cazale -among many others- he clearly stands out. In fact, I had the feeling that their performances got even better -if possible- after Brando passes away and is out of the picture. Few Oscars for Best Actor have been awarded with more justice than the one Brando got in this one. Old timers -even for 1972- Sterling Hayden and Richard Conte both in short roles, are also a major nostalgic ingredient that raises the movie for those of us who saw them often on the screen through the 50's.<br/><br/>No much more to say on this extraordinary film except perhaps that the two sequels that followed, great movies too, are one clear step below The Godfather."
"LoneWolfAndCub","10","1","4","15 June 2006"," For me, The Godfather isn't the greatest film ever, but still one of the best
","I can't say much that hasn't already been said a hundred times; this is a flawless masterpiece of cinema. It is considered the greatest movie ever made (and although it is not my favourite) it is rightly considered so because I can't pick out any faults in this movie. Everything from the acting (with a cast like Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and so on) you cannot go wrong! Nino Rota's score is fantastic and superbly integrated into the film. Marlon Brando gives a powerhouse performance of a lifetime as the now infamous Don Vito Corleone and the music is now referred to as the quintessential mafia music.<br/><br/>Not much needs to be explained about the plot as I'm sure almost everyone knows about it. It centers around the Corleone family and their rise through the world of crime. The family consists of Don Vito (Marlon Brando), Michael (Al Pacino), Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale).<br/><br/>I could rave on for ages about why this film is so good but I don't think I need to. The actors capture their roles perfectly and give them depth and emotion. Francis Ford Coppola's directing couldn't have been better, he captures the mood of the 40's and the underground crime world perfectly. He creates an epic, soap-operish feel of a families rise to power through corruption and murder. Nothing at all looks cheap or hokey, the special effects are nasty and the cinematography is beautiful. <br/><br/>Basically, this movie is recommended to any person who considers them-self a movie buff (although any self-proclaimed movie connoisseur has to have seen this) or someone who just wants a cinematic gem! <br/><br/>5/5"

","The Godfather casts a long shadow over every single film represented on IMDb, to a point that creates impossible expectations, and frequent accusations of ""overrated"". Let that very subjective criteria be measured against IMDb's very transparent ranking logic: average popularity. Much like the Oscars, the IMDb top 100 might not be ruled by your number 1 film, but by the film the greatest number of people ranked very highly. If you free The Godfather from this weighty title, it still deserves a 10 by any standard.<br/><br/>Let's rewind, and consider the insanity it took, back in 1971, to even contemplate giving a relatively novice director free reign to adapt a vast crime saga, in a costly period setting, and starring an ""ethnic"" nobody and a faded has-been. The Godfather is first and foremost a triumph of screen writing, Coppola's original forte, but the fine structure, character moments and dialogue could have been tarnished by a by-the- numbers treatment, and this where the film leaps from good to great.<br/><br/>What makes The Godfather one of the finest films ever made is how right all the individual pieces are, and how well they work in unison: the performances, all of them rich and credible, from Pacino's star-making turn to Brando's classic creation; the world of the story, rich and murky, in perfect service of the story; the look, courtesy of groundbreaking work from ace cinematographer Gordon Willis... But dig deeper and it's the small touches Coppola meticulously peppered his film with that make it unforgettable, be it a touching death in an orange grove, or hit men debating the perfect gnocchi recipe.<br/><br/>Ultimately, its rewards are double what you'd expect, because, by most accounts (though I still prefer this one), Part II is even better.<br/><br/>Unmissable!"

","A fine movie about the mafia in the day really have its advantages. They say that blood is thicker than water, that is no joke. Mario Puzo's ""The Godfather"" is a real masterpiece of fine art and work of generations of mobsters. Marlon Brando does a spectacular job playing Don Vito Corleone. This mob boss doesn't play around, even though he has a bull's eye painted on him. My mom has seen this movie before I came to the world, and I had to see it first on my own time, and she was right, it is good. The real kicker is when that mobster had one of his Clydedale's head in his bed, and freaks out indefinitely. That scene is a classic, makes a horror movie look corny. And that scene where ""The Turk""(Al Lettieri) gets pumped in a restaurant, amazing! The ambushing, the seduction, and the loyalty turn to double-cross is all there in this movie. I know this is long, but it'll be worth your while. I adore great work despite all the violence. The cast is great, and if read the book, or any of his books, consider yourself loyal.

I have never seen such a powerful, believable, and moving movie since Schindler's List and Braveheart! The film captures the classical viewpoint of the best-selling novel by Mario Puzo in a very dark, but epic way, revealing the mafia as a manipulating and greedy domain of not just villains, but also of their families. The film is almost a family film in such a way that it is about family, the power of it, and that it should be loved and honored. Taht is one of the main reasons why this is such a glamorous film! The story takes place in the 1940s and 50s, and is about a mafia family called the Coreleone's who came from Sicily. They're a very powerful mafia in New York city led by an aging, persuasive man, Vito Coreleone played by the ultimate Marlon Brando.<br/><br/>The story kicks off with the issues and members of the Coreleone family. When Vito Coreleone is gunned down by another mafia family, all hell breaks loose, bringing together the family from the hot-tempered Sonny (James Caan) who is the runner up for leading the Coreleone family, Michael (Al Pacino) who does everything in his power to not join the mob, and Tom Hagen (Rob Duvall), whose the advisable councilor.<br/><br/>The story follows these individuals and even more towards the history of this family, with its comings and goings of friends and foes, and issues and solutions.<br/><br/>The acting top-notched is excellent, especially by Marlon Brando who well deserved the Oscar.

","Based on Mario Puzzo's book, The Godfather translated to the screen is an American masterpiece in the study of management and command. As a serious film it is one of the few American films which rises above syrupy American romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Meet Vito Corleone (Marlin Brando). He's a self made American gangster who came up biting and crawling. The American mob however is different from its Sicilian progenitor racked with such vendetta driven violence that whole cities are decimated. The American offspring is a business. Wars (going to the mattresses) happen according to one character only every 10 years and then only to flush the trash out of the ranks, almost a statement one might expect to hear from a career military man.<br/><br/>Don Vito wants to make his second son Michael (Al Pacino), a war hero into a real American of culture, rank, and distinction. Third Son Sonny (James Caan)will head the mob. Elder Son Fredo (John Cazale)is a dolt the others will have to look after. Adopted son, a non-Italian, Tom Hagan (Robert Duval) slides through a shadowy zone of near legitimacy as an attorney for the mob.<br/><br/>War strikes. Rival gangsters want to sell drugs. The Don is firm but is almost assassinated; Sonny is killed. Only Michael is left to head the family business, defeating the Don's grand design. Will Michael survive to keep both the biological and mob family together?<br/><br/>Senator Pat Geary (G.D. Spradlin), an official suborned by the mob, tells Michael that ""The Family"" is Michael's delusion.<br/><br/>It was an all-star performance by the entire cast.<br/><br/>Though I read the book many years ago. I hesitated to see the movie out of respect for the sentiments of many Italians who believe the film to be anti-Italian. After watching the film many years after its release I decided it is not anti-Italian as much as it is the finest study of leadership the American theatre has exhibited. Only Twelve O'Clock High (Gregory Peck) and Major Dundee (Charlton Heston; Richard Harris) come close in the study of the personality of command. <br/><br/>I prefer the combined version of Godfather I & II.<br/><br/>In the gangster film genre, the comparables ST VALENTINES DAY MASSACRE (Jason Robarts), CAPONE (Ben Gazzara), VALACHI PAPERS (Charles Bronson), and LEPKE (Tony Curtis) are all great in their own right with splendid acting but nonetheless they barely approach the eloquence of THE GODFATHER."

","When tackling something of the sheer breadth of Puzo's novel, the screenplay problem becomes not what should be included, but what should be left out.<br/><br/>Coppola and Puzo mostly get this right - staying away from minor story threads, and sticking with the broad cinematic sweeps of post-war New York and Sicily.<br/><br/>It's when the camera moves indoors that we get enveloped in Coppola's world -- this is where cinematographer Willis cut his teeth, and left a stamp on how movies use lighting ever after -- we can luxuriate in the shadows, congruent with the shady back-room world of mob dealings. The true importance of the movie lies in this, not within the vicissitudes of tit-for-tat murders.<br/><br/>Coppola could have played with the Fontaine thread, which is all about the control of Hollywood (and by extension, control of us) through movie vision, but this is almost completely ignored here.<br/><br/>One nice touch, straying from the novel; Moe Greene gets it in the eye -- layered symbolism -- of how one 'vision' of the Corleone future is snuffed out, in favor of the violent ""New Cinema"" paradigm.<br/><br/>Because Coppola's vision of the narrative was constrained by Puzo's platform, he couldn't quite reach the summit -- that would be achieved in ""Part II""."

Al Pacino looks so young in this picture, as does James Caan with all the dark hair. They are two of three brothers in the Corleone family. Michael (Pacino) is the youngest and wants nothing to do with the family business, but Sonny (Caan) is easily angered and flies off the handle a lot, especially when it involves the abuse of his sister Connie (Talia Shire). They have another brother named Fredo (John Casale), but he does not have the leadership ability of the other two.<br/><br/>Seeing over all of this is the late great Marlon Brando as Don Corleone. He is father too all the Corleone children and is also known as the Godfather by everybody else. He wields the most power, but that power is tested by four other powerful families who are also vying for what the Don has. This leads too much deceit and murder as the leaders of the other four families look to unseat Don Corleone from the top.<br/><br/>This movie is 175 minutes long. Usually when I watch a drama that long, I am unable to get through it. Not so with the Godfather. Francis Ford Coppola, who directed, manages to keep you're interest throughout. Yes the film moves at a leisurely pace, but it is never boring. His directing is helped greatly by the actors who give some of their greatest performances ever. Marlon Brando definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Actor.<br/><br/>It is also interesting to watch how Pacino's character Michael changes as the film goes on through to the end. The sequence during the baptism is one of the best ever.

","I saw this film during it's initial theatrical release and went back again and have seen it numerous times on television since. Francis Ford Coppopla has been fortunate to have not had just a single career defining masterpiece but several and this is one of them. He'll likely have one or two more masterpieces to add to his arsenal of enduring works before he is done. This ensemble cast is wonderful with Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Sterling Hayden, Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda, Al Martino and on an on. Nonimated for 10 Academy Awards it won surprisingly only three in Best Actor for Marlon Brando, Best Screenplay for Mario Puzo adapted from his novel with Francis Ford Coppola, and the big prize Best Picture. James Caan, AL Pacino and Robert Duvall were all nominated for Best Supporting Actor, the most ever from a single film in an acting category but so many from the same film caused a split in the vote and Joel Grey from Caberet ended up with the Oscar. Godfather went head to head against Caberet for the 1972 Academy Awards with Caberet wining six to Godfather's three. The Godfather was also nominated for costume design, film editing, sound and music score. Omitted was Gordon Willis with his brilliant cinematography. Willis would go on to be a favorite of Woody Allen in photographing Annie Hall and seven other Allen films. Willis, like many involved in the Godfather would also do Godfather II and III. Production Designer Dean Tavoularis team of Set Decorator Phillip smith and Art Director Warren Clymer give this film a rich look and an excellent period piece atmosphere along with Costume Designer Anna Hill Johnstone. Nino Rota's music score gives the film the flavor of a fine Italian wine. He scored all of Federico Fellini's films in Italy including La Vita Dolce and 8Â½ as well as scoring such films as La Strada, Obsession, War and Peace and Romeo and Juliet in his long career. This film also features great non-original music from Berlin to Bach and Mozart. Editor William Reynolds would have had quite an ambitious editing project with this three hour film and his skill paid off. The sequel Godfather II was a great film and one of the greatest and most recognized sequels in film history but I would have left it there and not made it a trilogy with Godfather III. I don't know how long this film has been #1 on the IMDb top 250 but it will likely be there in that spot for some time and it will take a film made after it to knock it out of the top spot. Maybe a film not yet made. I would give this a 10 and highly recommend it."

","""The Godfather"" is a good movie that should have been a much better one. It has almost everything it needs: a stellar cast, a story based on a bestseller, great music, lush cinematography, etc. It makes a kind of visual poetry out of many of its scenes. But in the end it lacks a soul. As a movie about the Mafia, it made its characters too lovable, whitewashing the brutality, hypocrisy, stupidity and sleaze of real gangsters. We like the characters too much; we want to be like them, deliver their lines. It leaves out even the few ideas that the book had. In the end it is a story well told, but eventually, a story about nothing (not in the Seinfeld sense, either.)."

This movie has set the standards for epic story's (why do people compare this to LOTR?). You can really see the drastic change that is happening to Vito and how the family business is changing. This film was also one of the few that can make me Very tense (especially when Vito was *SPOILER* at the restaurant talking to the bent Cop after going to the Bathroom) It just made me on the edge of my seat with anticipation on whether he would do it or how it would happen.<br/><br/>This deserves the NO.1 top spot for definite.

","First seeing The Godfather you'll probably have a good idea of what it is about a Mafia family.It is never mentioned as a Mafia film,and I do not believe the word Mafia is used in the film.For the Corleone family its a part of their business and lives.We know what the Corleone's are doing is evil and wrong,but The Godfather isn't told from our point of few it is told from the point of few of The Corleone family.With understanding this we are able to understand the characters more,and have sympathy for them.Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone is a respectable man,he is offered to get into the drug business and he says it is wrong.The audience of course know that Vito is a cold hearted killer,but he comes across as a sad man.A crucial establishing scene in the beginning of the movie,has an undertaker asking Vito for justice,Vito says that he will receive it,but he will ask him a favor in the future.Vito is gunned down and is sick the rest of his life,his son Sanito ""Sonny"" Corleone takes his Father's place.Sonny is betrayed and gunned down in a violent war.A sad Vito comes in to the Undertaker asking his favor,clean up his body so his mother doesn't have to seem him like this.The story of The Godfather does not belong to Vito Corleone though he only plays a part in it.The Godfather is the story of the transfer of Vito's empire to his other son Michael.Michael is actually a decent guy,he has a girlfriend he plans to wed,and is a war hero.Michael in tears tells his Father he will be there for him next to his hospital bed.Michael kills the men who set-up his father.Vito even tells Michael he didn't want a life of crime for him,he wanted him to become something more.Through the course of the movie Michael becomes a man possibly worse than his father,he is a tragic figure you feel for.<br/><br/>The Godfather is brilliantly directed by Francis Ford Coppola.It is arguably the best directed film of all time.It has a dark feel to it.The acting is brilliant too,there is no bad performance in this film.The Godfather is a must see,for any fan of movies.If you could only place one film to represent the 20th Century and movies,The Godfather would probably be that film.<br/><br/>A Very High 10/10"

Godfather has a good plot but for me, it is just too much to handle. The movie would probably get away without so much blood but I guess you have to be realistic.

","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!<br/><br/>What can be said that hasn't been said already? Is this the best movie ever? Along with the Seven Samurai and Vertigo i would say yes. The cast is massive, they all have a part to play, and all perform with excellence. The scope is huge, the direction flawless, the score is one of the best, lots of memorable images, lots of violence, and endless points of discussion. if i try to find faults, i would be picky, and the faults would be minor-the wedding scene at the start goes on for too long, with too much singing and dancing, but i can see what Coppola is doing. We get a genuine sense of the family, its home life and business life, with the female members pushed away so that the men can do what they think they have to do. My favourite images are Michael standing outside the hospital, pretending to hold a gun, the first time he sees Apollonia, McCluskey with a bullet in his head, and all the mob deaths at the end. 10 out of 10"

","I believe that there is little that need to be said about the ""Godfather"". A true masterpiece, whose characters has become legendary (who has not heard about Don Corleone), has been followed by an equally great sequel (not counting Godfather III which is a good movie but definitely belongs to a lower league than I and II), and has inspired and paved the road for other legendary mafia films (""Goodfellas"", ""Once Upon A Time in America"").<br/><br/>With a large bunch of all-time classic actors such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, and Diane Keaton, the performances given in Godfather provide the definition of top quality cinema. In short, ""Godfather"" is one of the films that everybody should watch at some point of his/her life. 10/10."
"newkidontheblock","10","1","4","14 August 2004"," Simply The Best
","The Godfather is one of those movies that come around once ever so often that leave you in awe of it's greatness. Its a story of so many demintons, twists and turns and yet, it's not hard to follow. The Godfather is a film where it's hard to pick the bad guys from the good guys. It's a story of how even the most innocent of people can take part in the most despicable actions if the right pieces come to place. It's a story of family, love, hate, and murder. Mario Puzo's The Godfather is a sure fire classic that wont disappoint. <br/><br/>Spoilers Ahead <br/><br/>So The Godfather is about this Mafia boss named Vito Corleone (The Late Marlon Brando) who is a Italian immigrant who came to this country during the early 20th century (as you will see in part II). So he's in the gambling racket in New York and has many crooked politicians and other people of power right in his pocket. He has 2 Sons: Micheal (Al Pacino)and Sonny (James Cann). Sonny is his right hand man who is hier as head of the family, Sonny is the epidiemy of the hothead who is impossible to talk to with out pissing him off. During the film while at a tollbooth in Jeresy he's trapped like a rat in a huge boobytrap and is shot many times, thus his demise. And of coarse there's Micheal who is the innocent one of the family. A war veteran and college boy, Micheal has his hands clean of any blood, at least for a while. <br/><br/>One day while getting some fruit, Don Corleone was shot 5 times in the back by a man who he refused to do business with. To say the least, the brothers where not happy. So squeaky clean Micheal comes up with a plan to kill the men who tried to kill his father (by the way, Vito came though). He invited the two men to an old style restaurant in The Bronx to ""talk"". While they were talking, Micheal asked to go to the bathroom. While he was there he grabbed the gun that he hid behind the toilet, he took it out and killed them both. the plan went as planed, but Micheal had to go to Italy until the whole ordeal had cooled down.<br/><br/>Some assorted stuff happened (like his brother death) while he was gone but when he was in Italy, he met he future wife Appellonia. They were married for awhile until she died because of a car bomb. Soon afterwards, he gets word of his brothers death and returns to the states. Soon after he returns his father strokes out making him the new ""Don"". Here, you can really see Micheal change from a kind innocent man to a cold hearted mafia man who kills his brother in law, despite the objections of his sister.<br/><br/>One of the most cruel and ironic movies ever, The Godfather is with out a doubt the best film ever made. There will never be another one like it, this film had it all. a 10/10 all the way!"

","This film has to be one of the greatest films ever made.  Based on the best-selling novel by Mario Puzo, the film tells the story of the Corleone family (who also happen to run a large organised crime syndicate in new York).  <br/><br/>The film has some remarkable performances.  Marlon Brando appears in one of his most memorable roles as the aging family patriarch Don Vito Corleone (the ""godfather"" of the title) and Al Pacino makes a powerful impression as his youngest son, Michael (in the role that made him a star).  James Caan and John Cazale are both brilliant as Michael's brothers (Caan the volatile Sonny and Cazale the weak Fredo).<br/><br/>The film is beautifully photographed, with a great feeling for the textures of light and shadow.<br/><br/>The score by Nino Rota is superb.<br/><br/>More than just an action-packed gangster thriller, this film is also a complex family drama.<br/><br/>Both the quiet family and business scenes and the explosive action are well handled by director and co-screenwriter Coppola."
"Ben_Cheshire","10","1","4","14 July 2004"," The Godfather Phenomenon in a Nutshell
","The epic adventures of the Corleone family: Don Vito doesn't want to get involved in drugs, because its a dirty business. This causes repercussions and sparks a war among the five families.<br/><br/>The Godfather Phenomenon in a nutshell: people love it for Gordon Willis' exquisite indoor cinematography, the performances, the Scarface value of being able to say sentences in the Don's voice, the in-jokes (give him an offer he can't refuse, go to the mattresses), Nino Rota's iconic musical score, and the iconic scenes (the opening monologue, followed by the Don's first totally quotable speech ""you come into my house on my daughter's wedding day"", the horse's head, Sonny's sprinkler bashing in the busy street, the fruit-market shooting, the toll-way shooting, the gun in the bathroom restaurant scene, the garden fertiliser scene near the end, and the Baptism scene).<br/><br/>There are faults in the second film: i think Fredo goes a little over the top, for instance, but the first Godfather is as close as you'll get to a perfect film. If there was a weakest link, though, it'd probably be Diane Keaton. She does bring an interesting quality to it, I agree, but it always looks like she's reading lines. Luckily, she doesn't have too many.<br/><br/>It can be difficult to follow, due to the fact that its an adaptation of a long, elaborate book - but i think that contributes to its mystery. You always feel like watching it again to try and figure out who killed who and why.<br/><br/>To make a great film, Coppola went back to basics, pure and simple, grande classical storytelling. He took the lessons of the masters to heart, and the result is just one of the best, most beautiful epics in the language.<br/><br/>10/10"

The Godfather has one of the most gripping storylines that has come across in any film. It is a masterpiece of filmmaking. While there is no such thing as a perfect film, because someone will always find something they don't like in a movie, The Godfather is a film with few flaws. There is action, some comedy, a little romance, and tons of drama. The Godfather is about one family and how they will and do kill for each other. It's a movie that at the center is about what we all do to survive in this world.

","When you think of the top 25 films of all time, they have one thing in common. You could have seen them when they first came out or your children's children can be viewing them, and they will still give the same long lasting impression. They may encourage you/your children to get into film or entertainment, they make you think. They keep you talking well after you've seen the film not once, not twice, but for a long time. There is always something new you're discovering about it, each time you speak of it. The Godfather is one of those rare films.<br/><br/>I was too young to see it once it came out, but I read alot of movie magazines at the time about it as well as grabbing a copy of the Mario Puzio book. My first full length view of ""The Godfather"" was on...yep, you guessed it, the ""Z"" channel in Los Angeles in the 1980's. It grabbed me and never let go.<br/><br/>The Godfather has everything in it that a movie going public would like to see, and the rare thing is -- it's all in one movie. <br/><br/>It deals with family, the relationship of sons and their placement IN a family, it has violence -- that's for sure, mystery, romance, corruption, suspense. It has a story, surprises. The costumes are wonderful, the scenery and sets are wonderful.<br/><br/>This was 1972 and NOTHING like this was put together/filmed at the time. The early 70's gave alot of film makers chances, some good, some spectacular -- and most of all a legend for future film makers and entertainers to look at, hold in esteem and copy (which is the best form of flattery.)<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, there are many 'gangster-type' films out there that kick-butt (thanks to James Cagney, Edward G. and a host of others) , but this one...flowed. It really isn't all about the violence, but legacies, how violence begats violence and a look inside a ""family"" maternal and extended and what they would do to survive. The rivalries between ""families"". This is why ""The Godfather"" ranks in the top 7 of the best movies of all time among the majority. <br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Cann, Robert DuVall and an ecclectic, well cast group of actors and actresses and Production crew brought this to life. Regardless of how YOU may feel personally about the ""portrayal"" of the ethnicity of the characters, this film MAKES you wonder, makes you feel, makes you angry, makes you cry, makes you respond.<br/><br/>The Godfather is one of the best films ever made."

This film has it all - an extremely powerful, believable story, an all-star cast and a director (Francis Ford Coppola) who made the effort and took the time to do it right! The story is of a Mafia family in the 30's through the 60's and the events that catapult a son into control of the family's empire. Al Pacino, in particular, did a fantastic job as Michael Corleone, son of his father, although he didn't intend it to be that way. There is a lot of violence, but it's not there for violence's sake. The world of organized crime was much more violent in the past than it seems to be now and the violence is depicted as more or less just a part of doing business. This is perhaps Marlon Brando's greatest performance (as the father) ever. Other great actors include James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire.

","For some years I have avoided getting around to see The Godfather.<br/><br/>
Such is its reputation, one is afraid to spoil the almost mythical aura that surrounds the film by doing anything as pedestrian as watching it.     <br/><br/>
But watch it I have, and it is now easy to see why this epic has captured the imagination of so many people. <br/><br/>A sweeping family melodrama, it is completely engaging and replete with stunning performances from the cast.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the first-time viewer cannot help feeling a little cheated. So much is left unexplored, so many years glossed over without adequate explanation or credible character development.<br/><br/>What is missing in the main is a sense of how and why Michael turned around so completely in the last two thirds of the film. <br/><br/>From the point at which he becomes a murderer for the first time in a small family restaurant (a scene that stands alone as a masterpiece of direction), the film begins to rattle through events at an ever-increasing pace.<br/><br/>
At what point does Michael acquire the confidence that allows him to risk exposure in Sicilly simply in order to bully the father of a potential suitor (who soon becomes his wife)?<br/><br/>What led him to contact Kay for the first time in years, 12 months after his return to New York? Where is the warmth and passion in their rekindled relationship? We don't see any evidence of it: one moment he is demanding she marry him, the next they have children and he is fully wrapped in the business of running the family's affairs? Why don't we see her response to the inevitable discovery that Michael has since been married (and widowed)? Why does this strong and relatively independent woman so passively accept her role as mobster's put upon, excluded, untrusted spouse, a transformation completed in the closing moments of the film?<br/><br/>Is it because her love for Michael is so intense? If so then show us, it is too important a feature of the film for Coppola to ignore.<br/><br/>
At its best, The Godfather is in a class of its own as an example of cinematic genius. At its worst, it comes across like an upmarket TV mini-series.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest testament to the director's success in this case is that the film could easily have stretched to four or even five hours and still continued to maintain the viewers' attention. Perhaps then we would have seen many of these loose threads tied up to our satisfaction.<br/><br/>3/5"

In particular, Marlon Brando gives one of the most amazing performances I have ever seen.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it didn't quite live up to the billing as best picture of all time and was not flawless as many claim it to be...  I had two major problems with the Godfather.  First, even thought the movie is three hours long I felt that the character of Michael was still underdeveloped. Michael's ""transformation"" is the focal point of the movie, yet we see almost nothing of him in the first third of the movie and we can't really tell how much of an internal change he makes.  Leaving a little mystery and leaving things up to interpretation is fine but I thought this was a bit extreme.<br/><br/>Second, the female characters were one-dimensional, naive and passive to the point of incredulity.  Take for example the scene between Michael and Kay after Michael returns from his absence -- oh come on!<br/><br/>Despite these qualms, it was still very enjoyable and something that everyone should probably watch at least once.

When I came back I saw people in cars being blown up,   Marlon Brando being injured, an abused wife going crazy with the dishes, Al Pacino young and vengeful  and ,more and more deaths. Big Deal! The people that died were people that were underveloped and I can't say i cared much.  And what's the big fuss about Marlon Brando acting,  he just talked in a funny voice and relaxed-in A Streetcar Named Desire he actually give an effort to act. Well,  i have to admit that I did not finish the film.   It just wasn't fun enough,   not entertaining, and I think the acting nowadays is better.   The part that I shut the film off is when Marlon fell in the garden and the little boy went away.  I then shut it off and said,  that's nice.  If the ending is good then maybe I'll finish watching the Godfather, but i don't know.  It was just not entertaining.  Very boring.   The day before I saw the film I saw the three hour Casino,  which I liked because the music,  the acting, and the excellent 90's pace.   It dealt with the mafia,  Casino,  but people like Sharon Stone and pace made the film emotionally involving.   Watch Casino and then watch The Godfather and ask yourself,    which film was more entertaining?"
"Chuck-149","10","1","4","15 June 1999"," Perfect in every sense of the word.
","I've seen this movie a dozen times and still believe it is by far the best movie ever made.  From the opening sequence where you make the acquaintance of the Godfather, Don Vito Corleone and his family to the ending scene where Michael Corleone becomes Don Michael Corleone, the new godfather, the movie stays perfect.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando is excellent as Vito Corleone (he won an Oscar for his performance) and Pacino and Caan are great as his sons who have two opposite characters, Pacino is practical and Caan is radical.  However, I believe Robert Duvall is the one who distinguishes himself the most as Pacino's and Caan's adopted brother and lawyer of the family.<br/><br/>Many of my favorite scenes of all-time are included in this gem (especially the scene where Michael kills Solottzo and Captain Macluskey in the restaurant).  An absolute must-see at any costs."
"Michael_Pilkington","10","1","4","12 March 1999"," A real masterpiece
","The acting and story telling is so powerful thanks to the teaming of Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo (from his novel).  Marlon Brando is the Oscar-winning titled patriarch, Don Vito Corleone, who struggles to keep his family together.  Oscar-nominated Al Pacino is the son Michael, who eventually takes his father's place.  Let's not forget the supporting performances of Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire. This is a really perfect movie about the mafia that does everything in their power to stay on top.  Not to be missed, but if you can't say anything nice about ""The Godfather,"" then don't say anything at all.  My evaluation: **** out of ****."

","I first saw this film the summer before my senior year in college, during a summer school class I was taking called ""Literature and Film.""  This was the second film they showed, I think, and from the moment the character of Bonasera comes on and says, ""I believe in America,"" this had me hooked. This is like the perfect meal, where all the ingredients come together - theme (gangsters as a metaphor for society, family being overrun by cold-hearted business tactics), story, acting (Brando seemed a little overrated when I first saw it, but that's because he's not on-screen a whole lot; it took me a few viewings to see his shadow hangs over the entire film. The rest of the cast is excellent as well, especially Pacino), the technical sides (the way Gordon Willis uses light and dark to contrasts the two sides of the Corleones made me pay attention to cinemotography), dialogue (""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli"") - and leave you completely satisfied.  And the scene I remember is not the horse's head, or the scene where Michael says he will kill Sollozzo and McClusky, but rather the baptism scene, which haunted me for days.  Incredible as it may seem, Part II is even better.  But I'll say more about that in those comments."

"XRANDY","Null","1","4","8 November 2001"," My favorite movie
","Spoiler WARNING<br/><br/>Television takes a pretty bad rap.  It is often derided for its stultifying properties, engendering of abject values and overall ability to vitiate the masses.  Many even claim that it foments a sundering influence over families.  I suppose there is some merit to such an assertion, but I can tell you that when I was growing up the TV was the node in which our otherwise fragmented family coalesced.  I guess we would be referred to as `dysfunctional' today; my father didn't talk to us much and the dinner table was a surface in which to set the groceries until they were put away.  If my parents did ask about how school went, a laconic `alright' would satisfy. But when we sat in front of that glowing cynosure, with its exogenous felicity and fruition, our reticence faded into commentary.  Somehow the factitious world contained in that electronic box inspired us to notice each other.  We watched and we talked.<br/><br/>
So when it was deemed that I was mature enough to watch the network premier of `The Godfather' I was not only anticipating a good movie, I was looking forward to family bonding. I positively loved to listen to my father and older brothers (I'm the baby) engage in dialogue and repartee in response to the TV.  Their insight brought more to light than my young mind could comprehend with just the presentation as is, and I felt edified as well as inclusive.  Hey some folks have the visits to Yellowstone, I have this.<br/><br/>
Even though it was too much for an adolescent to fully appreciate, I knew then that this movie was something special.  And as I grew older I watched it every time it aired.  Of course after videos arrived this was the first movie I purchased.  It is the crème de le crème of films, of which I have watched at least 50 times.  It is a work of art that I can call a masterpiece without a bit of hyperbole.  It is my opinion the greatest picture ever made.<br/><br/>
Though a substantial portion of the film takes place in Sicily, and many customs of that land (as well as cabala) are featured this is a very American story.  It is no less than a stunning examination of the dichotomy that is success in the land of opportunity.  It is a tale of the fine line between legitimacy and profligacy in the capitalist world, of the gray area that exists between transgression and ignominy.  And if the film is a treatise on the American way then the opening line, `I believe in America', is its exordium.  With those prefatory words Coppola sets the tone.<br/><br/>
What follows is a congeries of dexterous camera shots, first-rate dialogue, incredible acting, untiring character development and one hell of a story. The juxtaposition of criminality and family honor/personal loyalty is achieved with utmost precision.  The motif of personal rectitude vis-à-vis societal ethos pervades the film.  The main characters embody this paradox. They are vicious yet decorous, violent yet urbane, heartless yet not without code.<br/><br/>
The actors are at their best.  Brando providing gravitas, Cann relishing his bellicose role, Keaton appearing to live her enduring conflict.  It is Pacino of course who must steer the course, as his permutation is unveiled before us.  Pacino achieves this vicissitude with a subtlety that resembles an insidious whisper, inaudible to those who underestimate him.<br/><br/>
If you will allow me an indulgence I would like to comment on the outstanding ending to this work.   At times movies are often beloved for memorable scenes.  The finale of this tale is as piquant as they come. Coppola understands the power of the doorway, and the shot of Kay's face, overcome with the realization of her husband's duplicity, as the door closes, symbolically shutting her out of his life, is sheer pathos.  Did I mention that I love this ending?  In fact the par excellence of this conclusion has soured me on the sequels.  I have watched them and think they are great, but I do not possess them and never will.  Any extension of this saga is a reproach to this superb terminus ad quem.<br/><br/>
`The Godfather' is a film that must be watched numerous times to absorb and appreciate the many names, nuances, and instances.  I highly recommend it."

"Kakueke","10","1","4","20 September 2001"," A classic all the way
","The Godfather is without a doubt one of the all-time greats, and the acting performances of Marlin Brando as Vito Corleone and James Caan as Sonny match that comment (Al Pacino is also good, but they have the edge).  The first two-thirds of the movie is definitely better, but the last third does its job in finalizing Mike's evolution into a Mafia chief.<br/><br/>The movie adds to the mystique of Brando as Godfather by not having him the center of action except for the first third of the movie, keeping you from that overdone feeling, and his major decisions are made in the wedding and shortly thereafter.  But oh, the classic scenes that resulted:  the friendship scene with Bonasera, the ""making an offer that he can't refuse"" line, the horse's head, the hand stabbing/strangling death of Luca Brasi. In the minority situation for an actor's being made to look older than he is, Brando is superb.  The cotton stuffing in his mouth works magnificently. He is The Godfather all the way -- way, way over Michael.  His wisdom and counsel are greater, and his majesty; Michael is a morose figure.<br/><br/>Sonny is a formidable, memorable character (is he not much taller than James Caan is?), and his blatant id contrasts with Vito and Michael.  Tom Hagen is also played very well, by Robert Duvall, and other actors and actresses do a good job.  The hypocrisy crystallized by the Catholic mass setting is also excellent.  And hey, is not Sonny beating up his brother in law one of the very, very best fight scenes, even if one-sided?  What can I cite by comparison, Bruce Lee vs. Chuck Norris in The Way of the Dragon -- and yes, not sarcastically -- for what good fight scenes are so distinctive, intense and original, leaving such an imprint--what other very good fight scene also sticks out so much in one's mind over others?  You can't say, ""they're all the same"" for this one.  Sonny, like Vito and Mike, is part of American popular culture (well, I guess international, not to be chauvinistic).<br/><br/>One of my friends, and perhaps yours, has said, ""I was rooting for the Corleones.""  As one who likes many thrillers, action and suspense movies, and crime dramas, but does not like the overly depressing subject matter and sleazy characters and sometimes tortuous, overcomplicated plots that characterize the mid-70s onward (Pulp Fiction, Grifters, etc.), I note that this is unfortunately a forerunner of these, altho not hard to follow.  But I think it was the Godfather Part II that really was the precursor, and II's quality pales in comparison to I's (I do not care what others think), and much more than other sequels.  Because the genius of The Godfather I was taking such sordid subject matter and making it so entertaining, so much a part of our consciousness, and leaving us with such positive feeling when we think about it.  I do not believe this is the case for many later movies to which its influence can be traced."
"Brian-272","10","1","4","5 June 2001"," Now ladies and gentleman it doesn't get any better than this.
","Long before serial killers, heroes, comedies, and dramas you had this masterpiece The, Godfather. Francis Ford Coppola knew just how to organize this so well by showing how a family made a living and going to elite power in the process. Marlon Brando is the greatest as Don Vito head of the family, then open the door for son Michael Corleone played perfect by Al Pacino. The, Godfather helped make Pacino a household name. The, Godfather also uses one of the best film editing techniques possible the work of Russian film editor Pudovkin as his editing technique of linkage of shots adds to the drama of The, Godfather. The scene of the baptism is linked just at the very same moment with the murder scene of enemies sure it is not the best pace but the scene is just perfect, and the drama of the events is increased through editing by linkage of shots by comparing death to a baptism both highly valued rituals in the mob. The, Godfather is the best from everything with the filming, acting, and the story. As you know The, Godfather will be the greatest classic forever."
"mentalcritic","Null","1","4","26 February 2001"," The best cinematic adaptation of a novel... ever.
","Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather was a sweeping tale spanning two generations with a tale that, as director Francis Ford Coppola states, is more the tale of a king with three sons than of a mob war. This view of the novel is surprisingly accurate, and the movie is helped along by it. Granted, the family at the centre of the story is in the business of crime, but the story is more about the family than the crimes.<br/><br/>The head of this family is Don Vito Corleone, played to perfection by Marlon Brando. His mannerisms, and the mannerisms of any other mob boss who has survived assination attempts and wars, are captured marvellously in Brando's performance. At no stage did I have any problem believing that I was watching a mob boss rather than an actor just playing his part. Then, of course, there's the three sons: Santino (James Caan), Frederico (John Cazale), and Michael (Al Pacino). The first two of these young men are unsuitable to succeed their father as head of the family business. The youngest, and most unwilling, is ironically the most suitable. This touch makes me wonder if Mario Puzo read Plato a lot when he was writing The Godfather, for it was Plato who said that the unwilling make the best rulers. Filling out the family's ranks are Constanzia Corleone (Talia Shire), who is getting married on the day the film opens to Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), and Vito's adopted son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). There isn't a single member of the cast, at least where these important roles are concerned, who doesn't play their part to a disbelief-suspending perfection.<br/><br/>As I mentioned previously, the film is more about the family than their business activities. Indeed, the business side of the story really only exists for plot movement. While the film cannot capture every single detail from the novel, such as the intricacies of the business, it does an excellent job of filling out the details. I've yet to see another film where this much detail from the original novel has made its way into the screenplay. Critics accuse this film of being overlength, but this is a load of cobblers. Having sat through a television broadcast of this film that took up four hours once the commercials were accounted for, I can tell you that the film is absolutely riveting. Whether it is the story, the characters, or Nino Rota's amazing score music, this film has everything it takes to keep a viewer glued to the screen for its entire length. Even the slowest part of the film, Michael's pilgrimage in Sicily, is delightful to watch due to its cinematography and doomed romance between Michael and Apollonia.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, the only criticism I have of The Godfather and its first sequel is that the back story of Vito Corleone wasn't developed enough. There are numerous details, such as how Luca Brasi came to be in Vito's employ, which should have been shown in the film. The role of Mama Corleone was also somewhat underdeveloped, as her interaction with Kay Adams was a critically important element of the novel. I don't think she was ever known by any other name in the novel, either, but she was still a living, breathing character with concerns and feelings of her own. Something she was stripped of in the film. All of these elements could have used some screentime because they help the reader/viewer to understand Vito Corleone as a human being as well as as a mob boss.<br/><br/>Aside from that one minor complaint, however, The Godfather is the best screen translation of a novel in the history of the art form. Francis Ford Coppola should be knighted for this movie, as he stands head and shoulders above anyone else who has attempted this feat (Stanley Kubrick's failure to get half the detail of The Short Timers, a 180-page novel where half the words are expletives, into Full Metal Jacket, anyone?)."

"krumski","10","1","4","1 February 2000"," Movies just don't get any better than this
","What can I say that hasn't already been said a million times. This is one of those movies that just holds you in thrall from beginning to end, with no let up in interest or involvement - an amazing feat under any circumstance but almost unheard of for a three-hour movie! As such, it's interesting to compare this with more recent epic-length films of today. A couple years ago, on its 25th anniversary re-release I saw this in the theater on the same day I saw ""The English Patient"". The difference in the two films was just amazing. The English Patient wasn't bad or anything, it's just that it was way too long for the story it told; a good 90 minute-to-2 hour premise was padded out with gorgeous but pointless scenery, an unnecessary subplot, and a shooting and acting style which emphasized dragging things out just for their own sake. The Godfather, by comparison, crams every single minute of its running time with richness, characterization, intrigue, etc. - so much so that, for me, the film actually seems SHORTER than its running time would lead you to believe. There's so many movies that could learn from this - movies that want to be epic length to inflate the importance of their subjects, but just arent' interesting enough to hold us for that long. Many films are guilty here, from Titanic to The Talented Mr. Ripley, The Green Mile - even such ""great"" films as Lawrence of Arabia and (yes) Shindler's List use their lengths more as endurance tests (i.e. if you can't stay interested through the whole thing than you must be somehow boorish or unfeeling) and as proofs that the directors just became so enamored of their subjects that they couldn't bear to take anything out than as necessary for the telling of their stories. Sadly, I must say that, in my opinion, even The Godfather Part II falls victim to this tendancy - definitely one of the most overrated and unnecessary sequels of all time.<br/><br/>But if you want to see the Corleones (and Francis Ford Coppola) when they were all at the top of their game and everything was just cooking, go back and watch this movie. Even after all the imitations, the rip-offs, the parodies and the cultural appropriations of lines like ""Make him an offer he can't refuse"" and ""He sleeps with the fishes"" to the point where the movie sometimes seems as entrenched (and as tired) as cliches like ""Mom, God and apple pie"" --- once you start watching all of that stuff flies out the window and you're amazed to learn that, wonderfully, this film has lost none of its edge or entertainment value in the nearly thirty years of its existence.<br/><br/>(BTW Don't anyone get the idea that I am against the concept of long movies - some of my all time favorites besides The Godfather are Apocalypse Now, 2001:A Space Odyssey, The Deer Hunter, and Oliver Stone's Nixon.  It's just that, I believe, a film really has to justify that running time, because it so opens the door to pretension and indulgence.)"

Now, taking under consideration that Coppola was under a lot of stress during the shooting, because he was threatened to be replaced, the scene doesn't really work as it should in such a flawless masterpiece. Not only do I miss more insight in the relationship of those two men, the camerawork is lost for a minute and I feel it has been build up too much as a set-up for the Woltz scene, which is a mistake."

"rmax304823","8","1","5","5 April 2015"," Excellent Execution.
","It's a beautifully made movie. Not just because of the subtle direction by Francis Coppola but because of the production design (Dean Tavoularis) and photography (Gordon Willis). Everything seems to lend itself to the impact of the story, which describes the replacement of Marlon Brando's Mafia chief by his youngest son, Al Pacino. Make up is expertly handled. Pacino's broken cheek is properly swollen and blue and fades gradually, providing the viewer with a kind of cinematic clock telling the passage of time. Nino Rota's score is tops. During the baptism scene, which takes place in a church, the organ hums an apt courtly tune. Then, as the film cross cuts between ritualized religion and ritualized homicide, the organ insensibly becomes darker and more ominous.<br/><br/>These departments seldom get enough credit -- except recently in CGI extravaganza's. The more nuanced touches in furnishings, wardrobe, shadows and the like generally go unrewarded by the public. But this film, and a few others like it (""Shane"", ""Verdict"") wouldn't be what they are if they'd been clumsily handled.<br/><br/>Brando has given maybe four nearly perfect performances and this is one of them. To appreciate it we have to skip over all his failed attempts to extend his range, the dancing bookmaker, the comic Oriental sidekick. The Don Corleone we see doesn't radiate power so much as fatigue. Al Pacino is transformed from a smiling lad, happy to be home from the war, to a dispassionate kingpin of crime at the end, a bit too abruptly. Sterling Hayden, as the corrupt Irish cop, has invested this much in a role only once before, in ""Dr. Strangelove."" Example: After smashing Pacino's face with one blow of his oversized fist, Hayden turns away, winces with self control and pounds his fist into the night-time air.<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine how Coppola could have improved on his direction of this tragic tale. With the exception of the violent scenes, of which there are many, maybe too many, the film's texture is smooth and understated. Example: A baker shows up at the hospital just before some would-be assassins arrive and Pacino talks this innocent man into posing as a gunman. Not a word from the baker. He does what he's told. And when it's safe, he tries to light a cigarette but his hands are shaking so badly that Pacino has to light it for him.<br/><br/>The women don't have much to do. Diane Keaton as the Shiksa is puzzled but hopeful. Talia Shire as the abused wife is hysterical. Mamma Corleone is a revered background figure who rarely shows up.<br/><br/>That's the good stuff -- and it's very good indeed.<br/><br/>The bad stuff, I'm not sure about. The Corleone family, like the other five families in New York, are making a fortune. That's evident from their digs, their cars, their raw silk suits. But what business are they in? That's one of the things Keaton is curious about. The businesses are only alluded to twice -- "" the gambling, the liquor, even the women."" Well, what's so bad about that? Who gives a damn about illegal gambling, smuggled liquor, or escort services? Nobody. Drugs are brought in towards the end, but only dealt with discretely. We never sell it around schools, it must be strictly controlled, and let the darkies up in Harlem have it and ""kill their souls."" The words ""extortion,"" ""protection racket,"" and ""Mafia"" are never used. <br/><br/>This is a pretty rotten business they're in. And if Marlon Brando' Don was a kind of community organizer, Al Pacino's Don is a ruthless hypocrite. In fact, he's a lying, murdering, thief. While he is solemnly taking his oath as godfather to his nephew, his minions are out in the streets slaughtering rivals wholesale -- and in the most graphic way.<br/><br/>""Never ask me about my business,"" he tells his wife. And one hopes she never does, unless she wants to wind up ""sleeping with the fishes."""
"chriskevingibson","10","1","5","28 November 2014"," The Godfather is the greatest movie that I have ever seen.
","There are many reasons that I say that The Godfather is the greatest movie that I have ever seen. For one, though it was made in the 70s, 1972 to be exact, it feels very modern. It's truly a timeless classic. Francis Ford Coppola, who directed and co-wrote the film, did an amazing job in the making of this film. The screenplay, which was co-written by Mario Puzo who also wrote the book of the same name, is the best that I have heard in any movie. Then there is the acting, which I think is not only the best ensemble of acting in a movie, but also that Marlon Brando, who in my opinion is one of the all-time greatest actors, put on the best performance in the role of Don Vito Corleone than any other actor did for any movie and any character. It is incredible to watch. There is no question why he won the Oscar for best actor, as well as the film winning for best adapted screenplay and for best picture. A must watch for any movie lover.

They are some of the most brilliant films ever made. Francis Ford Coppola is nothing short of the most brilliant director of the century. Everyone in the cast is perfect, especially Marlon and Al. Pacino is his usual genius self. The unfolding of these characters is a story of its own. The 4 Corleone brothers are all very different. Sonny, (wonderful performance by James Caan), the hot-headed, quick tempered man, Fredo, weak and powerless, goes to Vegas to set up business, only to be brought down my Michael. Michael, the most sensible, if not accepting of his family's business, he is the most likely successor of the title. Finally, Robert Duvall (a wonderful performance as well) , as Tom the lawyer and trusted counselor to the Corleone's. Watching everyone on screen and the story of the family is nothing short if genius. Watch only if you have three hours for each movie to spare, and if you like complicated character stories. It's an offer you can't refuse."
"wishkah7","Null","1","5","2 December 1999"," Seeing this movie is an offer you can't refuse!
","I saw this movie for the first time when I was 17.  The best part was the wedding!  The Godfather is one of my favorite movies, part 2 was cool, too! This movie isn't only about a Mafia power struggle, it also focuses on honoring and looking out for the family, and not to mention the Italian culture! <br/><br/> I've spent a lot of my summers during my childhood in Italy.  So, I understood what was happening when Sonny was beating up on Connie's abusive husband and when Michael warned Fredo in Vegas never to go against his family.  The Corleones were a very close, tight family who looked out for each other and stood up for one another during Mafia battles and other conflicts as well.  And it all boiled down to honoring the family! <br/><br/>
 I was also rooting for Michael when he took down Sollozo and the Police Chief!  Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors, and was excellent in this, and in a lot of his other movies, too. <br/><br/> So, if you haven't seen this movie, please go and rent it!  You might like it, or maybe you won't.  But it's still worth seeing."

","Why oh why is this 'the second best movie ever' according to imdb? Do we really need to sit through 2,5 hours of nothing to see for just a little bit of action in the last 10 minutes?
Gangster movies can be entertaining, just ask Scorsese. This was nearly 3 hours of trying to keep awake just because of the high rating.
Thanks but no thanks.

","On the day of his only daughter's wedding, Don Vito Corleone hears requests in his role as the Godfather, the head of a New York crime family. Vito's youngest son, Michael, in a Marine Corps uniform, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the sprawling reception. Vito's godson Johnny Fontane, a popular singer, pleads for help in securing a coveted movie role, so Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to the abrasive studio head, Jack Woltz, to secure the casting. Woltz is unmoved until the morning he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion. Shortly before Christmas 1945, drug baron Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo, backed by the Corleones' rivals, the Tattaglias, asks Vito for investment in the emerging drug trade and protection through his political connections. Vito disapproves of drug dealers, so he sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. The family then receives two fish wrapped in Brasi's vest, imparting that he ""sleeps with the fishes"". An assassination attempt by Sollozzo's men lands Vito in the hospital, so his eldest son, Sonny, takes command. Sollozzo kidnaps Hagen to pressure Sonny to accept his deal. Michael thwarts a second assassination attempt on his father at the hospital; his jaw is broken by Police Captain McCluskey, who is also Sollozzo's bodyguard. Sonny retaliates for the attacks on his father by having Tattaglia's son killed. Michael comes up with a plan to hit Sollozzo and McCluskey: on the pretext of settling the dispute, Michael accepts their offer to meet in a Bronx restaurant, retrieves a planted handgun, and murders them. Despite a clampdown from the authorities, the Five Families erupt in open warfare and the brothers fear for their safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily, and Fredo Corleone is sheltered by associate Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks his brother-in-law Carlo on the street for abusing his sister Connie and threatens to kill him if he abuses her again. When it happens again, Sonny speeds for her home but assassins ambush him at a highway toll booth and riddle him with submachine gun fire. Michael's time abroad has led to marriage to Apollonia Vitelli. Their euphoria is shattered when a car bomb intended for him takes her life. Devastated by Sonny's death, Vito decides to end the feuds. Believing that the Tattaglias were under orders of the now dominant Don Emilio Barzini, he promises, before the heads of the Five Families, to withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo revenge for his son's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to a father saddened by his involvement in the family business and marries Kay the next year. With his father at the end of his career and his surviving brother too weak, Michael takes the reins of the family, promising Kay that he will make the business legitimate within five years. To that end, he insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Tom is not a ""wartime consigliere""; the older man agrees Tom should ""have no part in what will happen"" in the coming battles with rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, Greene derides the Corleones as a fading power. To add injury to insult, Michael sees Fredo falling under Greene's sway. Vito collapses and dies in his garden while playing with Michael's son, Anthony. At the funeral, Salvatore Tessio arranges a meeting between Michael and Don Barzini, signaling his treachery as Vito had warned. The meeting is set for the same day as the christening of Connie's son, to whom Michael will stand as godfather. As the christening proceeds, Corleone assassins, acting on Michael's orders, murder the other New York dons and Moe Greene. Tessio is told that Michael is aware of his betrayal and taken off to his death. After Carlo is questioned by Michael on his involvement in setting up Sonny's murder and confesses he was contacted by Barzini, Peter Clemenza kills him with a wire garrote. Michael is confronted by Connie, who accuses him of having her husband killed. He denies killing Carlo when questioned by Kay, an answer she accepts. As Kay watches warily, Michael receives his capos, who address him as the new Don Corleone."

","It's considered a classic because it was cynically designed to be a classic; it knows the the secrets of tension and payoff, it hooks the idiots with some random moaning broad getting boned in the first few minutes, and enough money was pumped into it that it looks like a painting in motion. You got tits and glamourized gangster machismo for the men, and scenic rural Italy for the women.<br/><br/>It would be obvious how paper-thin and sadly calculated it all really is if the performances didn't propel it into something approaching three- dimensionality. I think I prefer Goodfellas because it deconstructs everything this movie is, and is a much more natural, interesting movie in the process."
"jonjonat","9","1","6","18 November 2009"," No Where Near The Master Piece As Shown
","I like to say that this movie was so fine that the violence and sexual references spoiled it all and the message was so deep. The Godfather is by far one of those movies that adults say even 16 year old kids like me can't watch it because it's very hard for even them to watch. It was rated R originally but they changed it to MA probably they think it's too offensive for viewers to say it's a masterpiece and doesn't deserve to be so highly rated. The Shawshank Redemption in the other hand was a perfect movie with the deepest message known as hope and was surprisingly rated MA in Australia and on the TV rating is Rated M which is more fair enough. The Godfather was just horrible and I really thought that Part 2 would be better but it really isn't and for once in my life I'm going to confirm that The Godfather shouldn't deserve to be known as a masterpiece"
"shotgunsmith2004","Null","1","6","10 April 2008"," The Godfather IS Greatest Movie of MY Generation!
","""The Godfather"" is to my generation (those born in the 1950's) what ""Dr. Stranglove"" is to those born in the 1940's and what ""From Here To Eternity"" is to my parents generation (those born in the 1930's) or what ""Gone With The Wind"" was to those born in the 1920's. They are all four considered the GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME by their generation!(They are all four historical dramas with plenty of realistic violence, insanity,love, hate, sex & bad language.) By the same logic there must be a ""greatest movie of all time"" to those born in the 1970's as well as those born in the 1980's. That would be an interesting list, what each generation considered the GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME? What did people born in the 1910's consider the greatest movie of all time?"
"arthurclay","Null","1","6","1 October 2004"," THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE. PERIOD.
","That I've seen anyway and I have seen more movies than most people except Siskel and Ebert. What else do you want me to say? Marlon Brando and Al Pacino give the best performances imaginable and the best of their respective careers as Don Vito and Michael Corleone, father and son who shall we say do not share the same frame of mind when it comes to the family biz. Don Vito is grooming his oldest son Santoro aka Sonny (James Caan) to take over from him and be the boss of the most powerful crime family in New York yet dotes on his second son Michael and sees him as destined for greatness. However, Michael, having returned from Army Service in WWII wants nothing to do with his father's illegitimate empire yet forces beyond his control cause him to become embroiled in its dirty politics despite his sincere attempts to steer clear of it. Attempted assassinations and murders quickly ensue and threaten to destroy Michael and his family that he loves. This masterpiece of art and cinema deals with many themes: love, honor, sacrifice, betrayal, and power are some of them. The central and most important one is FAMILY and that is the focus of the whole story. If the viewer doesn't understand that they will never understand this film at all. And that is why I and so many others believe this is the greatest movie ever made."

People who like this film must be huge fans of the Roman Empire. The only scene worth watching is the one where the old guy dies with an orange in his mouth.<br/><br/>And the writing: terrible. Does it really take that long to get the point across? And do people actually enjoy all that silly Italy talk? But even worse, the music. Uggg. So dull. I suppose it would be a good movie to watch if you wanted to take a long nap."
"DesheshHub","1","1","8","26 April 2020"," Overrated In Nutshell
","When a director tries to romanticize what shouldn't romanticized such like mob crimes, prostitution laundry money works, Drugs dealing.. all this goofy stuff to present an evil version of robin hood who tries to justify a weak folks,protect his family and Pushing you in the same uncomfortable corner that your boring philosophy professor about morality , hence that fake masterpiece is the result.<br/><br/>So, is The Godfather an Overrated film?!<br/><br/>WTF, no! It is super-overrated and boring.<br/><br/>I had really high expectations about this movie, like ""Hey, you just must see it - that's how the world really works!"". As a journalist, I could not miss such a masterpiece. Well...the things did not work out as I had expected. First of all, in general, I found it to be way too long, boring and tedious. I get why so many people are impressed with that movie, it offers some interesting ideas to consider, some - well-hidden, though - criticism of the American society between the lines and a fascinating storyline.<br/><br/>I really liked some scenes and parts, for example, ""Michael-hiding-himself-in-Italy"" was really beautiful! However, most of the movie is filled up with serious guys seriously discussing serious issues with a serious accent. And that's it! There is almost no humour, no symbology, no moral, no emotional charge - and no entertainment. By the way, I had exactly the same impression from the book and, knowing the plot already, I could not make myself to finish it.<br/><br/>Second, the acting and the characters. I expected something really super-amazing, or at least believable and accurate, and found none of those. I am a big fan of Al Pacino, for example, he totally nailed it in the Devil's Advocate (a better movie than the GF, in my opinion) but here, his stony face is just too...stony. No sensual or emotional charge at all. Just a serious, decisive guy - and nothing more. Hard to trust or to believe. The same for Marlon Brando. The GF is the only movie with him I have seen so far but his wheezy voice makes me cringe. And these guys are supposed to be Italians? They look like they both have had a serious deal of a serious wheat.<br/><br/>And, the last but not the least - the accuracy. There is none. First of all, it is really...hard to believe that an Italian family, first and second generation of immigrants, speaks English with a weird accent all the time. This is just crazy and I am surprised no one mentions this epic fallacy. For God's sake, they should speak Italian at least for the purpose of conspiracy, as they do all they can to hide their activities from the state!<br/><br/>Second, there are almost no pictures of what the Corleones' circus is actually doing for living. We see a rich house, family dinners, rituals, consiglieris but no murders, no drugs, no prostitution, no dirty stuff, except for a couple of shots. It's an unfair presentation. There is no sense in asking whether the portrayal of the organized crime in the movie is accurate since the picture is incomplete.<br/><br/>Pues...to sum up, in my opinion, it's a tedious, commercial and super-superficial movie which is not bad in the common sense of these words - it might be worth seeing once. However, a fairly overrated one. The best movie of all times? No way. There are many deeper, funnier and more consistent pieces around.<br/><br/>In my view, a movie is great if it engages the imagination, captivates, makes one think more expansively, and above all ENTERTAINS. The Godfather does all of these, but not really to any remarkable degree. I can think of twenty other movies that outdo The Godfather in all of those categories.<br/><br/>Another thing: I prefer movies that tell an engaging story, and the focus of that story is about BIG IDEAS. The Godfather is one of those movies that are about people and the characters. The latter really is of little interest to people with more analytical, logical-thinking minds, and more appealing to ""feeler"" type people who get fascinated by people-focused stories and relationships.<br/><br/>That's it."

","I personally believe that this movie is overrated. I don't really even believe it is the best work from a Coppola (I personally believe ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Lost in Translation"" are much better movies), but it still is entertaining to watch. It has notable performances by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino (perhaps the only Pacino performance other than ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" where he doesn't scream his eyes out), and the film also has a very nice screenplay, but the movie isn't as entertaining or extraordinary as other frontrunners like ""Casablanca"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia"". Maybe because this movie has been marred by so many rip-offs or clones, that the magic of the film has disappeared. The film just no longer feels ageless, and that's too bad."

","Watching a 3 hour long movie it's not a easy task unless you really enjoy the story and every single moment of it, but I really had to give this a try to find by myself if it really lives up to his hype.
Needless to say, the acting is by far the best thing in this movie especially Marlon Brando in his unforgettable Don Corleone role. The cinematography is very good too and the only critics I have is some flaws in shooting scenes were the gun is fired but the body doesn't get marked and some fighting scenes were they were literally punching the air but I would let that slip because they didn't had much of the technology that we have nowadays.
My biggest problem regarding this movie is pacing, like I've said in the beginning it's hard to watch a 3 hour long movie unless everything works perfectly and in this movie there were a lot of scenes way to bigger than the necessary, things that could be summoned in a shorter way and still with good cinematography were too long, and there are some unnecessary shots. The movie also advance years and it could've been done better, in a scene you are in the present and in the next you are some years later without no mention to how many time passed or even that the time passed you only understand that by the action, which if you aren't really concentrated will become confusing and It's hard to see a 3 hour long movie with long boring shots and confusing timeline.
The acting is the only top-notch thing here, everything else is just good."

Firstly, the story is based on Mario Puso's book, I really recommend to read it, and this film used almost all book, expect the storyline about young Vito (director used it in sequel). Secondly, all actors did the amazing performance: Brando, Al Pachino, Duvall and others created great film. Thirdly, music and costumes made the atmosphere of late 40s.

Other scenes, particularly where their is action or violence, seem dated. On the plus side, Brando gives a mostly fascinating performance, and some of the supporting actors are also quite good. I especially liked Robert Duvall and Abe Vigoda. Apart from the acting, their is one section of the film that I did find riveting. It is when they prepare Michael to kill The Turk and the police chief. It is tense and suspenseful, and is the closest the movie comes to noir."

","The Godfather! Known as the best movie of all time. That's about as high as the bar can be set, I think something like this will always disappoint when the bar is that high. Was it a great movie? Yes. Was it the best movie I've ever seen? No. Thankfully it reminded me that movies cannot actually provide as any sense of true purpose, real meaning, or long lasting satisfaction. They're an escape. This movie helped me to remember that movies alone cannot show me who I really am. It can educate and show new perspectives, and show part of who we are, or we can feel happy for a while, but this never lasts. If the best movie ever made couldn't do it then surely no movie can. I'd held out so long for watching this movie, always seeing it at the top of IMDB lists and imagining how good it must be, when it easily beats some of my all time favourites. But at the end of the day its just another movie. Worth watching. Not worth putting all your hope into of being the pincale of movie making. Great acting, great story though. It felt so authentic, very fresh and unlike movies that are made today. Sad that many western cultures today do not have such a strong sense of family and tradition - although in saying that this family and its traditions are not something I would want any part to do with."

","This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions"

"yeahmorelife","10","0","1","21 December 2019"," Coppola's masterpiece!
","The film is about important values like a honor and a family. The Family is the holiest for members of the Corleone's family. They are always on the side of their relatives and it doesn't matter who's right or who's wrong. Everyone, who promises a friendship and a loyalty, can count on a protection of the Family. Everyone, who betrays the Family, will be killed. It brings to mind the words of Michael Corleone. ""Don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever."" All of them bound by blood in their veins and blood of murders. Also there is the incredible music by Nino Rota. The tune is known worldwide! Great Marlon Brando and young Al Pacino! I never get tired of watching their acting. My favorite scene is at the end of the film when Michael becomes the Godfather. The combination of contrasts: the birth and the death, the baby and corpses, day and night. Great movie! I strongly recommend everyone."

The way the story was acted out and slowly unraveled throughout the movie was beautifully done. My favorite character obviously was The Godfather himself, I can't picture any other actor being able to pull off what Al Pacino did in this film and this is one of the big reasons why is one of my top five favorite actors.

I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film.

","This is a legendary film and I don't think I have to sing it's praises.

He clearly hit the air. It was embarrassing. And the scene where Brando is shot in the back about ten times. HE SHOULD BE DEAD!!!! And how lucky for him that they didn't shoot him in the head, considering all Italian hitmen do that! Maybe it's a matter of not caring because of how good everything else is, but for me personally, these things are incredibly distracting, especially when something could've been fixed so easily, i.e. the beating."

"THxRo","10","0","1","21 November 2019"," Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather.
","Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it.<br/><br/>We come to The Godfather like Kay Adams - outsiders uncertain in our expectations - but it doesn't take long for us to be captivated by this intricate, violent world. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told. Yet that last haunting image (Kay's shock of recognition), coupled with Nino Rota's mournful score, leaves a crater-like impression that The Godfather Part II only deepens."

"mackrj-34546","10","0","1","12 November 2019"," The Godfather
","There is a sense of wonderment to behold what Hollywood was like after the Golden Age. It was hell-bent, perhaps more so than any year, causing writer strikes, frequent movies that were just dull to audience members and Hollywood stars were slowly falling apart. Thanks to one book, that wasn't quite sure to be published because it glorified the Mafia, the story of the fictional Corleone Family was born and was adapted by Oscar-winner Francis Ford Coppola. Without further ado, here's my review of The Godfather.<br/><br/>Like previously mentioned that this was a novel, this film is based on the now bestseller The Godfather by Mario Puzo, this is the story of the Corleone Family and their fearsome world of organized crime. The opening scene of the movie introduces us to the head boss, father and husband to the family named Don Vito Corleone, in an Oscar-winning role by the late Marlon Brando. Don Corleone is a tough man, one who gains respect and loyalty with his trusted allies and family with three sons, Sonny, (James Cann) Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino) and one daughter Connie. (Talia Shire) As unexpected tragedy begins to downpour over the family, Michael leads his father's wishes and takes over the family business, but the Corleone Family will all soon face tragedy and betrayal in a world ridden by violence and war.<br/><br/>The Godfather was introduced to me when I was starting to get into movies. It's ranked as the second greatest movie of all time, it's widely considered to be the most quotable film in existence and it has one of the most controversial Oscar speeches. Either way, my own opinion has been that this is the singular most important movie to see and it's the greatest piece of storytelling ever. What really makes this movie shine is, not only a classic for all generations, but it's the performances that captivate the story.<br/><br/>Since The Godfather is a trilogy, I highly recommend the first two other than Part III. I will definitely set aside my doubts about Part III, and consider them all great pieces of cinema. Once you see this, the first movie, you will be dragged into the Corleone Family and look forward for what happens next. Clocking in at 177 minutes, it doesn't seem to feel that way the more I watch this movie. It's style on keeping you on edge in unique ways can be done with more than one viewing. Before I close my review of this brilliant masterpiece, I want to appreciate the cinematography of the film. Gordon Willis, also known as the ""Prince of Darkness"", has glorified the sepia tone, dark lights and shadows to unmatched beauty of the criminal underworld.<br/><br/>In conclusion, those who are looking for a movie that will have family elements will look no further than to check this one out immediately. Sure, it's lengthy and has more talking than gangster action, but it's a revolutionary experience. With exciting sequences, remarkable performances and brilliant piece of storytelling, The Godfather is a highly recommended movie for all fans of cinema and crime dramas. I'm gonna make an offer you won't refuse.<br/><br/>10/10"

","This story is so realistic.
If I analyze why this movie is a classic, the reason is that this is so realistic as a Mafia movie.
It caused by the situation that protagonist started as a university student. He was a normal student like us. We felt our self in his place.
And then gradually he is changing so we can follow his heart.
In that way, we felt that his behavior is kind of inevitable actions.
His is required to do it because he is in the position.
His killing people is kind of the mission as of port of the society. It make us feeding fearful.
This movie's story is so well written. Especially about the realistic situations. We were shocked by that.

","This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.<br/><br/>To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same."
"shahabshahrjerdi","6","0","1","5 September 2019"," The Godfather
","The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.<br/><br/>The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.<br/><br/>Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.<br/><br/>But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whispery, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.<br/><br/>The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although ""The Godfather"" is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races)."

","""The Godfather"" is an American mostly English-language movie from 1972, so this one is already almost 50 years old now, 3 to go, and it runs for almost three hours. I am not even sure if it is necessary to talk about the basics here, but lets go. The director is Francis Ford Coppola and he is also part of the writing team. This is probably still the defining mafia movie and the rating here on imdb says it all. It won Best Picture at the Oscars and Marlon Brando (in heavy makeup) received the second Oscar of his career. Add to that a writing Oscar, but the movie was cut short because of the tremendous success of Cabaret at the Oscars this year where Fosse won Director over Coppola and Grey beat all the three supporting nominees from The Godfather. I don't think Pacino was in the right category though, but I guess they really were all over Brando and wanted to make sure that nobody (from his own film) could stop him from winning. Anyway, the film starts with Brando and he is certainly defining in the first 90 minutes of the movie until an assassination attempt happens and from that moment on he moves a bit into the background and the boys take over, most of all Pacino for whom it was really a star-making performance.<br/><br/>Now as for the plot, it is a cleanly structured film really. There is basically one affair after the next and many of these issues don't have to do a lot with the next. The movie starts at the godfather's daughter's wedding and there is not really too much focus on the actual wedding process, but instead we are taken into the world of crime right away when an old acquaintance asks a lethal favor from Don Corleone. Pretty memorable beginning really that has been spoofed in many other movies, even animated ones not too long ago. Not much later, there is of course the really famous longer sequence that results in a bloody horse head between the sheets. And they get longer and longer as next up is the key plot that involves the Turk turning into the main antagonist as he plans to kill the godfather, takes out his most brutal assistant at the same time and abducts his lawyer. And while the latter is also considered a son (not by blood), we also witness how the godfather's offspring deals with this situation in their own very unique ways. Sonny the hothead, Fredo the weakling who cannot protect his father whatsoever, Tom Hagen (the reasonable one) and eventually Mike whose role is not too clear early and who is far far away from becoming the man he turns out to be at the end of the movie. There is still more focus for him on his love relationship to his significant other and he says he is not like his family. But the attack on his father and later on the killing of one of his brothers really change everything and we find out he is just exactly like his dad. As for Hagen, I still think Duvall is really good in this movie and there is one very brief moment in this film when we hear Vito Corleone say something like somebody who is not Italian like them, which shows that Hagen is really accepted as a son and also seen as Italian pretty much, even if he is German/Irish. This would be one of the really rare funny moments, slightly funny I guess, this film has to offer. It is never about making the audience laugh admittedly, but more to witness the demise of the old man and the rise of the new star eventually and the crime and brutal murders that come with it. As for Michael, this of course also includes him losing his wife when he is in Italy. Had that murder not occurred maybe he never would have returned and the story could have taken a completely different path.<br/><br/>I think one of this film's biggest strengths is that despite the really big quantity of characters, even for a 3-hour movie, they are all fairly memorable with their quirks, mannerisms and backgrounds. Take McCluskey for example. The movie could have done completely without him and he is really only there to serve as support for the Turk, but still he is truly memorable. Actually, his little words on how he frisked hundreds of guys like Mike for guns is another somewhat funny moment. He has no idea what's coming his way. I also want to say a few words on Fredo. He is not as big as the others in here yet or actually he is not too far away either. His scenes are all memorable and he is really definition of weakness and incompetence in 1970s cinema. Of course, that is even more the case in the sequel where he plays an absolute key character. But in this one here, he is also vital really and you could write pages alone on his character and how he (re)acts. Truly sad really Cazale died so early, but he left us a truly remarkable character and honestly every film he made was a winner basically. Now another thing to add here is that it also the small moments that count. When Mike lies to Kay at the very end, we find out 100% where his priorities are now and that he won't let anything get in the way of keeping his father's empire intact. Another strength here is that Puzo and Coppola are not scared of killing off major characters and it works oh so well because it makes a whole lot of sense. Pay attention to the permanent contrast of new/young life vs. death towards the end. When Vito dies, there is nobody around him except his very young grandson and that still puts major focus on the family component that is oh so crucial here, also when Mike talks about somebody treating Fredo badly. Or the christening of course, which is the best example with the baby and the alleged goodness vs. all the killings that take place at the same time. Vito was gone and that point already and he had gotten soft anyway, but Mike is not scared one bit about blood on his hands to defend his family's honor. Overall, this is a tremendous movie and when we see the bodyguard guy close the door eventually between Mike and Kay, it is all clear. Mike has turned into his dad by then. And how things go on, you can watch in the second film that in my opinion (thanks to Bobby) is even better than the first, even if the majority does not disagree. But yeah as for this one here, it was the third time I watched it I think and it gets better with each viewing I suppose. It is a film you don't wanna miss out on. Highly recommended, really close call between Cabaret and this one for me when it comes to 1972's finest. I'd still go with Cabaret though I think. It is just as much of a masterpiece. And finally, also pay attention to all the minor references included in here that seem even more interesting if you know how the saga continues. This is also why it is so much worth rewatching. One example would be Vito swearing on his grandchildren's well-being. There's many more. Do not miss out and girls who read this don't trust people saying this is a film that will only or mostly appeal to males. If you like quality filmmaking, then there is no way you should not watch! Oh yeah, but obviously you need to be able to stomach the violence. Just one example, there's a guy shot in the eye through his glasses and we see the blood pouring from his head and that is far from the most violent stuff depicted in here. That's all, folks. Watch it, don't be scared by the running time. You will not ask yourself afterwards if this was really worth 3 hours of your time, but if you are ready immediately for another 3 hours, namely the sequel. I was lucky enough to watch this film on the big screen and I am already looking forward to an occasion to see the second (and third). Certainly pick this opportunity over a small television or laptop screen. If necessary, wait for the 50th anniversary when it certainly will be shown again in many theaters. Mobster filmmaking at its finest."

The acting once again was amazing and the story and how the movie went on just never got me bored. Everything in this movie was clearly beautiful. The ending by far was my favorite when there all sitting at the table talking. There were so many great scenes like Vito when he was younger, Fredo at the lake, and many many more.

","""The Godfather"" is a masterpiece. It shows the closeness, the warmth of family ties. The scenes are filled with wives and squalling babies, festive weddings and equally festive funerals, spaghetti prepared in the kitchen. There is the flavor of Italian home life that few gangster films have attempted. This is one of the biggest advantages of this movie. I mean that generally in all gangster movies we see that the main characters tell that the family is the most valuable and crucial thing in the life, however we only hear it in these movie, we don't see. In ""The Godfather"" we see a great work, were every detail indicates the cohesion of Corleone's family.
A GREAT THANKS for the CAST. Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone and Al Pacino as Michael Corleone. These are the characters that will never die. I think that the actors that are chosen for these characters are the best ones. Al Pacino perfectly played his role; the way he changed from military to mafia. We see the this change in his play. Also the way how 47 years old Marlon Brando changed into such a believable senior citizen to play Vito Corelone. Yes, of course, first of all it is because of the makeup, however, his play also played a big role. Also, we all understand that is harder to play with this kind of a makeup and Brando achieved this. In my opinion, no one except him could play this character.
Director Francis Ford Coppola, with a strong assist from cameraman Gordon Willis, has done an extraordinary job of capturing period and place. Very few of the New York exteriors appear to be stock shots; most have been recreated with an incredible attention to detail. Interiors have the rich, burnt-umber look of photographs taken decades ago; while the exteriors - whether representing a garden party in New Jersey or an amorous interlude in Sicily - are filled with color and sun.
Another great plus of this movie is its soundracks choice. A ""Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis"" billboard in Vegas or ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" on the soundtrack (while a gangster dons his bulletproof vest) also add their own wry grace notes to the passing years."

","It often happens that the director, when stating a picture, leaves the original and is engaged in arbitrariness. Francis Ford Coppola director is no less brilliant than the rest of the directors. He squeezed everything that can be learned from the novel Puzo and put it into the film. Doing nothing without adding something new or removing something from the book, Coppola and Puzo created a masterpiece. A masterpiece in everything. Mario Puzo's book became a masterpiece of literature, and Francis Ford Coppola created the film - a masterpiece, a film - a classic that just can not help but like it. Coppola not only superbly put the film, but simply brilliantly picked up the actors. Who knows what was the fate of the film without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Coppola skillfully created the atmosphere of New York at the end of the forties, but also the atmosphere of family life, the life of people from Sicily.<br/><br/>Vito Carleone is a wise and cruel man with clear principles, a loving but stern father. Marlon Brando was just awesome dona Carleone. His character is a serious strategist who has achieved power and respect himself. Don Carleone's sad gaze, his smooth gestures, his unique voice and his unforgettable ""bulldog jaw"" forever blended into the image of the viewer.<br/><br/>Don Carleone - this is Marlon Brando - sloven and lover in life, but on the screen - a genius who embodied the image of Don Carleone - a strong spirit of a man and a cruel gangster, who has enormous authority. Vito Carleone is a very impressive person who knew how to get others to do things their own way. Marlon Brando with his game was able to make the viewer believe that before him is not just an actor playing a role, but a real person is that same severe don. Brando is a great improvisator."

"TheNabOwnzz","9","0","1","30 April 2019"," An epic family ballad
","Whereas some films disregard immediate reality and seek to convey a certain message in its sub text, The Godfather is the kind of motion picture that seeks to bring forth reality exactly how it was, and does this by creating a kind of family bonding that is as near perfectly structured as it can be.<br/><br/>Of course, The Godfather still utilizes cinematic moments, and has one of the greatest character arcs in cinema ( Michael's ). The film starts with a wedding sequence of half an hour, all in which we are introduced into the world of the characters, and their respective business. We see Don Vito Corleone ( Marlon Brando ) calmly doubting the sincerity of an undertaker's request, we see Santino Corleone ( James Caan ) breaking a camera of a journalist, we see Michael Corleone ( Al Pacino ) being the one soul that seems to be absent from most of the family at that part, telling us the story of the characters and personalities wonderfully. Due to this extended opening sequence, we also get a feel for the brotherhood and warmth that the mob can also possess. It is, of course, a sad cover for what is to come afterwards, as The Godfather is also somewhat of a study on the self destructive nature of man, as nearly every character in the end pays for price for immorality.<br/><br/>The Godfather is one of the best acted films of all-time. Most of this is of course because of Marlon Brando, who is deliberately made up like a 'bulldog' to fit his personality. The mannerisms & voice are somehow exactly what one would think when thinking of the founder of a gigantic mob empire. There is not really a weak spot in the acting throughout the entire picture, but other standouts are James Caan & Robert Duvall. Of course Al Pacino also set himself on the map with this performance as the good hearted war hero transforms into the stoic and calculated don of the family. As stated before, the film is near perfectly structured, with events always coinciding with character ( Take the final scene of Michael in Italy for example, with his wife getting killed in the car bomb. This scene is only there to further disconnect Michael emotionally between his work and his life, further sending him down the dark path to becoming the Don ), being the result of one of the greatest screenplays of all-time.<br/><br/>The Godfather features cinematography befitting its subject, as a lot of shots are very scarcely lit. In particular the scenes indoors where the mob business is being discussed, the darkness makes sure that only the faces and the white parts of the outfit are shown, as they are mostly wearing black during these scenes. This was to emphasize how 'shady' the dealings of the mob were, and this darkness enhances this feeling in the audience.<br/><br/>The original score by Nino Rota is also one worthy of mention, as it perfectly encapsulates what this movie is about; friendship, family, beauty & tragedy. Being an Italian composer who has previously composed other (Italian) masterpieces such as The Leopard (1963) & Rocco and his Brothers (1960), he also manages to give the Godfather this italian atmosphere, further enhancing the immersion into the roots of this family.<br/><br/>In the end, The Godfather is mainly about Michael's slow ascent to the top of the ladder in the family. He doesn't want to have anything to do with the business of the family at first, but he feels compelled to act when assassins try to assassinate his father, feeling that he is the only one who can get close enough to his enemies to eliminate them, and after he has done so, the events he witnesses in italy cause him to develop an even more emotionally disconnected personality that makes him feel compelled to take his family's throne. By the end, there is a sequence which contrasts the baptism of Michael's new nephew with the simultaneous murder of all of his competition ( Other mob bosses ), in a stunning sequence of moral duality. While Bach's satanic score plays, and enhances in sound significantly when Michael is asked if he renounces Satan. One of the masterful scenes in a masterful film, it perfectly shows us his final personal descent into immorality & emotional disconnection.<br/><br/>The Godfather is an epic family ballad of themes and tragedies, while also being exceptionally well made. It features some of the best acting & writing of all-time, superbly darkly lit sets to enhance atmosphere and a fantastic original score while being near perfectly structured. All of which cements this as one of the world's greats of mob & rise to power movies."

At its core this film is about every pro and con of the mafia. It treats it as necessary evil, but also shows that even the good people in society can easily be corrupted by its power (this is more relevant in the film's fantastic sequel).

","2 word advice: watch it. Just watch it.<br/><br/>The rest of this review isnt a review, it is a tribute to one of the most impressive movies I have ever seen. And I have seen it many many times by now and it still stands strong to this very day.<br/><br/>Choose the restored version if you can. It has 4K images, beautiful picture quality! However great a classic this movie might be, the original movie wasnt preserved very well at all. Yes, it seems astounding to hear that such a great classic wasnt preserved with care by the filmstudio or the director himself, but when they wanted to restore the picture they literally had to search over the whole world to find parts of the original copies of this movie that were in good enough state to be used for the restoration version in 4K.<br/><br/>The photographer of The Godfather was Gordon Willis, famously called ""The master of Darkness"" ever since he made this classic, because of his extraordinary use of low lighting techiques with very deep colors of black and dark. Especially the opening scenes with Marlon Brando are masterful.<br/><br/>2 more things I want to mention which just mesmirise me time and again when I watch it. First, those eyes of Al Pacino. Those killershark eyes. Never before or after have I ever seen Al Pacino look so psychopatically stonecold as in The Godfather. Ofcourse Marlon Brando gets lauded for his excellent performance, but Brando oozes sympahty with his kind looks. Al Pacino just is a killer personified. It freaks me out again and again, he has become the ultimate personification of the ruthless businesslike killer mentality of the mob.<br/><br/>Last but not least, I wanna applaud the soundtrack, that mesmirising soundtrack. Anybody knows it. I have heard it a zillion times and it gives me goosebumps time and again. Not of this earth, so beautiful. And that can be said as well of this entire magnificent classic: unprecedented power and beauty. BRAVO! BRAVO! BRAVO!"

","This is a very good film, with well drawn and engaging characters. It is also impeccably acted which coupled with Coppola's eye for detail really helps the world feel authentic. The script's biting criticism of American capitalism is well done and subtle. It is perhaps too subtle because people tend to miss it upon first viewing.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the notion that is the best that Hollywood has to offer is nonsense. While the film is is structured as a punitive plot Michael only get his just dessert is Part 3 of the saga. Morally, this film is incomplete until Michael dies along. I would not go so far as to say this film makes evil look good. But both does it straddle the line between making characters you can relate too and character you like. Vito, especially, is a bit too charismatic.<br/><br/>The film is is actually rather rough in places. The hospital scene has a slapped dash quality to it; the wedding sequence has multiple warts in terms of night for day shooting, continuity, deep focus framing etc. Likewise some of the action (i.e. Sonny's beatdown) is stagy and false. On the whole it is exceedingly well directed but Coppola's inexperience (or studio pressure) shows up in places.<br/><br/>This is a very good film. It is not the transcendent experience I was expecting."

"Badmoviessuck","9","0","1","28 December 2018"," A wonderful movie
","This movie is good in my opinion and it's really different from any movie i have watched.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS
There is a lot of characters in this movie and they give the side characters the screen time they deserve.
Micheal is truly a compelling character.
And he has an amazing character arc.
In the beginning he isn't really involved with the family and their buisness but when his father got shot five times he chooses to be apart of the gang and kill Sollozos and at that moment he changes as a character slowly.
He goes to another country to not get into trouble he marries a girl and that girl dies and Sonny dies and those death i think slowly changes him as a character cause he get to learn how it is when you are apart of the mafia thus having a responsibility to be the new godfather.
When i first watched that part i didn't understand why they added that part in the movie but now i do it's all because they want to develop the characters there is a reason for everything when it comes to this movie.
When they showed that scene where Connie gets abused by Carlo is because they wanted to kill off Carlo so that people will think it's Micheal thus adding to his character.
Sonny dying is to show how hot headed angry and simple minded he is and if you are not careful then there will be consequences.<br/><br/>VERDICT
When i first watched it i didn't understand why they put certain parts in the movie but now i understand that it all makes sense.
They choose character over plot and it made this movie one of the greatest piece of cinema ever created and it has inspired me and made me think of movies in different way.
I would 100% rewatch it"

"FilmLiquet","8","0","1","23 December 2018"," Film Liquet on The Godfather
","This criminal drama focuses on a powerful Italian-American mafia family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). After his daughter's wedding he refuses to make a deal with a new drug lord in the area, which leads to him getting shot by a rival family, who is now in a deal with the said drug lord. Following these events, the youngest son of the family (Al Pacino), leaves his civilian status and joins the Mafia, becoming involved in the ever-going family business, made of violence and betrayal.<br/><br/>Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, the lighting and cinematography are the first things that you notice throughout the film. The use of light and shadows, combined with precise framing makes this film unique, almost like Francis Coppola adopted a different style for this particular film. The menacing sound track makes sure to put the viewers on edge, seemingly making the protagonists even more menacing and scary in the eyes of the audience, as the mafia should be like. Being one of the best performances of Al Pacino, the aesthetic of the film only adds to the dark world of mafia orientated New York.<br/><br/>The film itself is a good illustration of the post-war America in 1945 to 1955, so if you like me, are a sucker for post war America, you'll be pleased by the film's look at the very least.<br/><br/>Follow us on instagram!

The murders are not unnecessarily gory or lengthy, but their startling abruptness and the expressions of horror on the victims' faces make these images unforgettable. The violence always has gravity. There is brief nudity and sex, and a few curse words.

","Picture quality is criminally underrated in this film. The balance between the darkness and light, including it in every scene and the way it was used was absolutely class. The way it depicted it the characters, showing the evil that they possess alongside the good, the way that Coppola wanted was done near to perfection. A risk a lot of directors and producers wouldn't have taken due to the movie picture turning out horribly wrong and then having to re-shoot the whole movie again along with added costs. The way that the movie flowed on the screen was done really well. Went at a slightly methodical pace which was pivotal in telling the story. The scene when Vito speaks to the guy in the opening scene to help his daughter is one for the ages and when Michael kills Sollozo and McClusky in the restaurant in New jersey might be one of the best character changes/breakthroughs ever. To be critical as well of the film, even though the general pace of the film was good to tell the story, the wedding scene went on for a bit too long for my liking, but it's understandable as they had too in order to portray the main characters for the story. A lot of movies have this problem for me, it just seems to be a general thing with films. Alongside that, Diane Keaton really didn't to the character of Kay any justice, her acting being as bad as it was, was magnified due to the great performances put in by Brando (Vito), Pacino (Michael Corleone)), Duvall (Tom Hagen), Caan (Sonny Corleone)), Castellano (Clemenza) and Cazale (Fredo Corleone)."

","Well! it is a legend! The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name.
It stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.
Paramount Pictures obtained the rights to the novel for the price of $80,000, before it gained popularity. Studio executives had trouble finding a director; their first few candidates turned down the position. They and Coppola disagreed over who would play several characters, in particular, Vito and Michael. Filming took place on location, primarily around New York and in Sicily, and was completed ahead of schedule. The musical score was principally composed by Nino Rota, with additional pieces by Carmine Coppola.
The film was the highest-grossing film of 1972 and was for a time the highest-grossing film ever made.
It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando) and Best Adapted Screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola). Its seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall (Best Supporting Actor), and Coppola for Best Director.
The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema and one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre, It was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1990, being deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" and is ranked the second-greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute. It was followed by sequels The Godfather Part 2 (1974) and The Godfather Part 3 (1990).

The film had great cinematography, using appropriate colors for each scene's tone. The film's score also resonated well with the scenes it was played in.

But not the best movie for Marlon Brando. No, there is no ""Apocalypse Now"" neither! By far Brando is much better in: ""Morituri"" (1965),
""Candy"" (1968) and, absolutely phenomenal (especially in the scene when he's talking to his wife's dead body) in ""Last Tango in Paris""(1972). All the other actors are super exceptional: James Caan, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, John Marley, Richard S. Castellano, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, John Cazale, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Morgana King (Mother Corleone). But, in my opinion, the best actor in the movie is Al Lettieri in the role of Sollozzo."

","I just watched this on Netflix. Can't remember if i'd ever seen it but that's a good thing. I could compare it to modern cinema in a fresh way and I must say, despite the 3 hour length I was captivated the whole way through! Al Pacino and Brando brought this one home."
"clifford-82579","10","0","2","13 October 2018"," The Godfather
","I was first introduced to The Godfather during the summer of 2017. I had expected an action packed, lighthearted flick, but received something much more unforgettable. Although the plot is somewhat convoluted, the messages of the American Dream and freedom are shown clearly. In the film, The Godfather, the director, Francis Ford Coppola, brings the movie alive and makes the movie memorable through visual aids, symbols, and music. <br/><br/> One of the first things the audience notices about The Godfather is its contrasts between light and dark. The walls of the Godfather's study are often black, with only minimal light shown on the faces and torsos. The light usually comes from a half opened blind. This is the world of the Godfather, Vito Corleone. However, Don Corleone's family is basked in light. They are often depicted outdoors with girls in gorgeous, sometimes gaudy, dresses. The men keep with the tradition of wearing dark suits and tuxedoes, but there is no lasting darkness near their persons. In these outdoor scenes, there is a zest for life in these scenes, heightened by the talks of brilliant futures and brilliant loves. Strangely contrasting to the brightness is the sedate quietness and darkness of the Godfather. In time, the readers will realize that Vito Corleone is the driving force behind the life of his family. <br/><br/> Corleone is also the driving force behind the family's American Dreams. One particularly interesting thing about the Godfather is the size of his circle of friends. Many people come to him for help. Therefore, he is protecting everyone's American Dreams. In fact, this idea is presented most clearly in one of the beginning scenes. Amerigo Bonasera, a minor character, goes to Don Corleone to seek justice for his daughter, who was assaulted. Bonasera claims to believe in the ""American process,"" where justice is always achieved. He fervently tells Corleone that he believes America is a paradise, somewhere all dreams can happen. Bonasera expects the Godfather to help him reach those dreams. Perhaps because of that responsibility, the Godfather is neither good nor evil. He only protects his family and friends. It is true that Don Corleone does many horrible things. However, through these twisted methods, he always benefits the people who ask him for help. People will forever argue about the light and evil in the Godfather, but one thing they could never argue about is his motives.<br/><br/> I was enthralled by the filming techniques applied by the Coppola, the director. Coppola is able to convey emotions, not only through actors and scripts, but also scenery. A part of The Godfather was filmed in the Italian countryside. Therefore, the movie is filled with gorgeous panoramic shots of nature. It gives the movie a sense of wildness and freedom that The Godfather tries to show the audience. It also shows the poverty that the Corleone family escaped from. This makes the wealth that Don Corleone built in America even more impressive. The audience realizes the determination and wits that are needed to move a family into another country.<br/><br/> The music, haunting Italian folk songs, of the movie is also outstanding. The audience is unable to forget the roots of the Corleone family. This is something that Michael Corleone, the second son of Vito Corleone and the main character of the movie, wishes to forget. The farther he moves away from his family and his father, the more desperately the music pulls him back, until he is sent to Italy. In the Corleone Village, Michael is immersed in his family's culture. This is one way music is powerful in The Godfather. As the family of the Godfather is made totally American by their pursuance of the American Dream, the Italian folk songs remind the audience that their roots are really in Italy.<br/><br/> The recurring theme among negative movie reviews of The Godfather is that people had expected more. They had heard from their friends about how great The Godfather is, but the actual movie was overestimated. With this I must disagree. Everyone should keep an open mind when first introduced to a movie. No one should go into a movie with preconceived notions about what the movie is supposed to be like because that is unfair to both the audience and the movie itself. Another point that movies critics often make about The Godfather is that it romanticizes crime. The Godfather also romanticizes the American Dream. This movie is an exaggerated depiction of reality. The Godfather is great for its plot, but it is even more amazing because it is memorable. People will always remember this movie for its filming techniques, themes of the American Dreams, and unforgettable music."

","I am not going to get into extensive detail on how great this film is, hundreds if not thousands before me have already done so and to good credit. As a Hollywood director has once previously stated on another non-Godfather film commentary track, watching the film is a cinema class in of its self... if you are going to watch only one film in your life, it is this one. I must agree, I watch this film repeatedly, not only to be entertained but also to study as a filmmaker myself. 
Obviously the many directors who turned down the assignment to direct this adapted script had a strong moral objection to glorify the mafia, and I agree, there is absolutely ""nothing"" glamorous about real life gangsters in organized crime. But this is a fictional tale and Coppola used his own strong Italian American heritage to infuse the film with far greater themes and family bonding than any of the other directors originally approached would have done. He raised this film from the exploitative gangster flick that it was slotted to be by the studio, even wanting to change the novel's 1940's setting to modern day to save money on the budget, to that of Shakespearian levels and the best example of film art in Hollywood films. Coppola well deserved the Oscar, fame and the money that followed the film's release, in my opinion anyway.
Perhaps it is because I saw this film as a youngster and accepted the film as is, as many others I watched, good and cheesy, but watching it even now there doesn't seem to be a single bad shot or angle in the entire film, except one.... Diane Keaton's false ""double-take"" reaction to the exploded vehicle in the back ground when she is confronted by Tom as she returns to the Mall to see Michael. It always takes me out of the film."

","A good develpoing gangster movie but too slow for my taste"
"Prashast_Singh","7","0","1","22 July 2018"," I didn't expect this: the synopsis kinda deceived me. Still liked it.
","The fact that it was ranked even above THE DARK KNIGHT and that it was also praised on a widespread scale compelled me to check it out. The film, in short, was too long; the first half was very slow and just one sequence before the beginning of the second half where the film actually picked up pace. The performances of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are the sole reason for watching the film, if for nothing else. <br/><br/>But sadly, the film didn't come near THE DARK KNIGHT (though I shouldn't compare them as TDK is an action film) or THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. THE GODFATHER was just a different type of gangster film which felt more like a family story, and that's great. Normally, I have seen very less gangster themed movies about family issues. Seeing a film like this seemed good as the film started on a decent note. But as the subplots started crept in, I felt underwhelmed. Moreover, the synopsis written here tricked me because I was waiting for that to happen. Had the film jumped to that thing early, the story could've not been very but still quite different. <br/><br/>But fine, let's leave that because it's the mistake of the one who wrote that thing. Even I kept wondering what actually was the actual story of the film for the first 2 hours. Added to that, we had some serious pacing issues as mentioned above. 3 hours is too long for a movie like this. What took almost an hour and a half to happen could've been wrapped up in just half an hour or just even an hour. <br/><br/>Performances are the redeeming feature of the film, but not all of them click. The actress who portrays Connie delivers a terrible performance, especially towards the end, when her dialogue delivery turns too laughable to handle. Also, there is some action which kicks in after long. But the fact that the director was more focused on the character development and other aspects shows up in the form of some ridiculous kicks and blows. Even though it's not too much in the film, it's just too funny sometimes that it ends up deviating a bit.<br/><br/>It's hard to watch a film like this without taking a break. But what is special is that the film almost didn't bore me at all. One heartwarming sequence involving the godfather and his grandson touched my heart. There were no other such scenes but still the film seemed pretty good to me and the ending, poetic. Marlon Brando's performance was class apart and seemed to drive the film alone.<br/><br/>I liked the film because it did grip me and some shootings, twists excited me. But by the time it ended, it left me wanting for more even though in this long duration it had already given way too much. I'll not really say that it's overrated, but as of today's times, it's just a decent watch. Not memorable enough."

The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film.

","This movie is widely considered in the community of film critics to be a landmark in motion picture history and is rightfully so ranked up there with Citizen Kane and Casablanca as one the best movies in history. The lines are iconic, the scenes of family, betrayal and violence are all memorable, the performances are beyond Oscar worthy and it does what any great adaptation does; stay as faithful to the original as possible and only make changes whenever necessary. For me the most iconic scene is the baptism murders, which I fell are appropriately edited as Michael Corleone oversees the baptism of his infant son. The only minor nitpick I have is that, although Marlon Brando does give a solid performance, the look they gave him is a little too much like a geezer for me to believe he is a Mafia don. Nonetheless, this is a film that anyone taking a cinema class should watch."

"justinurbas","10","0","1","23 March 2017"," Good one
","With several million hardcover and paperback books acting as trailers, Paramount's film version of Mario Puzo's sprawling gangland novel, ""The Godfather,"" has a large pre-sold audience. This will bolster the potential for the film which has an outstanding performance by Al Pacino and a strong characterization by Marlon Brando in title role. It also has excellent production values, flashes of excitement, and a well-picked cast. But it is also overlong at about 175 minutes (played without intermission), and occasionally confusing. While never so placid as to be boring, it is never so gripping as to be superior screen drama. This should not mar Paramount's b.o. expectations in any measure, though some filmgoers may be disappointed."

","this was one of the best movies by far. I researched that this was one of the best blockbusters selling point. Although the movie is great no matter what day and age you watch it. I don't think it will be a great idea to try to remake this movie . The old gangster movie is represented by Richard Conte and Sterling Hayden in bit parts. I would love to see another movie like this that is based out in Hollywood like this movie. If you read the book you would understand why there's so many books and movies and most movies don't stand toe and toe with the book but this one did. This is a old movie way before my time but the thrill and the envy of all the characters , family love it make you keep wanting to keep watching."
"opieandy-1","6","0","1","23 November 2016"," Quantity Does Not Equal Quality
","I guess the same kind of folks who made The Sopranos one of the highest-rated TV shows in history made this film a 9.2 on IMDb. I sure don't get it. I think there is also a slight bias towards rating longer movies higher. Quantity does not equal, or compensate for the lack of, quality.<br/><br/>Star-studded cast? Check. Outstanding director? Check. Dramatic and compelling plot? No.<br/><br/>A drama should be dramatic. It should be compelling. We should care about the outcome. This film achieved none of those objectives.<br/><br/>Some have lauded it as a fantastic sketch of organized crime. I suppose if you think of it more as a fictional docudrama, maybe your expectations would allow you to enjoy it more.<br/><br/>The only compelling aspect of the film was the progression of Michael Corleone. The movie did bring that full circle, and I will dance around the details here to avoid spoilers. Nevertheless, that one somewhat interesting aspect was not enough to redeem the movie. And even in that aspect, the film did nothing to make the viewer CARE about Michael or why he evolved as he did.<br/><br/>About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.<br/><br/>My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very Good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding.

","As opposed to focusing on everything that is incredible about The Godfather, a much simpler route for me to judge its quality is on what is terrible about it. Practically every film has something that I don't care for about it, however I can genuinely say that I wouldn't transform anything about The Godfather. There is nothing feeble about it and nothing that emerges as terrible. That is the reason it gets ten out of ten.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that made me ask why I hadn't seen it before. The acting from everybody included is awesome, Marlon Brando runs over impeccably as the leader of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are brilliant as his children. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is additionally extremely important, bringing back recollections of the film each time I hear it. The plot must be incredible for it to get ten out of ten, and it will be, it's a long way from unsurprising and the film is the meaning of an awesome epic.<br/><br/>The film is really stunning in the way every passing happens momentarily, and as it traverses ten years such a large number of various things happen and each moment of it is extraordinary amusement. It's a well-made and engaging film that is just the initial segment of a set of three, however it remains all alone as an awesome film in its own particular right. In the event that you haven't seen it, what are you sitting tight for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disillusion."

","""Godfather"" is consider one of the greatest film of all time in my opinion because of the plot, the visuals, the characters and the overall theme of the film. I love the fact that paramount pretty much went against almost everything Francis hand in mind for his vision down the casting. They didn't even agreed with some of the shot and artistic vision he had for his film but and went on to do amazing things, breaking records ad setting new ones. It did great in the box office that year and it went on to become the greatest film of all time. Not only did the film inspired filmmakers like my self but it paved the way for Mafia films in general. Ironically Francis him self became in his own right a godfather in the world of Mafia film. I also enjoyed watching how the characters in the film changed towards the ending of the film. Each character had a transition moment and my favorite was when Michael agreed to join the family business. In doing so he became the don at the end."

","Godfather is awesome. It is one of the movies which inspired me to give time to my family. As the Godfather has said, ""a man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real men"", this movie made me think that family is so important. No matter what is your business, you must spend time with your family. And don't even ask me about the acting. Marlon Brando is really a Godfather. His acting was one of the best of all times. And this movie is the reason that I started watching Al Pacino's movies. He is the greatest actor I have ever seen. He is a legend.

Its a rarity when a film is firing on all cylinders; from story, cast, cinematography, editing, directing, etc. Francis Ford Coppolla gives us such a beautifully crafted story that its easy to miss some of the wonderfully subtitle (yet so grand) acting going on within it. Marlon Brando is something to behold as he plays one of the most iconic characters in film history. A man responsible for such terrible things, and yet you're rooting for him in almost every scene. The way he pushes his character to the brink of madness in the most subtle of ways should be a textbook for future actors. For anyone that is a fan of the ""gangster"" film genre its a must-see.

","The Godfather, the first film in the franchise, was released on March 15, 1972. The feature-length film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based upon Mario Puzo's novel of the same name. The plot begins with Don Vito Corleone declining an offer to join in the narcotics business with notorious drug lord Virgil Sollozzo, which leads to an assassination attempt. Meanwhile, Vito's oldest son Sonny takes over the family and Michael strikes back for the assassination attempt by killing Sollozzo and a corrupted police captain, forcing Michael to go to Sicily in hiding. While in Sicily, Michael travels around the country and meets a young woman whom he marries, but who is eventually killed in a car bombing. Michael returns to America after the news of his brother Sonny's murder. After returning, Vito turns over the reins of the family to Michael. Michael plans to move the family business to Las Vegas; but before the move, he plots the killing of the heads of the five families on the day of his nephew's baptism. Other subplots include Vito's daughter's abusive marriage, Johnny Fontaine's success in Hollywood, and Vito's second oldest son Fredo's role in the family business in Las Vegas."

","One the greatness movies of cinema. Amazing, anything is better there. One of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes, The Godfather gets everything right; not only did the movie transcend expectations, it established new benchmarks for American cinema. The early life and career of Vito Corleone in 1920s New York is portrayed while his son, Michael, expands and tightens his grip on his crime syndicate stretching from Lake Tahoe, Nevada to pr-revolution 1958 Cuba. Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi- generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" ."

","The Godfather, is most people's favourite film, and arguably one of the best films ever made. However, I only saw it in 2015 for the first time, so my impression of it is different to those who have grown up with it. I thought the film was brilliant, some really powerful performances and many huge stars now in their youth; Diane Keaton, Al Pacino and James Caan. The film has not aged well, but is still gripping and interesting, and in place visceral and emotional. James Caan as the protective older brother was memorable but of course Marlon Brando stands out as the much parodied, copied and admired main character to whom everyone defers. As I said, the film has dated and his prosthesis padded mouth doesn't look so good as I imagine it did when first released, and the make-up on Pacino was also distractingly bad. The film jumps forward in time quickly, and doesn't explain anything, as films are wont to do more latterly, which is refreshing, and the plot is complex enough to require full attention, and whilst it's not a laugh a minute ""enjoyable"" film, or about subject matter which is pleasant, is bloody and violent, it is worth watching and certainly one of cinema's most brilliant masterpieces. I think my impression of this film is lessened by the fact that I didn't see it for until now so didn't have the loyalty to ""The Family"" that longtime watchers have, when they've grown up with it, but it was amazing to finally see the original from which many other films have taken their cue or inspiration."

The reason why I believe that this scene could have done better, was because the lighting may have worked in some instances such as trying to create an eerie lighting effect.

","OK so The Godfather is an entertaining movie. OK, so it has some nice music, decent acting, and a gripping plot. All in all, I'm secure enough to state that it is an OK movie. <br/><br/>However, the fact that it is rated 9.2 out of 10, and on #2 spot in the top IMDb movie list requires some analysis. Deep analysis on this simple question: is this movie really better than the 100,000 or so other movies in IMDb? Better yet, is there something wrong with humanity if a movie about sick, violent, greedy, vengeful, hateful people gets a #2 spot? <br/><br/>My answer to this last question is, sadly, yes. Well, at least for the bulk of humanity: individually, there is no problem to rate this movie 10/10 (in fact, there is but hey, I'm putting it into perspective here), because it is fairly entertaining. But the fact that statistically it has been rated so high shows you about the sad and devious nature of people. <br/><br/>I, for one, have rated at least 200 movies higher than The Godfather, and I am proud of it, because I cannot convince myself that a film which tells you the story of people with the lowest possible moral can be one of the best I've seen.

"jarbh","9","0","1","27 July 2015"," A Movie You Can't Refuse
","The world works differently in 1940's New York City, especially if you were a Sicilian. The Godfather, in all its twists and turns that coincide with the style of living in the mafia, sets itself aside from all other gangster/mob/mafia movies by providing a transformation unlike any other. This change, however, comes from an individual that you, as a watcher, wouldn't want it to come from, until you do. The hook is in the constant re-occurrence of the meaning of loyalty to an Italian.<br/><br/>Advice for first time viewers: watch with someone who has seen it before, because you will get lost at some points and will need the legal and mafia jargon explained."

","This Film is almost 3 hours long! I like the story, acting by Al Pacino and Marlon Brando but after I watch this movie on my TV for 1 hour, I start to look at my phone. The spoiler in which Vito Corleone died is dramatic( Which is a good thing). But after I watch this movie, I have mixed feeling, whether I felt happy that Michael take over the Corleone family or should feel bad after for the past 2+ hours that some of the character died in the end. But still, good effort by the director himself. When I think that when critics and people think that this is the best film of all time, I have some doubts about it, maybe other films like the wizard of oz or Forrest Gump might be better."

Marlon Brando is easily at his best in this movie. Along with several other actors. A must watch for all movie buffs. Especially the fans of crime drama genre. The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment.

","Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family ""business."""

","Till watching this movie I was confused which is the best movie I have seen, but after watching this movie I got answer that this is not only my favorite but also world's best movie ever made.<br/><br/>There are many characters in movie so people get confused and say movie was boring. Actually they don't understand the deepness of characters. Also there are many people who said ""we liked this movie at second watch"" because at first watch they did not adjust themselves with many movie characters. There are many characters and every character has his/her story. Story of movie is flawless and exceptional. Dialogues of movie are still considered as best movie dialogues in film industry. Everyone appreciated acting of Brando, Pacino, Duvall, but acting by James Caan (Sonny), John Cazale (Fredo), Diane Keaton (Kay), Richard Costellano (Clemenza) and also Sollozzo, Carlo Rizzi, Connie were also very good. Direction was also very good. Also watch the style of actors, watch when Brando moves his hand for signifying that give water to Bonasera. Also watch Pacino's acting in the restaurant, like he was hurt from inside and would do anything to save the attempt on his father or family. Movie is based on book written by Mario Puzo. I have also read the book and it is also very good and flawless like movie. And listen the music given by Nino Rota, masterpiece. The best thing of movie is Michael was innocent boy who didn't want to mix up in his family business, but when danger things come to your family , you have to take the commands, forget everything and save your family. And last thing I want to add is, if you don't get the movie in first watch, don't comment anything, watch the movie second time, understand the characters. You will like the movie. And 9.2 is less ratings, movie deserves 9.5 or more. It deserves first place not second."

","The Godfather is generally considered one of the greatest films of all time. In my opinion this stands, however it is nowhere near perfect. Most of the acting is very good, such as Marlon Brando's and Robert Duvall's performances, however Al Pacino's and Diane Keaton's performances are lacking. Talia Shire and James Caan give good performances, but not as remarkable as Brando's. The atmosphere of the movie is aided by the darkness in some of the settings, particularly those of the house. The film, on the other hand, is slightly too long . Some of the scenes could have been cut, and some sequences shortened, and the result would have been better. All in all this is a spectacular movie, which I urge you to see, but it is somewhat flawed."

You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.<br/><br/>John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants. <br/><br/>The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.<br/><br/>Do not miss this film!"

Not that I despise movies that run for this long, because some certainly do have the content to keep that run time entertaining. This one, however, gets boring and slow at times. When I say this, I am mostly referring to the Marlon Brando dialogue scenes. I cannot get over the way the words fall out of his mouth as he mumbles them. Why he did his dialogue like this, I have no idea. If there was a reason for it, I stand by my rating.

When Corleone, against the advice of Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), refuses to intervene in the drug business, the head of another band ordered his assassination. Then begins a violent and bloody war between Mafia families.

Lets Begin, The Film The Godfather Starts In The Wedding Of The Daughter Of Vito Or Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) Were Not So Much Violence Happens But Mainly Presents The Cast. I Wont Lie The First 0:43 Minuets Of The Film Were Not As Good As The 2:14 Hours To Follow But A Major Plot Point Comes In That Time So Its Important. The First Half Of The Film is About The Corleone's Regular Days, But All That Changes When SPOILER ALERT: Don Corleone Is Nearly Killed From Another Mafia Who Already Killed An Other Character Luca Brasi Which Changes Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) From A Good Man To The Mafia Man He Never Wanted To Become. After Michael And His Brothers Fredo And Sonny Take Charge Over The Family Until They're Dad Comes Back, They Have A Meal With A Police Officer Who Broke Michaels Jaw, Michael Shoots The Cop And His Bodyguard What Causes The Second Half Of The Film When Michael Must Fly To Italy And He Stays There For Two Years Which All Contain Him Falling In Love, Getting Marred, Finding Out His Brother Sonny Was Killed, Wanting To Go Back To New York And Having His Wife Be Killed By One Of His Bodyguards. After Michaels Wife Is Killed He Returns To New York There He Meets His Ex Girlfriend Katherine (Diane Keaton) Who He Ends Up Marring And Having A Child With. There Is A Part In The Film Were You See Don Corleone Back On His Feet Talking To Michael And That For Me Is Were His Acting As The Don Really Shins And That Is Were His Character Really Connected To Me And Made Him One Of The Best Characters Of All Time For Me. One Of The Saddest Parts In The Film Is Around The End And Huge SPOILER ALERT Here This Is Big: In A Scene You See Don Corleone And Michaels Son Playing Around The Garden When All Of A Sudden Don Corleone Falls To The Ground And Dies And In That Scene You Can Really Feel The Sadness And Are Even More Sad When Michaels Son Keeps Spraying Don With Water And Dose Not Know His Dead. There Are Few Scenes That Thrilled Me As Much As The Baptising Scene In ""The Godfather"" Were You See Michael And His Wife Come To The Church To Become The Godparents Of Constanzia The Daughters Son And In That Scene You Can Also See Michaels First Acts As Leader Of The Corleone Family Which Includes Killing Of The Leader Of The Mafia Who Tried To Kill His Dad And More Stuff Of That Type An Is Just Incredible And Amazing.

"clouds88","9","0","3","20 December 2014"," An Epic!
","There are some movies which cannot be reviewed. We can all have our opinions, but we cannot rate them. These are the movies which go beyond the ratings and awards. The Godfather (1 and 2) is one such movie(s). To give a rating to these two movies would be an insult to its creators and I am not making any attempt to do so. These are two legendary movies, each an epic, a magnum opus for all other 'Don' movies.<br/><br/>Thus, I present here some of my views and scenes from the two movies that touched my heart.<br/><br/>Right movie from the beginning of the movie, the music is haunting. It pulls you towards itself, like the fatal attraction of parvana to the shama. Marlon Brando is characteristic. There has never been another Don in history so charming, honorable and one who is also a true family man. A Don who respects his friends and never forgets a favor.<br/><br/>The transformation of Al Pacino from the distant lad who says ""That's my father, Kate, not me"" to the emotional son beside his father in the hospital ensuring him ""I am with you now"" to ultimately the unprecedented words pronounced by him ""I am working for my father now"" underlines the storyline.<br/><br/>Some of my favorite dialogues by the movie are: ""A man who doesn't spend time with his family, can never be a real man."" ""I never ask for a second favor when I have been refused the first."" ""Don't tell me you're innocent, because it exhausts my intelligence."" ""Don't ever take sides with anyone against your family."" ""Women and children can be careless but not men."" The distress look on Brandon's face when he finds out his war hero son is invariably pulled into the underworld business, the silent tears of acknowledgement when he hears the news of his other son's murder and simply says ""I want no acts of vengeance"" shows that some actors don't need big dialogues to act.<br/><br/>The final stages between father and son are beautifully portrayed. A concerned father advising his son, the last person he thought would be his successor. And the dutiful son consoling his dad that ""We'll get there"".<br/><br/>The music is not just background score but also underlines the essence of the movie. Attentions to details like the steady flow of water, chirping of the birds, are hard to ignore.<br/><br/>The climax of the movie where he lies with so much conviction to his beloved wife completes the transformation of Al from a civilian to the head of the Corleone family."

","In a college level FILM 249 course Fall 2014, we studied the film ""The Godfather"". What I suggest a viewer watch for during the film is oranges and the color orange. The purpose or reasoning behind the director's inclusion of this may be to foreshadow any danger or violence. In multiple instances throughout the movie an orange or the color orange is seen with or on someone that is involved in a violent act. For example, there is a bowl of oranges in front of Woltz at dinner and he wakes up with a horse head in between his legs. Another example is when Don Corleone is shot multiple times he topples to the ground, spilling a produce setup of oranges."

Every character is complex, but I think my favourite must be Sonny. A hot headed son who is expected to take the reigns of the family one day, in spite of older brother Fredo. I was a kid when it came out but I would love to see it on the big screen. I also find the ages of the actors interesting... Pacino and Caan were very close in age despite Caan as being portrayed as years older. Duvall is actually considerably older than those two. And Abe Vagota is the oldest living cast member."

","An acclaimed film that deserves its acclaim, The Godfather validates the crime epic and explores the dark side of the American dream. The Godfather is simply a classy production; unlike the mass of movies, most of which can each be criticized on some level, The Godfather manages to engage its audience throughout, and the portrayals of Brando, Pacino and Duvall, to name a few, were instant classics. Moreover, the film is memorable, in particular for its performances, assured direction and insightful depiction of the corridors of power of the American Mafia (not to mention it's extremely quotable).

","I admire the way authors and directors have fun with their readers and viewers by including scenes of great dramatic impact that are completely unexplained.<br/><br/>The Godfather has a perfect example in the 'horse's head in bed' vignette. Implicitly we are required to believe that intruders armed with equipment to decapitate a stallion in the prime of life breezed into the stable block of what was presumably a fortified estate belonging to a movie mogul. Khartoum is somehow subdued without startling the other horses, stable lads, nightwatchmen, burglar alarms etc. His head is severed with stealth and silence. Then the slaughterers break into the movie producer's house and make their way to his bedroom, carrying the bleeding head with them. <br/><br/>After what has already been accomplished there's no problem in placing the head under the duvet at the foot of the bed and smearing blood all over the slumberer's pyjamas, hands and face without waking him. Whistling a happy tune, perhaps, the horse butchers, recruited from afar at a moment's notice, make their exit without difficulty or detection.<br/><br/>More nominations please for the most outrageous, impossible scene in a vaguely serious movie. I give this only 9.9 out of 10 to leave the slightest of breathing spaces for anything even more improbable."

","The late great Gordon Willis changed cinematographer forever in this classic film. Ordinarily during this time, an eye light was routinely used on the lead actor in order to better expose the eyes: an important part of the performance. To the dismay of the studio executives, Willis decided to let Marlon Brando's eyes fall into shadow, creating an ominous cinematographic look that is indelibly inscribed into the consciousness of filmmakers. Since his contribution to cinematography, we now embrace a much more naturalistic approach to lighting which has allowed for interesting photography to flourish.<br/><br/>Rest in Peace, Gordon Willis."

","Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, THE GODFATHER is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release. Nino Rota's score, the sumptuous set design, and Brando's raspy pseudo-whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory.<br/><br/>The film possesses an operatic quality, yet it's more understated than it is flamboyant. It takes its subjects seriously, bestowing legitimacy upon the internecine power struggles of the Mafia normally reserved for classical themes in high art. The film's release initiated a period when American filmmakers dared to take themselves and their artistic ambitions seriously (perhaps too seriously). There is something deeply resonant in the film's treatment of filial piety, the need for respect, and our culture's abiding interest in the parallel moral universe of the Mafia."

","When reviewing a classic masterpiece like the Godfather, it is hard to believe that there is still something left to say. Well, to me , movies are all about performances and how a viewer can relate to a character. I am fascinated with actors. Marlon Brando has showed us that in order to be believable one has to search deep down his soul even look for a crazy version of himself in order to deliver a believable character. Directors should give the freedom to the actor to deliver a character that has to come somewhere from within the actor himself. Any judge of talent in an audition will tell you that a performer has to lay down his emotions on the floor and be true to himself so that the audience can feel his truth and relate to it. Marlon Brando has just showed us what acting is all about. The Godfather is now , thanks to Marlon, a man who knows that by lifting a finger his will shall be executed and the ""scum who ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day""...Marlon Brando doesn't need to convince us how powerful the Godfather is, we are already convinced , he won us in just a few lines. Now we believe he is trying to bring Bonasera back to the ""family"" under his power and to the business of trading ""services"". The magic of the Godfather is right here and there."

I remember the ending most vividly: a bloody battle on the top of a hill where two armies clashed, apparently led by a man and a woman inside cyborgs or some kind of robotic vehicle. These two seemed to share a history (fling?? / siblings??) and confronted each other beside a nearby river. They both died. The movie ended tragically with a shot of the great tree on the top of the hill, surrounded by corpses of both armies.. <br/><br/>The only other thing I recall is a young man and a woman that spent the night in a house and in the morning the woman transformed in a butterfly and flew away.

","Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.<br/><br/>The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.<br/><br/>Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.<br/><br/>But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.<br/><br/>To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.<br/><br/>But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.<br/><br/>Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).<br/><br/>Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film."

","'Mafia' - whenever the word hits the mind, a bewildering aura or gesture accumulates the thoughts and forces the urgency to create a visualization of certain characteristics.

Lucidity of screenplay, exemplary art direction, spontaneous acting, portraits of frame after frame with artistry had made this movie a topmost exemplar in regard of film education. To enlighten the topic, the lucidity of acting deserves far more credit than it can be written in a compact overview. The picturization of Sicilian eccentricity had been executed with a great prowess. When legendary Marlon Brando appears with a simple yet kindling shot, the whole movie sets off to a placid smooth flow. Integration of great Al Pacino from the two distinctive prospectus, one is a must to be edged to the seat while pondering over the transformation of Michael Corleone. <br/><br/>Story line combines us with the explicit overview of Sicilian uprising crime in America. But, what we get from the movie is the greater contradiction of human nature, genuine compulsion for setting higher in the hierarchy and ecstasy of human prudence for family.

As the inevitable occurs, the legacy passes and bewilders the framework highly. In spite of possible complexities we get the taste of a single man enthroning the summit. It serves us with the latent ambition of every man to taste the eternity, dignity and complexity. <br/><br/>From the point of any aspect, this movie provides the perfect aura for any audience whether looking for cinematic excellence or compact perfection of intricate plot. From my point of view it deserves a straight 9 out of 10. I have not given 10 because of some redundant cross dissolves."

","Movie is just Love! The remarkable thing is that the first priority of Godfather is his family. Movie is just telling you how do you gain respect in your life but without family everything is useless. The old gangster movie is represented by Richard Conte and Sterling Hayden in bit parts, while Brando's cotton-cheeked patriarch represents everything about old Hollywood that Coppola aspired to. The younger generation is represented by the then fresh, exciting talents who remain respected names in their profession (Pacino, Robert Duvall, Caan, Diane Keaton). This is a film that has entered popular culture: even if you've never seen it, you know the lines (""Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes""), and some of the scenes (the horse's head). But there's more to it than moments imprinted on the psyche"

","The Godfather is among the hardly any films that does not have one flaw. Seeing The Godfather for The very first time was one of the most amazing Motion picture activities of my daily life. There is scenes that stay with you when the films over, therefore you remember them. Anyone can make the mistake of calling this film a Motion picture about criminal offense. Its definitely a Film about relatives. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I have observed the Film a minimum of 30, forty instances, and I'm nonetheless stunned at how excellent it is. The tunes, the performing, every little thing. Folks think that Citizen Kane is the greatest Motion picture at any time produced...perfectly, there's no way that ANYONE can believe Citizen Kane is a lot more moving, and it has a greater storyline compared to the Godfather. The matter I locate so astounding concerning the Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) improvements throughout the movie. Its my impression this is the greatest movie ever designed, and I doubt that any one can look at this Motion picture, and Believe I am ridiculous."

","The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Based on Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, the film stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning the years 1945 to 1955, centers on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while also chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone. The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema[4]—and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre.[5] Now ranked as the second greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute,[6] it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990.[7] The film was for a time the highest grossing picture ever made, and remains the box office leader for 1972. It won three Oscars that year: for Best Picture, for Best Actor (Brando) and in the category Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Its nominations in seven other categories included Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. The success spawned two sequels: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in 1990."

","It's a great movie which shows very well the structure and working methods of the Italian-American mafia. The excellent interpretation of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando and all the others makes this movie one you must see. The great screenplay based in the Mario Puzo's novel gives to this movie a very strong story. You can also see a very good representation of the Italian lifestyle in the USA and the original Sicilian mafia. Each character has his own presence and they interact as in the real life. For me it's probably the best movie of the history, followed by the second and third part of the Mario Puzo's story."

","In 1972, one based on a bestselling film written by Mario Puzo emerged. The saga of the Corleone family is like a tragic opera, soaked in blood and deafened by the noise of the guns. The shooting marked by disagreements between the director and producers. A film that addresses violence, mafia, family and love. Yes, the love a father has for his family. Cynical characters under a humanized view maintains the essence of the work, no one is who is by chance, are the circumstances that define their choices, all for a greater good: the good of the family. A metaphor for America in the history of The Godfather is clear from the first moment, Francis Ford Coppola holds a dramatic power of passages of the book by Mario Puzo turning a great book into a powerful film, both in its aesthetics and in its essence. The Godfather is my favorite movie, and undoubtedly one of the most important films in history. The most talked about, imitated and revered film."

You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.<br/><br/>John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants. <br/><br/>The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.<br/><br/>Do not miss this film!"

","I got to watch the fourth bonus DVD celebrating 25 years of the first movie, after watching the behind scenes and the work done by the film crew, I cant agree more that his movie is the best ever made. I watched the fourth DVD which includes the Godfather Notebook, it's how Coppola wrote the script for the movie on the exact papers of the original novel by cutting every single page of the novel and paste it in an A4 frame that will make the footnote bugger so he can write the script on each page of the original novel. Some of the greatest scenes were Coppola first hearing the sound track by Nino Rota on a cassette tape, and Robert De Niro playing the role of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone during the casting for the role. It's really a very good DVD and it shows how a great movie was done."

Of course you can see that this movie is not made this Century, but that just adds to the (call it) charm of this movie. Like Sopranos this is more about Family than the violence and mob.<br/><br/>A genius introduction to the main characters are made. The movie starts with a wedding of Don Corleones daughter. Even if it take some time it never gets boring, and after the introduction you already know a lot of the characters in the movie. This is lacking in many modern movies. They do not use enough effort in the character building, it looses to the need of action. <br/><br/>So much is said about the movie that I do not think I can add something to it."

The story keeps on going and you never feel bored or non interesting scenes. The dialogues are very powerful. ""I'ill make him an offer he can't refuse"". The roles of Tom Hagen, Sonny and of course Michael (Al Pachino) are epic and very heart touching. The sound & music gives us a feel like Italian environment in USA.

","good movie to watch, and not bored to watch it again and again, because there is romance in this film, drama and also the most important action. So those of you who have not watched it please immediately and instantly watch, and those of you who've seen it, can watch again. I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.<br/><br/>There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an exposé of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.<br/><br/>The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.<br/><br/>That just advice from me, thank you."

Few have succeeded but the ones that followed the happening closely took advantage of it and rebuilded the age of honor. A whole book can be written for one of the greatest pictures of all time and we could not be even close to explaning how good actually it was! For those who haven't watched it yet it's a must! For those who watched it I'm sure they've watched at least a thousand times. If I must say a few words for the acting I might say that I am not among the big fans of Marlon Brando but his role in this movie is the role of his life! What can I say about Al Pacino? Genius! Only one man could have played the role of Michael Corleone and that is him! I even thing that Brian De Palma didn't think twice when he had to pick the actor for Scarface 10 years later. All the rest are on the same level and whenever we see them in other pictures we think about The Godfather. Lets just point them out - James Caan, Richard S.

How Michael goes from being the war hero non- criminal, to become the leader of the biggest crime family is just amazing. But the best thing about the movie is Marlon Brando's performance. Just astonishing and it will be remembered as one of the greatest acting performances in film. I love how the conflicts build up during the movie, and that they can not trust anyone except their own family. If you love mob and crime movies, this is one for you. The music is also terrific, it fits the scenes perfectly. It is a great directed movie by Francis Ford Coppola and he keeps up the impressing work in The Godfather Part 2.

","There are certain films that you watch where you know by the end that this isn't just a film but a masterpiece in cinema, a piece of artwork that live forever and is simply untouchable by any film studio who has run out of ideas and wants to remake a film. <br/><br/>Every aspect of the film is utterly brilliant. From the characters and their individual development down to the lighting. It is difficult to put into words how this film makes you feel. It certainly is not just another gangster film that categorises or stereotypes Italian-Americans. Instead it is a tale of man, who despite everything his father wanted for him, is hurled into a life that he is totally wrong for at the start of the movie. But given the events that take place over the course of his life he loses everything that is good inside of him, and he becomes cold and calculated and perfect for the life his father shielded him from. <br/><br/>You become immersed in 1940's America, and through the trilogy far beyond that. It is the only film where I refuse to watch the first one, without subsequently watching the other three in the days that follow. It is an epic that words cannot do justice.<br/><br/>If I recommend just one film to anyone for the rest of my life it will be this one. I judge my friends who have not seen this film, and pressure them into watching it. I mistrust anyone who says they don't like this film.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando is sublime, Al Pacino is excellent, James Caan is fantastic and Robert Duvall is incredible. This is the peak of their collective careers. Francis Ford Coppola isn't a director. He's a genius.<br/><br/>Do not watch any other film before watching this one.

Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando, whose iconic performance has overshadowed an even better turn by Al Pacino as his son Michael) is a man for whom family is all. ""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man,"" he says, and he lives by that. He's devoted to his wife, dotes on his children and grandchildren, throws a lavish wedding for his daughter, and kills or threatens anyone who gets in his way or that of his family and friends.

","(Short overall review) I watched ""The Godfather"" in 2013. It was broadcast Sunday evening at 20:00 and the sequel and prequel followed after one week each. At the time, my most favorite movie was only one. Even though I had watched numerous classics and modern films (Lord of the rings, Starwars, etc) I could only say ""This is my favorite movie"" to one production. But after I watched ""The Godfather"" the number increased. To say anything bad for this film will be an abomination. I have given several 10s in IMDb, to films I like, but I have always realized that if this was an official review I couldn't give 10 to any of them. That is not true for this one. This film truly deserves a 10 and will remain on the top of my list of the greatest movies of all time."

","I know it is such a cliché to say it after thousands of comments, but this is a must-watch movie. You probably have seen all the impostors around acting like Marlon Brando which is funny of course but still it strikes you because of how much effort he put to pull off this movie. Although it might get boring sometimes, the acting and the sense of reality wind you up with the plot making it an easy-to- watch movie. Just to give you some heads-up, the first movie of the sequel can elevate the expectations for the rest, you won't regret for the time you spared for this movie. The plot is designated so well that it encircles you in every way not letting you stop or look away from the screen. In my opinion this is the best mafia-related movie in which all the racketeers and kingpins do not cut a swath and you admire even to the ones who die during the movie. Long story short, this movie definitely deserves its place among the top three in all time favorite movies."

","Godfather is not just ...A... classic gangster film it is...THE... classic gangster film. Marlon Brando is an amazing actor when he's not a big fat lazy jerk reading his lines off of a piece of paper hanging on the wall (and yes he actually did crap like that from what I heard in class) and this is one of his best performances if not the best performance he ever did. Robert Duvall and James Caan are always the same in their performances but they are good in this, probably because they are so young and their shtick wasn't old yet. Pacino is really very good. His weak brother is also very good in his role. The ladies in Pacino's life are very good. I really loved this movie, the drama is great and also there are some really great violent gangster action scenes. The scene where Sonny is racing to town in his old car and gets stopped at the toll booth is an all time classic, don't want to give away details but it sticks with you. Awesome movie!"

"gabbyJ_1","5","0","4","6 December 2013"," it's not historically accurate to the genre or dark and gritty like i expected. slow paced over-hyped family film
","I do not understand the hype, i have tried earlier today on my second attempt to viewing this movie, i made it about 45 minutes until Don Corleone's first assassination attempt until I coulnd't sit through it anymore.<br/><br/>I want to say again I don't understand the hype and high 9.2 IMDb score for this movie. I will try to explain for the following reasons: #1) There is a lot of hype involved because it is considered a true crime epic, well it's not even a true story or based upon one has anyone realized that? Yes , there is some elements which are relative to the crime world at the time, but no this does not do justice to the real crime families. It's not based on a true story in any way other than something like Inglorious Bastards would be, it only uses some real names and real ideas in our history.<br/><br/>#2) The action and build up is very slow paced and makes it difficult to sit through without getting bored. The action crawls at a snails pace, it does not bother to cover the history behind how Brando's character came to be in the position of power he is in. For something with such a slow build up i am surprised they did not incorporate anything about the don and how he came to be. I am disappointed to be unable to connect with the don on any level, it is only assumed that he worked hard and is a respectable individual.<br/><br/>#3) It does not fully capture the real danger and constant rush involved with living a dangerous life every day. It does not feel real. The first shooting scene looked bundled and strange, even unorganized. It did not look professional or scary. And second, they didn't bother to finish him off or plan this effectively it looked like an assassination attempt doomed to fail. Not to mention his bodyguard, might i add this is the DON the GODFATHER his bodyguard looked like a quivering mass of coward. For someone in such an esteemed and established position he should be able to pick more skilled bodyguards. His crony immediately broke down and cried, any true criminal knows that business comes first, avenge your boss, don't sit and cry. If i was his boss and still alive i would get up and shoot my henchmen in the face for being a chicken. Also the scene where Robert Duvall sneaks a horse head into the director's bed? Am i the only that fully can see how ridiculous that is, and the fact that it is also quite impossible? For you that don't know the movie, he gets welcomed into the directors house to discuss business, and like a sneaky petty con artist insults him behind his back and mutilates his prize horse and sticks it on top of his bed while he's sleeping. The reality of that is just crazy. First of all, a person does not become a godfather by employing low integrity sleaze balls into his direct office, that is not how the world works. Criminal organizations have a code of conduct as well, and need skilled and practical criminals to do their work, criminals who often maintain their own standard of rules and principles. If a criminal did that kind of bull he is gonna being embarrassment to his organization.<br/><br/>#4)This film does not appeal to me as dark and epic, but family fun inaccurate to the brutality and hustle real gangsters encounter. It is a strange concept it is too long and way too inaccurate to reality.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I Want to say as a hardcore fan of crime, and someone who has broken a few rules personally in my time I can say this does not accurately portray the genre. It is far too long and slow paced for me to sit through, i cant say that i have ever finished this from start to finish i tried twice now and don't see my self as being able to."

","A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits.<br/><br/>Of the many themes which The Godfather touches upon, it is that of ""family"" which resonates the most. The film is based upon the novel by Mario Puzo (who co-wrote the screenplay) and many sub-plots were minimised or thrown away by director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola, himself an Italian American and family man. He knew that the only way to make Puzo's sprawling novel work on screen was to focus on the familial relationships within this crime story, whether it be father to son, brother to brother, or husband to wife. In this world blood is not only thicker than water, it is holy.<br/><br/>Best for ever."
"alishahmohd","10","0","1","21 November 2013"," A Grand Masterpiece....
","Almost every person who sees Hollywood films has at least heard of The Godfather, it is considered by multiple sources as one of the best films ever made in history, many people have also claimed that this is the best film ever made. I am not sure if I agree with the latter point, but I can proudly say is that the Godfather is just a Grand masterpiece which not only a fan of the crime genre but anyone who likes movies in general can enjoy. <br/><br/>Now this is a 1972 film some people say it has not aged well, I disagree that film is still entertaining to watch, the plot will still grasp your attention and you will still be on the edge of your seat. The main thing that this movie does different compared to the movies of today's generation that it moves at a very very slow pace not that it's a bad thing, back then almost all films did that, the minor scenes went on for quite long. I mean seriously has there even been a recent movie in which a party or wedding scene went on for over 10 minutes (unless the actual film was based upon it)? <br/><br/>Now I will not take away from this movie because of of prolonged scenes because the movie still makes sure to progress its story slowly in such scenes to keep the viewer interested. However these scenes also make the movie go on for 3 hours which kind of hurts its replay value. But even if you watch the Godfather once you will simply be in awe of it's magnificent story, brilliant characters and perfect setting and environment. <br/><br/>This film is also a very realistic portrayal of mobs in Italy during that time period. All actors bring the characters to life and very so into the characters that you will feel like they are the characters themselves rather than actual actors. The acting is simply among the best I have seen in any movie, not just from the lead Al Pacino and Marlon Brando but even the supporting characters like Sonny played by James Caan or Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall are fantastically portrayed. Even the minor and the female characters play their part to perfection. There is nothing really bad to say about the acting.<br/><br/>The plot is about the Corleone family and how it tries to co-exist with the other mobs. The story is fantastic with many twists and turns throughout and will keep you engaged about what will happen next, the movie does not move rapidly fast but it moves at a very slow pace to allow the viewer to get a better idea of the characters and the plot. The ending is also fantastic and is a perfect example of character development.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also fantastic and fits all the scenes in the movie, the main theme of the film in particular still sounds awesome even to this very day. The movie also takes itself very seriously, it does not do comedy, apart from a very few and rare scenes, this film is very serious and rightfully so it deals with a very serious topic and the events that transpire throughout are very difficult, tragic and severe for this movie to be anything else. The film is violent but it is not what you see throughout 90% of the film, the violence which is there, serves its purpose and progresses the plot in a meaningful way.<br/><br/>Apart from the pacing, I felt like this film was a little hard to understand sometimes without subtitles specially when the Italian language is spoken, we are still not completely clueless to what's actually going on but knowing what the characters are actually saying would have helped. But that is only a minor issue which does not take away from the overall film.<br/><br/>In the end, I just want to say what has already been said many times, The Godfather one of the best films ever made in history and anyone who likes Hollywood cinema in general and still hasn't watched this masterpiece, should just watch this classic, this is Hollywood at it's very finest.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 10/10"
"nalingfx","10","0","1","19 November 2013"," Best movie ever made!
","Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, THE GODFATHER is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release. Nino Rota's score, the sumptuous set design, and Brando's raspy pseudo-whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory.<br/><br/>The film possesses an operatic quality, yet it's more understated than it is flamboyant. It takes its subjects seriously, bestowing legitimacy upon the internecine power struggles of the Mafia normally reserved for classical themes in high art. The film's release initiated a period when American filmmakers dared to take themselves and their artistic ambitions seriously (perhaps too seriously). There is something deeply resonant in the film's treatment of filial piety, the need for respect, and our culture's abiding interest in the parallel moral universe of the Mafia."

","A great movie that takes us into the life of the underworld bosses. Really depicts the real life happenings of the mostly glamorized life of crime bosses.<br/><br/>Whats amazing is that there is a lot of life and sub-stories in the movie. The Godfather is not even the central character.<br/><br/>The actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing.<br/><br/>Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so ""The Godfather"" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller.<br/><br/>I love the decor it makes the film authenticate since its the decor you would expect from the 1940's. Its filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish-brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.<br/><br/>Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry."

","The Godfather series is one of the most popular in the entire movie industry, and starting with the first one released in 1972 following the traditional Mafia path and some familiar mafia family references, this movie takes you on a journey worthwhile for any Mafia fan. As Vito Corleone takes the control of the Corleone family, you get to see incredible hard-taken decisions that will move the plot radically from a moment to another, leaving you constantly asking what's about to happen next and bringing an incredible sense of excitement to the entire experience.

"cafescott","10","0","1","14 November 2013"," joining the underworld
","The Godfather is a great film made with gusto. Most of the participants are at their career best. Nina Rota's magnificent score and Francis Ford Coppola's direction tie things together very well. <br/><br/>Al Pacino is the greatest performer of a top-shelf cast. The decision to cast him as Michael is a stroke of cinematic genius. (Supposedly, Marlon Brando threatened to quit if Pacino wasn't cast, and this tipped the scales in Pacino's favor.)<br/><br/>Another diminutive actor playing Michael might have emulated James Cagney a bit, with bounce and swagger in his step. Pacino never seems worried about his physical stature; instead, his Michael is very articulate. Pacino and Brando are putting on a Method acting show; and their chemistry together is sublime.<br/><br/>The Godfather foreshadows Michael's destiny exquisitely. For example, consider the hospital sequence. Michael enters a room looking for the detectives protecting his father and we hear the musical soundtrack repeating the number ""two."" Michael opens the hospital door to his father's room--and it is clearly marked with the number two. The association of the number two with Vito when Michael is present foreshadows the rise of Michael in the family business. (That is, Michael is #1.) In addition, the actor playing Enzo the baker (Gabriele Torrei) has a strong resemblance to Pacino. When Michael throws Enzo's carnations away (on the steps outside the hospital) this is another clue that Michael is destined to chuck away the lover boy side of him and rise in the underworld.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando's performance is a lightning rod for criticism, praise and satire. It is difficult to imagine any other actor of his time portraying Don Vito with all the knowing looks and gestures that Brando makes. It is another brave portrayal from Brando.<br/><br/>The conflict between brothers Sonny (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is well explored. Sonny is all testosterone and action while Tom Hagen is cautious and inexperienced in underworld affairs. Since Hagen is adopted, he is both an insider and an outsider. The audience needs him to help understand the Sicilian logic at play.<br/><br/>Having seen The Godfather dozens of times, it is fun pointing out the implausibility with the story. For example, it seems very hard to believe that a brother-in-law, already having been savagely smacked around in public for hitting his wife, would beat her again knowing that his wife's hot-headed brother would chase after him without his bodyguards. How much could Carlo have been paid to willingly absorb the risk that his brother-in-law exercises usual caution?<br/><br/>Another implausible is that Barzini is doing something in public the day of the Baptism. Forgetting that Baptisms usually occur on a Sunday, what happens to Michael if Barzini is staying at home that day?<br/><br/>The Godfather has us rooting for Michael even as he descends into evil. The transformation that Michael makes is shared by the viewer; we are also joining a criminal conspiracy. It is a uniquely memorable and pleasurable ride."

This is one of a few films in which brings amazing performances from the entire cast. Marlon Brando as the Godfather is obviously solid gold. The then 47-year-old nails it as the title character and offers an iconic, unforgettable performance that will always remain one of the strongest performances in movie history. Al Pacino succeeds as the ""nice college boy"" that changes strongly throughout the film. James Caan and Robert Duvall come strong as supporting characters, as well as Richard Castellano, Al Lettieri and Diane Keaton.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola is one of the last great directors. His directing in The Godfather is brilliant and spectacular. The screenplay for the film is terrific. Many good and iconic lines, and great dialog. The music is beautiful. The main theme is bone chilling and the Love Theme is unique and a masterpiece. The cinematography is visually stunning, from the wedding party to Sicily, Italy, it's just breathtaking.<br/><br/>No matter how many years pass, I know for sure that The Godfather will always remain a strong and powerful film, and one of the most important films in motion picture history. Impossible to defeat, The Godfather really is the greatest film of all time."

We can see our own experiences, in the lives of these characters. From the beginning of the movie one can identify an uncle, or a family member with one of the characters. The story line just takes you in great journey, from the naïve and idealist Michael to the cold and calculated killer he becomes when he takes charge of the family business. The loss, the gains, the falls, and victories of the Corleone's family, we can feel them as ours as well. We can see how the moral code changes from Don Vito Corleone's leadership, and Michael's way to handled business. Don Vito Corleone to my point of view who have not killed his daughter's husband, for him it was all about the family, and community. I think Michael's difference was that everything was giving to him, and he grew up in an environment of richness, where in Don Vito Corleone, he suffered poverty, and worked really hard to get that kind of power, and his number one motive was the well being of family and community. Michael not having this kind of life experiences took a decision that marked his life, and we as spectators could live and suffer with these characters. <br/><br/>A wonderful movie to watch again and again, the more you watch it, knew things you'll be able to discover."

And that was a one way ticket to a new era, the one of a Wounded to Death, Crumbling Empire. <br/><br/>After watching The Trilogy and the movies Goodfellas, Once Upon a Time in America, and Scarface. If you can (have the spare time), do not miss The Sopranos (the HBO TV Series) by the also great James Gandolfini. <br/><br/>See how a Empire can bleed to death because a wrong decision betrayed what they stood for and that changed everything so much that they lost their reason d'être."

Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Based on Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, the film stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning the years 1945 to 1955, centers on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while also chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando). The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema[3]—and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre.[4] Now ranked as the second greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute,[5] it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990.[6] The film was for a time the highest grossing picture ever made, and remains the box office leader for 1972. It won three Oscars that year: for Best Picture, for Best Actor (Brando) and in the category Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Its nominations in seven other categories included Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. The success spawned two sequels: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in 1990. On the day of his only daughter's wedding, Vito Corleone hears requests in his role as the Godfather, the Don of a New York crime family. Vito's youngest son, Michael, in a Marine Corps uniform, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the sprawling reception. Vito's godson Johnny Fontane, a popular singer, pleads for help in securing a coveted movie role, so Vito dispatches his fear, Tom Hagen, to the abrasive studio head, Jack Woltz, to secure the casting. Woltz is unmoved until the morning he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion. Shortly before Christmas 1945, drug baron Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo, backed by the Corleones' rivals, the Tattaglias, asks Vito for investment in the emerging drug trade and protection through his political connections. Vito disapproves of drug dealers, so he sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. The family then receives two fish wrapped in Brasi's vest, imparting that he ""sleeps with the fishes"". An assassination attempt by Sollozzo's men lands Vito in the hospital, so his eldest son, Sonny, takes command. Sollozzo kidnaps Hagen to pressure Sonny to accept his deal. Michael thwarts a second assassination attempt on his father at the hospital, but is accosted by corrupt police captain McCluskey, who breaks his jaw; Sonny retaliates by having Tattaglia's son killed. Michael comes up with a plan to hit Sollozzo and McCluskey that his brother approves over Hagen's objections: on the pretext of settling the dispute, Michael lures the pair to a restaurant, retrieves a planted handgun and murders them. Despite a clampdown from the authorities, the Five Families erupt in open warfare and the brothers fear for their safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily, and Fredo Corleone is sheltered by associate Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks his brother-in-law Carlo on the street for abusing his sister Connie. When it happens again, Sonny speeds for her home but assassins ambush him at a highway toll booth and riddle him with submachine gun fire. Michael's time abroad has led to marriage to Apollonia Vitelli. Their euphoria is shattered when a car bomb intended for him takes her life. Vito, saddened to learn that, despite his hopes, Michael has become involved in the family business, decides to end the feuds. Believing that the Tattaglias were under orders of the now dominant Don Emilio Barzini, he promises, before the heads of the Five Families, to withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo revenge for Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home and over a year later marries Kay. With his father at the end of his career and his surviving brother too weak, Michael takes the reins of the family, promising his wife to make the business legitimate within five years. He allows rival families to pressure Corleone enterprises even as he plans to move family operations to Nevada and delegates New York business to members who stay behind. Hagen, upset when Michael replaces him with Vito, is mollified by the older man's reassurance about their long- range plans for him. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, Greene derides the Corleones as a fading power. To add injury to insult, Michael sees Fredo falling under Greene's sway. Vito collapses and dies in his garden while playing with Michael's son, Anthony. At the funeral, Salvatore Tessio arranges a meeting between Michael and Don Barzini, signally his treachery as Vito had warned. The meeting is set for the same day as the christening of Connie's son, to whom Michael will stand as godfather. As the christening proceeds, Corleone assassins, acting on Michael's orders, murder the other New York dons and Moe Greene. Tessio is told that Michael is aware of his betrayal and taken off to his death. After Carlo is questioned by Michael on his involvement in setting up Sonny's murder and confesses he was contacted by Brazen, Peter Clemenza kills him with a wire garrote. Michael is confronted by Connie, who accuses him of having her husband killed. He denies killing Carlo when questioned by Kay, an answer she accepts. As Kay watches warily, Michael receives his capos, who address him as the new Don Corleone."

"sevinc-zorbey","10","0","1","6 September 2013"," Review for Godfather
","The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Based on Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, the film stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning the years 1945 to 1955, centers on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while also chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando). The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre. Now ranked as the second greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990. The film was for a time the highest grossing picture ever made, and remains the box office leader for 1972. It won three Oscars that year: for Best Picture, for Best Actor (Brando) and in the category Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Its nominations in seven other categories included Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. The success spawned two sequels: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in 1990."

"calvin-crenshaw-2095","10","0","1","30 August 2013"," The story of the Coreleone family an Italian mafia family's rise and struggles both internally and externally to keep control of their domain.
","Just to start off. With director/writer Francis Ford Coppola and screenplay Mario Puzo. And boasting a star studded cast of Marlon Brando,Al Pacino,James Caan,Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton,Abe Vigoda to name a few. In my humble opinion there was little to no chance that this wouldn't be a standard setting blockbuster movie. This is the story of the Corelione Italian mafia family and their rise in power as well as a look inside the family business with a emphasis on their relationship with each other. Their struggles to keep control of the family power and the internal struggles and pressures of mob versus mob fighting to end the Coreleone family control. Due to events that occur cause Don Coreleone to think about stepping down to bring young Michael(Al Pacino)to the head of the family business of which he is reluctant and self doubting if he is up for the responsibility that goes with the title. I can not say enough about how well this is written,directed and acted. I gave it a 10 and I firmly believe it was totally justified. Hope you enjoy this as much as I did. Cal"

","For me, it was a difficult film for the first part, so I had to look twice is not that supposed to mean completely, especially the names of the supporting cast. I'm not used to this movie, so I guess you can. A very serious film, it is possible to know a lot of it, and have something to say, of course the family. I think the story is very well found out, it can be a very interesting book, and I think he is funny, because as I watched the film ends, it is based on a book. I definitely Starring Al Pacino came out to be the best, I just wanted to know, first, I think it is fantastic developed here, and the other part as well. Robert Duvall and the other who think it is perfectly formed. Marlon Brando did not work out so much, or so it seemed, but when I watched the second part, really missed it, so I liked it somewhat. The others were good, I think highly of the performances here were the best of the trilogy there. I liked the three parts is virtually the same, only one was slightly better acting performances, but otherwise the same hold good in the other two, do not even think worse. Each of the three great film, but it did not become my favorite, but I will admit that a great, thought-provoking film, and everyone must see at least once. All three films with me 10/9-es osztályzatú here of course is 5 * for they deserve.

","I have watched this twice earlier in my life. I liked it, but I didn't find it to be the bee's knees or anything. Then I realized how much dialogue I was missing without the subtitles on! Some characters, especially Brando/Don Corleone, is impossible to understand a majority of the time but he says lines that are extremely important in order to absorb all that is going on. <br/><br/>I feel like I have finally seen the great movie everyone was talking about. It feels like that in order to view the symbolism within a film I need to understand nearly every line. And don't get me wrong, I love Vito as a character and the performance given is amazing, but he is too difficult to understand. The most comparable performance to Brando in Godfather is Christian Bale in The Dark Knight series. Both are stellar performances, but both have dialogue that is nearly impossible to decipher. <br/><br/>As a final note, the actor that plays Fredo is not familiar to me, but he is really talented and very good at pretending to be a person I would hate in real life."
"torrado-767-284731","9","0","1","17 August 2013"," God Father
","We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of ""The Godfather,"" which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old- fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.<br/><br/>Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.<br/><br/>But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whispery, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.<br/><br/>The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although ""The Godfather"" is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races).<br/><br/>The success of ""The Godfather"" as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garrotings.<br/><br/>Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so ""The Godfather"" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they'd tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn't have worked. But it's uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish-brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.<br/><br/>Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other."
"StoryCharts","9","0","1","15 August 2013"," Family above all other values
","The Godfather is about the idea of family above all other values. It goes about letting us experience this idea with three plots. The main plot is the external plot to Save the Corleone family. Supporting plots include the external plot of Michael becoming an insider of the family and an internal plot of Michael's morality.<br/><br/>Michael starts out an idealistic young man who looks down on the dirty deeds of the family business. In the end, Michael save the Corleone family. But in order to do so, he has become the ultimate insider (the Don) and loses the values he had held so dear at the beginning.<br/><br/>It's a classic story that can be argued to humanize a criminal family by making us a member of it through Michael's transformation. The stakes are laid out such that we have to believe the ends justify the means. This idea, to protect the family at any cost, is taken to its logical extreme in the sequel, The Godfather: Part II and then the pied piper comes calling for payback in the finale The Godfather: Part III. But Part I is what stands apart from its distinctive internal arc of Michael. In the other two movies, Michael's determination and moral center never wavers, we just see the external world's consequences of his moral choices.<br/><br/>My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca."

"mmelvin43326","10","0","1","11 August 2013"," A Masterpiece
","The Godfather is arguably THE defining drama motion picture of the 20th century. The character presentation was magnificent. Though Al Pacino had other great movies prior to this, Brando obviously took a shine to him and really mentored this actor in ways I believe no one can imagine. Pacino evolved and solidified the role of the head of the family that I believe is still being used in references today. A strong but loving Father figure, ruthless and forceful at times, Pacino drew on his personal background greatly during this role.<br/><br/>James Caan was spot on as Sonny. The typical view of Italian temper as well as showing the eagerness to make a dollar. This role was the glue in the first half of the film. <br/><br/>Talia Shire, just too good. What can one write about a flawless performance. The quintessential bad Italian daughter, awful wife and terrible sister. Scorned by her brother, bitter in the end of this movie, Mrs. Shire is wonderful in portraying the suppressed spirit of the true Italian mob family member.<br/><br/>John Cazale is a piece of work. As Fredo, he embodies the mob family's image of the family member ""you should have just given money to instead of letting him in the business"". What a smart role for a great actor. Through it all Fredo was the one family member that was actually true to himself the whole time. He loved his family dearly, wanted to earn money, and absolutely craved respect. I love how he was always like the lamb in the lions den no one worried too much about. The movie was tailored such that if one thinks about it, the family is the one that let Fredo down by not recognizing his inherent shortcomings.<br/><br/>Robert Duvall is a Master Counselor in the movie, but most the important contribution Duvall made was as an outsider. Not an Italian. His portrayal as someone who could be loyal and not blood Italian was huge in the USA at this time. I believe Duvall's role made it almost OK for races to interact with each other better without using side glances. This is a great testament to Duvall and one I don't believe was intended by the director or screenplay.<br/><br/>Finally there is Mr. Marlo Brando. There's nothing to say but marvelous, magnificent, platinum performance."

It really feels as Coppola had some inside informant give him insight on how things work in a mafia family. They are many other crime movies but in my opinions none of those is on the same level as ""The Godfather""(that's not saying they are bad or of inferior quality of course).<br/><br/>I recommend seeing this movie to anyone, enjoys not only crime flicks but good cinema in general."

","Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it.

Michael's transformation from college kid who wanted to steer clear of the family business to a godfather in the making was highly convincing. It's a pity that the version I watched lacked subtitles as I don't understand Italian, but I could still follow the plot.

Many a director worldwide has paid tributes to this film in one way or the other. Twice in the recent history in India only (Sarkar and Raajneeti).<br/><br/>Marlon Brando is amazing as the Godfather. Al Pacino (who was still making a stronghold in Hollywood at that time) has done justice as the son who is in conflict with his family business. His transformation, both by action and his psyche, is a treat to watch. <br/><br/>The beauty of the film, and why it works at so many levels, lies in the fact that the characters' charisma is built not by their actions on screen but by a sense of intrigue that the writers and director have achieved by this flawless narrative.<br/><br/>Add to that the cinematography of Gordon Willis. The lighting in the frames (and lack of it) adds to the sense of intrigue. <br/><br/>The cutting is crisp and helps build the tension.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly a 10/10"

The acting of both Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is simply phenomenal. Pacino's never-changing serious demeanor perfectly conveys the life of a mobster. One can almost feel bad for Brando's 'Vito Corleone'. He is displayed as an old man who loves his family and will do anything to make sure they thrive rather than a ruthless killing machine. There is violence, but it's not over-the-top gore. It's all done in good taste. I found this movie to be very interesting because I know next-to-nothing about the Mafia. True, this movie is long at almost 3 hours but it's worth it. Now, to mention the music. I thought the music was truly beautiful and timeless. It perfectly captures the essence of the movie. . I've had the theme song stuck in my head for days now. At times my heart was beating fast for the characters out of suspense. I cried when they cried. I really felt some of the deaths. Overall, I feel as though this movie rightly deserves the title of 'Greatest Movie Ever Made'. I could watch this movie over and over again without getting tired of it.

","At three different occasions, i tried to watch this whole movie, this was about 4 years ago.. I don't know maybe i was too young and impatient, but at every single try i never got through it, and i wanted to get through it all because everyone loved it so much and it had good rating and reviews. A few days ago i had to watch it, the whole movie, 3 hours. At first i was thinking ""oh sh*t"", but i just had to get it over with. <br/><br/>The performance of these two as i saw as main characters, Marlon and Pacino delivers an outstanding performance in adjusting to their characters battles as well in handling their emotions progressively. If we focus on Marlon his character i believe not many people could pull off, you can see that he really is stuck in this character, he looks worried constantly and troubled but at the same time a bit calm and bitter. His accent make's him even more interesting and the way he talks jagged tone. If we take a look at Pacino's role, I'd say this is irreplaceable as well, from the beginning who is a bit innocent and tries to not get involved, but the exceptional we see further on about his character evolves to this emotionless devil. What is so fascinating about this movie is how one person behavior is changing as the person itself goes through violence, sorrow and grief, what these situations turns a person in something he least wanted in this world. But as he goes through it, it becomes like nature to him, it's like it was in his veins from the start, he just needed it the keep spreading like a disease throughout his system. This is what is so bizarre until the very end, to wonder how he got so emotionless. <br/><br/>I've never liked movies that were all about the Mafia, because i've never liked their motives. Which in the end it's all about money, respect and family, but this was something different."

","This is my first review. It is an excellent and very well done movie There can be no mistake. When you watch The Godfather, you know you are watching something special. Pherhaps, the best film of all time, and surely in my top 5. great cast, great plot, and the magic of Coppola, love it. The mafia is seen like never before in a film, and now, no one can make such a cinematographic masterpiece as the godfather. The Godfather has been showered with praise by nearly all major critics out there. This is one of my all time favorite. This movie stands at the top in all decades. ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.""There are at least dozen movies (in my country alone) which inspired/copied this epic.So, the bottom line is if you haven't watched this yet then get a copy now."

","""The Godfather"" exists within a vacuum: it is without precedent, and (not for the want of much effort), it is without imitation. To try and objectively review this Film, after its effect on my life, would be a poor joke. Frankly, I adore it. It is Romantic, absolutely. Beyond belief. Even Technically, it's a paradise. The colours drip, rich and heavy. The characters hold up a mirror to our psyche, and the dialogue has rightly cemented ""The Godfather"" as a movie which will always have a relevance. Ironically, this tale of counter-culture has become arguably the definitive Pop Culture statement. ""The Godfather"" IS the gap between Mainstream and Art. It is the scale to which every ""classic"" must compare itself, and inevitably fall short. Concise Coalescence: ""The Godfather"" is the greatest Movie ever made. But that's not why I LOVE it. Sure, I respect a whole bunch of Films. I can recognise a Film's influence, award it its dues, and move on. But I keep coming back to this, because I feel an affection for it. Every time I hear that sweeping NiÃ±o Rota score, I'm reminded: this changed my life! Days spent dreaming of my future as either a Mafioso or a Film-maker. To a degree, ""The Godfather's"" reputation does it a disservice; this isn't a Movie to admire, it's a Movie to FEEL. And I guarantee you, it's so powerful that only a truly emotionally dead person won't feel it.<br/><br/>And so I again ask myself: Why is it I love ""The Godfather""? I love ""The Godfather"" because it never becomes cute or cuddly. I've just waxed lyrical about it, but as I sit to watch it, it's still dark, it's intimidating. It never gives itself up to soppy nostalgia, and that's why it remains as shocking a statement now as it did more than a quarter of a century ago. Perfection."

","Honestly this is a masterpiece of it's time along with our time. The story was very solid, sent a lot of messages for interpretation, and it is truly a movie that you can watch over and over again. The classic entry to Don Corleone sends me shivers every time. The movie entices you so that you feel as if you've known these characters for a while. With that being said, it nearly broke my heart seeing Don Corleone get shot and you could feel the anger along with the rest. As Michael grew to his top dog position, you could feel the change within a second, you could immerse yourself in his world, his thoughts, and his actions (whether or not you agree with them). All in all a absolute masterpiece in which you are not allowed to die until you see this movie at least once."

It is well respected from all movie directors and inspired many actors/ filmmakers. The directing is wonderful, not to mention the acting is brilliant, cinematography perfect, and everything else about it. I personally believe that any writer/actor starting out in their careers should take the time to view the godfather and experience what a real movie is. The film itself is told in the most perfect way it could be showed. HANDS DOWN.

","Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.<br/><br/>The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint."

Unfortunately for him, when his life is in danger, his children can not stay away from danger, and they are trained in this highly risky game of battles between mafia clans in America. Respect, murder, money and, above all, power: these are the words that best define this film and its action. Probably the best movie ever.

With outstanding performances from Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and an incipient, but extremely talented Al Pacino. The GodFather transports you to the dark world of the Italian Mafia, how they managed their business, their families. Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), head of one of the five Italian mafia families, manages to control his business (Alcohol, Game, Women) with his son Sonny (James Caan), his stepson Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and his loyal friend Clemenza. He develops good social relations with the Government, and important business men. When other families want to take advantage of Don Corleone's relations, in order to introduce drugs and deal with them, Don Corleone refuses to share his contacts.

","This is, undoubtedly, THE classic movie of all time, and seems to set a standard for lines, effects, acting, action, and all other basic elements connected with any movie. With all due respects to the outstanding and late actor Marlon Brando, it was more than just he who made the movie an outstanding success, though he was convincing as the usually-calm yet almost-always cold, controlling don Vito Corleone The nostalgia effects were superb: it was not the least bit difficult to imagine what NYC was like between 1945 and 1955. (1971 NYC was ""turned into"" the NYC of the time setting of the story.) James Caan was as mean as mean could be in his role as the godfather Vito Corleone's son Santino, (Sonny) and Al Pacino, as the don's youngest and favorite son Michael Corleone, had his career launched in just this movie. Of course, Diane Keaton proved to be a promising future star in her role as Kay Adams at her young age of about twenty-five. The story came across as a story of, in my personal opinion, how NOT to live. (Of course, some would disagree with me one hundred per cent on that.) This in-depth study of the Mafia (though the word ""mafia"", as the case was supposed to be, was never used) was definitely a convincing view of the underworld with, among other things, the ""eye-for-eye"" mindset. To recapitulate, the nostalgia, the action, the acting, and the story itself made it THE great feat for Hollywood for all time. Paramount Studios, the director Francis Ford Coppola, and the producer Albert S. Ruddy should be proud."

","I am not the first, nor last to watch The Godfather and be utterly intoxicated by what is on the screen. When I first saw this film 8 years ago, I was entranced by the colorful characters, the Nino Rota score, the story and the saga. But every viewing since then brings something new. The nuanced performance of an unassuming but unflinchingly confident Al Pacino. Every time I think that they almost cast Jack Nicholson, I can't help but wonder. The way the wedding scene at the beginning lulls the audience into a sense of family, tradition and honor before putting all of it to the test in the remaining 2 hours of run time. There is no better example of crime film, drama film and acting combined with writing. The lines are rich and quotable. There is no scene that is superfluous. And once you see it, you will want to see it again and again and you will notice things every time you see it. Rarely does a filmmaker bring together this caliber of actors that bring together their characters with such color and vitality. You feel for every character on the screen and for every character who departs from the family. You feel almost that this is your family, too. That is the investment that can be made in this film....to lose one's self in its depths."

"jon-fougner-966-434081","9","0","1","8 May 2013"," Antitrust in The Godfather
","We often hear that what the Feds nail mafiosos on is tax evasion, rather than the substantive underlying illegal commerce. What if it was antitrust instead of tax?<br/><br/>Gangland is exactly where you'd expect to find anti-competitive behavior, working in the shadows to extract rents. After all, unfairly treated competitors can't complain to the authorities; their recourse is instead only to violence. What's more, those competitors are often themselves taken out of play by the government, whether through transparent corruption (e.g., the legislatively and executively sponsored ""war on drugs"") or through opaque corruption (e.g., bribery of corrupt cops by competing gangs). Thus, the very illegality of the products in which gangs traffic makes for government-granted monopolies that incentivize the illegal behavior.<br/><br/>As much trouble as these monopolies and oligopolies cause for incumbents, they're even more of a headache for insurgents. Hence, barriers to entry in mob-controlled industries are high. Indeed, in Coppola's 175-minute film, there's barely a suggestion that a new family could come to compete with the five, let alone that an organization other than a family could try to enter. (There is one suggestion than an existing deputy of one of the families could do a start-up.)<br/><br/>Relatedly, the specter of boycotting by the Corleone family is ever-present. The Godfather's office is the marketplace. Demand walks in, and the Godfather farms it out to approved suppliers of murder, maiming, extortion, etc. Hence the refrain from his lieutenants, ""Who(m) should I give this job to?"" As an antitrust defendant, Don Corleone would likely argue that this matching of buyers to sellers is a market-promoting service, see Chi. Bd. of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231 (1918)—like a market maker on a securities exchange—while prosecutors would allege that, by unilaterally choosing the supplier for each transaction, he is impeding an open market rather than lubricating it. Prosecutors would background this argument with atmospherics of racial discrimination, cf. NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886 (1982), by the Corleones qua employer; Mike says of the family attorney, ""He's a good lawyer (but n)ot a Sicilian one.""<br/><br/>Market-splitting is rampant in The Godfather. One family controls the Bronx, another Brooklyn, and so on. In a particularly apt bit of dialog, during the epic meeting of the five families, one head refers to the United States as being split into ""territories."" This meeting is the smoking gun of collusion amongst the five families. If they could survive evidentiary challenges, such gems as Don Corleone's ""When did I ever refuse an accommodation?"" would find prominent places in the prosecution's brief.<br/><br/>The tying in Coppola's film is blatant enough to make Yale, Hack v. Yale Corp., 237 F.3d 81 (2d Cir. 2000), or Microsoft, United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (per curiam), blush. And the ties that bind are first and foremost family ties. Hence the brilliant opening sequence of intercutting between shadowy interiors of business deals and sun-washed exteriors of the wedding, which lingers long enough—the latter replete with multi-generational singing, dancing and tribute-paying—to make us feel we're there, part of the family. The mistake of the father whose beseeching of Don Corleone opens the film was to miss this lesson. By not investing in respect for the family upfront, by forgetting that the contract with the Godfather is a deep basket of goods and services that one locks into for the long term, he insults the CEO. Only by signing up for the whole kit and caboodle—including reciprocity of a sort and at a time to be named later—does he get into the club. Hence the plausibility of Mike's claim at the end of the film that he is imposing exile—the ultimate punishment by the market dominator—on his brother-in-law. Sonny's career as family head is doomed not just because he's a hothead but also because he forgets that ultimately it's all about family.<br/><br/>All these shenanigans are ways of restraining trade. And how better to restrain trade than decapitate the $600,000 horse of a Hollywood producer who won't hire your guy and leave the head in his bed, to whack a Las Vegas developer who won't sell you his hotel, or to execute your competitors point blank under the mantle of family ties? While making offers that one figuratively can't refuse is generally market-promoting, making offers than one literally ""can't refuse"" is market-restricting.<br/><br/>So, would going after mob commerce under the antitrust laws be an unprecedented prosecution of a monopoly that the government itself sponsored? Nope. The government unwittingly sponsors monopolists all the time, by imposing so much regulation that potential entrants don't bother. Thus the Godfather is referring to America's political organs when he says, ""I believe in America. America's made my fortune."" And he is speaking on behalf of countless regulatorily entrenched incumbents—from banks to taxis, Katrina Miriam Wyman, Problematic Private Property: The Case of New York Taxicab Medallions, 30 Yale J. on Reg. 125 (2013)—too."

","This movie was the biggest let down of my life. From all of the hype and clout that comes with any conversation that involves ""The Godfather"", I was expecting some real action, from beginning to end, but instead Coppola uses only a few powerful scenes of violence to break up all of the dialogue used to explain what is going on, and the extremely exaggerated editing that adds about an hour and a half of unneeded movie time, which really took me away from the storyline. Not only was this movie to slow, but the writing I think could have been better. From viewing this movie once, I did not get that it was a story about Michael Corleone, it seemed more like a movie composed of typical situations in which gangsters of organized crime historically endured.

","I've tried to watch through this movie so many times without succeeding, and the reason to that is that the movie is incredibly boring. I know this is a very respected movie and considered one of the greatest movies ever, according to some the best movie ever. But I don't really see what's so great about it, the movie starts off boring and ends boring. I seriously cannot understand how anyone could watch through 3 hours of this crap. The movie is way to detailed, half of the stuff in the movie you don't even need to know, the acting was good and I give the storyline a meh. What ruined it all was the length and combining that with the movies boredom ruins it all. I have watched many movies, and I am a movie enthusiast, but this one does not even reach my top 50. Other movies like Stand By Me and The Green Mile etc are way better than The Godfather. Don't waste your time on this movie, its three hours of boredom. Watch Shawshank Redemption or Titanic instead. Even 8 Mile ranks higher than this on my top list. It is up to you, you can either give the movie a go, or just waste your time."

","The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence. <br/><br/>The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.<br/><br/>The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis."

"kickacan","7","0","1","4 March 2013"," Maybe a better Michael Corleone was in there
","I recently watched the Godfather again on DVD after many years - actually watched it twice. Obviously, this film is an icon in American pop-culture and there probably is nothing new to be said about it. But I will try to make a few fresh observations here. <br/><br/>After the first viewing about a week ago, I thought, this movie is sloppier and more sprawling than I remembered. After the second viewing, I saw how all the pieces came together to redefine the Hollywood gangster movie. <br/><br/>The sets, lighting, sound, dialogue and the entire atmosphere really draws the viewer into the past, even if the effect romanticizes gangster life. Most of the performers seemed to bring their best stuff to their roles. But, most of the main roles could have been fleshed-out more, in the script. <br/><br/>For example, two of the main actors, Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone and James Caan as Sonny, were very good and they could have carried more scenes. Also very good were some of the supporting actors like Richard Castellano as Clemenza, Sterling Hayden as McCluskey and especially Al Lettieri as Sollozzo. In fact, Lettieri was so compelling in his brief role as the criminal rival to the Corleone family that I wondered if he would have been better cast as the ""hero"" Michael Corleone. <br/><br/>Which brings me to Al Pacino's portrayal of Michael: Of course Pacino is one the great actors ever, but he underplayed the role and made Michael so lacking in charm and charisma, that I found it hard, not only to like him, but to believe he could pull off the things he did, like controlling a powerful crime family or even marrying a beautiful native girl during his time in Sicily. <br/><br/>I also found the portrayal of Tom Hagen a bit bland, probably more to do with the script than with the acting of Robert Duvall. Hagen was supposed to be an adopted family member, who was brought into the family as a boy and raised like a son and brother. Yet throughout the whole film, he never gets out of lawyer mode. Even actual lawyers frequently stop being a lawyer for a few minutes here and there. <br/><br/>A few scenes were a bit superfluous, particularly those featuring Diane Keaton as Michael's fiancé (maybe I'm just biased against Diane Keaton), but the Godfather is worth sitting through more than once.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I never read the book by Mario Puzo. This review only concerns the film itself, independent of the source material."

James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Cazale,Talia Shire and Diane Keaton also co star in memorable performances that contribute to the story.<br/><br/>The transformation of Michael from a man who wants nothing to do with his crime family to ruthless gangster is one of the most subtle and disturbing elements of cinema. I like to think of it as the dark unconventional side of the Hero's Journey. <br/><br/>The film is just epic in scope, spectacle and storytelling.

"ShibanPD","Null","0","1","12 November 2012"," The Godfather
","Francis Ford Coppola's mafia masterpiece is a three-hour family portrait—a brilliantly and beautifully rendered oil painting in motion. As impressive as his direction of scene and mise-en-scene is Coppola's direction of the actors. The director's authenticity filter was apparently tuned to a heightened level of sensitivity; not a moment of film goes by that makes you question its reality. The acting performances are at their most engaging during the quiet moments—the calms before and after the storms: Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen holding back tears, trying to remain interested in the demands of Sollozzo after he tells him of his adoptive father's demise; Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, as he musters up the courage and opportunity to take out Sollozzo and McCluskey; Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, losing all hopes of the life he had wished for his favored son when he learns of his acts of murder. The Godfather is so well-acted, so well-directed, and, from the perspective of character detail and human interest, so well-written by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, that we ignore (or forgive) the fact that the dramatic structure is disproportionate—that well over a third of the film has come and gone before the true hero decides to accept his journey, and that shortly after he does so, he is forced into temporary exile—onto a vacation of sorts—into a ""B"" plot that stars the now central character. This foray seems misplaced—even disruptive—from a dramatic standpoint, but it enriches the experience from a historical-interest perspective, and the contrast between the modest quality of life of the Old World and the opulence of the New World adds justification to the emigrated family's strong dedication to business success. This mild sagging in the second act points up the merits of the film as an experience. Indeed, there are multiple stretches where the film nearly lets the air out of the balloon to pursue character or relationship development as various constituents align themselves with or against the family. By fending off the tension escalation of a traditional thriller, The Godfather assumes the feel of real life, so that the ultimate showdown—the final dismissal of the ""bad"" guys, though dramatic in and of itself—set against the rising organ notes of the baptism of Michael's nephew—is somehow anti-climactic. The real climax happens at the very end, when Michael officially becomes what he swore at the beginning he was not, and would never become. Exactly what that is the film cleverly obscures: the head of an extended household, the president of a company, the king of an empire, or, least suggested, the leader of a gang of common criminals. This is the ""organized"" side of organized crime. These guys raise families, conduct business, and wage wars; the crimes they commit only appear as such to the larger community within which they move and influence. Until the final murder montage, and with the exception of Jack Woltz's unfortunate prize-winning race horse, the violence initiated by the Corleone family seems like justifiable revenge or preemptive self-defense; no one who gets it is innocent. And the brother we are led to identify with is presented as a war hero, a reluctant protector of his family, and the happy medium between two ineffective extremes: the quick-drawing, hot-headed Santino, and the calculating, ascetic lawyer, Tom Hagen. Through Michael, The Godfather assumes a coming-of-age flavor that is as thrilling in its adventurous exoticism, as it is frightening in its familiarity. Whether or not its analogies hold, the film offers, for the price of a view and a few hours of leisure time, the opportunity to become a patriarch, a CEO, an emperor, and a boss—all from the comfort and safety of your spectator's seat. Now that's an offer you can't refuse."
"simon-harris20","9","0","1","3 November 2012"," It's not personal. It's business.
","This is a masterpiece of modern film-making. Coppola has managed to make his audience care about a Mafia crime dynasty, as we follow the inevitable transition of power from the venerable Don Vito Corleone (Brando) to the youngest of his three sons Michael (Pacino). This was something that the ageing Don never wanted for Michael, wanting to see him legitimised as a Senator or a Governor, but fate and the violent nature of their chosen profession steps in. Impulsive and violent eldest son Sonny (Caan) is duped and gunned down in a drug war, and middle son Fredo is overlooked as he is just not Don material. Michael, however, is his father's son, and his path into the family business is partially forced on him after an attempt on his father's life. Humiliated and beaten by the New York Chief of Police (who is in the pocket of a rival mafia Family), his life changes when he makes a character defining decision to take revenge on both the Police Chief and a rival narcotics trafficker named Sollozo, who, having made the attempt on the Don's life, must now see it through or forever be a marked man. Michael completes the task with a steely eyed determination, and murders both men in a chilling scene in a family restaurant. Michael is then forced to flee the USA to hide in Sicliy under the protection of a friendly Mafia family. His character is further developed after he falls in love with and marries a beautiful Sicilian peasant girl, who is mistakenly murdered when his enemies track him down to Sicily. When Michael returns to America, he is not the same man that sat in his sister's wedding celebration at the start of the movie. He is older, wiser and surrounded as he has been by death and betrayal, those intervening years have been crucial to his character development. Like his father before him, he has chosen his path and has become a Don in waiting. This is an accolade that the older Don Corleone does not wait long to pass on to him, and although the old Don is still alive (surviving the five bullets Sollozo's assassins hit him with) he hands over the reins of power to Michael. Michael, now at the head of the business, accelerates the nefarious activities of the family. He seeks to relocate them to Nevada, but must tie up his New York business, split his territory between his Lieutenants Tessio and Clemenza fairly and settle old scores first. He uses his father as Consigliari, and Tom Hagen, the Families lawyer and Consigliari is quickly sidelined both because, as Michael tells him, he is not a wartime Consigliari, and because he needs his hands clean after the family re-settle in Nevada. The Assassination / Baptism scene is unparallelled, as Michael cuts down his enemies with a ruthlessness that maybe even the old Don did not possess, perhaps the reason why he stepped aside. These scenes are an interlinked series of brutal murders as Michael wipes the slate clean and assassinates anyone and everyone who have opposed the family. The genius is that the murders are interspersed with cutbacks to Michael standing as Godfather to his sister Connie's child, in Church, renouncing evil and Satan, as his Capo's and button men rampage through the remaining heads of the other five families. It is truly breathtaking film making. There has never been a better or stronger collection of actors ever assembled for any film before or since, and the dialogue is as memorable as anything ever committed to the page. There are no weak spots in this movie and the point to consider is that even though this is a film made against the background of crime and violence, and these play a huge part in what unfolds, it is essentially a film about family and loyalty. When the Corleone's decide to take murderous revenge on the heads of the other families, you do not turn from the screen at the savagery which is undoubtedly there to be seen, but instead, you root for Michael to be successful. There are simply too many memorable scenes to recount, but the final scene played out immediately after Michael orders that a Doctor be called for Connie because she is quite rightly hysterical (he has had her husband Carlo garroted out of revenge for Sonny's death) where Kay watches Michael's Capo's pay homage to him by kissing his hand/ring, while his Chief assassin, Neri slowly and deliberately closes the door in her face is the best ending in cinema history. I will end by stating that the Godfather II, is, if it were possible, even better. You will not regret watching this movie. It will stay with you for a long time after the final credits have rolled."

"bnijgomez","Null","0","1","1 October 2012"," This is a review for my Media Literacy Class
","The Godfather is a 1972 gangster film by Francis Ford Coppola that portrays the life of a family outsider who becomes a merciless head of one of New York's most dominant Mafia families: the Corleone's. Along with the Corleone's come four other rival and ally families striving to become the underground kings of New York in the late 1940's early 1950's. They fight for their power, respect, and pride as they interact with each other. The five families are the Corleone's, the Tallaglia's, the Barzini's, the Cueneo's, and the Stracci's. The families all have their sole leaders who are addressed as Dons. The Dons are Vito Corleone, Philip Tattaglia, Emilio Barzini, Ottilio Cueno, and Anthony Stracci. Throughout the film the Dons of each family gather together to discuss and try to resolve any differences they may have. In one scene, Jack Woltz, a studio head who did not comply, wakes up to find the head of his prized horse in bed with him. The horse head symbolizes the power they have and how easily they can kill. Another scene involves a dead fish wrapped in a vest to symbolize that the dead character ""sleeps with the fishes"". The fact that they use animals is symbolic. The families may have on-going conflicts but at the meetings there seems to be an established peace treaty. Despite there being four other Dons they all seem to look at Don Corleone as the most powerful. The Corleone family is a well-established one. They are very family oriented for the most part. The family consists of Vito, Sonny, Fredo, Michael, Carmela, Connie, Apollnia, Kay, and Sandra. The Corleone has very close allies including Pete Clemenza, Luca Brasi, and Tom Hagen; Vito's legal adviser. Don Vito Corleone is the main character in this film. He works hard to maintain the status of his family as an organized one. Although he is a crime boss he tries to have legitimate reasons for his actions. Don Vito is a high ranked man in Little Italy, New York. He has many connections and is always finding ways to build upon his empire and also giving back to the community. Don Corleone offers protection to many of the business owners in exchange for their loyalty and services. Since he is so powerful the other four Dons look to him as a growing threat. In the streets of Little Italy, there is an on-going crime war for territory, property, drugs, and all out power. The Corleone house is the family's protected safe haven where most of the movie's important sequences and dialogues are shown. The film takes a turn when Don Vito is severely injured and hospitalized. Control of the Corleone family is up for grabs so Sonny steps in as Don. Sonny is later set-up and killed. His death causes a stir between Don Vito and the other families. Sonny's character is the ""shoot first, ask later"" type of guy so when labeled Don, he immediately took action. Sonny and most of the other Dons, like most men, can't help but try to take on the role as an alpha male. Michael's character starts off as shy but eventually grows to learn the family business. Don Vito does not intend for his son Michael to join in the family business. Don Vito has surrounded himself is crime and wants a better life for his son. When Michael realizes his brother Fredo is too weak to be in charge, he takes control. Michael is a very intelligent man who understands he must pick up right where his father left off because in Mafia's, one mistake can lead to your family's demise. Though the film is about different Mafia families, the violence throughout the movie plays a very small role in the bigger picture. The ""rise to power"" cliché is about having the most allies and maintaining power through fear, not the actual action of killing. Michael's rise to power comes at a higher cost. It takes the deaths of his older brother, family enforcer, and wife for him to realize that he was meant for that lifestyle. If none of those deaths had occurred then Michael and his wife Kay would not be dragged into their new roles as a Don and his wife. Michael's first hit was sloppy but then Copalla makes it so that as Don, Michael's hits go smoothly. This makes it seem like the title Don matures Michael in a sense. The death of Michael's father, Vito Corleone, and the birth of his son, Anthony Corleone, symbolizes new beginnings for the Corleone family. At the end of the film, Michael is questioned by his wife about the death of his brother-in-law. Michael denies any involvement and his wife accepts his answer, he is then addressed as Don Corleone by his capos. When one door closes, another usually opens."

","Now, let's take a look at what anyone who is serious about film says is the greatest of all time. They're right. Both Godfathers stand alone as the two of the best scripted, acted, and directed films of all time. In all, they come out to the two best films. If you read some of my other reviews, you'll find that I consider a saga one film. A saga is best watched simultaneously. The Godfathers are a perfect example of how a series can get it right. Except the third. The third was just plain bad. Did Coppola really need to do this? Throw in another addition to the greatest saga in history? Sure, Andy Garcia was pretty spot-on as Sonny's illegitimate child. But they might as well have had someone like Dustin Hoffman play Michael, because he would've looked and sounded more like him than Pacino did at the time. And Sofia sucked. Good director, bad actress. It was not needed, because the first two were flawless. The ways of how this crime family rose, fell, rose, fell, etc., was perfect. I distinctly remember saying in one of my film classes (in front of a bunch of total film snobs) that Coppola is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. The other students stared at me with blank looks on their faces, as if I had told some horribly offensive jokes. Screw them. Why shouldn't he be considered? He deserves it, with The Godfather, Part II, Apocalypse Now, and The Conversation. Four classics. Did the other students not like it because he made a couple of flops (Jack, The Rainmaker)? All the best did (Kubrick-Eyes Wide Shut, Nolan-Insomnia), and they continue to be praised. I did enjoy The Outsiders, even if it doesn't come close to touching The Godfathers. Apart, they are masterpieces. Together, they are the definition of flawless filmmaking. <br/><br/>The genius behind the storyline is that we never see the Don at his peak. We see him just before his peak, and just after as well. Everything, from the script to the directing, makes this storyline perfect. But it is the acting that has the biggest aspect on the story. Two actors (De Niro and Branda, both two-time winners) won for the role of Don Vito. Also, the surrounding cast of Pacino, Duvall, Caan, and Keaton, make the film what it is, attached to a pitch-perfect script by Mario Puzo and Coppola. to quote Richard Roeper, saying you like film but have never seen The Godfather is like ""saying you love to drink but you've never had water."" Too true."

The shooting of Vito and the assassination of Sonny maybe explains a psychological turn to revenge (a little material showing the attachment between Michael and each of them would have been nice), but it's not enough for this transformation into a full-fledged mafia manager, interested in brothels and casinos. The character of Kay is pathetic, living among criminals and believing Michael's promises about changing his way of life. The whole movie is a collection of excuses to present sketches of violence."
"Hawkensian","10","0","2","9 August 2012"," A twisting, dramatic masterpiece whose success relies on perfect casting and Mario Puzo's excellent novel.
","It's hard to judge a film like 'The Godfather', especially for someone of my generation. Since its release in 1972, The Godfather has accrued a legendary status; it's difficult to watch a film that is often touted as the best of all time with an open mind and no preconceptions. However, after watching The Godfather many times and reading the novel on which it was based, it's clearly something very special. The film is a sprawling epic that rewards the viewer with a savagely twisting, multi- faceted plot. It's a mobsters' coming of age tale that's laced with tension, deception, tragedy, violence and death.<br/><br/>Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is introduced on the day of his daughter's wedding, a very special day in Sicilian tradition where the father of the bride is to deny no man a special favour. The beneficiaries' utmost respect for the Don is illustrated in the opening scene, their displays of courtesy coming in the form of personal address and greeting rituals. The Don is a man of respect and principle, a man who puts emphasis on what's fair, denying to avenge, for example, a father's anguish over the rape of his daughter by means of murder – 'That is not justice; your daughter's still alive'.<br/><br/>In other circles however; the Don is not so respected. Vito Corleone is an old fashioned Don, what is referred to as a 'Moustache Pete'; he is reluctant to delve into the business of drugs, unlike the contemporaries from the rival New York crime families. The Don's refusal turns the relationship between the Corleones and many of the other families sour. It is how the ensuing violence is regarded as just 'business' that is the cold, harsh danger of the film. Its depiction of violence is visceral and often occurs when not expected. Rather quickly, the Corleone criminal empire falls apart; the next generation having to revitalise the family and reclaim their place at the top of the five families.<br/><br/>The film is probably the most perfectly cast in history. The primary characters of Vito (Marlon Brando), Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Fredo (John Cazale), Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) and Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) are all expertly interpreted from Mario Puzo's magnum opus. The scores of supporting actors are also without fault. After reading the novel, it's remarkable how faithfully envisioned the characters are in the film, which is thanks to a combination of uncanny physicality and astute interpretation.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a brilliant adaptation of Mario Puzo's masterfully told story; the 1969 novel was written with such an authenticity that it almost seems like non-fiction in certain passages. I think it's true that when one thinks of a gangster, they picture the omnipotent Vito Corleone sitting back in his chair, his glum face contemplating with that infinite sagacity and authority.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a true spectacle in both mediums; deciding which is best is a difficult task. The only aspect that I felt was stronger in the book was character development. The character of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is given greater depth in the novel; Michael's transcendence seeming comparatively abrupt in the celluloid interpretation. The character of Luca Brasi is abundantly more powerful in the book, whom whilst is an ally of the Corleone family, is penned as an ominous villain with a dark, brutal secret. The film, meanwhile, essentially depicts Brasi as an oaf. This depiction is understandable, Brasi is an old-timer who is firmly within a closing chapter of the Corleone family, however I was surprised by how markedly less intimidating a figure he was. <br/><br/>Additionally, many of the supporting characters are also given interesting back stories by Puzo, notably Captain McCluskey. Of course, that level of intricacy is possible in a novel, while a film could easily become bloated with such detailing.<br/><br/>Ultimately, 'The Godfather' is a film made by a highly talented crew who combined the seminal prose of a skilled author with brilliant direction, perfect performances, effective cinematography and the utterly beautiful, iconic music of Nino Rota and Carlo Savina to produce one of the best, well rounded and moving films ever made. It is a film that is wholly deserving of the term 'required viewing'."

","Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.<br/><br/>The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy."

","Now as this is my favourite movie ever made it is going to be hard for me not to be bias towards this movie and I will try and be as objective as I possibly can.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of the first Godfather film and it's story I've read the book, played the game and watched the movie countless times. The story is a great story of a family. That is what the story is basically about the family and how they cope in all these different situations. Now I'm a huge fan of gangster movies and this movie is the best of them.<br/><br/>The movie has some of the best cast of actors I have ever seen in a movie, with actors such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Cann, John Cazale and many other fantastic actors it would be hard not to make a masterpiece. Each character is exactly as you imagine them to look and act in the book and this movie is one of the few movies where it is actually as good or even better than the book.<br/><br/>The only negative I can find about this movie is that it is abit of an unrealistic take on the Mafia and glorifies them more than what they were. As the movie shows them being very close like a family even the ones that aren't related, but in actual fact it would be best friends killing each other in the mafia as seen in movies such as Goodfellas or Donnie Brasco. But those movies are supposed to be dark and gritty realistic movies. But this movie isn't; it's supposed to be a movie about a family which just so happens to be in the mafia.<br/><br/>I have never met anyone that has not liked this movie and most people put it up there with the best. Which it deserves it is a masterpiece. The acting is terrific, the costume and set design is amazing and the story keeps you interested even when it is just dialogue. These are all the reasons why this movie is my favourite movie ever and why it deserves 10 our of 10 stars!"
"vid8","10","0","2","4 June 2012"," A perfect movie in every aspect.
","What can I say, an outstanding movie, certainly the best that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The Godfather depicts organised crime in a way that no other film ever has, or ever will. Although there is violence, it is put in very discretely- instead choosing to focus on the Italian family values that the Godfather and his heir, Michael, have adopted. It is a beautiful portrait of a seemingly happy family, with dark secrets. Eventually, the family suffers because of their underworld status, and Michael Corleone eventually takes over the family, with all of his father's wisdom, but with the ruthlessness of his late brother. The direction and the acting of the Michael character is exceptional. Al Pacino portrays him perfectly, and Francis Ford Coppola masterfully directed his transition from family rebel and sweet Westernised man to aggressive and ruthless kingpin of the family business.<br/><br/>The music is another pivotal part of the movie. Nino Rota's famous main theme of the Godfather will stick in anybody's head for the remainder of their life. The lighting is also very well done, with the dark orange colour which adds to the overall effect of the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, a brilliant masterpiece, with no flaws whatsoever, 10 out of 10."

Under his belt, Coppola had one of the best casts ever to appear together on screen. In the main role is the legendary Marlon Brando in what is probably his best performance ever. Alongside him you see the brilliant Al Pacino in his first major role, the amazing Robert Duvall and the great James Caan. The supporting cast also counts on Diane Keaton, John Cazale and Talia Shire. Thus begin the best movie franchise of all time. Sit back and watch this powerful film."
"max-swindlehurst","10","0","1","10 May 2012"," A masterpiece of cinema. One of the greatest films of all time.
","Francis Ford Coppola directed an absolute masterpiece on film when he made the immortal classic ""The Godfather"", which was adapted from Mario Puzo's best selling book about the inner working and ordeals of the Corleone Family who was head of the powerful Mafia organization. An excellent screenplay, excellent actors and excellent cinematography makes this one of the best films ever produced and its not hard to see why. The film stars Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone aka ""The Godfather"", Al Pacino as The Godfather's son Michael, James Caan as Sonny who is The Godfather's eldest son and heir apparent, John Cazale as Fredo, the ""innocent"" son of Vito Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie the daughter and last but not least Robert Duvall as ""Tom Hagen"" as the adviser to the Don. The rest of the supporting cast is outstanding as well.<br/><br/>The screenplay is faithful to the storyline of the book, which excludes some chapters from the novel, however this doesn't diminish the movie in anyway. It is a story, ultimately a tragic one, about the powerful Corleone Family and the internal strife, struggle, loyalty and love mixed in with a need for power ultimately makes victims of all members of the family. I am sure all who have seen the movie know the plot well, and for those who haven't seen the movie, I wont spoil any of it, since it is a movie ""you cant refuse"" to see. The ultimate lesson of the movie in my opinion is ""Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely"".<br/><br/>The characters in the movie are supposedly based on real life Mafioso's such as real Gambino crime boss Sam ""Boom Boom"" Giancana is the inspiration for Vito Corleone and Johnny Fontaine is based on Frank Sinatra as it will be easy to see when the viewer watches the movie.<br/><br/>This is a true classic in every sense of the word and I can't recommend it highly enough for those who enjoy classic movies and movies that last throughout time. This is only the opening chapter however and there are two more movies (Godfather II and III) in this incredible saga that are just as brilliant as this one and I highly recommend that they be viewed as well to see the ultimate tragedy of the Corleone Family."
"deepesh-355-609949","9","0","2","3 May 2012"," The Godfather
","A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits.<br/><br/>Of the many themes which The Godfather touches upon, it is that of ""family"" which resonates the most. The film is based upon the novel by Mario Puzo (who co-wrote the screenplay) and many sub-plots were minimized or thrown away by director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola, himself an Italian American and family man. He knew that the only way to make Puzo's sprawling novel work on screen was to focus on the familial relationships within this crime story, whether it be father to son, brother to brother, or husband to wife. In this world blood is not only thicker than water, it is holy.<br/><br/>Coppola opens the films with an interesting shot of a pitch black screen giving way to a desperate figure, an undertaker pleading to Mafioso patriarch Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) to revenge the savage beating of his daughter. It is the wedding day of the lone Corleone daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request, which Don Vito takes on with reason, while also subtlety enforcing his position as a man to be respected and feared.<br/><br/>Brando's casting was a coup for Coppola, for three reasons. First, it exhibited the brilliance and innovation of Brando's thespian prowess, creating a wholly new mafia figure within a world of stereotype. Second, it re-established Brando's standing as a major player after years of being labeled ""box-office poison"". And third, it points to Brando's influence as ""godfather"" to a generation of actors, many which play his children in this film.<br/><br/>Plot wise, The Godfather begins with the attempted assassination of Don Vito from a rival crime family unhappy with his refusal to enter the narcotics trade. With the Don temporarily out of the picture, it is up to his sons to run the Corleone clan. There is hot tempered Sonny (James Caan), meek mild Fredo (John Cazale), adopted son of Irish ancestry Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and the fiercely independent Michael (Al Pacino).<br/><br/>It would be Michael who comes through as successor, and as a result The Godfather is as much Pacino's film as it is Brando's, introducing himself with a revelation of a performance."

"armanmarok","10","0","2","3 April 2012"," The Most Outstanding Achievement In Motion Picture of The 20th Century
","Steven Spielberg once said he considered retiring after watching The Godfather. Stanley Kubrick admitted The Godfather may very well be the greatest movie ever made and without a doubt has the best cast. If two of the greatest directors of all time had claimed such statement, what more needs to be said about this masterpiece, really? By now, it's already a stuff of legend. Countless lists and people have rated this as the finest motion picture to ever grace the silver screen. The genre and cinema itself have been heavily influenced by the contents in the movie, and even real-life mafias mimicked how Don Vito Corleone, portrayed by Marlon Brando in what I consider to be the most splendid acting job done by any actor or actress in any movie ever, carried himself. When did you ever hear something like that happened? If there was ever any? I doubt Francis Ford Coppola himself would have thought his first big directorial job would have given birth to an enduring legacy THIS big. Sure, he had Marlon Brando in his pocket, complete with Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, James Caan, and Robert Duvall as future stars just to name a few, which must have been exciting for a young director for that time. But I still doubt Coppola would have known he was directing the greatest motion picture of the 20th century even once during the entire 62 days of shooting, even when he, the entire casts, and the entire crews gave it their all for those 62 days. But that magic was there. And it is now known throughout the world as The Godfather.<br/><br/>I think the story is rather famous now, but I'll say it anyway. It tells the story of an organized crime family after the World War II was over. Spanning over 10 years, the movie was a journey of the youngest son (played brilliantly by the legendary Al Pacino) transformed from a war hero not wanting to have anything to do with his family's business to become the next head of an organized crime dynasty.<br/><br/>It featured brilliant performances from every single person involved, especially the mythical Marlon Brando. Every scene he was in, no way you didn't have your eyes on him. Even when he wasn't around, you would still feel his presence and power. His character, to me at least, made this movie. No one could play him as grand as Marlon Brando did.<br/><br/>On technical aspect, this movie is flawless. Coppola's directing really captured the quintessence of every character in the movie. The dark photography added to the whole mystique of every scene in this movie. And the last but definitely not the least, the score is magical.<br/><br/>What else is there need to be said about this masterpiece? Only a few movie can be called perfection, The Godfather is a prime example of it. Everything in this movie is so unbelievably perfect it is almost unreal. How come something became this great is hard to decipher. This timeless classic is a definite must see for anyone. And among many movies made in the 20th century I have seen, this is the best of the best. The finest of the finest. Maybe several movies can come close, but I don't think anything can top this. I firmly believe The Godfather is without a doubt the most brilliant motion picture of the 20th century."

There's no clichés or corny moments, no annoying, useless characters, and its about as original as it comes in all aspects of story. The Corleone family is both evil and moral, both sympathetic and begging for hatred, both understandable and from another world. Vito Corleone is a ruthless crime boss, but at the same time, has standards and a sense of right and wrong. Michael Corleone goes from being a war hero who claims that he is not his family, to a mafia don more ruthless than his father. Sonny, his older brother, is a loose cannon, but with method to his madness. Every time I watch this movie, I ask myself: How did Coppola and Puzo do it? How can this movie be described as anything except perfect? If I have ANY gripe with The Godfather, at the toll booth, there's no way that somebody could take that many rounds and still not be incapacitated. Yeah, people don't always drop with one round in real life, but fifteen guys opening up on full auto with .45 ACP rounds from a Tommy Gun is going to kill pretty damn quickly!

There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons.

","The Godfather (1972) is an intricate yet compelling story about the Corleone family who is involved with the Italian mafia in New York in the 1940's. This movie shows the revenge, greed, and betrayal, between the Corleones and the mafia. Marlon Brando does a superb job playing the godfather who is the leader of the mafia, or Vito as they call him. His character gives one insight to what the mafia really is about and the business deals among them. Other actors such as Al Pacino and James Caan also portray their characters Michael and Sonny as the sons of the godfather very well too. Michael at the beginning of the movie has no interest in being involved in the mafia and by the end he has taken over the family business. People get to see first hand the transformation of these characters from beginning to the end of the movie. The story line makes this movie much more fascinating yet harder to follow than your average movie. Each scene that takes place in the movie is essential to understanding and delving in even deeper into the history of the Corleones and their involvement with the mafia. The great acting, excellent dialogue, and an ever-changing plot is what sets this movie apart from the rest. I recommend this movie to any movie fanatic. The Godfather is more aimed towards older teens and adults because of the complicated storyline and the violence shown."
"pumishmumi","9","0","1","16 December 2011"," Cinematic perfection, why not 10/10?
","The Godfather is one of maybe 3 or 4 of those 'perfect movies'. The ones where no matter how many times you watch it, you can't nit-pick anything wrong, unnecessary, even if your life depended on it. It has an amazing story, incredible (and subtle) acting, great cast overall, and it is consistently gripping for the 3-hour run time. There is no trace of any laziness or mistake.<br/><br/>So why shouldn't I give this a perfect rating while we're at it? Well, two reasons mainly.<br/><br/>The first is universal: Despite it's Cinematic perfection, the way I see a perfect movie is if no one hated it. If ANY human being watched this movie from start to finish, they would be on the edge of their seat for 178 minutes (and I mean ANYONE who watched this, not one person left behind). It seems a little like splitting hairs if one person would lean back for a second and no longer calling this movie 'perfect', but when I hear that word, I expect people to mean what they say. And judging from the few hateful reviews I've seen on this one, it just doesn't quite make the cut.<br/><br/>Second, I would be one of those people who happened to sit back for a portion of the movie, mostly after Don Vito came back from the gunshot scene. I was thrilled and angry at the same time, but seeing as how he went on with business as before, I figured it was a break in the movie for everyone to re-cap so far. Bottom line, I got lost a little after that.<br/><br/>Again, if the Godfather were perfect, then it would have a prefect 10/10 overall rating as well, and not the 9.2 it currently has. Still, I recommend anyone who likes movies to watch this one. It will most likely be worth your while."

","There's no sense fighting the general consensus about this uber-classic. I refuse to use words like ""overrated"" and you probably don't care that I don't care for mob movies, because I consider thugs in expensive suits no more heroic than thugs without expensive suits.<br/><br/>Having said that, I was amazed with Pacino (stunning performance) and particularly Coppola, who was such an amazingly slick and accomplished director at such a young age. His use of light and music is superb. His framing makes the atmosphere intimate and believable. This movie is laced with iconic scenes, has great pacing and is blessed with great production values throughout. Wow.<br/><br/>The bad: Brando is a joke (as he often is). Also, I didn't think the storytelling was particularly tight; you could find more holes in the plot than in Sonny C's body.

The acting, the script, the music, the characters, the story, the screenplay, costumes, art, direction everything is just near perfect.

"mrs_ponpuda","Null","0","1","19 September 2011"," What a classic
","That was a classic, this is what you'll hear about this movie. The Godfather has set the stage since it's release in 1972, for all other movies in it's class. All ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have won as many awards. The difference between this movie and the rest is that this film apart has the ability to weave the often-many layers of story into a firm whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, reinforced by so many complimentary themes, each is given added ring. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion. Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. It is obvious that this motion picture was not put together just for the fun of it, to make people laugh; it was carefully crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it. The film opens in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court. It is the wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request on that day. So the supplicants come, each wanting something different - revenge, a husband for their daughter, a part in a movie. The family has gathered for the event. Michael (Al Pacino), Don Vito's youngest son and a Second World War hero, is back home in the company of a new girlfriend (Diane Keaton). The two older boys, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there as well, along with their ""adopted"" brother, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the don's right-hand man. With the end of the war, the times are changing, and as much as Don Vito seems in control at the wedding, his power is beginning to erode. By the standards of some, his views on the importance of family, loyalty, and respect are old fashion. Even his heir apparent, Sonny, disagrees with his refusal to get into the drug business. Gambling and alcohol are forces of the past and present; narcotics are the future. But Don Vito will not compromise, even when a powerful drug supplier named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) arrives with promises of high profits for those who back him. Don Vito's refusal to do business with Sollozzo strikes the first sparks of a war that will last for years and cost many lives. Each of the five major mob families in New York will be devour by the bloodshed, and a new order will emerge. Betrayals will take place, and the Corleone family will be shaken to its roots by betrayed from both within and without. The Corleone with the most screen time is Michael (it's therefore odd that Al Pacino received a Best Supporting Actor nomination), and his tale, because of its scope and breadth, is marginally dominant. His transformation from ""innocent"" bystander to central manipulator is the stuff of a Shakespearean tragedy. By the end, this man who claimed to be different from the rest of his family has become more ruthless than Don Vito ever was. Don Vito is a most complicated gangster. In his own words, he is not a killer, and he never mixes business with personal matters. He puts family first (""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man"") and despises displays of weakness. He understands the burden of power, and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the ""throne"", is one of The Godfather's most revealing moments (about both father and son). Family responsibility. A father's legacy. The need to earn respect. The corrupting influence of power. These are some of the ingredients combined in Francis Ford Coppola's cinematic blender. They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries. Motifs Return to Sicily Michael, Connie, and Kay, all principle characters, are in all three movies, while secondary characters like Archbishop Gliday or Senator Geary appear in only a single film. Of course, such a structure makes sense. The plot follows the most significant characters, while the less significant die or are forgotten. But every rule has its exceptions. In the Godfather trilogy, one such exception is the insignificant, little-known Don Tommasino. Tommasino appears in every movie because he is Vito's and Michael's host and friend in Sicily, the island of Vito's birth to which characters return in every film. In the Godfather films, Don Tommasino may be a minor character, but Sicily is not. Sicily seems to be the mystical place, but in reality, it is a world full of violence and bloodshed. Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are all ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families. The word ""Mafia"" conjures up images of the sinister and mysterious - scenes of the sort where Luca Brasi meets his fate. Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience."

"nightofthereaper","10","0","2","27 August 2011"," A father trying to pass his legacy and empire to one of his sons and that one son having to come to terms with his own legacy and the choices he makes.
","In cinema, there are few films that can, at all, be considered either great, and fewer that can be considered perfect. Mario Puzo's The Godfather is one of those films that is perfect. Being based of off the best seller by Mario Puzo, director Francis Ford Coppola creates one of the most accurate portrayals of an Italian crime family. When most people think about films that deal with the Mafia, Italian gangsters, what they think about is people that ship drugs, deal with prostitution, and above all else, just fight others for the hell of it. But, what makes The Godfather so different is that, contrary to the rather dark, violent nature of the film, this movie destroys all stereo types as it becomes a film that is not, at all, about running a crime family. This film is REALLY about a father trying to pass his legacy and empire to one of his sons and that one son having to come to terms with his own legacy and the choices he makes. When Mario Puzo decided to originally write the novel that this film is based on, he did it only for the money and nothing else. But what he did not expect was to have his entire creation take a complete life of it's own in a way that only few people can imagine. Even more so was the shock of how well this film did. Want a little taste of how well this film did? Before the film was even released, The Godfather Part II was already in development. But, more on that later. Now, my complete reaction to watching this film. To say that this is one of my personal favorite films of all time would be something of a drastic understatement. With me, there are some films that you like and some that change your life. This is one of those films that changes your life with each and every viewing. When I first sat down and watched this film, I remember feeling complete once the credits started to role. I know that sounds cheap, but it is true. Everything from the story to they way Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is in this film, it just spoke to me in a way that very few films can ever do. And I am not the only one that felt this way. There is a magic in this movie that can never be paralleled and the closes that we get (and one that is pretty damn close at that) is the sequel that is said to be equal to better then this film. But more on that later. Let's get down to the details. With direction, Coppola does wonders. He keeps the story moving, never dragging behind, and keeps making you interested with the look of the film. While some have complained about the lighting used as being too dark of a film or too gold, I say that the use of that is, quite fantastic. The reason why is because it always sets the mood for the scene and the tone that you will end up feeling. Plus, little added in items like the use of oranges in some scenes give this film a little kick by letting the audience know that something is about to go down. For the direction, Coppola, you do wonders. And the Academy Award for Best Direction was well won and deserved. Now the acting. Oh, my God. What can I say? Well, let's think. Marlon Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor and Al Pacino won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Need I say more? Okay, I will talk about the supporting cast. With huge names like Richard Dreyfus, James Caan, Abe Vigoda, and Diane Keaton, this film is filled with some of the greatest talent that money can buy. But what shocks me the most is that they treat this film with such a tone of seriousness that they literally stop becoming themselves and become these incredible people. Next the score. Like so many classic films, this film's score is something of a staple in film history. Mostly due to the famous 'The Godfather Waltz', Nina Rota became a household name in the music world due to the simplicity of that piece. It was simple, yet set the tone perfectly. The only crime that has ever been done on this film was the score not being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score. Oh well. Later on, this film saga will get it's award. Finally the script. Being adapted from the novel by Mario Puzo, and being written by him and Coppola, this film mirrors the novel so closely that you would only have to read the novel to know more about the extra characters that are not THAT huge. The dialogue is authentic, honest, and bold as this well written script is presented. The Academy Award for Best adapted Screen play was also well deserved. Overall, this entire film is worthy of the magnitude that it has gotten, the awards it has won (including Best Film), and the hearts and souls it has touched. Easily one of the greatest films ever made."
"hassan-ilahi","10","0","2","16 August 2011"," The Greatest American Film Ever Made
","Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' is perhaps the best gangster story ever told and the best film ever made. It's an enriching, engrossing, and evocative look into the criminal underworld in perspective of the Corleone family. This is also one of the rarest films to come out without any flaws. As far as it goes, The Godfather is literature for movie-goers and respectfulness for critics. It boasts legendary performances, excellent direction, a brilliant script, and a smooth, peaceful soundtrack.<br/><br/>This film wouldn't have been this good if not for Marlon Brando's absolutely amazing performances as Don Vito Corleone. His character has gone down in history as one of the most sophisticated, yet graceful characters of Cinema. Brando is widely known today as the greatest actor that's ever lived. Al Pacino, is brilliant, if not perfect in this film. He plays Michael Corleone with a certain innocence, yet jealousy for all he's worth. This actor is also known as one of the best actors in the world. You would have to also thank an excellent supporting cast that includes people like Diane Keaton, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Sterling Hayden.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola's direction is trustworthy and often rewarding, as he leads this film in the right direction. The sets and scenery are often beautiful and intriguing, which matches the silent tone of this film. Since this is set in very old periodic places, this is a great example of old New York and Italy. The greatest scene in this film involves only Brando and Corleone. It's a scene of such scope and emotions that it's hard to describe it.<br/><br/>Even though this material is based on Mario Puzo's wonderful books, it's hard to notice it. The film is so fluent and straightforward, that it's hard to pick up any flaws or evident mistakes in this. The writing is nevertheless excellent and even though there's no narration, this film never leaves you bored.<br/><br/>And last, the soundtrack by Nino Rota is quite something. It's a very smooth, soothing soundtrack that is based on Italian music. This is very original and never leaves you disappointed with itself.<br/><br/>Overall, there's no doubt this is an examination of American classical Cinema. Completely flawless and highly recommended for any movie buff. If you haven't seen The Godfather, then I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse. See it and you will definitely adore it."

","Yes its a guy line and this is by far the greatest guy movie ever made. Any man who has watched The Godfather knows how much this movie would have touched him and his soul. He would have felt like going into a parallel universe and coming out refined. Such is the sheer magnitude and power this movie commands. A long story about one great gangster is not a story about a gangster itself. It is the story of every human that you see in the world everyday or every father you see everyday. It is a story of a father who is trying to pass on his legacy to this sons and as always there will be a son who will want to make it on his own. But there comes a time when the son will realize that family comes first.<br/><br/>The steeling portrayal of Don Vito Corleone by Marlon Brando will be one of the most haunting performances that you will ever see on screen. The deep voice, the heavy face with a small frown and the look which says even if you point a gun a gun to my face I will still blow your head off is empowering and scary at the same time. But the subtleties and pain of a man who has power are the things you might remember about him the most. <br/><br/>Then comes the young Italian Al Pacino. He looks like the wimpy son of a army general dad but dare you not forget that the blood of the king of gangsters runs through him. He is not muscle, he is the brain. The way he just sits down and thinks about his moves and executes them in deadly precision makes him just as good a Godfather as his father. <br/><br/>The remaining members of the cast consisting of James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, Diane Keaton etc. are all extremely praise worthy. The bottom line is that this movie had the best cast, the best direction and the best script in the history of cinema. <br/><br/>The flow of this magnum sized cinema is amazing as it does not let the viewer off its leash. The intricacies of the film and the way it swerves and squirms and rolls and down right destroys sometimes is amazing.<br/><br/>For Mario Puzo's book, the brilliant screenplay, the brilliant cast and just about everything associated with this movie it gets a 10/10. <br/><br/>P.S. - Address him as The Godfather"

","I mean, really, what hasn't been said about this film yet? That's right, nothing, and so I'll now write a review that doesn't go anywhere.<br/><br/>There are those that say this (or maybe pt2) is the best movie ever made, but I couldn't agree with that. One of the best, yes, but not the best. And then you have those who say it's overrated and boring. I think those people are just not used to extremely long movies anymore, and that's sad, because these people are missing out on some other awesome long movies (casino, GF 1,2,3, Heat, Once upon a time in the west, etc.) Anyway, back to the movie. It was the breakthrough for several great actors, including Marlon Brando, in the brilliant role of the compassionate but cruel Don Corleone, and Al Pacino of course, in the role of Michael, the Don's son who didn't want to take over the Corleone empire at first but in the end does anyway. When I fist sat down to see this movie it was with thoughts of 'overrated' and 'way too long', but the 2h55 just flew by, really. Though it was the longest movie I'd ever seen, it felt no longer than say Inception, which is 30min shorter and (in my opinion) a really boring movie, and at the end I couldn't wait for pt2, so it was a convenience that I had it standing right next to me in my DVD-rack."

"dapadula13","Null","0","1","15 March 2011"," Among the best films ever made
","This is mostly in response to some of the bad reviews I've read on this on the site. It absolutely contains spoilers. If you haven't seen it yet, do it, and then please come back and read this, especially if you didn't like the movie.<br/><br/>While it may not be the greatest movie ever made, it is certainly my personal favorite and is up there among the best with movies like Citizen Kane and Casablanca. One of the main criticisms I saw of this film was that it was too long. This is pathetic. 3 hours, in the great scheme of things, is really not that long. If you really want to give the film a chance, you can manage keeping your eyes open for that long. That being said, its length is necessary to manage the progression of the story. Think about it: there is not one scene that can be removed from the film and have it keep its composure.<br/><br/>This leads me to the second main criticism, that it is too long-winded, and as some people say, has no plot at all. This is simply false. The main crux of the story, for those who refused to look for it, is the development of Michael from a puppy-eyed guy who had a swell gal and hated his father's business to a cold-hearted, truly evil character who oversees half of the film's deaths in a matter of 20 minutes, movie time. Some claim that this transformation is not called for, and that it seems too sudden, but there is really a cause and effect. McCluskey punches him, he gets mad, realizes that he should kill Sollozzo and McCluskey, goes to Italy, comes back heartbroken after the murders of Appollonia and Sonny, and finally snaps when Vito passes. Of course, this leads to his rise as Don Corleone, giving him the power to execute Barzini, Tattaglia, Cuneo, Zaluchi, and Moe Greene. It's actually very well thought out.<br/><br/>Then people say ""Why wasn't Vito like this?"" The reason why Vito is such an interesting character is that he is not like his counterparts in the other families. Pay close attention to the film and you will note that he never orders the death of anyone. The closest he comes is in the very beginning when he takes Bonasera's request, but he specifically states that the two men who beat his daughter are to suffer, but not to die, because it is not ""just."" Perhaps equally as close is the warning to Michael that someone (Tessio) will betray him to Barzini. He never says to kill the person, it was basically just a heads-up. He clearly regrets that Bruno Tattaglia was killed, and especially that Sollozzo and McCluskey were killed by Michael. It is Vito's near-pacifism that exaggerates the ultimate development of Michael. Indeed, Michael waited for Vito's death to kill Carlo; Vito would have never approved of that. A second facet of this is his refusal to participate in narcotics. He says to Sollozzo it's merely for political reasons, and understandably so. But Vito is a moral man, and at this stage of his life, he sees the evil of his ways. I have yet to see The Godfather Part II, but it would not surprise me if Vito had some sort of epiphany in the course of the plot that led him to see his error. <br/><br/>And if you can't understand him, you're not trying hard enough. Watch it twice if you have to.<br/><br/>People also rant about the lack of violence in the film, but this is ridiculous. If it were advertised as an action film, then I could see the point. But that is not the case. And in addition, when shooting comes, like in the baptism scene, you can't ask for much more in 1972 than what you see there.<br/><br/>Finally, the film is criticized for alleged glorification of the mafia business. I will admit that this is romanticized, but neither Mario Puzo nor Francis Ford Coppola sets out to create accuracy. In addition, people haven't really had a problem with more recent films like The Town, which gave back stories to bank robbers. In fact, Jon Hamm's cop character was easily the least likable character in that film, though the world usually perceives him as the good guy. For older movies, look to Best Picture winner All Quiet on the Western Front, from the perspective of Germans in World War I. Just because it's from the perspective of the ""bad"" side doesn't mean it's glorifying them.<br/><br/>Okay, my rant is over. I've pretty much covered not only why criticisms fail, but also why this movie stands as one of the greatest of all time. The only criticism I may have of this film is Connie's reaction to Carlo's death. Carlo was very abusive to her, and she was clearly unhappy in her marriage, but she is extremely distraught and calls Michael a ""bastard"" after hearing of Carlo's death. It seems inconsistent, but it's not nearly enough to outweigh the final few seconds of the film, let alone everything else that makes The Godfather the classic it is."

","Today, i have finished watching Godfather 3. After the film, i looked for whom vito carlione was at IMDb so to find out what other films he starred at; yet i saw, it's writing (1924-2004). Eventually, i got very sad. Firsly, i supposed the Godfather film as it is real: so much money property fame murder desire pride, on the other hand see that it's now 2010, and he died in 2004. So there is no sensible relation with the environment, world that i dreamed. He is at the moment accounting for his life, actions which were in this life, this is so much sorrowful that not my eyes but my heart is crying, suffering. How much have i been deceived, made mistake throughout my life. In my mind were some wishes going about, like i wish michael carlione wouldn't have killed his elder brother, at last he himself like his father died on a chair all alone inspite of the trasure, proerty, money, fame. It is so sad inspite of being just a film. I'm not sure if al pacino lives, even he -took a deep breath for sad- Alas me too have died one day all alone, and now i'm asked to account for my life, my actions, my desires. However, i have deceived myself in this deceiving world, shut the sound that tells the truth, the right thing. I have always pursued something seemingly nice but in fact harmful,deceiving as now.As it were, i was the servant, -that is a bit indignity-the dog of this bad sound. Alaaas... Alaaas. What will it help if i were a godfather like don vito carlione or michael. At last, the suffering, very suffering but with the witness of thousands of deads everyday the death, the reckoning after death. I think i have no remedy other than seek forgiveness and help from God, really no remedy else. I always remember the scene that michael was falling and dying on his chair alone, and the sad film music is playing in my mind. Very sad... What remedy else could i have that, now it is really the most important need if anyone has a remedy..."

","After experiencing the Godfather many years ago, I finally made my mind up that this might be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Taking a humanistic viewpoint on an unbelievable and fictitious Italian family mob, The Corleone's, communicates to me how truly ""unAmerican"" this movie is. Seeing how Michael Corleone (aka Al Pacino's worst role) is experiencing inner dualism between morales and his family showed me how boring this movie really is. When I'm watching a good ""American"" film I want action, not character development! This movie was one big slumber-fest and there wasn't enough boobs!<br/><br/>But what truly made me come to this decision was discovering the pile of popcorn and butter vomit that came from my mouth onto my smart phone's IMDb application, after revisiting this so called winner of ""Best Picture,"" ""Best Actor,"" and ""Best Adapted Screenplay."" Critics of Coppola's uncreative, cookie-cutter, three hour long cheep film cheated and lied to the American population. Make no mistake, this ""Italian"" cultured film is worse than a serving of stuffed calamari in tomato sauce with no garlic, rotten eggs, and a pregnant squid pulled out of the Sarno River. <br/><br/>For the those of you spent time to even explore the other two parts of the story, I apologize. When I eventually got up from my imitation leather lazy-boy for a bathroom break all that came out was Marlon Brando's crappy performance. Not to mention Diane Keaton ""expanding"" her acting career... should of stayed with Woody. I feel this movie was pretentious and belittled the American audience. Even Italian film theorist Jean Epstein would probably say, this movie was about as sincere as using Ragu in spaghetti. For my own taste, I'm going to stick with the true mob classics like Corky Romano and Mobsters (with the truly talented Christian Slater). Thanks for the waste of time Francis Ford Coppola!"

The movie kept a nice balance between dialogue and action scenes, and the action scenes were in very good taste (meaning they weren't ""over-done"" with gallons of fake blood and/ or over-exaggerated pain).

"ochoamanuel21","10","0","2","7 February 2011"," The Essential Mobster Movie
","Besides romanticizing the idea of being a mobster, the movie marks the end of an era and the beginning of a new idea. The whole concept is the patriarch of this mobster family seeing the end of a profit for innocent leisure activities such as gambling and running molasses when new mobsters want in on the narcotics business which is just dirty business since it involves addiction and not just plain drinking and gambling. The viewer sees how the old ideals of the 1920s which are embodied with the Don conflict with the new ideals of the 1950s which is the business of narcotics. It is an epic of the Don's youngest son, Michael, how he refuses the idea of being a part of the family and how his love for his father forces him to be more ruthless and calm than his father and his brother, since he takes action right away by killing Solozzo and the police captain for being corrupt and to top it off kills off the heads of the five families just to solidify the Corleone family power. This is the essential mobster movie since solidifies the idea of an organized crime effort with the Boss, the Underbosses who are next in line, the Capo Regime and the soldiers modeled after the Roman Empire as mentioned in Part II by Tom Hagen. While the sequel is arguably one of the best sequels of all time, the original excels in showcasing how this mobster empire conflicted with new ideals but came up on top with nothing but ruthlessness and calm precision by Michael."

Al Pacino makes his breakthrough performance in this movie as Michael Corleone, who just wants to live his own life outside of his family's lifestyle. James Caan plays the hostile, hot-headed Sonny Corleone in a way that can only be described as if he were living the role. I could sit here and describe every single role in this movie, but that would take much more than 1,000 words.<br/><br/>The music and lighting set a dark yet warming tone to the otherwise gritty setting here.

Each main character is portrayed differently and has their own unique personality and as in reality, these characters change throughout the movie and the trilogy as a whole. In particular I believe that Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone and Al Pacino as the tragic character of Michael Carleone were the standout performances, but each actor and actress should gain respect and recognition for contributing to this work of art. The music in the film is absolutely stunning and is a perfect portrayal of love and respect. In turn, the music adds to the film's overall greatness. Most of the people who criticize this movie as boring to too lengthy and those who have not yet seen it. I can understand why this film has been listed as the best movie of all time.

I understand that there's more depth in The Godfather than most movies of the time. I don't know, I keep a pretty open mind to movies and the different eras they were made in. 1970-1980 just isn't a popular decade for me. So far, The Godfather series is probably the best thing to come out of this era (or at least the first two). It's a pretty big hit. I loved it. I just didn't love it as much as the movie masses do even to this day. The story is rich, and Vito Corleone is easily one of my favorite characters of all time now. The death scenes are brutal and hard-hitting. The director didn't waste a single gunshot or strangulation for the sake of just doing it. There's a method to the madness of The Godfather, and I guess thats' why it hits people so hard. They story is built up in a way to where the killing of a character hits just as hard as your favorite character leaving the cast of your favorite sitcom.<br/><br/>The scene in the garden with Don Vito and his grandson is by far my favorite. Out of all the ways I'd expect it to happen, It took me by surprise. It was a very sweet and heartfelt scene, and the character was too worthy of it. I would've been angry if Vito ended as a victim, and not the legend... the Godfather.<br/><br/>Check this movie out. There's a good reason why it's such an important movie to the industry.

","Made 15 years before I was born, I didn't watch this film until I bought the trilogy a couple years back. And I was not disappointed. How could I be? Francis Ford Coppola has gifted us with what is quite frankly, the greatest gangster film of all time. Goodfellas, The Departed, Reservoir Dogs and other great films of this genre cannot even touch the pure brilliance of this film. There is such an inexplicable gulf between The Godfather and every mob movie ever made. It does not allow you to take your eyes off the screen for even one second. <br/><br/>Perfectly written and directed, there is not a single fault in this film. For me, Brando just steals the show. He makes you believe that he IS Vito Corleone. Just a sensational, legendary film."
"tml_pohlak_13","6","0","3","4 June 2009"," An offer you can conceivably refuse...
","WARNING! SPOILERS EVERYWHERE!<br/><br/>The beginning of The Godfather is both horrifying and engrossing. The first shot is in a dark room, as a man speaks to Vito Corleone (Brando) of an appalling attempted rape on his daughter. The criminals have escaped American justice, but he wants (what he considers) real justice to be done. As it is his daughter's wedding day, Corleone (as a Sicilian) mustn't refuse a reasonable request. And thus, the opening scene of the film plunges the viewer directly into what is one of the most respected movies of all time.<br/><br/>And yet, as effective as this move is, it can also be extremely confusing. As a non-Italian viewer, the sudden immersion into Italian culture created a disconcerting effect.<br/><br/>Thankfully, for a film that is nearly three hours long, The Godfather has plenty of action going on, spanning 10 years, yet rarely becoming boring. Unfortunately, when it does become boring, it is because Coppola falls into the trap he fell into with Apocalypse Now: too much side material makes the plot irrelevant. His muddled concept of suspense at times left me completely bored. The Mafia is often treated as a bureaucracy, with men in tight suits pledging loyalty to each other, then promptly killing each other. Many of these scenes end up being ineffective.<br/><br/>Incidentally, it is curious that although the central characters of The Godfather are members of the Mafia, the viewer somehow sympathises with them. Why? I believe I've found the answer. We never see the individual victims of crime. We never see women reduced to prostitution, a family broken up by gambling, drugs ruining a man's life. The only cop we see with speaking lines is corrupt, and promptly killed off. Although the characters are, at heart, immoral, the effects of their immorality are limitedly shown. And this might be why the characters have such appeal: instead of gangsters, they become a dysfunctional family. Thus, The Godfather, often dismissed as a thriller, is most aptly classified as a drama.<br/><br/>For me, one of the (if not the) best scenes in the entire film is when Michael (Pacino) attends his sister's son's baptism, where he stands as the godfather. As the priest asks him whether he renounces Satan and all his works (etc.), Michael answers ""I do"". In a masterfully inter-cut scene (kudos to Coppola), this moment of the baptism is shown to take place simultaneously as several murders Michael has arranged. The juxtaposition of these two moments is highly effective (much more so, in my humble opinion, than the brutal execution of Carlo minutes later), and is one of the moments that make The Godfather the oh-so-sweet treat it is.<br/><br/>However, despite being one of the most respected movies of all time, The Godfather undeniably is flawed (gasps!). There are so many characters to keep track of, that several of them remain sketched-in shadows. In addition, Coppola has thrown in a subplot about Michael's life in Sicily after he flees America, which is not only ineffective, but also slows down the tone of the film, and brings in doubts over just how much Michael loves his wife, a situation affirmed when he lies to her at the film's end, denying his involvement in the murders. It just feels stiff, awkward, out-of-place, and slows down the film. And of course, I think that Michael ordering his sister's husband to be killed is possibly the film's biggest flaw. Michael shows positively no concern for Connie: his only thought is to avenge his brother. Well, this relentless circle of vengeance gets dizzying at times.<br/><br/>When it comes to acting, there's practically no argument. The Godfather is one of the best-cast films ever. Marlon Brando in particular works well. (Nay, I'll revise that-- he IS the Godfather.) His final scene, as he dies playing with his grandson, works precisely because of Brando's acting.<br/><br/>The score for The Godfather was composed by Nino Rota, and a very effective score it was! The theme in particular seemed to melancholically say: ""If only we had listened to the GodfatherÂ…"" Finally, I find it fascinating how, with subtlety, later events in the film are foreshadowed. The most brilliant case of foreshadowing occurs when a film studio boss (whose name completely escapes me) shows off his prize horse, boasting of its price and how he plans not to race it. This serves as such a clever way of foreshadowing the (gruesome, yet effective) slaughter of the horse.<br/><br/>The Verdict: Although The Godfather is undeniably a very good movie, it has been overrated, emphasis put on its good points, yet its flaws shockingly overlooked. It's currently #2 on IMDb's Top 250-- but it should, in my humble opinion, be a lot further down the list.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 6.5/10"

","Cinema lovers all over the world consider this movie as the best movie ever. And to some extent I agree . The plot of the movie has been repeated and copied by so many movies coming after this, that it will be of no use of me explaining it.<br/><br/>The characters of this movie have become legends especially of Don Vito Corleone played by the great Marlon Brando. Many other actors in different movie industries tried to emulate this character in their own way but failed to create an impact as huge as Brando created. But the character who keeps his own amongst the geniusness around is Michael Corleone which gave a first glimpse of the acting prowess of one of the greatest actors of this generation Al Pacino . Another actor who impressed is the great Robert Duvall (Tom Hagen) who played the supporting part to perfection. The movie is almost 3 hours long but nowhere the movie loses its grip on the audience .Coppola has made sure that the audiences are craving for what is going to be the next twist in the movie .The best scene in the movie according to me is the Baptism and the enemy killings scene which showcased the great capabilities of the director. ""I will make him an offer he can't refuse"" can be called as one of the best dialogues of the cinema history. This is one movie any cinema lover cannot afford to miss<br/><br/>Rating : 9/10"
"kavinps","9","0","1","10 February 2009"," Flawless movie with maybe some Mafia Inacurracy but overall a master.
","The Godfather has to be one of the most masterful and perfect films of all time. Francis Ford Coppola does a great job in directing by creating great suspense and drama in the film as well as the dark theme meant in the book. Mario Puzo did a wonderful job in turning his best-selling book into a movie script with a little help from Coppola. This film also introduces some of the greatest actors in the crime genre which includes great performances by Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. The beginning of the film is the only part that I hated because it was so long and boring too but I guess there was probably no other way to begin the movie I guess. I like how they show a lot of the Italian and mafia culture in the film but they do tend to mistake a lot of mob culture. First of I looked at the film and the guys don't ever talk like mob guys. In the real mafia everyone curse including the higher ranking and elder bosses. I surprised by the lack of profanity in the movie and I think the only I time I ever heard a curse word is when Sonny said the ""N"" word at the dinner table which I have no clue why he said it because it was so random. Also they get rid of a lot of power away from the Captains of the capo-regimes. I never heard much talk of the business from Tessio or Clemenza which is really is out of the mob ranking style. Also despite this being a great mafia movie they don't make the mobsters cruel enough. I mean come on we all know that these guys are monsters and murderers make them look that rather than some fat guys who are rich and love eating cake. Well one thing they did get right was the asking favors thing with the Don and screw him for not getting into drugs. Overall I'll recommend this movie to anyone but please don't judge by the boring beginning please see the whole movie before you judge it."

","This is a good film. It is well directed and well acted. The story is engaging, and the sets flawlessly reflect the time period. And yet... it is only a *good* movie. I know that I will probably be hated for saying this, but ""The Godfather"" really doesn't seem like a masterpiece. Although it is certainly one of the most influential films of its time, I can't help but feel that it is a little overrated. Perhaps my tastes just aren't the same as everyone else's. And then again... maybe I am right, and a film doesn't have to be ""perfect"" to be memorable. ""The Godfather"" is worth watching... once... mainly because it has become such an integral part of our culture. It set the stage for epic crime dramas, and that alone is impressive. But... is it really so much better than other films? The first doesn't always have to be the best. ""The Godfather"" lays down a very solid foundation for future cinema, much as ""Gone With the WInd"" did, way back in the day (don't even get me started on that one). It is by no means perfect, but it is, like I said, worth watching."

","I absolutely LOVE this movie! This is my personal favorite. Everything in this film works perfectly.<br/><br/>First off, the acting. It's as though the actors were born for the roles. Especially everyone in the Corleone family... you find they act totally like a family. The best performance for me was Brando as Vito Corleone. He brought such a presence to the character that it's astonishing... basically unbelievable. The rest of the cast does a great job. Al is extremely convincing as the youngest son of the don. <br/><br/>The only thing people have to realize is that the mafia in no way act like this. I mean, ""The Godfather"" is a very romantic or Shakespearean look at this world. Even though all the characters DO eventually pay for their sins. <br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola once said ""I always thought of THE GODFATHER as the story of a great king with three sons. The oldest was given his sweet nature and childlike qualities; the second, his passion and aggressiveness; and the third, his cunning and coolness.""<br/><br/>I wholeheartedly agree."

","To be honest, I approached this film with an air of apprehension after being told by everyone that it was a masterpiece. I didn't want to like it at all, and the fact that i ended up loving it is a testament to the director.<br/><br/>The movie was incredible. Seriously. Marlon Brando was stunning and Al Pacino an inspiration. The nature of their performances should send this film into the history books, as well as those of James Caan and Diane Keaton. From an actor's POV, splendid, and the plot kept me hooked for the majority.<br/><br/>Key word: MAJORITY, as good as it was, I didn't pay complete attention for the whole thing. That aside, incredible movie. The genre has been done better recently in American Gangster and The Departed (Scorsese, legend, and as good a director as Francis Ford Coppola) but this is a true testament to American and Italian cinema. If you don't watch it, you're a closed minded idiot. No offence lol."

","The execution of the 5 family heads is one of the most powerful scenes not only in this trilogy, but of all film. You have Michael swearing to renounce Satan in the church while his minions are slaughtering men on the street, under his orders.<br/><br/>Here is Pacino as Michael who in his own right is just so downright haunting. He is a man who has literally damned himself, and is forever tortured. Seeing, his character go from the war hero marine to the haunted and isolated Mafia Don..... Wow.<br/><br/>Brando. Again. Wow. That scene with him and Duvall where, Don Vito is told by a broken-hearted Tom that Sonny has been killed, and Michael's involvement in the murders. Or that final exchange between Vito & Michael. The dialogue is so un-forced, so natural, so real - gives me goosebumps! The most touching scene, for me, are the scenes between Michael and Apollonia, the local Sicilian girl who he falls in love with. And how couldn't he? ""Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday..."" She was so innocent.<br/><br/>All in all, my favorite scene I think is the scene in the Italian restaurant, leading up to Michael's murder of Sallozzo and McCluskey --Pacino's performance in that scene is just off the charts-- you can almost feel his mounting stress and blood pressure right through the screen."

The story is based on the novel -The Godfather- from which the movie obviously got its name and it follows the most part of the story in the novel. The cast is also excellent the stars who play each character fit their role in the movie perfectly. Some parts of the story may become confusing to some audience if they don't pay much attention to the movie, i found the movie more interesting when i watched it the 3rd time because I had missed some tiny details which make this movie so good. The story won't become boring, it keeps you watching the movie all the time because you really want to know what will happen next which is quite rare in many movies. The effects are also done well for the 70's period, they look very realistic. The movie really gives you a good description of that dark period in history in a non boring way.Those who enjoy watching drama will love this movie."

","I must've seen this movie more than a hundred times over the past seven years or so, but I still can't get enough of it. It was released in 1972 and there is hardly any doubt in my mind that it has truly stood the test of time. It is a brilliant adaptation of the bestseller novel 'The Godfather' by Mario Puzo.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a gangster movie set in the late 1940s & early 1950s around the lives of the Corleone family. Corleones are an Italian American Family in New York headed by 'Don' Vito Corleone. Vito has three sons, Sonny, Fredo & Michael and a daughter named Connie who is married to Carlo Rizzi. He also has an adopted son named Tom Hagen (German-Irish) who is the 'Consiglerie'(Advisor) of the family. The family is into the business of gambling, unions & liquor. They have all the judges and politicians 'in their pocket'. The Corleones also have influences over the media & the cops. They form a crime syndicate of 5 Italian- American families who have a stronghold over different parts of New York. Vito is assisted in his work by his 'Caporagemes' namely Clemenza & Tessio who carry out his orders.<br/><br/>The family is faced with problems when the refusal of Don Vito to join & support the drug business along with Virgil Sollozo leads to other families (Barzini, Tattaglia, Stracchi & Cuneo) going against them. The bad blood between the families results in Don Vito getting shot. Sonny, (The 'hothead')who is the eldest son gets killed and Michael has to step-up in this time of need. The emergence of Michael who was earlier reluctant to join the family business as the head of the family is the highlight of the movie. Michael imbibes all the unique qualities of his father and takes revenge for his family. I don't know where to begin with as far as appreciating this movie is concerned. It has the most amazing characterizations with all the characters being well etched and having their own individuality. If Vito was the 'reasonable man' who valued his family, Sonny is a hot head, Michael is rational, Fredo is weak & stupid, Tom is measured, Sollozo is ruthless. Even the supporting cast of Clemenza, Tessio, Don Barzini, Connie, Captain Mcklusky, Jhonny Fontaine,Jack Woltz,Mama etc are extremely well defined. The dialogues in the movie pack some serious punch. Some of them which I can recall on my fingertips are "" It's not personal Sonny, its strictly business"", "" Only don't tell me that you are innocent , because it insults my intelligence & it makes me very angry"" and finally "" I'll make him an offer he cannot refuse"". The screenplay seamlessly gels with the movie. Who can forget the scene at the Louis restaurant, the baptism scene at the end, or Tom Hagen informing his Don about Sonny's death. The movie has got this whole Italian milieu which takes you in a different world, makes you feel like a member of the Corleone family and identify with each and every character. Last but not the least, a tribute should be paid to the entire cast of the movie. No one could have acted better than Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, Al Pacino as Michael, James Caan as Sonny or Robert Duvall as Tom. Even the performance of the supporting cast is phenomenal.<br/><br/>I would like to sincerely thank Francis Coppola for putting up such a gem of a movie which has really caught my imagination."

","On the 15th of March 1972. I sat in my apartment at the age of 17 with my girlfriend. We decided to go see a movie. We heard that there was some big premier of some sort at the cinemas. We went and saw 'The Godafther'. We expected an average film. But from the minute it started we were stuck into it. Back then we had no idea who Al Pacino, James Caan or Robert Duvall were, but because of this film we now do.<br/><br/>Basically the film follows the rise and almost fall of the Corleone crime family. It tours us through the everyday life of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and his family. Don Corleone is like a different kind of police commissioner but he has his own ways of punishing people (E.g. A man comes in and asks for justice after his daughter had been beaten, and the police failed to put them away, Don Corleone orders them to suffer). The film also follows the outsider of Organized crime and the Don's youngest son (played by the then unknown Al Pacino: giving a chilling performance) who has fought at war and come back with no part in crime. All goes well until the Don refuses a deal with someone powerful who reacts by gunning the Don down. Michael is then forced into the mob in order to secure safety for his family.<br/><br/>I could name 1000 reasons why The Godfather is and always will be a classic. It garnered 10 Oscars and took home 3 including Best Picture. I was surprised that almost every other award was lost to Cabaret, after all I believe that the supporting Oscar nominated performances (Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall) were more worthy that Joel Gray in Cabaret. It was a pure and entertaining experience at the cinemas, it was very quiet because everybody was listening to the characters sharp dialogue. The film reminds me that everybody is a good guy in their own opinion, he is not pure and cold hearted, he is just another police man who has his own way of doing things.<br/><br/>Do not miss this film, 10/10 all the way. All the masterfully set pieces such as: The severed horse's head in the bed, the baptism multiple murder, and Many memorable lines. The masterful performance by Brando, the chilling performance by Pacino and the calm and inspiring performance by Duvall all help to make this film a classic."

What can I say...I never saw just a combination between action and drama in one movie, so I could say that the plot is definitely the best I've ever watched and may be will ever watch. Actors' performances were perfect, I mean what do you think of Al Pacino or even the better Marlon Brando's performance in any other movie? well, they were at their finest and reached their top acting talent in this movie. Also James Caan made a remarkable performance and especially that scene when he dies. Even the soundtrack and the main theme for the movie, I think nobody could ever forget this music and how it did fit the movie and the drama. By winning only 3 Oscars, I think that the academy awards really did underestimate 'The Godfather' as I believe that it deserves to be the most Oscar-winning movie in its year and may be one of the most ever....I just feel that whatever I'll say won't afford to describe such a legendary movie, but I must say that I recommend this to ANYONE who only wanna watch an excellent movie...."

In fact if I could only watch three movies for the rest of my life, this would be it along with to Kill A Mockingbird and American Beauty.<br/><br/>There are many things that make this movie enjoyable so many things that I have to break it down.<br/><br/>The plot. There are few American movies that have a plot as deep and complex as the Godfather. Usually when I don't want to spend 6 dollars to see a movie I'll just go to a website and read a recap, but with this it is impossible. There are more twists and turns then a hamster maze. In fact the first time I watched this I had to pause every 20 minutes just to take in what I was seeing.<br/><br/>It delivers what it promises. With 90 percent of today's movies they promise something big and epic, only to fail to deliver. The Godfather sets up high expectations and meets them all and then some. It is impossible to say this movie is over rated, because there isn't a scale in the world that can rate a movie such as this.<br/><br/>The characters. Just as a captain is nothing without his crew a movie is nothing without its characters and this movie has some of the most memorable. I cannot possibly have a favorite because they are all incredible. Clearly when casting they chose the best and not the ones that looked good and had six packs.<br/><br/>The dialogue. Very few movies have realistic dialogue. They sound rehearsed and forced, but this movie is the exception. The actors were speaking as if this was real life and they were having a realistic conversation. If I didn't know this was a movie I would think that someone had recorded an actual person's life.<br/><br/>The action. I won't deny it, I love action and this movie does not fail. The fight scenes were epic and unpredictable. One moment a family could be sitting down to a nice dinner and the next minute machine gun fire could be going everywhere. My personal favorite was when Emilio Barzini was shot and rolled down the stairs.<br/><br/>This is a movie that I would recommend to anyone. This is one of the few movies that can please everyone. It has action, romance, comedy, drama, suspense, a deep plot, and a feeling of satisfaction after you see it. If you haven't seen this movie do so as soon as possible this is one film that you can't refuse."

","Words cannot describe the perfection that is The Godfather. It captivates you from the moment the wonderful and haunting score starts to play to the moment that the credits roll. Coupled with a wonderful script by the author of the book himself and the perfect cast of characters, this movie cannot be called anything other than perfect.<br/><br/>It is a story of a Mafia crime family and how this identity affects those within it. It is a haunting story of love, betrayal, hatred, fear, and, most of all, family. As you watch this movie, you will find yourself wishing that this family was a reality, something you could see and talk to and join. The greatness of the Corleone family is summed up in Don Corleone's line, ""I refuse to be a fool, dancing on a string held by all those big shots.""<br/><br/>Marlon Brando's performance stands out above all the others; his portrayal as Don of the Corleone Mafia family is so convincing that if you see him in his other films, you will find it hard to be convinced by his other characters. Al Pacino provided a wonderful portrayal of a family member outcast that is unwittingly drawn into the whirlwind of his family's business. Other performances by James Caan and Robert Duvall and all the others completed the greatest cast assembly in movie history.<br/><br/>Though followed by two sequels, The Godfather was undoubtedly the greatest among them as well as being the greatest movie ever created. Citizen Kane may be regarded as higher, but it is the most important movie of all time, not the greatest; The Godfather holds that title. It is a pity that this movie won only three Academy Awards (Picture, Actor, Adapted Screenplay); it was right that it won Best Picture, but it was jipped out of all the other awards it should have won, especially Best Director, by Cabaret, a self-indulgent piece of crap with Liza Minneli as the star.

","Marlon Brando was a great actor, who could amply improve a given role by his own imagination and Method based on his raw, visceral and natural acting style. He could add many dimensions to a given character /role by his own charismatic personality, demeanor and voice. People will never forget Stanley Kowalski of ""A street Car Named Desire"", Napoleon Bonaparte of ""Desiree"" and Christian Fletcher of ""The Mutiny on the Bounty"". He was definitely a living legend of his time, a towering personality over other contemporary actors.<br/><br/>Mario Puso's Godfather owes a lot to Marlon Brando, who was shown as an aging patriarch (Don Vito Corleone) teaching tricks of the underworld ominous trade to his young cub,(Michael Corleone) portrayed by Al-Pacino. As the young role demanded, Al-Pacino's innocent face and if not simple, straight acting style was appropriate while the old man's (Brando's ) visage bore the complexities of life's bitter machinations that were required of him to get to the top rung of the clandestine Mafia Empire.<br/><br/>It is beautifully directed while punctuating the cinematic sequence with retrospective details of the elder Corleone's youth. It takes the audience to the old times with a pensive setting that approaches the status quo/wealth and waste of American Underworld.<br/><br/>Howsoever great the title and story of this movie as well the acting skills of Marlon Brando, but it cannot be regarded as the all time great movie EVER MADE. There is more to the Mafia and Underworld than meets the eye after watching this movie. The human intellect is endowed with exploring and implementing even more innovative ways of the negative side as one can imagine.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it is a good effort at revealing the gory and ruthless side of the criminal dark world."

I could say, I became a Godfather addict. <br/><br/>PLEASE NOTE, this film tends to change most people's life good or bad! If you do not want to see the perfection, see Scarface, Goodfellas, Once Upon a Time in America, and the other better mafia films, and leave Godfather to the end. It is easy to underrate other great films after watching Godfather.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola made a deep research before setting up the scenes, and discussed every single detail with Mario Puzo. Two masterminds created the most unforgettable movie in the galaxy. Paramount must be proud of their son, Coppola who had an amazing era in the 70's when made a bunch of memorable pictures in a row like Patton, The Conversation or Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>10 OUT OF 10 or 5* out of 5*"
"ruthiecrisafulli","10","0","1","11 July 2007"," This is one of my favorite movies ever.
","I always thought that the godfather was kind of boring until I watched it this past year. I never fully grasped the idea of the mob. Also I couldn't get past the first half hour. But once I did I went on to watch the second and then the third one too. This movie is filled with drama, action and gore. If you love gun action and movies with deception you'll love how things play out in this movie. There isn't any comedy in my opinion only great sayings that stick with you and great scenes. If you have ever seen ""you've got mail"" and the godfather you'll know that if your a guy it is essential to see this movie. If you don't see it, you will be missing out on the best movie of all time."
"stefanbe","10","0","1","5 July 2007"," One of the most talked-about films of all-time.
","When somebody approaches a screening of The Godfather, there is naturally going to be a bit of nervousness approaching it, since so many people have called one of the greatest films of all-time. There is a feeling that he will come away with comments like ""It wasn't that great."" or ""That's supposed to be brilliant masterpiece."" Well, I am going to add some more into the hype machine, because the many other raves about The Godfather are true. It is a phenomenal motion picture that deserves its awards, praise and even more. Francis Ford Coppola constructed one of the shining works of the New Hollywood Era and due to the many spoofs that people produce, both in films, television and YouTube, it has stayed in the memories of countless film lovers. Much like Citizen Kane and Casablanca, a viewing of The Godfather is a must for any film aficionado.<br/><br/>Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the most powerful mafia family in America. He is aided by his sons, timid Fredo (John Cazale), violent Sonny (James Caan) and the adopted family lawyer Tom Hagen (Robertt Duvall). His youngest, Michael (Al Pacino), has returned home from serving in the Second World War to attend the wedding of his sister (Talia Shire). Unlike his brothers, he wants nothing to do with the family business and prefers to go into in a clean profession. However, after Vito is shot and wounded, Michael's inner Corleone comes out and he decides to seek revenge on those responsible. He flees to Sicily after doing his job and when he returns, he becomes the new Godfather and one of most powerful men in the mob world.<br/><br/>Every single aspect of The Godfather has been so praised and analysed by many historians and film critics that it will be difficult to construct an original review. Marlon Brando's performance is incredibly etched into our minds and for good reason as it stands as the pinnacle of this great actor's work on film. Newcomer Al Pacino also provided a stunning acting job, making Michael a fascinating character of the Godfather universe and his brilliant work continued to even greater heights in Part II. James Caan, John Cazale and Robert Duvall add more fantastic triumph to the ensemble with their impressive work as the other three Corleone brothers. It's incredibly insane watching their work knowing that Paramount Pictures did not want them for the parts. Coppola's direction and screenplay (which he co-wrote with the book's author Mario Puzo) are also the film's high points along with Nina Rota's brilliant musical score. The Godfather is a fantastic film experience and a masterpiece of cinema that will and can be viewed many times over."
"davulture","10","0","1","27 June 2007"," One of the Greatest American Films of All Time
","The Godfather is considered a landmark achievement in film and considered by many as one of the greatest film of all time. The plot of the movie is a little hard to explain because the movie misleads the viewer and goes somewhere else but little by little the pieces add up together. The story begins with a bunch of people coming to the mafia Don, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) for some requests because ""The Don can't refuse an offer to a Sicilian on the day of his daughters wedding."" At the wedding we are introduced the Corleone family which include Santino or Sonny Corleone (James Caan) the oldest of the family and the most hotheaded member, Fredo the second oldest who is a womanizer and isn't as smart as the other members of his family, then there is Michael played by Al Pacino who is a WWII veteran who comes to his sister's wedding with his girlfriend Kay and tells her how he doesn't want to become like the others in his family. Then is Tom Haygin (Robert Duvall) the non Italian character who was taken in by Vito Corleone as a son and become the consiliere (or head of legal affairs) and then there is of course Connie (The Don's Daughter) who is marrying a man named Carlo. The beginning of the story focuses on a famous singer Johnny Propane coming to Vito Corleone asking him for help to get cast in a film, soon Tom goes there and ends up ""forcefully"" making the Director accept Johnny Propane. From there things become a little difficult when Vito Corleone refuses to get in the business of narcotics with a heroin dealer named Virgil Sollozzo. After Vito's refusal he is shot and nearly killed when his shot down by Sollozzo's men. Without much hope Tom is taken hostage and tries to get hotheaded Sonny to take a deal with Sollozzo but when he refuses things become worse as a possibility of an all out war with the other 5 heads of family become visible. Then Michael takes his role in the story when he visits his father and realizes their isn't security before he is beaten by the corrupt Captain McCluskey. After the incident Michael offers to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey who they realize are working together and in a climatic scene Michael takes out a loaded gun and kills both McCluskey and Sollozzo. Without any hope Michael is forced to move to Sicily to be safe guarded for a while. There he meets a girl named Apollonia and she is soon killed in a car bomb in a near assassination on Michael's life because of the crime's he's committed. Things start to fall apart as the Don finally returns home and Sonny goes on to beat Carlo after he beats on his sister Connie. However when Carlo beats Connie again, Sonny is aggravated and goes to beat up Carlo again before getting murdered at a toll booth by an army of gunmen. After the death of Sonny, Vito Corleone decides to go with the five heads of the mafia to make a truce, soon Michael returns now that it's safe and returns to Kay his girlfriend and tells her he wants to marry her. With Sonny dead, the Don almost retired and Fredo in Vegas (being incompetent to take care of family affairs). Michael soon reduces Tom's power and makes Carlo his right hand man when they move their operations to Nevada. When visiting Vegas, Michael goes to a casino which is financed by The Corleone's and run by Moe Greene where Michael tells Moe that he plans on buying him out much to his dismay. Later Michael returns back home where he talks with the Don and the Don tells him that an associate close to him will betray him and kill him. Soon after the Don plays with his grandson (Michael's son) he dies of a heart attack. During the funeral Michael discovers that Tessio was the traitor and soon has him along with Moe Greene and the heads of the mafia all wiped out during the baptism of Connie's child. Afterwards Michael goes to Carlo's house where he questions him on Sonny's murder before wiping him out. The movie ends with Connie angry at Michael for Carlo's death but Michael seems not to care and when Kay asks him if this is what he does for a living, Michael tells her he doesn't. However it's obvious she realizes that Michael is becoming more what he was afraid of."

","it is not good as pulp fiction, because this film just shows that an older mafia dies and his son takes control, this type of films are more common,but pulp fiction which is a master piece and narrates an hit mans story with good type of narrating. this film does not deserve to be in 1st place, because they didn't made any effort on acting. it also has many errors on film making.this film was a good movie for those who saw the movie in the olden days, but now the this film has no effect on the viewer, but movies like pulp fiction, the shaw shank redemption are really extraordinary creations of directors. i don't know why it is still stuck in the 1st place."

","The reason I do not give The Godfather a 10 out of 10 is because it is not the perfect movie. And the reason why The Godfather is not the perfect movie is because it drags. The movie drags for 3 hours and I have to admit that Marlon Brando as the Godfather is a little overrated. I understand his amazing acting ability but i actually thought De Niro did a better job in Part 2. Pacino as Michael is one of the greatest performances in modern cinema. His performance ranks right up there with De Niro in Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, Ray Liotta in Goodfellas, and Tim Robbins in Shawshank Redemption. I love the Godfather although I do understand the criticism the movie receives from people. (too long, boring at times)"
"crazypigkiller9-1","10","0","1","19 April 2007"," One of the best movies of all time
","There's too many good things I could say about this movie so I'm going to try to make this short and sweet. Plus most of the other reviews here are long and go into all the details. This movie is fantastic, it is one of if not the greatest flick of all time. It completely annihilates most of the movies of its time and even though it was made in the early 70's it is still better than most any movie that has come out since then. Powerful acting, powerful direction, perfect amount of violence and gore and one of the best stories ever written in my opinion. Sheer brilliance. A stunning masterpiece. One of Al Pacino's best and its an understatement to say that he has a LOT of stellar performances. With an all star cast and not a single bad scene in the entire film i'd have to say that this is one of those few ""perfect"" films. I have a hard time differentiating a favorite between the first and second movie in the trilogy, but if I absolutely had to it would probably be the first one. The third one was good but pales in comparison to the first two. I have seen very few movies in my day that can compare to this film. If for some reason you haven't seen it and are looking for a powerhouse of a film, this is it. Immediately go out and get it, you will not be disappointed."
"timothy_480","10","0","1","16 April 2007"," Best film ever
","Some day and that day may never come i'll call upon you to do a service for me but until that day accept this justice as a gift on my daughters wedding day. (Don Corleone) If you put the Godfather in front of me two years ago i would have told you to get lost. I never watched the film until a year ago and i realised that it wasn't some religious film but one of the most powerful movies ever made. The more i watched it the more i liked it and i believe that i have watched it more then fifty times over the past year. I recommend that if you have not watched it yet you need to get down to the nearest video store and hire it out.<br/><br/>My favourite character in the film would have to be Michael. A war hero and a college boy until he decides that his destiny is to be in the family business. Through out the movie you will notice that he changes from a nice full of life college boy to a smooth, cool mafia don. Al Pacino portrays Michael very well and this was the role that made Pacino famous.<br/><br/>Other characters are Sonny played by James Cann, Tom Hagen played by Robert Duvall, Fredo played by John Cazale and of course Don Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando. All of these people including Michael Corleone are the family. Brando does an excellent job as the old Don who is wise and powerful and is really the main character. James Cann is the bad tempered Sonny who has a hard time thinking before he acts. Throughout the movie you will like Sonny and you will feel peed off when something bad happens to him. Tom Hagen is the unofficially adopted son of Vito Corleone and the family consiligerie (Can't spell it) who is the brains of the family along with the Don. Fredo is unfortunately the useless son who does not have an idea about what he is doing. Then there are other characters throughout the film like Clemenza, Tessio, Rocco, Al Neri and heaps more.<br/><br/>The movie is about an aging mafia don who refuses to start a business with narcotics but there are four other families in New York who have an interest. An assassination attempt is made on the Don but he does not die. Sonny Who is short tempered takes over the family while the Don is still recovering and wants revenge. The Dons youngest Michael who is the only one who wishes not to be in the business decides that he must stick with his father and kill a crooked cop and Sollozo. The movie starts out in 1945 and carries on to 1955 showing the war of the five families and Michaels rise to Don.<br/><br/>This movie is directed very well by Francis Ford Coppola and is definitely a must see for everyone."

","I sometimes wish I was alive in 1972 so I could see The Godfather in theaters. Some of the best cinematography and editing was produced in this movie. It tells the story of the mafia from the inside. It was amazing how the movie made you admire Don Corleone even though he was essentially evil. During the movie, the audience really doesn't see much it can disapprove of. No women are involved in prostitution, no lives are being ended by compulsive gambling, and no theft rings. In fact, the only real person outside the mob who is corrupt is a police officer with a significant speaking role. Brando is great with many memorable and quotable lines, and Al Pacino's performance in comparison to Brando's shouldn't be ranked to much further behind. A great ensemble of a cast and supporting players. Well done!"

","This film is very long but well worth watching. A story worth witnessing at least once. Thou fictional the Godfather is a film which captures the audiences imagination and will lead them into the verge of reality. As addictive as getting involved in conspiracy theories or the Da Vinci Code. This film could alter your life. Therefore to conclude. Againsts IMDb.com English only policy i say ""molto buon"". The Godfather is the first in a trilogy of films describing the life of Michael Corleone. Filled with an all star cast the films delivers on all aspects of filmography. Comedy, Romance, Action, Thriller etc. Admittably the comedy is limited by the ruthlessness of the Corleon families lust for power. The trilogy of films confirm that wealthy people can get away with murder, literally. Most touching about the film is the Italian mafia's resilience to touch drugs. In an effort to prevent any spoiler notes i'll try to end this comment hoping it is longer than 10 lines. A stupid rule set by the powers that be."

So, I decided to get the next best thing, and I read the book. I read the book in about a week, and I was astonished that such a book had existed and I hadn't read it before. So, my desire to watch the film was greater than it had ever been before. Finally, I was able to watch it. And, my God in Heaven. If I could, I would name my first born child Don Corleone (that's a joke) and make him look exactly like Marlon Brando. The acting, the writing, the directing, the cinematography, everything is fantastic. The only thing I can critique on is the action, and the fact that it was semi-cheesy. But, this is too be expected, as it was made in the early 70's, before great special effects. Despite this, I'd give this film 11/10."

That's not to say that the other actors don't deserve recognition; each character is believable and realistic.<br/><br/>I am not going to spoil much of the story; it's fairly simple, but there are a few twists and turns.<br/><br/>The score by Nino Rota is great, and has now become a classic. The main theme is very memorable.<br/><br/>The direction by Francis Ford Coppala is just genius. Each shot is done beautifully. The opening sequence for example, is just great, starting with a close-up of a minor character and slowly zooming out until you see a glimpse of The Godfather.

","This is probably my favourite movie. It really is tough to decide between the first 2 for the greatest, but i do think that this just has a slight edge, and i am also a huge fan of the 3rd, but its not quite in the same league. I just think that it's really mindblowing how awesome Marlon Brando is in this movie. That is probably the most deserved Best Actor Award ever, as this movie is probably the greatest Best Picture winner ever.<br/><br/>Basically this movie is about organised crime, or the mafia, or cosa nostra or whatever you want to call it. I can see how some may think that it glorifies the world of organised crime, but i really don't think that that makes any difference at all. A really basic overview of the story is that Michael Corleone (Al Pacino in one of his greatest roles ever, alongside the other Godfather movies and Scarface) is involuntarily drawn into the world of organised crime when his father, Vito ""The Don/The Godfather"" Corleone (Marlon Brando) gets gunned down in the street. Of course there are a thousand small loops involved, like the whole Sonny, Connie and Carlo triangle and Tom Hagen (beautifully portrayed by Robert Duvall) is important as well.<br/><br/>I don't think i could ever get over this movie, as it is one of the most brilliant things i have ever seen."

I loved both, though the book is better since it gives more insight into the Italian mafia. But the movie is great.<br/><br/>I love crime dramas and gangster films. The Godfather was very well crafted. I come from India and many film directors love this film. In 2005 an Indian filmmaker made ""Sarkar"" which is inspired from The Godfather. Sarkar was good but nothing beats The Godfather. It is magnificent and hugely entertaining. No one can beat Mr.Francis Ford Coppola's version.<br/><br/>When it comes to the performances everyone do a great job. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are the best in the film. Their performances have and will always inspire upcoming actors anywhere in the world. They live their characters as no one else. It is sad that Pacino never won an Oscar for any of The Godfather films.

The cast is incredible, the acting is above average, and the movie itself makes it hard to believe that it made it's debut in 1972.<br/><br/>It also gives us an unforgettable line from Marlon Brando that is now known throughout the world- ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.""<br/><br/>To call this movie overrated is a real shame; it is (in my opinion and in many others) the greatest 'mafia movie' ever made. Mario Puzzo and Francis Ford Coppola should be very proud men after making a movie of this caliber."

","This movie had me speechless by the end. In this movies there are no errors,no mistakes, everything is perfection. It is perfect in every aspect of the movie. It boosted Pacino to stardom along with a Dog Day Afternoon. It is Francis Ford Copollas greatest classic alongside Apocalypse now. This movie has a great story line and shows what its really like to be in a mob family down to the very last detail. No part of this movie is wrong and the views of the mob are correctly viewed. This movie is an all-time classic. I would not consider it the greatest mobster movie as i feel Good Fellas is but it is perfect and could not have been done better by a perfect director. I give this movie an amazing 10 out of 10."

","This movie really did change my life. It was absolutely breathtaking and so complete in film quality. I have never seen so flimed and completed so well and there was a near perfect movie of that type, it would be the Godfather. You look at the cast of people in this movie and these people were made stars because of this movie or already were stars; Al Pacino,James Caan, Marlon Brando, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and the list goes on. The storyline was unbelievable with a plot that was constantly evolving and the commitment to accuracy and staying true to Puzo's novel written years earlier. People actually spoke Italian in this movie and you really felt that they were their characters because they sold it to you that well. I still look at Brando, Caan and Pacino and say, ""Your the Godfather who started it all, your Sonny with rage and ferocity and Pacino is the up and coming Godfather who is the most sinister and clever Godfather there ever was."""

","I must admit that I wasn't born during the time that this film hit theaters. So consequentially, it probably doesn't have the same impact on me as it did to others from that period.<br/><br/>The 1970s produced some truly extraordinary movies. It was the golden age of cinema. One of these such films was ""The Godfather"". It was based on a novel by Mario Puzo, and when the movie entered theaters, it was perceived as one (if not THE) greats movies of all time. It still is today.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando propels this movie forward with one of the most amazing Oscar-winning performances ever delivered by an actor. His memorable pug-dog face and quiet mumbling as Don Vito Corleone is known to about everyone. The famous tagline ""I'll make him an offer he won't refuse"" is still spoken today.<br/><br/>It is also wise to acknowledge Brando's fellow actors-Al Pacino as Michael with his cold danger; Robert Duvall as the immensely likable Tom Hagen; James Caan as the hot head Sonny; Diane Keaton as Michael's girlfriend Kay Adams. This is THE ensemble cast of any film.<br/><br/>The wonderful themes of the Godfather are those related to the concept of family. A man's first and foremost care should be for his family. It is the most important thing in anyone's life.<br/><br/>Finally, let's not forget the wonderful technical aspects of the movie that made it even more effective and impactive: The memorable and haunting score by Nino Rota is one of the most beautiful I've ever heard. The dark and beautiful cinematography by Gordon Willis creates an atmosphere that would not have been present with any other DP. And, of course, nobody can forget the flawless direction by Francis Ford Coppola. The way he handles the film (the violence in particular) is astonishing to watch.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>One of the best. Ever."

","I'm not a big fan of this masterpiece but I liked almost everything in it, I starting to love it though .. 1st time I've seen it I didn't really like it then re-watched it twice then really released how great this movie is .. one of the problems I had before seeing it that people told me almost daily how great it is and they speak with details sometimes which I believe is a big mistake because they really made feel that like if a miracle is going to happen and change the world as we know while I'm watching it!! besides, the biggest pleasure is to discover all the great things yourself so you can actually feel the greatness instead of faking it or something even if it takes you more than five times to watch it.. just be patient and try to see it as q movie and while you are watching someday you will know for sure how and why it is so great. In my opinion it is great because of Marlon Brando who gave one of the best performances in history of cinema .. the rest of the cast especially Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Talia Shire did a great job .. Coppola did a great job directing and writing it with Mario Puzo and the music couldn't just be better .. the movie is great but it has also its down points .. so, I doubt it is the best movie of all-time.

"parachute-4","9","0","1","30 October 2006"," A new beginning for the American gangster film
","The key to the success of this defining gangster movie is the faultless casting. All the characters are strong and eminently believable. The central masterpiece is, of course, Brando's Don Corleone, a feudal mafia warlord of the old school who can distribute largess or initiate mayhem with no more than a mumbled whisper to his ever-attentive mobster acolytes. Excellent performances from Al Pacino , James Caan, and Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden as the tough, bad cop and one of my favorite screen thugs, Al Lettieri as ""The Turk"" Solozzo. A fairly predictable plot, even if you haven't first read the book , but so what? Its not meant to be a mystery. We the audience KNOW that the enemies of the family are going to get what's coming to them by way of the usual methods, and the director does not disappoint us. The traditional christening juxtaposed with the scenes of vengeful carnage are a masterful touch.<br/><br/>Is it possible to be a good son of the Church and a mass murderer all at the same time ? The director poses this question to us and we are discomforted. We have to take on board the new reality that not ALL mobsters are flamboyant psychopaths in the erstwhile Hollywood tradition of James Cagney, Edward G Robinson etc; doomed to perish in a hail of police bullets or in the electric chair. The mafia boss could be the family man next door, the theme picked up and carried to new heights in ""The Sopranos"". At the end of ""The Godfather"", we are left in no doubt that Michael Corleone and his henchmen are highly unlikely to be brought to book for their crimes, and more to the point, we the audience don't mind this one bit.<br/><br/>In that respect, that is probably the secret to this films enduring popularity everywhere in the World that it has been screened. Al Pacino's Michael Corleone defends his family and protects their livelihood by doing the hard yards and making the tough decisions. We can all identify with that, but in balance, we are also presented with the down side of Michael's effectiveness as a mob boss. His brother-in-law is dispatched without mercy and he lies without remorse to his wife. These themes were effectively developed in ""The Godfather Pt 2"", which is mostly concerned with the subsequent and inevitable degradation of Michael's humanity, culminating in fratricide. <br/><br/>The violence depicted in ""The Godfather"" was extreme at the time of its release and still has the power to shock. This is no bad thing as the mayhem is fully in context with the plot and is in no way glamorized. Real gangsters DO commit horrible crimes and often die in their turn bleeding in a gutter.<br/><br/>R. B."

","'The Godfather' is perhaps the greatest American film ever made.<br/><br/>The cast is absolutely second to none: Marlon Brando, James Caan, Al Pacino, Talia Shire, and Diane Keaton are all very convincing in their roles as members of this crime family.<br/><br/>My favorite character in this film is Michael Corleone. In the beginning, Michael's intentions are honorable, and he does not intend to become involved ""in the family business"". However, the viewer soon learns that the apple does not fall far from the tree, and Michael inevitably follows in his father's footsteps, and becomes even more ruthless than his father, Don Vito Corleone.<br/><br/>This film vividly portrays the ruthlessness of criminal organizations, and the price participants pay for involvement in a business that plays by no rules and never forgives betrayal. Life is certainly not sacred with these people, and the ends justify the means in accordance with 'The family business'.<br/><br/>'The Godfather' is a timeless classic that you will enjoy watching repeatedly."

","In writing an apology for a film that really needs none, let me begin by noting how many careers were established with this movie, beginning with that of Al Pacino. Pacino had made movies before and was a respected New York stage actor, but this was his breakthrough movie. Brando was regarded as poison: he was impossible to work with, causing movies to lose money with his outrageous demands, so the studio execs despised and distrusted him. This movie, for which he had to suffer the humiliation of auditioning, resurrected him. It opened the door to the memorable ""Last Tango in Paris."" Of course we had all seen Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, James Caan and John Cazale in other movies, but this one made them stars. (I don't recall seeing Talia Shire before this.) And it gave Coppola the kind of artistic freedom that would lead to ""Godfather II""--another masterpiece. Puzo, who wrote the book and collaborated on the screenplay, would go on to do the scripts for ""Superman"" and other movies. It was magic for everyone who appeared in it. I am only sorry that the success it brought people like Marlon Brando and Richard Castellano led them to price themselves out of ""Godfather II."""

Rightly labeled, ""Godfather"" is in the top ten ultimate guy movies of all time. In many circles it is required viewing before labeling yourself a man.<br/><br/>Mario Puzo and Coppola have crafted Americana organized crime mythology. The Godfather story has weaved it's way into society slang, catch phrases and the average person's basic knowledge of the mafia.

The movie, the dialogue, the cinematography are as fresh today as in 1972. Pacino's portrayal of the character of Michael Corleone is film school homework. The appearance of Brando as Don Corleone not only revamped his career but is now a staple for what the head of a mafia family must be like.<br/><br/>Voted in the top ten films of all time by the American Film Institute, ""The Godfather"" is a must see film.

","This is one of those movies that will consume your life after first glance. It's one of those movies that you would always hear people talk about and wondered 'what's all the hype - could a movie that was made prior to your birth really be that great?' Well, at least that is what I wondered. I never understood the fascination with Al Pacino, well at least until I watched this film. When I first laid eyes and ears on the first one, I could not put it down. I must have watched it at least 10 times consecutively and just fell in love with it's powerful and captivating presence. There is a reason that this film is on the top of the IMDb Charts. All the pieces that make this film so brilliant somehow magically fell into place when this film was made. For such a great director such as Francis Ford Coppola to come across one of the 20th century's greatest novels - The Godfather was destiny. Francis knew to truly captivate mastermind he wouldn't go it alone for the script. Yes, he dove passionately into the project and a lot of the film's ideas were sparked and derived by initial interest. But being the fanatical director that Coppola was, he set sail to take the project into timeless space. To do this, he knew he had to include Mario Puzo (author of the Godfather book) in on the script. Even casting took Coppola by storm and he was in for much labored conflict and tough decisions in order to see out his vision. Hollywood being Hollywood and Paramount in it's scope originally rejected the idea of casting young and unrecognized actor Al Pacino to play the role of Michael. But Coppola knew better and thus fought hard to keep him in. Thank goodness because any other actor could not play such an untouchable role that only Al Pacino could fill; The makings of such a dynamic and powerful role. Marlon Brando was probably the sure-shot out of the whole cast and well, Marlon Brando certainly pulled through. For me, it's Marlon Brandon's lack of presence in the 2nd that makes the first topple the second. The beginning of Godfather one with Marlon Brandon as ""The Don"" Vito Corleone sitting at his desk addressing Bonasera's request before he steps out for his daughter's wedding is simply timeless. That powerful message which in it's own right from the film and in the book carries even deeper and more powerful messages in analogies and sub-meanings is delivered on a timeless measure that puts chills down your spine almost every time you watch it. That deeply rooted sub-context makes it tireless, restless and relentless enough where hearing it a billion times is not enough. And is the perfect intro to a mastermind film -- letting you know that something mysterious and powerful is approaching.<br/><br/>More to come.."

","""I will make you an offer you cannot refuse."" said by Don Vito Corleone in The GodFather.<br/><br/>Well the setting of this intense movie is in New York where all the big 5 families or 5 different mafia families live in... The movie starts off in New York but slowly the setting moves to several different places in the United States. For example California and Las Vegas are two places where the Corleone family went to make deals with people. First of all i have to say the roles of the characters were played very well especially how the godfather uses he's accent and the way he acts in he's role makes it seem more realistic to how most people think of the mafia. I also think that Al Pacino did a very good job in playing the role of his character making him seem like a man who is not interested in the family business but has to step up to take revenge and take control of the family so that he's family members will not die. The costumes that the characters dress in suited the setting very well because the setting was not modern, but was in the past. Also the way people in each setting acted represented a lot like how much people would act when someone was killed because most people would be scared to get interfered with the mafia families. i think that this film is a very well directed and acted film and is a movie that must be seen because it is almost an once in a life time experience that can change one's thinking of what goes on in the world.

"jansen-aui","10","0","2","23 June 2006"," In American motion pictures, it's as authorative as its title role
","It's amazing to think, having listened to Francis Ford Coppola's DVD commentary, that his 1972 epic The Godfather was produced under such incredible studio and financial pressure  one can only imagine what this picture could have been if Coppola was given a little more control. To this day, The Godfather remains a classic, truly extraordinary, and etched into the memories of all who've seen it. It is one of the most widely acclaimed and financially successful films of all time, consistently among the top film lists of most, and is my personal favourite motion picture.<br/><br/>Set in 1940's New York, The Godfather tells the tale of the patriarch of a mafia organization, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando)  a man who commands enormous authority and power  and both his literal and figurative families. When the Don refuses a proposition by the drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo, believing that narcotics is ""a dirty business"", Sollozzo  backed by the power of a rival mafia family headed by Don Phillip Tattaglia  orders an assassination attempt. Don Corleone barely survives the shooting and, for the love for his father, Vito's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) decides to take action, masterminding a calculated move that will forever draw him in to the life of crime he always wanted to avoid.<br/><br/>The cast assembled for The Godfather can lay claim to being possibly the greatest ensemble ever featured in an American film. Marlon Brando's career-reviving turn as the Godfather himself has already cemented its place in cinematic history  no more needs to be said. Al Pacino demonstrates a remarkable transformation from idealistic youth to cold, calculated heir to the Corleone throne. James Caan as Sonny, the Don's eldest son, is as explosive, violent, and temperamental as the pages of Puzo's bestseller describe, and Robert Duvall as adopted son and family Consiglieri (Counsellor) Tom Hagen is all logic and composure. But the praise should rightly stretch out to all, even those in small roles, as all play a part in making Coppola's world of Italian culture and underworld crime authentic and believable.<br/><br/>When I try to pin down what it is, exactly, that makes a motion picture a ""classic"", I can't help but return to the notion of how memorable it is. This is ultimately where The Godfather qualifies  just about everything in this film is memorable in one way or another. We remember the acting  there is not a more iconic performance committed to film than Brando's Don Corleone. We remember Gordon Willis' celebrated cinematography, from the shadowy, atmospheric tension created in the offices where ""business"" is dealt, to his presentation of the sweeping, sun-kissed landscapes of Sicily. We remember the beautiful themes of Nino Rota's score  the haunting, lone trumpet that opens the picture and the full- fledged orchestral arrangement of the instantly recognizable ""Godfather Love Theme"". And who could forget the masterful inter-cutting during The Godfather's climactic baptism sequence? <br/><br/>From the opening shot of the thickly accented undertaker proclaiming ""I Believe in America"", to final unforgettable shot in the Don's quarters of the door closing on Diane Keaton, who finally realises the truth of what has happened, Coppola has attained a directorial quintessence with The Godfather that he may never again reach. While watching the picture, we simply cannot wait until the time comes to sit down and view it again. It's a rare quality in a film, and the hallmark of a cinematic masterpiece."

Just to hear the initial notes sends shivers down your spine. The conjunction of all this stars in one movies and the great performance given by each one of the actors is amazing. I love Brando's performance, and the way that Micheal Corleone's character is developing thru the film, Robert Duvall is great as Tom Hagen and James Caan as the hot-headed Santino opposite to everything that is Michael Corleone. All wrapped in a fine script written by Puzo which is really flawless. This is why I love movies."

","The original ""Godfather"" is the granddaddy (or maybe ""goddaddy"") of them all. Followed up by two good sequels, the 1972 first film was the best. If we could have understood Marlon's mumblings it might have been even better! Al Pacino is terrific as young Michael Corleone, youngest son of Don Vito, played by Brando, who, all kidding about his dialogue delivery aside, gives an astonishing portrayal of a crime kingpin, a loving family man, a shrewd businessman and a loyal friend but a murderous enemy. My favorite performance, though, is James Caan as the fiery, hot tempered big brother, Sonny, Who is riddled by Tommy guns at a toll plaza ambush by rival gangsters. John Cazale is Fredo, the middle brother, who's not nearly as sharp or ruthless as the rest of the family. Talia Shire does very well in a pivotal role as the Don's only daughter, Connie. Robert Duvall is outstanding as the family consigliere, Tom Hagen, the Don's adopted son and legal adviser. Diane Keaton is very good as Kay, who will enter the family as Michael's wife, and discover the less appealing aspects of her husband and his family business. Richard S. Castellano and Abe Vigoda are both exceptional as the godfather's lieutenants. The plot is well documented in other posts, so I won't recap it here. The thing to remember is that all the people depicted are either criminals or beneficiaries of criminal activities, while they often show virtues, they are corrupted by money and power. This is a complex and moving film, filled with great lines, unforgettable characters and action. A worthy choice for #1 in this list, or any other."

","The film is an amazing achievement in cinema. As far as acting and direction goes it is hard to find a better example. An older Brando plays one of his most famous roles, and possibly his second last great role (after this his last notable film appearance was in 1978's Apocalypse Now). It has an amazing storyline and amazing characters. The supporting cast of Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and others make this film one which can never be forgotten or replaced and certainly not replicated. It spawned possibly the most pastiched scene in film and television history (""One day- and that day may never come- i'll call upon you to do a service for me.

","Vito Corleone is the aging don (head) of the Corleone Mafia Family. His youngest son Michael has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Michael's sister) to Carlo Rizzi. All of Michael's family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo is looking for Mafia Families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don's lawyer Tom Hagen, the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart.<br/><br/>I have never read the novel but I am sure I will pick it up.

","Great story of a mafia family. Although this story does not reflect real mafia workings (a fairy tale in comparison) it's great entertainment with a lot of class and a lot of style. The sets are spectacular, acting flawless and characters intriguing.<br/><br/>There is a lot of subtle material ocuuring in the continuous power struggle the mafia family is undergoing, especially with Michael. His gradual change, from war hero to Godfather is brought on by the violent events around him. He can't help but be sucked in. His icy cold demeanor is a reflection of the violent world around him and how the human character adapts to it, the transformation from doting husband to ruthless killer. Various events; the assassination attempt on his father, his brother and wife's murder, the betrayal by associates, the beating of his sister, gives him insight into the workings of the human mind. As the cold, clear thinker (as opposed to his animal-like brother, Sonny) he survives and becomes king.<br/><br/>Brando is great as the older Don who is starting to lose his edge with oncoming age and the love of his family. His old school mentality does not adapt to the more businesslike, colder generation of mafia hoods where honor and respect are becoming a thing of the past.<br/><br/>This movie is marvelous character study comparison between father and son in a violent world. Intelligently done and should hold up for generations to come."

","The Godfather has to be the best movie of all time. It not only captivates the criminal aspect but the loyalty and business savvy of a mafia family. This movie is also great because it was the rock of many careers of our most notable and best actors and actresses. Al Pacino, Abe Bagoda, Diane Keaton, Sophia Coppala, Marlon Brando, and James Caan along with many others. Now whenever you see an organized crime movie anywhere it will be compared to the mafia story. This movie also teaches you some important roles to live by. Be careful who you trust.

","What makes this movie so good? It's, most fundamentally, and perhaps most subtly, that rich, full, religious-like piety (the kind that's earnest) that it exhibits, for the family, for loyalty in general, for a kind of life of crime that inspires reverence for the criminals rather than condemnation, as if somehow these criminals are martyrs who must do all the dirty work while protecting, or at least pretending to protect, their family and others from it. The movie has a belief in honor and traditionit also has a strong belief in power, though, a commitment to it. The respect for family in these movies is inexorably connected to the inconspicuous (or perhaps conspicuous)celebration of Don Corleone and his son Michael ""doing what it takes,"" acting illicitly as a kind of sacrifice, out of manly volition; in this aspect Michael and his father are like Fortinbras as opposed to Hamlet; by acting decisively they answer Hamlet's ""to be or not to be[?]"" with a firm ""to be."" When they reflect they are more like Hamlet himself, though they do not match Hamlet's scope of thought, but the movie supplies that missing profundity with the diffusive effect which is common to all films as inspired as this one: the look is just right, the pace, the music, the blocking and the photography in general."

","Actually Sonny's car is a 1940 or 1941 Lincoln Continental. <br/><br/>When Michael rides in the 1941 Buick with McClusky and Sollozo, notice that the steering wheel shows a lot of wear on the rim, and the rear window panes are starting to delaminate- this is indicated by the odd shapes on lower inner corners of the glass. This would not occur on a car less than 10 years old (at the time of the scene), but certainly would on a car that was over thirty years old. <br/><br/>Sonny's shooting was actually filmed on an airport runway, but the toll booths are exactly as I remember as I grew up on Long Island.

","All praise the godfather, patriarchal symbol of our time. For he is disappearing, yet fighting to reappear, fighting to be relevant. He has the audacity to proclaim honor among thieves, bullies and murderers. And for this, we are grateful. Opportunists may triumph, but we will preserve HIS spirit in our minds, amen.<br/><br/>If you go through the list of reviewers who love this movie and, if you listen to your friends who rave about its greatness, you'll find a not so astonishing leitmotif. They are almost all men. These men see ""The Godfather"" as symbolic of something. It's something sort of mystical, just like the rituals of the Catholic Churchgun smoke and incense. It has to do with the right of fatherly place, something which is being lost as time has marched on, ever onwards towards an oblivion of irrelevance for patriarchy, the family, private property and the State itself! We mourn the loss. We are nostalgic for these good old days. This is a tragedy. But, buck up, me buckos. It's also reality. You know that. That's what's so good about ""The Godfather"". It's REAL, baby! Don Vito Corleone is right to recognize that the potential violence embodied in HIM, the patriarch of the ruling family and his/its gang of servant/employees gives him the power to dispense justice. Kiss his hand. Lick it. He is Papa, you guinea. Justicewhat an abstraction, all filled with nicety-nice images of doing good unto others as you would have them do unto you. Pure crapola! You beat the crap out of your enemies and underlings and show them who's boss! That's the reality of everyday life within the political-economy of capitalism : political power comes out of the barrel of a gun baby and it hurts! <br/><br/>Michael: So the next day, my father went to see him; only this time with Luca Brasi. And within an hour, he signed a release, for a certified check for $1000. Kay: How'd he do that? Michael: My father made him an offer he couldn't refuse. Kay: What was that? Luca Brasi held a gun to his head and my father assured him that either his brains, or his signature, would be on the contract. That's a true story. That's my family, Kay, it's not me. <br/><br/>It's only the women-units, like Kay Adams who are confused and who need to be reminded, every once in a while. Kay ventures to open her mouth about politics and her naive liberalism is met with a quick back fist of REALITY by Michael Corleone, (who art her husband and budding patriarch in his own right, amen).<br/><br/>MC: My father is no different than any other powerful man -- any man who's responsible for other people, like a senator or president. KAY: You know how naive you sound...senators and presidents don't have men killed. MC: Oh, who's being naive, Kay? <br/><br/>That's it girls and the rest of you liberals and socialists. The richest one percent of the families in the USA own more of the well, no, I mean wealth, than the other ninety-percent of American families. For this, they get the best government money can buy. And, if someone stands in their way with some left-leaning line, well we know what happens to them.<br/><br/>As Barzini says to the other Dons about sharing the spoils from the well of exploitation: Certainly, he can present a bill for such services. After all, we're not Communists. But he must let us draw the water from the well. <br/><br/>Get it you softies? This is social darwinism in action, reduced to its simplest formula and ground down to its final solution. This is reality of THE GAME : dominance and submission, master and servant, the Godfather and you.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, true women can talk about the kids, especially about the up and coming males. She can cook and clean. This is her place. She knows nothing about the realities of politics. It is a dog-eat-dog world outside of her properly protected areas of concern : with the kids, in the kitchen and at church.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. This is a great flick. The acting was the best that most of these men ever did or would do. Of course, the women were a bit hollow. But that role fit the script. Francis Ford Coppola's direction was masterful as was his collaboration with Mario Puzo on the screenplay. The cinematography by Gordon Willis was appropriately brown, dark and conservative. The casting by Louis DiGiamio, Andrea Eastman and Fred Roos was near perfect.<br/><br/>Brando's last scene in ""The Godfather"" was really the classic moment. But then, there were so many. Anyway, remember? He and his grandson playing in the garden. First Vito sprays the bugs. He pushes the device. Out comes the death spray. Down go the bugs. Then, he gives the push-spray gun to little Michael's son. The cute thing chases his grandfather around spraying insect killer at him like it was some kind of Tommy Gun until, boom, the old ticker gives out and Brando collapses. The kid doesn't know he's dead yet and so steps up to the body and sprays it some more. <br/><br/>Rather like the last moments in Sonny's untimely death, no? Oh well, like father, like son."
"ianmacdcoleman","9","0","2","1 April 2006"," A terrifically entertaining movie, but deeply phony and morally dishonest.
","You get a lot to enjoy in The Godfather, although I suspect that anyone who has not read the book before seeing the movie might occasionally lose track of the plot.<br/><br/>But the movie is morally crooked, because the Corleone Family are never shown doing anything criminal, other than killing off rival criminals in justifiable self-defense. Don Vito Corleone is a wise, benevolent patriarch to the Italian American community of New York, and gets into trouble with rival gangsters only because he refuses to take part in selling heroin. Unless you have been told that he is a criminal, you'd never know. You certainly never see the Corleones cheating or hurting honest citizens. That's what I mean when I say that the movie is crooked.<br/><br/>Compare the Corleones to TV's Sopranos. Tony Soprano is overtly criminal-a brutal, thieving, murdering, adulterous extortionist who pretends to adhere to a Mafia code, which he breaks whenever it suits him to break it. This is why The Sopranos is artistically superior to The Godfather. The creators of the Sopranos have actually dared to make Tony Soprano and his fellow criminals hateful, which is just what you would expect real criminals to be. Don Corleone, on the other hand, resembles a real human being about as much as Tarzan of the Apes.<br/><br/>So, great as The Godfather is as an entertainment, it fails as art."
"98nurdinm-1","9","0","2","11 March 2006"," ""The Godfather"" of all movies.
","""The Godfather"" is much, much more than a great film - it's a legendary film, regarded by thousands as the greatest ever made. And its continual reign at the top of the IMDb.com top 250 proves this. There have been so many reviews written about this movie and its subsequent sequels, so much written about it - not only here on this website but in magazines, books, universities, the whole caboodle - that someone like me has to be careful that their review doesn't go over too much old ground and become boring. Unfortunately, to a large extent, ""The Godfather"" is famous for people being unanimous about what makes it so good and so I will probably have to repeat what countless others have said.<br/><br/>Certainly one can not fault the story itself - a magnificent tale of life in the Mafia and, in particular, of the development of the youngest son of Don Corleone (Marlon Brando), Michael (Al Pacino). The screenplay, adapted by Mario Puzo and Coppola from Puzo's own novel, is a breathtaking affair of first-class writing and suspense, and is a fine example of what is sadly missing in many of today's films. The fact that we, as an audience, are drawn into this world by the way in which it takes its time to unravel its many different layers is something that a lot of filmmakers don't consider today.<br/><br/>Take, for example, the scenes after the attempted murder on Corleone. The audience are told exactly what is going to happen with Michael's revenge, so that everything will seem plausible when the time comes. Think about it; if we had cut straight to the scene in the restaurant after Michael's announcement that he is going to kill Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) then the fact that Michael finds a gun in the bathroom would seem ridiculous and we would not believe it. It is like this throughout all the film - everything is explained to us, every last piece of information needed to tell us why this thing happens later on in the film, why he dies at this moment. It means that the movie takes its time - the DVD version I have is aprox. 164 minutes long - but in a sense you lose track of time because you are so engrossed in the story.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, not just Pacino or Brando, though these two do stand out, but the whole cast, even the extras in Sicily. Again, like every nook of the script, Coppola uses and manipulates every actor's potential to get the performance we deserve as an audience. There's a wonderful scene before the one mentioned earlier where the sons and Tom are discussing what to do next and they're all talking over each other. Utterly believable and excellent.<br/><br/>The film is shot beautifully. I'm no expert on this area and I do try to steer clear of it in reviews, but there's no doubt at how gorgeous the whole film looks. The colour is vibrant, and yet the shadows play such an important part in the key scenes. I believe it really reaches its full potential in the scenes in Sicily, truly capturing the beauty of the country, which in turn is transposed to the beauty of Appollina.<br/><br/>There are one or two flaws - after all, there has never been and never will be an utterly perfect film, despite what some people say - which are also, ironically, perfectly plausible. The female characters are weak and although this is obviously demonstrating the role of the woman in the Mafian society, Diane Keaton's character could have been stronger. Also, although wonderfully written, the script does need paying attention to, otherwise you are going to find yourself lost in a maze of Italian names.<br/><br/>What you cannot argue against, however, is the violence. Yes, ""The Godfather"" is a violent film, but the great thing about this violence is that Coppola only uses it WHEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. Unlike many films today, the violence in this movie is essential to the plot, to keep it driving on and also to give us a fantastic character study of Michael, particularly towards the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Enough's being said; if you haven't seen this movie you HAVE to see it, just to see what all the fuss is about. That's what I did, and it turned out all right for me. I mean, I haven't found a horse's head in my bed....yet.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I can't count the times I've seen the Godfather. I can't count the times I've read books about the movie. I can't say how much I regret not having found the time to read Mario Puzo's book. The Godfather is a story about a king and his three sons. And the sons all fight for power one way or another. The succession of the kingdom is the absolute reward for some and the absolute curse for others. There is something utterly seductive about the lighting of the movie, the stories (from the main stories to the secondary characters), about the ongoing feeling that danger lies around the corner, that this life is never safe and that you must, as popular Italian culture suggests, do everything for the family. ""In my youngest and more vulnerable years"" I wrote an essay about the role/position of women in the Godfather. I wrote about the flaws of the Godfather, about how, because it was filmed from the side of the family, you couldn't see the illegitimate character of the Corleone family's work. I wrote about the misogynist approaches and the utterly patriarchal viewpoints of the movie. I wrote about the inherent racism towards other ethnic minorities. But I still can't escape the spell. I still can't believe this feeling when Michael goes to the hospital to see Vito and he protects his father as is in his imaginative nature. There are so many moments in the Godfather that make me shiver. There's so much magic in the trilogy.<br/><br/>I don't give this movie a 10, because I am a perfectionist."

","The Godfather is Mario Puzo's and Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece, featuring Marlon Brando in his most memorable role as mafia boss Vito Corleone. As one of the most influential crime films, the Godfather is also much more than that.<br/><br/>It tells the tale of how the aging Vito needs to decide who is to succeed him as don of the Corleone crime-family. Since he has three sons and thus only three possibilities, he finds it difficult to choose between the capable Sonny, the timid Fredo and the intelligent Michael. Each son is in a way unsuited, since Sonny is such a tremendous hothead, Fredo is not quite smart enough and Michael doesn't want to have anything to do with his father's business. When a drug dealer named Sollozo interferes with the family's business however, bad things happen to the Corleone family. Michael seems to be the only one capable of saving his relatives from the bad luck that haunts them. But by doing so, he will need to give up everything he had in mind for himself, and he could risk losing the love of his life, Kay. As much as the Godfather is a story about crime, it's also a story about loving and caring for your family and be willing to do anything for them.<br/><br/>The acting performances are among the finest you'll ever witness. The music has a very chilling effect, and it has some of the most memorable scenes in the history of film. It's something you'll never forget, and everyone, especially film-lovers, should have seen this movie at least once before they go six feet under.

His denial to accept a narcotics deal gets him shot and although he survives, things are never the same again, with constant attempts to murder the bedridden Godfather.

","Everyone here have watched the movie, so I will save the effort to describe the movie again. After all, this movie is brilliant! One thing I like Don Vito Corleone is that he beat (though not depicted in the movie) the s**t out of the two punks who used violence on a girl. Nowadays, too many Americans ONLY blame other people or other things like they are the ONLY innocent ones. They kill because the video games are so violent, they steal because they cannot find a job paying them $30/hour to let them be a slacker, they sexually abuse minors because they are under control of the drug or alcohol, they are fat because the food is too delicious to resist. As a grown-up person, everybody should be responsible for his own wrongdoings. The video games will not open the TV by themselves, the alcohol or drug will not go into the body by itself and the delicious food will not go straight from the deep fryer into the stomach. This is a lesson I learned from Godfather, which is especially valuable in a world full of selfishness and cowardice."
"stefan-reindl","10","0","1","18 January 2006"," Coppola has created a masterpiece
","Mario Puzo's novel about crime, corruption, family and loyalty comes to life with the help of Francis Ford Coppola in The Godfather. The Corleone family, headed by the aging Vito Corleone, is the most powerful family on the East coast, and possibly all of America. They ""own"" senators, judges and policemen. They are above the law. Vito's son, Michael, has just returned from the war a hero, and wants no part in the family business. But when an up and coming rival family wanting to get into the drug trade asks the Corleones for protection, Don Vito declines their offer, sticking to his traditional Sicilian values. The other families aren't as concerned about the old ways and want in, but know that they can't do business without the Corleones' influence. So, they have Don Corleone shot, expecting to gain leverage with the Don out of action. Luckily, the Don survives and Michael, furious with the attempt on his father's life, steps up to take out the opposition.<br/><br/>Soon, Michael, originally wanting nothing to do with the family business, proves himself to be quite a strategist, always playing mind games with everyone. Everyone except his father, of course. Michael slowly crawls up the ladder of power, destroying anyone who gets in his way, until he sits comfortably at the top. Ruthlessness is his tool and he wields it well. Only those inside the family and his small circle of long term friends are safe from his wrath.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone is magnificent. Brando portrays him perfectly as the tough and feared old patriarch that, although brutal to his enemies, loves and cares for his family. His raspy whisper and deliberate movements will forever echo in film history (already having been parodied and imitated countless times).<br/><br/>Al Pacino's Michael Corleone makes a very gradual transformation from the respectable war hero with a nice girlfriend to a full-fledged criminal mastermind. At the beginning of the film, Michael is a friendly young man who wants no part in his father's world. In the very last scene, he is a dangerous, cold-blooded sociopath who still cares for his family, but will do anything to further his influence. Pacino gives a career-making performance and fits perfectly into the role of brilliant anti-hero (as well as the roles of Tony Montana in Scarface and Sonny Wortzik in Dog Day Afternoon that would come later in his career).<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola's directing is perfect. The dark, dramatic lighting used inside the Don's office is a trademark of foreboding danger and power. Everything from the gruesome and, sometimes, disturbing execution killings to the way Vito Corleone looks at his son, Michael, adds to the intoxicating blend of brutality and love that Coppola serves his audience.<br/><br/>Nino Rota's score only spices up the brew with his traditional Italian-sounding pieces that conjure up images of tough Sicilian men riding horse-back through rugged terrain in the old country. A beautiful soundtrack to an already beautiful film.<br/><br/>The Godfather is about how the human mind is affected by crisis, opportunity and corruption. Michael Corleone does not involve himself in the family business until they go after his father. This proves to be the catalyst. Michael takes the plunge into the underworld and, upon realizing that he is smarter than all of the other families put together, only goes deeper. He plays the game of crime like chess. He plans his moves and has all the angles covered. He strikes swiftly and without mercy. Michael Corleone is a criminal, but he is very different from the goon knocking over a 7-11 with a pen-knife. Coppola has created a masterpiece."

","I have a sentimental love for the first Godfather. Though part 2 might itself be a better film, i love the Corleone family because of the first one. Every time i see it, i remember why these people feel like family to me: sonny is like an obnoxious older brother sometimes, hot headed, but genuinely loving and caring. Tom is the level headed man, who takes into consideration the wisest way to handle things and benefit the family. Fredo is the one that everyone loves, just because he can't take care of himself. and Michael, he's everyman isn't he? He has dreams and goals and wants to live his life independent of the influence of his family. but circumstance formulates, and deepens his character. He soon chooses a path that he swore he never would, but he is almost forced to do it. Granted, no one is pointing a gun to his head- but his heart compels him.<br/><br/>and Don Vito himself. An aging king who's love for his family is what keeps him alive even after a brutal assassination attempt. What is he to do about his kingdom? he knows he has little time left, yet, his sons imperfections and his own regrets (though he says he has none) leave him questioning the future. I draw a parallel here to King Lear and even Kurosawa's Ran- Vito Corleone is much like the principal characters in these other two works, though more composed and strong in mind.<br/><br/>Look beyond the violence, the slick talk, the plot. See the love, the family, the relationships. You'll be able to see your own family in the Corleones, as imperfect as they are (being that we need to remember that they are monsters, who murder people for personal gain) and more importantly, you'll be able to see yourself. Not one of us can say that we're any better- we can only say that we've chosen a different road."

","This is the most powerful and greatest movie ever made. It has its mistakes (see the goofs section) but I am sure many would agree with me. Marlon Brando delivers the best acting performance in movie history and Francis Ford Coppola directs brilliantly, no matter what Robert Evans or Paramount thought. I think Bob Evans should have shut his mouth during production of this film because he would have ruined its greatness had Coppola lost his will to direct under his constant complaining. Al Pacino delivers a slightly good performance, Jimmy Caan delivers a great performance along with Robert Duvall. Several quotes and scenes make the movie memorable and to this day, powerful. This is a must see for anyone. 20/10."
"benjajamim","10","0","1","10 January 2006"," A film you will not be able to refuse...
","Elegant crime and respected Italian leaders is the best setting for a Mafia. The Godfather is truly a great movie. When I saw it I felt identified even though I have nothing to do with any mafia. The main point of this film is how Michael Corleone inherits the work of his father, Vito Corleone. This movie touched my emotions. It is greatly directed by my friend the great Francis Ford Copolla, greatly written by my dearest Mario Puzzo and PERFECTLY ACTED by my masters Marlo Brando and Al Pacino. It is not by coincidence that this is ranked Top 1 in the IMDb list. The character of MArlo Brando is the perfect character a film like this should have: an old wise man who knows whats good and bad for his business, who even though leads a huge criminal bloody almost gore mafia, has a soul of his own that manages to love his family.<br/><br/>The Godfather is truly one of my favourite films, highly over-passing all the modern day high-tech criminal movies. The point that sets this whole story in motion is that it is not about crime, but about business, not clean but big business. And then comes Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, a humble little man whose life is happy and truthful. He's loyal to his country and opposes to work for his father and brother Sonny. Al Pacino, due to his usually expression-less face during The Godfather, shows he's was meant to be the one to inherit the ""familia"".<br/><br/>The music is probably the memory that will remain longer from this movie in my mind. The famous waltz, and the famous theme used many times in the scenes of Scisilly. Try to never hear this songs until you see the movie and it will cause to even the bravest hearts some bit of emotion (which is hard to accomplish).<br/><br/>Last but not least, Francis Ford Copolla direction is probably his best. He includes beautiful settings in Corleone, beautiful enegeryfull angles in the wedding scenes, some great camera movement, great timing so it is not too slow or too fast. Francis Ford Copolla is certainly one of the best directors and it is shown in this film. The Godfather is a classic which movie lovers cannot die without seeing. If you don't like it (something that I've never heard as a reaction to this film)you better begin question yourself."

","I remember seeing this as an 8 or 9 year old kid with a friend of mine when it first came out(with no parental guidance, the manager of the theatre never enforced the rating system). You would think a 8 or 9 year kid at the time would find the movie long or boring, but quite the opposite, when it had an intermission at the 2 hour mark we was like wow 2 hours has passed!! This is a movie best not watched on TV where there is commercials to interrupt because TV tends to make one's attention span short due to the enormity of other programming to watch.I remember watching it on TV years later and thinking to myself i can see how someone just seeing it for the first time would find it long and boring. The reason being is because if you do not tune on it from the beginning it is not the type of movie that will catch your attention compared to the action adventure blockbuster movies people are use to seeing. For a movie to keep a couple of 8 or 9 year old kids interested for 4 hours it had to done something right.I am not a movie critic so i don't feel comfortable rating it but to this day it is one of the few movies i can clearly recall almost every scene as compared to other movies where i just have a vague recollection of what they were about and what happened when and where.One reason i think i enjoyed it so much as a kid was because the story was interesting. A mafia kingpin trying to survive gang-wars and treachery.He realizes it is not good profession or lifestyle to have so he tried to steer his son Michael into a peaceful legitimate respectable profession. He tries to explain to Michael the reasons he turned to this lifestyle is because he didn't have access to the educational opportunities Michael had access to. With a wife and many children to feed and jobs very scarce he had to do what was necessary so his family could eat and survive. He knew that Sonny's temperament would not allow Sonny to change course from the family's profession and Fredo so much a nincompoop that Fredo could not have too much responsibility or pressure thrust on him and would need someone to look after him so he kinda was treated like the women of the family. But he saw in Michael intelligence and ability, and he wanted Michael to use his talents legitimately and achieve the American Dream. Sorta what every father wishes for their sons. I think the turning point for Michael from turning from the American Dream was when the police under McCluskey instead of normally taking a neutral role in the war between the gangs took an active role in protecting Sollozo and trying to rid Don Vito of any bodyguards at the Hospital so the allied Sollozo-Barzini-Tattaglia camp could finish Don Vito off. When Michael was roughed up by McCluskey and the police he began to see the American Dream as a big corrupt hypocrisy and that money and the access to money was the only thing that really mattered in America. Recall the speech he gave to Mary Kay when he told her she was the one who was really naive not him ( It may have been in The Godfather part 2).From that point on Michael began see the irony and erroneous assertions of what his dad was saying that politicians and police would desert him if he would began to expand into narcotics but the exact opposite was happening with the opposing Sollozo-Barzini-Tattaglia faction as their Consigliere Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall) predicted. Sollozo was virtually untouchable because he had Police protection because of the wealth he accumulated from his narcotic operations.As a result Michael lost all his idealism and became a pragmatist. Why try to become legitimate and respectable when no one really is and the so called legitimate and respectable people behind closed doors sell out to the highest bidders regardless whether or not if they are ruthless killers, murderers and worst scum of society.You can transform into being respectable and legit once you accumulate your wealth. Notice the talk by Michael near the end that they are moving the operations to Las Vegas and going Legit."

","Before I saw 'The Godfather', I had always wondered about it; been seeing it at #1 on the IMDb Top 250 List. It has a consistent rating of 9.1/10.0 and I was always fascinated by that. I had some really heavy duty expectations from this movie.<br/><br/>A friend lent me his DVD and I finally saw this movie which has widely been said to be the greatest movie in all of film history! This was quite long ago, and in all honesty I wasn't very impressed in my first viewing (probably due to my ultra-high expectations). <br/><br/>Now, I had heard about The Godfather Part II being better. Therefore, after knowing all the characters and the actual story in Part I, I rented Part II.<br/><br/>This time, I was awestruck, as I totally fell in love with Part II! I shall leave the review of 'The Godfather Part II' to its own comments section.<br/><br/>Since I loved Part II, I decided to watch the first installment again. Only this time, I liked it much better than the first viewing! It turned out to be one of those movies that get better with each viewing. I was also picking out the reasons why I hadn't liked it by itself at that time. <br/><br/>First, though, the pluses, which are aplenty! Wonderful acting from everyone in the lead roles as well as the supporting cast. Marlon Brando never fails to amaze me with his majestic screen presence! Other bravura performances: Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Richard Castellano and Al Lettieri (as Virgil Solozzo). John Cazale is good too (although he has a bigger part in Part II, so he made a bigger impression there).<br/><br/>The story: The novel is already one of the most popular books I've ever come across! The story is indeed powerful and quite gripping.<br/><br/>The cinematography: Need I mention the already talked about sepia colors Coppola has used throughout the trilogy? They add a wonderful touch to the movie and it makes the movie look more ""beautiful""! <br/><br/>The Lighting: Excellent effects; one noteworthy scene is the talk between Solozzo and Hagen. The dim lighting gives a brilliant touch to their topic of discussion! <br/><br/>The score: Beautiful, haunting music that won't let go; I still casually whistle the tunes every now and then! Thus, as far as the technical aspects are concerned, the film is flawless! (well, almost...there are a few revealing mistakes as are listed in the goofs section of this movie!) <br/><br/>Now the minuses: I was not happy with a couple of things. First of all, my biggest complaint..the length of Marlon Brando's screen time!! His scenes total to a length of not more than 50 mins in a running time of 175 mins!! Why? I just wished I could see more of his greater than great performance! Second thing: The blooming of Michael and Apollonia's romance in Sicily appears at a time when the story should've really moved ahead at the pace that it had caught! Those scenes in Sicily (him being ""hit by thunderbolt"" on seeing her; the exchange of glances, etc.) were just taking too long and could have easily been cut short! They just hampered the smooth flow of the story. I can say that 'The Godfather' is an almost perfect film! Minuses apart, the film has some really memorable scenes, which will go down in history as some of the classiest moments in cinema.<br/><br/>The Godfather saga continues in Part II, which is even better than this first offer that no respectable movie buff can refuse....."

"phattdirty","10","0","1","12 December 2005"," The Godfather, a review
","Hailed by almost every film critic as a masterpiece this film is regularly voted as #1 in film polls, or at very least in the top 10. And if there was ever a movie which deserved it's place amongst the elite, this is it. Director Francis Ford Coppola had only made low-budget movies and enjoyed limited success as a director up until 1970 when he came to recognition with his screenplay for Patton. The screenplay won himand co-writer Edmund H. North an Oscar. He then began work on a screenplay for The Godfather with Mario Puzo, the book's author. The resulting film took the world by storm and won Coppola his second Oscar for writing. The film also won Best Picture and Best Actor (Marlon Brando) at the 1973 Academy Awards and was nominated for 8 others Oscars including three nominations for Best Supporting Actor (James Caan, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall).<br/><br/>The wealth of acting talent in the leading roles is unparalleled. Marlon Brando's Don has been copied and imitated in countless films and TV shows since it's release; the strength and memorable nature of his performance standing as a true testament to his acting ability. Al Pacino gives a career best performance as Michael, struggling to remain aloof of his family's criminal activities and maintain a happy relationship with his girlfriend Kay (played brilliantly by Diane Keaton) but eventually being dragged into the family 'business' by his father's failed assassination attempt. James Caan is superb as the hot-headed older Corleone brother, Sonny; subsequent acting roles have never quite given him the opportunity to shine as he does here. Robert Duvall's cool, calm and collected adopted brother character, Tom, is a marvellous addition to the family as he tries to diffuse situations with sensible advice (he is the family's lawyer and consigliore). However he too appears to have hidden, darker tendencies; the famous horse's head scene is apparently all his own doing. The whole Corleone family is played with perfect depth and emotion by all the actors; John Cazale as Fredo is the perfect example of the understated performancehe is not as prominent as Sonny, Michael and Tom but still an integral player and extremely memorable. The only aspect of the acting which seems to be less than perfect is the supporting actors in the smaller roles. Although there is nothing 'wrong' with their performances, one does feel at times that they are stereotypes i.e. the rotund chef / hit-man Clemenza, and the aging henchman still trying to break out into his own 'family' (Tessio).<br/><br/>This is without a doubt the most influential movie of the 1970s and whatever minor quibbles might exist about some of the stereotyping, the acting of the leading stars, the perfect direction and brilliant musical score (by Coppola's father, Carmine) cannot be faulted. The pacing and editing of The Godfather must also be commended because even with a runtime of almost three hours, it never feels boring and withstands repeated viewing. A true American classic, it spawned two sequels; The Godfather Part II, which is also hailed as a masterpiece and won numerous Oscars, and the lesser but still noteworthy Part III. Currently residing at #1 on the IMDb's Top 250 list, this has been firmly lodged there for some time."

","One word: Awesome.<br/><br/>The Godfather held my interest from beginning to end. Reasons for that was the direction, the performances, the cinematography, the editing, and the storyline. Mario Puzo's book of a powerful Mafia family in New York, along with their relationship with the other fellow organized crime organizations, and the rise and fall of Don Corleone was directed with delicate efficiency and care. Marlon Brando it the star of the film, but Al Pacino was the real reason to watch the movie. His character, Michael, at first does not want to take part in the family's business, but we soon see how one punch to the face by a cop can turn the tide, and Pacino creates a well drawn character for himself to play. Francis Ford Coppola did a extraordinary job with this movie, and Brando, Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Cann gave great performances. This is one of my favorite films of all time.<br/><br/>10/10"
"sa-kawel","10","0","1","11 December 2005"," Nice movie
","Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.<br/><br/>Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best. Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever."

The interplay between all actors is of the highest standard and the ""look"" of the film is convincing & classy.

Of course, Brando just keeps up what was an excellent performance throughout.<br/><br/>I had memories of this film being quite difficult to follow as a youngster. This may have been in part due to the sometimes muffled voice of Brando, but with the help of subtitles at my dumbest moments(!), the plot and characters are actually fairly easy to keep up with.<br/><br/>Cant really say much more.

If you watch the movie for the first time it can fill you up with quite a lot of anxiety (second or third viewing still can't exclude it). <br/><br/>The final act was exceedingly memorable and symbolic. We see Michael Corleone and his family at the church during a sacred act, the christening of his niece. Parallel to that event is the killing of the family rivals.

At one point, i was made to believe that I too was a part of the movie and a living-breathing character. I was so into it. Oh my god it was perfection. Marlon Brando's and Al Pacino's acting was nothing less than AWE-INSPIRING. The scene when Al Pacino shoots down 'Solozzo and McCluskey' was terrific. It just transformed Michael's character from a civilized American army-man into a civilized Sicilian-American don, and this journey of transformation was conducted so beautifully in the movie. Another great scene was when Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando) expresses his grief to Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) his son over Michael's current profession. He tells Michael as to how he once hoped that Michael would be the one to give the family a taste of Legality, but ended up being the Don who would head the Crime Family of the Corleone's. How he hoped that one day Michael would become a Senator or a Priest. Every actor's performance was supreme. What a fantastic movie. Can't wait for it to be Re-released."

","This movie is awesome. I've been in love with this movie (and the other two) since I was a young girl. And I think partly due to this movie, I love movies with violence. Not that this movie has tons of violence in it, but it has enough to leave a lasting impression on a young person. It has been said many, many times before that ""all I need to know, I learned from the Godfather"" and truer words have never been spoken. At it's core, The Godfather is about family values. This movie isn't only about the mob or drugs or any of those things that's just one part of it, but ultimately, it's about family. Despite not exactly having anything in common with the characters, this movie has left a mark on my life that could not have been placed there by another movie. This is THE best movie. Great job Puzo & Coppola. RIP Mr. Puzo."

","OH MY GOD!!! I have never watched a film this long before then decided to sit down and watch it again. I've seen plenty this long and although I enjoyed them and watched parts of them again, I have never watched one like this all the way through. Let's take your standard gangster film, either you have the new guy just arrived in town looking for trouble, Joe from 'A fistfull of dollars', or you have the guy looking for revenge, Porter in Payback, or the cop trying to stop them, countless films. THIS IS DIFFERENT!! Sure you might say gangsters have been the guys your rooting for before but no not like this. You start with an established family, and you watch them fall into the ruin and gradually get saved. Brando and Pacino both deserve every award there is for making characters who although are often bad you can still see the old fashioned hero in. Not one bad actor, not one bad character. Not one bad moment. Yet why isn't it no. 1? Well I don't know but it isn't really no. 1 material. Perhaps its the fact you have so much story to take in and so much happens that you aren't sure whats just happened or it could be simple. I could have just expected a no. 1, a film that had me crying, cheering, yelling. I didn't get that but I cant think of one better gangster film, or one other film that deserves to be a classic like this. So perhaps it is a no. 1, for now until a true no. 1 comes along. For those of you who say 'the book was good, not sure if I want to see this', then I'll tell you this. This film is a book. not only is it a book, it's a great book. You cant put it down but when you do you can start anywhere. You can flick back to clarify what has happened, the story is well structured the characters well developed. It's well cut as if it's been edited by a publisher. I don't want to call this no. 1 because when you see it you'll constantly be judging it as a no. 1 film, like I was, and you will feel let down. However if you see it not expecting a no. 1, you will finish it having seen a no. 1."

","This is in my opinion, the true classic of American cinema. From the opening to the climax inter-cut with the baptism of Connie Corleone's son you will be riveted to your television screen. This is not, however, a fast-moving mob film like Martin Scorsese's work, but more of a drama. Also unlike Scorsese's work, this is more of a romanticised version of mob life, and you will grow to like the characters better because of this If Mafia films aren't your cup of tea I still recommend The Godfather as it depicts family life as well as Family life, showing how Don Vito keeps his family together through good and bad.

","A Masterpiece of its time and all time, this movie defined the term - ""blockbuster movie"" and set the ultimate limit for a cinematic masterpiece. No one would have ever believed that this movie would have such an impact on popular, mainstream American cinema. The executives of the studio that funded this movie's production just seemed to keep their fingers crossed and hoped that the movie wouldn't bomb really bad in the box office. Their fears were not unreal. They were taking a mammoth risk by funding a movie to be directed by a 'risk taking, not so popular' director starring many unknown actors in major roles and to top it all, the story was to be adapted from a decently popular fictional novel. All these factors could have kept this movie down. If it weren't for the amazing talent exploited really very well in every department, aspect of the movie, their worst fears would have been realized. ""The Godfather"" established many careers and gave life to many interesting personalities to have ever graced the screen. A ""Definite Watch"" for anyone who wants to know what a 'perfect, no non-sense movie' is all about and also in general, an engrossing movie that grows on you over time."

","This film, without a doubt, is one of the most popular films in history.<br/><br/>""The Godfather,"" as we all know, is based on an early 70's novel by Italian author Mario Puzo. It tells the tale of one family and it's destiny...the Corleones. Don Vito Corleone (the Godfather) is the head of the Corleone family and runs his 1940's New York empire with Mafia justice. The story begins with the wedding of Vito's daughter, Connie, to Carlo Rizzi. Present in the wedding include Vito's sons and heirs, Sanito (""Sonny""), Fredo, and, most famous of all, Michael, the reluctant heir to his father's business.<br/><br/>While the Corleone family is wealthy and fortunate, they also have some rival Mafia families, such as the Tattaglia, Sollozzo, Brasi, and son on and so forth. Tragedy occurs when Vito is injured by the gun of one of the rivals, and thus, a tale of the mafia, bloodshed, and family takes place. ""The Godfather"" chronicles the story of a family trying to stay on top during a dog-eat-dog era, revenge and murder, family and trust, as well as the rise of Michael Corleone as the don (head) of his family and how he avenged his entire family from all rivals.<br/><br/>Puzo's novel was brought to the screen by legendary director Francis Ford Coppolla, whose daughter, Sophia, is now following his footsteps and unleashing her directional legacy with films like ""Virgin Suicides"" and ""Lost in Translation."" F.F. Coppolla uses his talents to tell Puzo's story through actors and actresses.<br/><br/>Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone and brings a fine Michael Corleone, portraying the his character well. Pacino shows the evolution of Michael from the reluctant young man to this ruthless don and willing godfather like his dad. Diane Keaton also stars in this movie, playing Michael's non-Italian wife, Kay Adams. But, of course, the title role (the Godfather) is given to the recently-deceased legend Marlon Brando. Brando is truly Vito Corleone, bar none, and you better respect him or else.<br/><br/>Other than the actors and actresses, the sets are good, too. This is not a cheery and bright film but a dark and gloomy epic. The grim and gritty 40's-50's NYC sets reflect the brutality of that time, when gangs were the rulers of New York's streets. However, the Corleone family's Italian heritage is also reflected, and who's better in making Italian music than Italian composer, Nino Rota? The Godfather theme song (""Speak Softly, Love"") is just as classic as the film.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" was released in 1972. It was a critical and commercial success, winning several Oscars, even, best of all, Best Picture. It was followed by 1974's ""Godfather, Part II,"" and 1990's ""Part III."" The first sequel was just as acclaimed as the first while the latter had mixed reviews. But still, all of these films are regardless as classics by critics and the movie-going public. Many consider this film to be the greatest film of all time.<br/><br/>Runningtime 175 mins. (2 hrs. 57 mins.) Rated R for graphic violence"

","I must say this film is the best mobster/gangster movie ever made. The acting is so superb , it was a crime that Pacino was not an Oscar winner for any of these classics! Al goes from an Ivy League College-Boy / War Hero to a cold, calculating mob boss and he does it all to the point where you not only believe the transformation, but applaud it as well ! This was also one of those rare times where the film was actually as good as the book ! And of course there's the music and costumes and vintage cars... it's all a treat for movie-lovers.. If you see only ONE ""mafia"" movie in your life, this MUST be it !

","I have watched it more than six times and every time I watch it I discover that it is more beautiful than before. Every aspect of this movie is really wonderful. I can say it is one of the masterpieces in the history of film making. To me it is the number one movie of all times. Marlon Brando was marvelous. Al Pacino was adorable. James Caan was great. Robert Duval was really great. It is really hard to tell what is missing in this movie. The whole package was really astonishing. I have never imagined a movie will have such an impact on me as well as on many others. I have watched it with my brothers a couple of years ago. You won't believe it if I tell you that every year I go to a movie store and rent it again. I will be doing this for the rest of my life because it is an artistic piece that is worth watching more and more. In conclusion, I would like to say that if Marlon Brando had not been there, this movie would have lost a lot of its glimmering and shimmering light. Al Pacino was also as outstanding as Marlon Brando. The movie is a way beyond criticism. It is a work of art for all generations and at all times. Also the story itself is well-knit that you feel it happened in reality. There are lots of movies out there, but they never measure up to the God Fahter."

","I can't say enough great things about ""The Godfather."" It is, without a doubt, the greatest film ever made. The plot is gripping, an amazing interpretation of the American Mafia, and the film's acting is superb. The characters make the film seem like we are watching a documentary moreso than a movie. You can see the transformation of Michael from the reluctant son, to the man who inherits an empire. Al Pacino's performance is outstanding. Marlon Brando is such a believable godfather that I think mafiosos throughout history would feel intimidated if they ever had to go to a ""meeting"" with Don Corleone.<br/><br/>James Caan also provides a smashing performance as the hot-headed Sonny. His ferocity and high spirited attitude adds so much to the film. I've always wondered if Robert Duvall's natural speaking voice is that of Tom Hagan or of another one of his characters like the preacher or Gus.<br/><br/>This is one of the few films that I will never, ever grow tired of watching. Dramatically and cinematically speaking, it is one of the few films that I admire and wish that other Hollywood directors and producers would try to emulate as far as style, story development and acting goes, especially in Hollywood's dark time of remakes and lackluster script writing."

Sonny is great (although I don't know his name). In fact all the Corleones are great along with all the cast. I'm commenting on all three of the movies as a saga as they're all superb but part 2 is something else as many people agree. You may think I go hard when commenting on this trilogy but seriously, it's excellent. I definitely recommend you to own a copy of The Godfather at least and I'm disappointed that I wasn't born when the movies were released as they would've been quality cinema I think."
"ian-smith","10","0","2","6 July 2005"," Brilliantly Haunting
","To begin with, I had not seen the Godfather, nor its subsequent sequels, until about two years ago. I have only one thing to say about this: Why? Why did I not see this sooner? Francis Ford Coppolla creates a brilliantly haunting masterpiece, full of drama, and perfectly sets the mood, entrancing you frame by frame into the world of legalized crime. Marlon Brando shines in quite possibly his greatest performance ever as the Don Vito Corleone. While he may not appear to be a truly menacing figure, as the viewer you instantly respect him with the way he carries himself and his words. Brando's range of emotions, the way every line he speaks is with conviction of a man who is so wise, truly defines the character that I'm not sure anyone originally thought could be so strong. The next main cast standout is Al Pacino, who gives here a staggering performance as Vito's youngest son, Michael. The transformation of his character is absolutely incredible, from the mild-mannered Captain in the United States Marine Corps, to the future and eventual Godfather of the Corleone Family. Pacino completely grasps his role and takes on an entirely different life himself, to the point where we forget he is an actor. The rest of the cast is extremely superb, all the way down to the most minute character. Perhaps the two most touching scenes are 1) When Michael visit's his father in the hospital after the attempted murder at the hands of the Tattaglia family, and 2) After James Caan's character, Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone, is albeit brutally shot numerous times, and Vito Corleone asks the mortuary to ""use all of his powers"" to fix his son, because he ""didn't want his mother to see him like this."" This is truly a magnificent story, filled with betrayal, family loyalty, and eventual heartbreak. A marvelous masterpiece from both Copolla and Mario Puzo, who wrote the screenplay (and the later who wrote the novel). And to think that Paramount almost fired both Copolla and Pacino because they weren't the first choices! That would have been an insult! If that had happened, I would not be here, commenting on this movie, because it would not have been anywhere near as beautiful of a film. If you haven't seen this yet, see it now! Don't wait another minute! If you have, watch it again. And again. And again. Now, I'm going to end this review, and watch it myself."

"Surecure","10","0","2","24 May 2005"," About the closest thing that 20th Century film came to Shakespearean scale tragedy
","The Godfather and the Godfather Part 2 represent a defining moment in cinema. Few films can claim to be such an integral element of modern film-making as Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo's masterpiece that explores the downfall of a man born into the world of the Italian mafia. To describe either film as being perfect is not an overstatement in any means.<br/><br/>Coppola's mastery of direction is evident from the very beginning of the first film of the Godfather trilogy. The ""I Love America"" speech tells the audience exactly what they need to know about the world these characters inhabit, and the wedding that follows sets up all that is to befall ""the family"" over the course of the film. Coppola clearly demonstrates a true understanding of the delicate balance between the importance of camera work and the necessity of allowing master performers the latitude to develop their characters to the rich level they achieve.<br/><br/>When one combines a perfect script with perfect performances by some of the legends of film, all under the guidance of a director with a mature and tasteful sense of the art of film, the results are inspiring. The Godfather and the Godfather Part II are my favourite films of all time simply because they are the closest thing that the 20th Century ever produced to Shakespearean tragedy. They go beyond the clichÃ©s of Hollywood sentimentality and strike at the heart of what great drama is about: love, hate, the death of idealism under the weight of the world... and family."

","So much praise has been attributed already to Coppola's multi-layered masterwork it's difficult to add to anything not already said. It's enduring appeal over the years (it's incredible how it hasn't feel at all dated) must be the result of Coppola's mix of excellent ensemble acting by all concerned - a multi-layered complex story reflecting not only dispelling the myths of how the mafia was perceived in post WW2 America, but also edicts of family, loyalty, devotion and the difficulty of controlling or maintaining any position of power, as well as some brilliant set pieces, character acting & one-liners that have become part of film history folklore. This saga & story span many years but is entirely engaging throughout. <br/><br/>Ultimately though, it has to be seen as the prototype great American saga family soap opera, and the one by which all others are judged. Much has been stated about Brando' performance -ultimately it's the restraint he shows in exposing the frailty of an ageing Mafia Don losing his grip on power and struggling to effectively raise his family and keep his favourite son out of a life of crime. Pacino is brilliant at conveying the transformation of innocent son struggling to keep the family business at arm's length, to the painful realisation for his family to survive he too must compromise to become the type of character he loathes yet is extremely effective at- both ruthless & uncompromising.<br/><br/>Beautifully shot by Gordon Willis, and brilliantly acted by a cast that quite rightly all went on to become some of America's greatest actors of their generation. Every viewer I have spoken to is engaged and enchanted by the characters;both strenghths & foibles- Don Corleone is a man of great power, epitomising the dark & light sides of the American dream, but for the most part he uses it mercifully. we feel for this family's pain when they suffer loss despite their sins, & root for their merciless triumph.<br/><br/>A great American masterwork, and one of the greatest films of all time."

","Now as I think, what to write about 'The Godfather' a thousand brilliant perspectives flash in my mind. Should I marvel at the mesmerizing story that surrounds you ever so sweetly or should I wonder about strong undertones which reveal themselves like shooting starts. Should I admire the vivid visualization of the dream or should I talk about the truth that emerges from it. Godfather might be a great movie to others but to me it is a journey through human mind, candid and knowing. The motives of a man and the eternal conflict with direction. All that is said about 'good', reveals itself in the story of this bad man. I am a fan of Vito Carlione, he is wise, he is respectful, he is a true capitalist. He is not bad himself but does not mind employing bad means. After all, some body has got to do the exploration. I can't say how thankful I am to people who made this movie for not spoiling my imagination. A truth well told is the biggest achievement."

","I remember having seen this movie many times when I was a teenager. All my friends swore this movie was great and anyone who didn't see it was missing out. I would watch a little of it here and there in between bouts of reading or napping. I was bored.<br/><br/>Fast forward almost 15 years. I am home and this movie is being shown in its entirety. I decide to give it one more try and see if I could understand what all the hype is about. I am glad I did! This movie is about emotions, which fuel every action a human commits. This time, there was no reading, no napping, just me telling my friend to be quiet so I wouldn't miss anything! I realized the movies Hollywood puts out today are awful! I have been watching many ""older"" movies lately and feel as if the viewers are being cheated to a point. There are no ""classics"" being made. People do not have a choice between seeing a mentally stimulating film or a 2 hour fluff film just to escape reality for a little while. There are no performances that match Brando, Caan, Pacino, and Duvall.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando was undeniably one of the best actors of the 20th century, even though he made light of his talent and profession. His turn as the Corleone patriarch was absolutely mesmerizing and should be considered some of the finest acting work ever captured on film. Caan's performance as the hotheaded Sonny shows how underrated this actor became. He captured the rage, anger, and disregard for health and life it takes to be a cold-hearted, ruthless ""businessman"". Yet, unlike today's ""gangster"" movies, his actions were glorified because the other side of the coin is taken into account, karma.<br/><br/>Pacino was definitely in rare form here. His latest movies don't live up to this performance. He showed the talent is there, but Hollywood doesn't require that anymore. Duvall, as always turned in a stellar performance.<br/><br/>This film captured the good, the bad, and the ugly of crime life and real life. It's riveting and will keep your attention. This film a 9/10."

","The Godfather is a movie that will never be forgotten. I watched it when I was 11, and I fell in love with it then.<br/><br/>This is a movie about an Italian mafia family living in New York. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the family, and he's always been taking care of everything. The movie first shows how the whole business works, with making sacrifices, keeping promises, and getting revenge. Sonny and Michael are Don Vito's sons. Everyone knew that Michael was the smart, elite ""college boy"" of the family, and Sonny was the completely opposite, and someday he'd be the head, the new Don Corleone. Michael doesn't want to be involved in the family business, until Don Vito gets shot by some of his enemies because of the whole deal about whether drugs should be sold or not, and troubles start to happen. Michael knows he's the only one who he can save his father. When he agreed to take revenge to the enemies who shot his father, he had gotten himself into a completely new life filled with violence, hatred, and betrayal, a world he had never experienced before, and there's no turning back.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna say what's going to happen next, for the people who haven't seen this yet. But if you're one of them, make sure you see this. This movie is absolutely perfect and flawless."

","I believe the Godfather is the greatest film all time. Marlon Brando, who at first wasn't interested to play Don Vito Corleone, put down his most stunning performance ever. The characteristics, the voice of Brando match perfect with the some kind of mysterious Vito Corleone. This film is also the real start of the career of Al Pacino. After he played Michael Corleone, he was immediately given the role of young cop Serpico one year later in 1973. The best actors of two following eras meet here in this film. But the Godfather is more than just Brando or Pacino. We must certainly not forget the brilliant performances by James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton, all Oscar nominated. John Cazale playing Fredo Corleone stays a bit in the background. I liked him better in part 2. Francis Ford Coppola puts all this great actors together in a beautiful whole."

","I watched The Godfather for the first time on DVD the other day and was simply blown away from the very start. It had a quality that no other film has and much of this is accomplished by the brilliance of the director, Francis Ford Coppola, and actors Marlon Brando and the astonishing performance of Al Pacino, who many doubted at the time. All great films require a great beginning and this one had, in my opinion, the best yet with the very first line, 'I believe in America', and then the very slow draw back of the camera to reveal The Godfather (Brando). I was worried for Al Pacino at the start of the film whether he would be shadowed out of this movie by the brilliance of Brando, but all doubt quickly went from my mind after watching him in the restaurant scene. The way that he sat there so calmly to the people he was talking to but to the audience he built up an incredible amount of tension. This was important for him to do this because this part of the film was the defining moment of this characters transition, from not wanting to be involved at the start and now he is doing his fathers job personally."

","The Godfather Saga is the best story ever. With respect to George Lucas and his Star Wars series, There is nothing better then a story about money, power, and respect in an American setting. The series starts with Part 1, The Godfather, which is in the same category with Citizen Kane, Casablanca, The Searchers, and Schindler's List as the best movie of there respected Genres. As good as Marlon Brando is in this film, I think that his best film was On the Waterfront and this is his last goodbye. I realize that Last Tange in Paris was a great performance, but the Godfather was an icon for generations to come. Al Pacino in this film is absolutely superb and he only made it better in Part II. Many people put The Godfather as the number 1 movie of all time and I can't argue with that because of all that it has to offer. I think that Citizen Kane is more of a landmark because of all the things that Orson Welles brought to cinema from that movie, but if that is number 1, than Coppola has no shame in being the best number 2 of all time. The amazing thing about the Godfather Saga is that I think the world of Part 1, but I think that Part 2 is better. Bravo Francis, you have made your mark on Film forever, no doubt."

","Wow! Ross And Ronnay in the Sunday papers will have their work cut out for them commenting on this film! It is the greatest film ever, just like Casablanca, Shawshank Redemption and Shindlers List, it has mastered its genre, except many people do not know of the film!!! Now days movies such as oceans 11, Layer cake and even police investigative stories try to have the original concept of them film, with the moral battling of crime. The beauty of the story is that it is original and none of the actors (in the first part) were well known, which gives them an better on-screen identity, compared to modern day Hollywood heroes such as brad Pitt, Collin pharrel and Tom Cruise. Even action packed scarface can take The Godfathers title as 'Best Crime/Gangster Film Ever' because that is exactly what godfather is. Its only downfall is the conclusion of the saga, in part number three which is kind off like The Matrix trilogy in a way, The First part had a cult following, number 2 was ""good but will never beat the first"" and the third one was awful! The Godfather = legendary film, which will live long in existence especially with the Italian population! The only deteriorating factor is its lenght not many people can watch a film for 2 hours and 10 minutes, but i could :). Also the plot is tricky to understand for first time viewers!"

"acorral-1","9","0","2","16 February 2005"," Familia taking care of business
","One of the best thing about this film is the terrific performance of Brando asDon Vito Corleone. He created a character capable for transmitting themost ambiguous emotions. For one side, we have the loving father (and godfather of course), husband, grand father, friend. In the other hand he is one of the coldest blooded characters in movie history. ""It's not personal, it's strictly business"" is the perfect phrase to define the way of the ""Familia"" taking care of business related activities. There are several sequences that have become classic scenes: at the beginning of the movie we see a merciful Vito sitting in his ""throne"" deciding the destiny of dishonored fathers, Hollywood actors, rude bodyguards. ""Remember that some day I will ask another favor in return"". Don Vito is respected as a priest, his hand is kissed and he takes care of the situations one way of another. Religion is, ironically, one of the main characters of the history. Four major scenes are related with catholic rites: Two weddings, a funeral and a baptize. Italian costumes are essential as well. The family concept, the traditions; big dinners with pasta, meat balls and red wine. Concepts as honor, loyalty, vengeance are reminded consistently along the three hours. In another classic scene we visualize the ""familia"" way to solve some pending issues: Johnny, the favorite Vito's godsons is one of the hottest Hollywood stars hoping to obtain the leading role in a movie. The producer does not want him on the film for personal reasons, but at the end he accepts once he discovers his favorite horse head the next morning in his bed. Robert Duvall is the adviser, Vito's right hand and in my opinion the second best performance. He is responsible of dealing with the other families. He hates violence but justify every decision to use it. He is the conscience and a critical member, no matter if he is not Sicilian. Other sequence (I think the best) is where the big families have a meeting to solve their differences. Don Vito did not want to be involved in the drug business, he wanted to remain with the usual ones: gambling, liquor and unions. His relation ships with influent people are important to the mob environment. He agrees to permit the drug dealing and offers protection just with one condition: at this time his son Sonny (performed by James Caan) was brutally killed. He accepts his dead as a part of the business and he is willing to make a truce to stop the blood spill. In one of the best scenes ever performed by Brando he stands up and says (not literally): ""I won't revenge my son's death. Mike, my other son is hiding somewhere in Italy and he will return shortly. I accept the conditions to bring peace, but if my son is murdered in any way, shoot accidentally by a cop, have a car accident or appears hanging in his cell I will blame someone in this room"" an then he signed his agreement with a huge with his enemy. A good movie with excellent cast selection, including a good performance of young Al Pacino and his incidental transformation from war hero to new family Don. Coppola created a myth with his trilogy. The second part was actually better than the first one and this is much to say. The baptize sequence at the end is just extraordinary. The initiation of the new Don receiving the holy water and holy blood. A new life, a new grandson, a new era. The end is just the beginning. The familia is not dead is just taking care of business as usual."
"joelsaxton","10","0","2","14 February 2005"," Still at the top of my list
","The Godfather was an epic novel, an excellent story, and the movie could have easily been botched on numerous levels; instead, Francis Ford Coppola managed to create an enduring masterpiece of modern cinema. This excellence he achieved in spite of the constant harassment and general incompetence of Paramount Pictures. Coppola was almost fired by the studio several times during the filming of this classic, yet he managed to persevere and realize his vision through to the end. The casting, direction, acting, cinematography, and story are all top notch. Add to it a beautiful score by Nino Rota and you have the #1 IMDb movie of all time. This is a movie I have watched many times and found few weaknesses.<br/><br/>If Paramount had its way, The Godfather would have been much different. In this alternate reality, Coppola would have been fired and replaced with some studio sycophant director. There would be no Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, since Paramount felt Brando was a troublemaker. Michael would have been played by Ryan O'Neal or Robert Redford since Paramount wanted a ""prettier"" leading man. Al Pacino, despite superior acting ability, would have probably remained undiscovered. The story would not have taken place in the 40's and 50's, but instead would have been contemporary in order to minimize production costs. To be sure, the ultimate result of Paramount's expediency would have been unmitigated disaster. Thankfully, Coppola fought Paramount throughout the entire production, and much like the Godfather himself, refused to dance on the strings of those Paramount pezzonovante."

","The Godfather is literally the most highly rated movie of all time. I liked this movie, adored it. And with all the respect that I have for this heavyweight striking flick, my sub- conscience tells me that there seems to be an overrating that simply has been unable to be tamed down for years. First of all, this is a great gangster movie with the most common characteristics of a mafia circuit. Superb acting is harshly evident with a small dose of surrealism. This is everything a true-life movie needs to have. But, still, I think that this is somehow one-dimensional and self-appreciative. It doesn't have a universal sense of mafia mob but remains within the confines of a single direction of storytelling. It concentrates on the Italian mob, a single family and no further. It depicts, marvelously, the structure of that-time mafia entourage and the set of rules it was based upon. However, I think there have been several other movies which, if not as subtly as The Godfather, precisely have managed go beyond the classic understanding of mafia and grasped a wider span of this topic. Anyway, The Godfather, though overrated, still remains self-contained and deserves to be one of the best but with all this time having passed by, not the best one. 10/10"

It has romance, drama, action, and a little comedy. Every scene is memorable in some small way. <br/><br/>Amerigo Bonasera and Johnny Fontane both come to the Don with problems that they have. The Don tells both of these men that he will help them out Luca Brasi also gives his thanks to the Don for inviting him to the wedding and he hopes that Connie's first child will be a masculine one. Michael and Kay arrive shortly after the wedding of Carlo Rizzi and Connie Corleone begins. Michael explains to Kay that he doesn't want to be in part with his family business. He also tells her the story of how Johnny Fontane got into a big band but, wanted out of the contract. He couldn't get out so the Don and Luca Brasi went over to the band leader and said that either his brains or his signature would be on the check. After the wedding scene Tom Hagen heads over to Hollywood to talk to the big shot producer, Jack Woltz, about Johnny Fontane being in the new war film. Jack Woltz goes on to explain that he cannot let Johnny be in it because he would be perfect for the part and he made Jack look like a fool. Tom Hagen flies back to New York and then the next night we see the famous horse head in the bed of Jack Woltz. With that Johnny Fontante gets the part for the film. Next Virgi Solozzo comes to the Don saying that he has a proposition; he would need funding and then he would smuggle in drugs. They would then split the money from the profits. The Don explains that the narcotics business is a risky on and he doesn't want to be a part of it. Solozzo doesn't like this and has the Don shot while he exits his office one day. The Don doesn't die but gets seriously injured. Michael and the rest of the family meet up at the house and try to find out who the person inside their family betrayed them. They finally come to the conclusion that Tessio had betrayed them and kill him. Meanwhile Michael heads in to the city to eat dinner with Kay, he then leaves and heads over to the hospital to meet his father. With no one their except for the nurse and the Don, Michael quickly rushes him to another room and stands guard outside of the hospital. Solozzo's men come by in a car but soon realize that someones guarding Vito Corleone so they drive off. Captain Mckulskey doesn't like this so he comes over and slaps Michael on the face. The Corleone family quickly sends over bodyguards to help protect the Don. Later the Corleone family finds out that Luca Brasi has been killed. He was going on a special errand for the Don. He heads over to Solozzo and Tattalgia saying that he is displeased with the Corleone family and wants to go into a new job. The men are not convinced and kill him. Santino, Peter Clemenza, Tom Hagen, and Michael Corleone all figure out how to make the most of the meeting that Solozzo has just called with Michael. They decide that the best choice would be to have Michael gun down Solozzo and Mckluskey. The Corleone's get the location of the restaurant that Michael and Solozzo will meet and plant a gun in one of the bathroom stalls. When they arrive Michael is searched, he then asks permission to goto the bathroom, comes back out with the gun and kills Mckluskey and Solozzo. He then exits and drives away. The newspapers soon flood with headlines of the killing of a Police Captain. Michael has to be deported to Sicily because it's to dangerous for him in America. He meets a woman named Apollonia and marries her. Later one of his bodyguards, Fabrizzio, kills his wife. Michael becomes infuriated but cannot do anything about it. After he is patched back up he gets sent back to America because its safe again for him. Meanwhile in the time Michael stayed at Sicily, the Don had returned home, and Carlo was beating up Connie. Sonny gets really mad and rushes over to try and help Connie. While going to her house, he gets shot by what it seems like hundreds of bullets. The Don is in pain and soon calls a meeting with all of the major families in the United States to call peace between them. When Michael returns home he talks to Kay and they get married. Soon Michael becomes the new Don of the family and heads over to Las Vegas to check out on Freddie, his brother. He also talks to Moe Greene and says that he wants to buy out the casino. After Moe Greene refuses to sell, Michael heads back to New York. We then see a very sad scene where the Don is playing with Michael's child and suddenly gets a heart attack in the garden and dies. The funeral for the Don had a big turnout with many members of other families coming to pay their respects. After that Carlo Rizzi, and Connie Corleone ask Michael if he can become the Godfather of there newborn child. Michael accepts the offer. The next scene is probably the most beautiful in cinematic history. Michael Corleone is having Connie, and Carlo's child baptized while he is also having his capo-regimes, and bodyguards executing the members of other families that have become a threat to him. The movie finally ends with Michael killing Connie's husband, Carlo Rizzi."

The only thing that no-one could ever pinch from The Godfather, and make it look better, is waking up to find the bloody-head of a horse, sleeping with you in your bed.<br/><br/>The philosophy plays a big part of the film and provides its unique blend of characters with great depth. We also see a great zoom-in shot when Michael (Pacino) devises a plan to assassinate a mafia boss, that killed his father (Brando) and the dishonorable who Michael seeks revenge for receiving a black eye from him. Here we see the good, young Michael take his very first step into the world of terror, that follows him for the rest of trilogy.

After hearing this, from Long Beach, California, Michael rushes back home to his father. After hearing about the ones who almost killed the Don, he plots revenge with Sonny and close associates. But a twist of fate happens to the family, and in the end, the once-reluctant Michael is made Don over the Corleones.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola beautifully shows a portrait of what seemed to be a harmless family into such malice. The story was adapted from the number one hit by Mario Puzo, who also collaborated with Coppola in this project. The cinematography is excellent, the screenplay gripping and intelligent, and the haunting but enchanting score is memorable. Marlon Brando is absolutely divine as the ruthless, merciful Don Corleone, which earned him the Oscar for Best Actor. New-comer Al Pacino is extremely excellent as Michael, showing both the innocence and fierceness of the son, and his performance received many praises. James Caan is great as scary Sonny, and Robert Duvall could not be a better Tom.<br/><br/>Some notable scenes are the monologue, the Baptism, and the ever-famous horse-head-in-the-bed scene. This demonstrates how scary and malicious the Mob can be. With twists and turns, it shows that even the Mob can lead everyday lives, but one could have a particularly hard time dealing with carrying out a deadly job twenty-four seven.<br/><br/>I personally love this movie, because of the intrigue I felt as I read some of the novel. I definitely recommend this film to people, but I hope that you would not show this to young children. Some things could scar them for life, much like myself...If you like this movie, I also recommend you watch the other two films with the trilogy. In my opinion, this is the greatest trilogy ever made."

Here you see what happens when his ego doesn't get in the way, and when that happens you can see his technical genius.<br/><br/>Brando gives the best performance, and one of the great performances of all time by any actor in film.

","The Godfather is the pinnacle of American Mafia in Hollywood cinematics. Besides the more than obvious storyboard of this trilogy, the godfather is filled with references to the roots of the Mafia as a criminal organisation. The opening scene of the trilogy is a beautiful display of limbo lighting and chiaroscuro effect where our attention is focused on Bounasera and Don Vito Corleone. Through the opening conversations we begin to understand the mafia's role in society; to intervene and arrange the clockwork of society when the governmental institutions have failed. We see that the underworld is a male- orientated place. There is an obvious division between work and family which is echoed through the partition between the dark and gloomy office and the bright colourful and chaotic festivities outside. Strangely enough aesthetic perfection is present in the darker realm of Don Vito's office. This hints at the suggestion that the Mafia is merely the evolution of human necessity to arrange what the judicial services can't. Throughout the films we see the Mafia is a family centric 'Business' which revolves around the paterfamilias, i.e. the head of the family. Whatever he sees just and right, all his family follow his wishes, even if they don't agree. If they don't they are aware they will suffer the consequences. The family structure is also present from the Don ,il capo to the consiglieri and further down to the henchmen. There is also a clear picture of inter winding network between the families. In the end it is obvious that when the family tries to legitimize itself it finds great difficult since the Mafia is a cycle; you enter by blood and you part by blood. The Mafia will always be present in American and Italian Society, the only question is how much shall there presence be felt?"

This is James Caan's best film and is the only film that got him an academy award nomination. Other people that became noticeable are Robert Duvall and John Cazale. For sure it is a 10.

I just watched this movie again and the scenes of Micheal whacking the crooked cop and the other mobster family head and the scene where the director wakes up to find his favorite horse's head and blood all over and beneath his feet still shocks and stuns me... this movie portrayed the drama of it all elegantly and I love every minute of it. Although 2 things are odd... In the beginning when the first Godfather is being begged for help I was surprised that the beggar wasn't killed off then for being so disrespectful to Don Corneioli (I hope that's how it's spelled). I mean this guy is an infamous, murderous mobster who's career started out practically with a murder (As seen in the future Godfather movie) but he'd let someone who left him disrespected alive seems so uncharacteristic of the man. And also the length of the first wedding in the movie, the very first few scenes of this film, well... was horrible, I'll not lie. At the risk of being stoned by those in love with this movie I have to say that they had achieved the desired effect after the first or second deal the Godfather made, not entirely sure which it was since the movie lasted so long but I'm pretty sure not past 2. The rest of it was very nice and all and showed how he did business (bloody and death-ridden beneath a velvety, beautiful cover) but was it really necessary to do so much of it?

","Well, I just wanted to remark on the Sicily scenes. They were superb! Coppola could not have painted a better portrait of the community life in Sicily on those days. I feel I can tell better because I live in Malta, a small island just beneath Sicily which till the late 1970s still had a lifestyle almost identical to that of the Sicilians. The attire, the environment (the fields, the terraced walls, the type of plants), the surroundings, the wine bars, the facial characteristics of the people were very much similar to those of the Maltese people and in some places it is still very similar to that. And this culminates in the wedding celebrations. <br/><br/>Finally, this led me to grasp the difference between the convolution of American lifestyle and the simplicity of the Sicilian lifestyle, even though there were some perceptible parallels."

One of the first, and still the best.<br/><br/>It started off as a novel written by Mario Puzo, until Francis Ford Coppola came in and expressed his interests of turning it into a film. He took it to Paramount Pictures, and they originally slated it to be a modernized version. They figured it would be much cheaper to make it in the present day (1971) and would hit audiences harder. However, Coppola, along with Puzo, fought them day on end for the rights to leave it as it was. Eventually, they gave in, but gave Coppola even more troubles when they disagreed on practically half of Coppola's cast. Paramount eventually gave into Coppola again, and let him make the film. <br/><br/>This film is magnificent in so many ways. Performances by Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, John Cazale, James Caan, and Marlon Brando make the film shine, and also make it some of the best acting ever caught on film.

","There are few films that can make the claim of being regarded as the best film ever made. ""Citizen Kane"" could. ""Casablanca"" could. But here on IMDb, ""The Godfather"" reigns supreme, and with good reason.<br/><br/>Do not make the mistake of thinking that The Godfather is a mobster movie, focusing on action, violence, and Tommy guns. Think of the title, and what it implies. The movie could have been titled ""The Mafia"", ""The Don"", or a dozen other things, but instead, they chose a familial word for this film. Thus, it must be the family, and specifically, the role of Godfather, that must be the film's subject.<br/><br/>There are three Godfathers that this movie examines: Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), Sonny Corleone (James Caan), and Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). All three have their defining traits; Vito his traditional views, Sonny his furious temper, and Michael his reluctance to enter into the family business. Through the leadership of each, the movie follows the story of the Corleone family as they cope with joy and sadness, and life and death.<br/><br/>One of the most enduring aspects of The Godfather is its score. Probably behind only the works of John Williams (Jaws, Star Wars, Indiana Jones) in its recognizability, the familiar theme form The Godfather has become the theme for the mafia and every stereotyped Italian mobster group the world over. Likewise, infamous scenes such as that involving the surprise left for the stubborn director have ingrained themselves into the realm of organized crime forever.<br/><br/>The story that The Godfather tells is superb. As power transfers from one leader to the next, we hope for the best for people that are ultimately criminals. How was director Francis Ford Coppola able to humanize figures that would typically be stereotyped? By infusing them with life and background, and showing to the audience that even the hardest mafia hitman has a softer side.<br/><br/>The Godfather has accomplished a feat few films have: winning enough critical and audience acclaim to cement itself in cinema history forever. As long as people desire to experience human drama on an intimate level, The Godfather will ""make them an offer they can't refuse""."

It's crazy to think about really, for instance, this reviewer can't remember the last time she felt sympathy for a murdererÂ…  The Godfather is amazing, it's well written, and the cast just meshes well on screen.  The names can be confusing because they are all Italian and people address each other by their last name most of the time, but after a while it starts to make a little sense. 	The lead character of the movie is, surprisingly, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  This story follows his coming of age from a young man wishing to get as far away from the business to his deep involvement after some family catastrophes.  Upon first introduction Michael is dressed in his service uniform and bringing a new love, Kay (Diane Keaton), to the wedding of his sister.  When Kay asks about his family, and his father in particular, Michael explains to her that his father is a mafia leader and he wants nothing at all to be like him.  So far, he had been doing very well at trying to keep himself separated, until one day when his father gets shot in the back several times and is put into the hospital.  Well, of course, the henchmen aren't going to be satisfied with just putting him in the hospital, they want to finish the job.  Luckily, Michael goes to visit his father and upon arrival realizes that there is no one there keeping guard over his father.  He calls his brother to get backup and places his father in a different room in the hospital.  The suspense in this scene is SO heavy it's almost suffocating, in a good way.  There are distant footsteps heard coming toward Michael's father and this reviewer felt her hands clench and her heart beat racing; it was so well done.  But this is the point when Michael really starts to enter the mafia; and he only gets deeper and deeper into it as the movie plays out. 	There is, however, one death scene that is a bit too played out.  A character is in a car and suddenly there are a gazillion guys around the car and they all have rapid firing guns.  Well, the character is shot while in the car and proceeds to crawl across the seat and exit out the passenger side of the car.  At which point, the character puts themselves in full exposure to the henchmen.  Why?  No clue, but then another 70 or 80 shots are successfully taken AND THEN one of the henchmen proceeds to take a few shots at close range and throw in a few kicks.  This is a bit excessive upon reflection but at the time, this reviewer almost cried.  It was SO unfair! If it wasn't for the fact that it is completely impossible, jumping into the screen to save the victim was all this reviewer could think of.  Once again, it's amazing because the victim wasn't exactly an angel to say the least. <br/><br/>	The story is truly what manipulates the audience to feel sympathy for this family.  They seem to be falling apart left and right, which is tough to see because they used to be such a strong unit.  The values of family love seem to be falling apart with each new marriage, the men are trying to stay ahead in the game but they keep getting attacked from behind because there are traitors amongst the alliances.  Personally, this reviewer can't wait to see the two following films in this trilogy and compare them to the first, because topping this one will be extremely difficult. 	If your looking for an awesome drama, watch The Godfather, it's got a little bit of everything in the story for everyone.  It's a great movie to watch on an icky day when you're stuck at home, because it will make time fly so fast."

","The Godfather is absolutely the best movie of all times. It is a true classic that will always be a great film for every generation. This movie will still be great in 50 years. The Godfather is about the Italian mafia and all the work they do. The Godfather (Don Vito Corleone) is the leader of the mob. Most of his sons are in the family business except for his son Michael, played by Al Pacino. He gets involved later. The acting was truly amazing in this film. Marlon Brando did great playing the Godfather and doing that famous voice that you will recognize watching the film even if you have not seen it before. Al Pacino did an incredible job portraying his character. Every actor was perfect in this film. Each actor brought something to the film and they were all needed to make this movie such a great movie. The screenplay was remarkable. The storyline never got boring. It is also very ingenious, because you can watch this film 10 times and still find something new that happened in the plot. Things will make even more sense when watching the film again. There is so much depth to this story.<br/><br/>The music in the film was also great. It added the frosting to the cake. The music really illustrated the mood of the film, especially in all of the suspenseful scenes. The music made you think of a great close Italian family but with a bad side to them, which is what the film is about. There was not one flaw in this film. The screenplay, acting, directing were all perfect. What makes a great film is when the viewer is still thinking about the film after watching it. It has such a great ending that the viewer actually wants to see the sequel to it. This film makes it happen. The Godfather is 10/10 stars and is a must see movie if you want to see a truly great film."

There are so many spoofs and other movies that adapt or down right steal a scene or a quote from the Godfather. Watching this movie helps to explain a lot about so many others. The plot was intriguing, every event through the plot into a new turn. Like just when a person would think Vito has died and then he recovers against all odds. This movie is just like that. And Mike goes and guns down the cop and then flees to Italy. Nobody that hadn't seen the movie before would expect Mike to go and get married. Then at the most unlikely moment Sonny dies as he is going to help his sister and is gunned down at the causeway. And at the beginning when they chop off that horse's head as part of that `deal he can't refuse'.<br/><br/>
	Mike had not really get involved in his father's work up until that night after Vito had been gunned down. When he and the baker stood out front of the hospital to protect his father from being `finished off'. After that it was almost all down hill from there. He then killed the police chief and that mobster. After Sonny was killed and Vito recovered mike became the decision-maker in the family. Until Vito finally died, at that point (at the end of the movie) he became the head of the family. <br/><br/>	In a way the movie revolved around him and things that effected him, Events that pointed him in a certain direction.

","The Godfather, an electrifyingly well made film. Starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, just naming the heavy hitting stars. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a mafia family living in New York. The Don's main source of income is gambling and protection. Another head of another mafia family (Sollozzo) wants to sell drugs to gain profit, Don Vito hates the idea of selling drugs on the market, so an attempt to take his life is made. One special son of the Godfather is brought to light when this event happens. In the film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the films gives the viewer a feeling of sympathy for a mob family, when in reality, a person does not usually take the side of a mob family, doing things against the law to make profit. A couple of the ways this happens is the fact that it's felt that Don Corleone is trying to do the `right' and `honest' way to make his profit by not selling drugs. Also, by the death and injury of many family members, the film brings a feeling of understanding, sympathy, and compassion towards the Corleone's. The film includes numerous scenes of murder, often in an offensive amount. Some scene feature hideous lights jobs, to the point of not seeing the character's faces, or telling what is happening. Although very monotonous, the music and soundtrack the movie was well done, and really changed the feel of individual scenes. There was an excellent job of doing crescendos and making diminuendos of certain scene to build suspense, or foreshadowing an event. Overall, the acting was superb, great casting, very well conceived and structured plot. I give The Godfather 8.5 out of ten."

","`The Godfather' is quite possibly one of the best movies made in history. This film has been quoted/mimicked time and time again, even in a Rugrats (the famous children's cartoon) episode. Why would this movie be quoted so much if it wasn't so amazing?  It wouldn't be. All the hype made about this movie really isn't understood until you actually watch the film.  It's a classic that can't be described.<br/><br/>I suppose it's illustriousness could be arguable either way, but most viewers find this movie riveting and engaging.  One could understand how someone could find this movie dry, especially in the beginning.  If you're not familiar with the plot at all, many things could be missed the first time around.  It starts out at his daughters wedding, and from there, all the events can easily run together and cause a vast amount of confusion within the viewer.  If you stick to it, promises are that the movie does get betterimmensely. <br/><br/>There isn't one single thing that makes this movie so remarkable.  It could be that it had a spectacular cast, intriguing plot, and very realistic situations.  Or, it could be that this movie has what any great story has, a huge change in the main character.  Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is by far one of the most interesting characters through the movie.  You watch every step of his moves, thoughts, actions and you see him evolve into the person his father tried so hard to keep him away from.   The actual scene where he makes his huge jump could be argued, but it is often believed that this change took place at the hospital.  This was his first opportunity to take charge of the `family business.'<br/><br/>Many details, sentences, phrases could go into this review to describe the movie. But, words could never really fill all of the emotions that you experience during this film.  Out of all the classic films I've seen, this is by far the most captivating I've experienced. This film isn't recommended for smaller children, one because they wouldn't be able to comprehend as well as early adults would, and two, because there are some things that may be found offensive to a younger crowd. All in all, this movie receives a 10/10 stars for pure genius."

","The Godfather<br/><br/>	Smart.  That's how I describe `The Godfather'.  Every aspect of this film is dripping with intellect.  The directing, the writing, the cinematography, and the acting.  And all the elements of the film are woven tightly together to make a very entertaining package. 	The intricate plot follows the development of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) and the enthralling drama that pursues his `family'.  The script does the impossible task of capturing the complex politics of organized crime, and makes it interesting to boot.  The plot leads the audience along its windy path where it comes across many peaks until it finally builds to the fantastic finale. 	To achieve this famous finish, the director employs the use of some pretty clever technical tricks.  To achieve suspense, he cleverly places the camera at angles that leads the audience one way, until he surprises them with the real result later on.  He also infuses the sound of the church organ music and the crying baby, and then gradually increases the decibels subtly and effectively.  That technique pulled the viewers in and made their knuckles white during the climax of the film.  The director was skillful in his mastery of all the film's techniques and in getting what he needed from the actors. 	This strong cast of cast of actors included Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Conn.  Each actor portrayed their characters profoundly.  Marlon Brando executed method acting techniques in a way that only a veteran like Marlon could.  Al Pacino clearly shows his character (Michael Corleone) grow and change.  His acting is subtle, confident and quiet until it explodes in an awesome rage. 	Michael Corleone is much like the entire movie.  `The Godfather' is subtle and complex, and it builds to the memorable finish.  `The Godfather' stimulates the mind and starts the blood and adrenaline pumping in anyone who watches it.  That is why I recommend this beautiful masterpiece to anyone and everyone with a thirst for quality film."

","What makes for a good movie?  What elements do audiences look for in order to leave the theater sighing `that movie was great?'  To some, it's whether a character goes through a transformation, whether you can literally see a character evolve from one form to the next.  The Godfather is one such movie.  True, on the exterior what you see is a mafia family caught up in the new business of drug dealing and how they deal with a near fatal hit to `The Godfather' himself.   But if you take a second look, what you really see is the struggle between good and evil that one son must face upon the his return to the family home. 	When the movie opens, the audience is introduced to the character of Michael Corleone as played by the great Al Pacino.  Michael is what one would call a `golden child,' everyone in the family had high hopes for him.  They wanted him to become something great, and not get caught up in the family `business.'  In the beginning, he was something great, he was a war hero, returning home for a wedding.  Things take a toll for the worst when Michael's father, Don Vito played by Marlon Brando, is critically wounded during a mob hit.  At this point, the viewer starts to see a change in Pacino's character.  Putting family before all else, Michael gets sucked in to the `business,' seeking vengeance for his father. 	 Throughout the movie, Pacino's character transforms.  He makes the change from a flat character to a round in a very believably way thanks to the direction of Francis Ford Coppola and writer Mario Puzo.  The elements in the story of The Godfather support Pacino's change so that it's not out of the blue.  In that way, the audience can relate to the story better and even start to feel sorry for the mafia clan known as the Corleones, maybe even start to root for the bad guy, in hopes that the family can come out on top. The Godfather is a great movie, a must see, definitely an 11 on the 10 point scale."

","`The Godfather' is a spectacular movie, for the older crowd.  Between a quotable script, great theme music, and a fabulous main character, this film will keep the viewer wondering.  <br/><br/>While watching `The Godfather', the viewer may recognize many lines.  Some of examples of those could be, ` I'll give em an offer he can't refuse,' or `Take it to the mattresses.'  Simply the fact that lines from the movie are well known, proves that this movie is worthy of watching.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, the same music is played over and over, but in different styles.  For example, if someone is about to get shot, the music speeds up, and almost gets scary.  When a happy time comes, the music gets softer, and more legato.<br/><br/>Finally, one of the best things about this movie is the main character.  Al Pacino plays Michael, the child of the original Godfather.  After his father gets shot in a mob hit, Michael, takes over the family business, and completely changes who from the person he used to be.  Al Pacino is very believable in this role.<br/><br/>Overall, this reviewer gives this movie a 9 out of 10.

"slugbelle","10","0","2","21 May 2004"," Viewing is definitely recommended.
","Classics can be seen as old, intimidating, mostly black and white movies... The Godfather doesn't even glimpse at those characteristics, in contrast, it not only enthralls the audience, but also inspires other films relating to its topic.  The 1940s revolved around a tone that was dark, and uninviting to sympathy, while The Godfather actually triggers extreme emotion towards the, otherwise seen as, ""bad guys.""  <br/><br/>Characters that are seriously stereotyped take a new spin and actually make the viewer feel involved in the events of the movie.  Michael, an army man in search of pure separation from his family and the family business, is in love with Kay, a young girl full of life and enthusiasm for Michael.  While his older brother struggles to keep the family name intact.<br/><br/>The characters themselves shine in the light of a great story, full of excitement and suspense.  Talks of war between families and the spread of drugs and gambling keep the viewer interested throughout the long film.  The viewer is hopelessly involved with the family, having had no interaction with any real people or in conversations.<br/><br/>The Godfather is timeless with awesome actors and angles, the subject matter is rather heavy and it should be seen by parents before viewing by children. It is definitely a ten on a scale where that rates the highest."
"JPTaylor","10","0","2","21 May 2004"," A precise and flowing work
","Mario Puzo's The Godfather is a landmark of cinema.  The three-hour film is the result of an incredibly precise brand of filmmaking.  Despite the fact that the story spans a number of years and thousands of miles, there is a clear, very natural progression throughout the film (with the exception of a subplot or two).  The characters are complex and varied, each playing a specific role that contributes to the story.  The film does admirably well in keeping the story relatively coherent, despite its complexity.<br/><br/>In the film, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a powerful crime family in New York.  He arranges killings and is involved in illegal gambling rings, among other things.  Yet to those who love him, he is known as a man of reason and justice.  He is the Godfather - a title of respect and endearment.  Many seek him out for his blessing, his advice  or a favor.  Despite the fact that he is, essentially, a murderer, the movie does an excellent job of making the audience respect him; the deaths he arranges are always justified in some manner to the audience.  They men killed are either other criminals - usually involved in narcotics and other crimes somewhat worse than the Corleones' - or are corrupt in some way, a danger to ""the family"" and probably murderers themselves.<br/><br/>Vito's family has a hierarchical power structure.  At the top is the first-born, Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone (James Caan), hot-headed and vengeful, with a lust for power - he is inverse of the collected and methodical Vito. Then there is Fredo (John Cazale), the ambitious but ultimately incompetent son who is more interested in women and booze than the family business. Finally there is Michael (Al Pacino) - the youngest son who is clearly the central character throughout the film.<br/><br/>Michael is a young World War II veteran who wants no part in his father's business.  His signature line is ""That's my family, Kay it's not me.""  He respects his father more than any other man, but he wants to live a different line.  He is a dynamic, fully-realized character that is absolutely convincing.  He is also a very different character at the end of the film - but in a way that is completely consistent with his personality.<br/><br/>The film has an excellent pace.  There is an ebb and flow - the film begins rather slowly, then picks up the pace, and rises to the climax of the first act - and then the pace slows once more, only to build up suspense again to a final climax, in which all loose ends are neatly tied.  Never is the audience bored - the story keeps a tight grip on the viewer, ensuring that they wonder as to the fates of the characters even in the slowest parts - a remarkable accomplishment in of itself.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a excellent film in every sense of the word - technically, aesthetically, in terms of story and characters, themes and music. It immerses the audience in a completely different - yet perhaps altogether to familiar - world.  It is a classic that is - and will be - rooted in film history."

","The Godfather, which hit movie theatres and wowed audiences over 30 years ago, is still arguably one of the best movies ever made.  Only the best writers, directors and actors could make a story about the mafia, who in the beginning seem to be cold, ruthless killers, and turn it into a group of people winning over the sympathy of nearly everyone in the audience.  This film wouldn't have been as believable or worth watching if it weren't for the great cast.  Their acting drew people into the movie.  Marlon Brando, who played Don Vito Corleone, was introduced to the audience as the Godfather', the leader of the organized crime family.  I loved how he was portrayed as an intimidating leader, but had a softer side for his grandchildren and his son, Michael, who he had a close relationship with. Throughout the movie, negotiations are made, bold-faced lies are told, families are torn apart, and several people are killed.  At the beginning of the movie, the viewer feels sympathy for Michael Corleone because he seems confused and not sure if he wants to join the business.  He makes up his mind to be apart of the business that will soon consume his life and because of that he changes as a person and the viewer no longer seems to identify with Michael and they feel a little bitter towards him.  He looses respect from the audience.  The camera angles added more attitude to the movie, giving it more symbolism. Sometimes the viewer is frustrated with the actors, knowing that if they had just made a different choice, things would have turned out the way the viewer wanted them to.  That's another thing that caught my attention during this film; I found myself upset with the characters and disappointed in them as if they were actual people.  I think that is a great quality in a movie.   I really liked how the viewer's feelings for Michael changed in the end.  It's a nice surprise when movies throw something like that in to spice things up and make the audience hope for a sequel."

It's such a classic that it is still a strong contender in the `Best Movie Ever' debate. 	 	No other movie has told such an involved story of the mafia. Only could a director like Francis Ford Coppola and writer Mario Puzo, create such an atmosphere of believability. By the end of this epic film, the audience has a newfound respect for some notorious mobsters and unexpected sympathy becomes apparent. Never has such a movie before or since told the story of important values among common criminals so well as here. 	 	Only with fantastic actors could you pull off such a reversal of feelings toward the mafia. Marlon Brando does a fantastic job as the lovable patriarch, whose swollen growl makes him feel like the `Mafia Santa Clause'. The always-good Al Pacino creates a deep character full of turmoil and ultimate greed. His role of Michael, `the heir to the thrown', goes through an extreme transformation of personality and values. Such superb actors like these, and others such as Robert Duvall and James Caan, create an environment full of complex and intriguing characters. 	 	The technical execution of this film is stunning. From the first frame to the end credits, this movie is film production at its finest. Unique and smooth camera movements pair nicely with the story; the score is the quintessential piece to such a gripping plot; and I have never seen a more entertaining murder than in this movie. 	 	A flawless piece of cinema throughout. Great writing, directing and acting make it a classic for the ages. Never have I felt more connected to such ruthless and villainous individuals than in this film. The `climax' of The Godfather sums up all the feelings in the movie: countless murders over the sounds of a child's Catholic Baptism. Outstanding. <br/><br/>

In this grand flow of a film there are two main characters `The Godfather' Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).

","There's a bond that family members have between one another. It's something unexplainable. In most cases, they are there for you whenever you need them most. Maybe it's a loan you need help paying off. Maybe there is a boy at school that has been giving you a hard time, your big brother will be there right be your side. The movie ""The Godfather"" shows this bond between family members, but the movie shows it at it's most extreme. 	The definition of a Godfather is ""a man that sponsors a person at baptism"". Another definition is ""to take under one's fostering care"". The slang term for ""Godfather"" is of course, ""the leader of and organized crime family"". It's amazing how this movie incorporates all three of those definitions.<br/><br/>	In the very beginning of the film, the viewers are introduced to Don Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando. In the opening scenes, Vito Corleone is meeting with a man that tells him about how his daughter was beaten by some male ""friends"" of hers. This man asks for justice. He obviously wants revenge for what they did to his daughter. Vito grants him this request, it being his daughters wedding day, he cannot refuse any request. These people keep coming into his office,Wanting something from The Godfather, it being protection, revenge, fame or just giving their thanks to him and pledging their loyalty. They go to him because he can provide those things, and he can provide much more than the police could. The family had so much power. They had lawyers, journalists and all sorts of helpful people working on their side. People wanted to be a part of this family, but there was a very dangerous side to it all. 	The acting in this film has to be the absolute best part. The casting could not have been done any better. Marlon Brando is the perfect Godfather. There is no other actor that could have pulled it off so well. Using the dental appliance to give him the bulldog look was genius. Brando was intimidating (as a mobster should be) but he somehow had a soft side that allows the audience to fall in love with the character, whether they think what he is doing is right or wrong. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is also a perfect fit. Is has an innocence about him yet at the same time he makes a seamless transition into a full blown criminal. 	The dialog in this film is smooth and very believable. The story is intriguing and intricate, it is also very difficult to follow.The continuity in this film is also impeccable. The music in the movie seems repetitive. The same song is played all of the time, just different variations of it.<br/><br/>	I must say, the first time watching this film, it didn't impress me whatsoever. I thought it was overrated and I didn't understand what the big deal was. Then I decided to give it another chance and rent it. I'm not sure what was different about the second time watching it, but it totally changed my mind about it. So, if you are one of those people who think it is overrated, just give it another shot, you won't regret it. This movie is brilliant and is rightfully called one of the best."
"Blondeatheart56","9","0","2","20 May 2004"," A superb, yet confusing movie
","""The Godfather"" is an extremely well known movie and one that<br/><br/>this reviewer just recently saw for the first time.  There is a lot of<br/><br/>talk about it being the best movie ever made but honestly, there<br/><br/>are other movies that could be better.  The cast was made up of<br/><br/>some pretty famous actors and they all did marvelous acting jobs. <br/><br/>The movie definitely wasn't lacking in that area.  It was a big<br/><br/>attention getter in the way that there could be a scene where the<br/><br/>actors would be talking and talking, which isn't too exciting, and<br/><br/>then soon after it would be like ""BAM!"" and there was action.  It<br/><br/>would certainly wake up anyone in the audience who might have<br/><br/>been dozing off.  All in all, the movie didn't have too much talk, or<br/><br/>too much action, it was just the right amount of both. <br/><br/>It did have a superflous amount of special effects though, most<br/><br/>being gun shots and explosions.  Considering the fact that the<br/><br/>movie is about the life of a crime family, the enormous amount of<br/><br/>killing that there is throughout the film isn't too suprising.  Maybe a<br/><br/>little disturbing, but not suprisng.  This reviewer has never seen a<br/><br/>movie with as much killing as ""The Godfather.""  It was like<br/><br/>someone was killed from this family, so they killed the person who<br/><br/>did the killing.  Then that family killed the person who killed their<br/><br/>family member and it went on like that back and forth and back and<br/><br/>forth, if that even makes sense.  It was like an argument.  Person # <br/><br/>1 says something to person # 2, so person #2 says something<br/><br/>back to person #1 and so on and so on.  There was just an<br/><br/>excessive amount of killing.  In fact, all the killing is sort of the thing<br/><br/>that the viewer might remember the most about ""The Godfather."" This movie does something that a lot of movies dare not do.  It lets<br/><br/>some main characters die.  That is probably the most unpredictable aspect of the entire movie.  When people watch<br/><br/>movies they don't expect any main characters to die and they rarely<br/><br/>ever do.  The fact  that ""The Godfather"" does this, although it is<br/><br/>sad, is stupendous. The plot of  the movie revolves around the crime family, Corleone. <br/><br/>It basically follows their lives during a certain period of time.  What<br/><br/>that period of time is, this reviewer does not exactly know.  In most<br/><br/>movies, when there has been a big time difference they say at the<br/><br/>bottom of the screen, ""one year later"" or something like that.  ""The<br/><br/>Godfather"" does not do that.  Instead of putting the time change<br/><br/>into words at the bottom of the screen it's put into words that the<br/><br/>actors say.  It makes it so the audience has to listen very closely to<br/><br/>the movie to hear how long its been since something happened. <br/><br/>This reveiwer thinks that this is done because when words are put<br/><br/>at the bottom of the screen, like subtitles, it distracts the viewer's<br/><br/>attention away from the movie and what is going on.  In ""The<br/><br/>Godfather"" there is not this problem. The clothing worn in the movie wasn't anything like big, fancy<br/><br/>costumes, but there was something about them that was quite<br/><br/>interesting.  If the viewer was really paying attention to the actors'<br/><br/>outfits they would notice that the men are always wearing some<br/><br/>type of suit.  They're never caught walking around in casual wear,<br/><br/>just suits.  And the women are always wearing dresses.  They<br/><br/>don't wear pants with t-shirts, they wear dresses.  Tha'ts pretty<br/><br/>grand if you ask me. ""The Godfather"" was a very superb movie, but there are others that<br/><br/>are better.  It's worst feature is the enormous amount of killing.  It<br/><br/>is entertaining to watch, but it's not one that this reviewer would<br/><br/>want to watch over and over again."

"ericglunneborg","9","0","2","17 May 2004"," Who's the real godfather in this film?
","Well what is there to say about this movie?  Is it still the top movie on this site, or is it not?  Personally, it is not one of the reviewer's all time favorites, but it is still a very good movie.  One significant  detail of this movie, is counter culture.  The movie is filled with it.<br/><br/>As the movie starts Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), who is known as the Godfather, is in his office. It is his daughters wedding day, and according to  Sicilian tradition, he cannot refuse any requests that are made to him that day. The room is filled with people wanting something. The whole family is there for the occasion.  Michael (Al Pacino), the God father's youngest son , is back home from the war. He brings his new girl friend,   (Diane Keaton)  with him. Michael's brothers,  Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there too.<br/><br/>Family loyalty is an important message that is stressed in this movie. The Don, Vito Corleone heads the family . He is against dealing in drugs. According to him,  society is not alarmed by liquor, gambling or prostitution, but he feels it is wrong to deal drugs. He refers to it as a dirty business. What appears to be a moral decision on the Don's part is really counter culture because his decision not to support dealing in drugs has nothing to do with the legality of it but because he feels society would not accept it.  <br/><br/> A lot of emphasis is put on trusting a man's word, yet the central character do not always trust each other.  Woman are not highly regarded by the family. The Don's wife is only shown in a few scenes. Sonny ignores his wife. and the Don's daughter Connie's husband is not allowed into the family business. Instead, he given a job so he can earn a living.  The counter culture in this movie, represents the killings of innocent, and not so innocent people between families.  Throughout most of the movie, the Corleone family is in somewhat of a battle between another Italian family. Because of this, Don Corleone who is the Godfather of many, (Marlon Brando) is shot by one of the other families.  This heats up the subject for the Corleone family, because it puts two of his sons Michael (Al Pacino) and Santino `Sonny' (James Caan) in between a rock and a hard place.  That is just one of the examples of counter culture in this movie.  Here is another example.  Sunny finds out two different times that his sister's husband is beating her.  Outraged by all this happening, Sunny takes off to go find his brother in law.  The first time, he finds him, he is successful in beating the wind out of him, however the second time he gets gunned down by his in-laws.   Right about then, Don, is called to make a peace treaty with the other family, to stop all this violence between the families.  But are all the violent scenes in the movie over with? Unfortunately not. There are so many more examples of counter culture than the ones listed in this review. In order to see all the examples of counter culture, you would have to view the movie a couple times to understand what is going on in it.<br/><br/>Over all, it was a very good movie in my opinion.  I was Glued to the edge of my seat the whole time, just waiting to see what happens next.  The reviewer gives The Godfather a five gold star rating."
"Cwoods04","Null","0","2","17 May 2004"," the transitions
","The Director of the drama hit `The Godfather' Francis Ford Coppola, was unique at directing this film. There seem to be a lot of transitions in this film and mystery. He also was sneaky at who is the real main character.<br/><br/>	The movie is full of suspense and disbelief, The casting director was remarkable at finding the right people to play the part. When watching this movie ask you self one question, do you feel sorry for this family, that's full of hatefulness and war? I asked my self that question and yeah, I did because of the way Coppola took the movie apart and pieced it back together in a different way. The transitions are some-what noticeable and there are others when you might have to watch it again to see it. 	The one thing that could have been changed was when ever the Italian family or even when ever they were speaking in Italian it was hard to understand what was going on, but it also could have been used as a tactic to throw the viewer off. Another thing that could have been changed was the timing was difficult to comprehend, between 2 days or a year."

","The Godfather was a wonderfully done movie. This movie had comedy, romance, death, family. The movie begins with the lead Godfather, Don Vito Corleone and his daughters wedding. This means in ritual that anyone may come to the Godfather asking for a favor. Whether someone needs to be killed, or something needs to happen in order for that person to succeed. This movie revolves around Mafia people, such as the other leaders in the mafia besides Don Vito. Now after his daughters wedding day he is already processing these favors that people have asked of him. As the movie progresses Don Vito gets shot, but to the peoples dismay he survives. Though he is no longer a threat to the other Mafia Leaders. Then after a few other mishaps Don Vito's son Michael turns the tables as he begins the process of becoming the Godfather. Once this happens, Michael handles what he needs too and then the film ends. I know that the reason this movie ended this way was because there was eventually going to be a sequel. I personally enjoyed this movie, it sucks you in like a twister. It just has this part that keeps your curiosity button going. I know this, as I started this movie not wanting to watch and after the first hour I was hooked. Now I will most likely go out and rent the others to see if this extremely sensational classic can be out done. I know that if this movie did not have as much romance, death, or family values then it would of not been appealing to me. I recommend this movie, it in a way shows that the little man can become more then you ever thought."
"razwee","Null","0","2","10 May 2004"," Epic Journey into the History and Culture of the Mafia
","Spoiler Alert!! ""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.""<br/><br/>And with those words, Marlon Brando cemented his claim of film immortality. Many have imitated his cold, calculating stare, his borderline incoherent mumbling, and his movements which are, on the surface, awkward and elderly, but have an inexplicable gracefulness to them. But none will ever truly become Don Vito Corleone the way Brando did.<br/><br/>His mere physical presence depicts years of harsh dealings with unscrupulous types, and yet somehow, we see honor, loyalty, and a sense of family devotion that is to be praised, not lamented. Roger Ebert, in his analysis of The Godfather, eloquently explains that part of the film's resounding charm and success is that it ""tricks"" you into sympathizing with people who commit unspeakable acts.<br/><br/>Indeed, several have had their disagreements with the Godfather series because of its ""overly romantic"" portrayal of one of the most notorious groups in American history, the Sicilian Mafia. These people kill, cheat, lie, and scheme. And yet here lies the key as to why this film is one of the greatest ever made. Yes, many of the characters with whom we are supposed to identify are corrupt in many ways. But the further we are drawn into the microcosm of the Corleone family, the more we learn about these individuals that we initially shun as pure evil. The more we learn, the more human they seem, and we begin to see many signs of redeeming values.<br/><br/>Mixed in with the lies, the crime, the deceit is a rich cultural history, and even more immediately, an ongoing battle for a piece of the coveted American Dream. Amongst the violent background, there can be honor and virtue, and with so many gray areas, we wonder if these supposedly horrible people are really evil, or whether they might be unwitting byproducts of a ruthlessly violent tradition that does not allow them for any alternatives.<br/><br/>This particular point applies much more to Vito himself in The Godfather Part II. In this first installment, it is his son Michael (Al Pacino) that is the true tragic character of circumstance. Being the youngest of three male children, Michael begins the story as the only one with no ties to the nefarious dealings of the Corleone family. The eldest son, Sonny (James Caan), is a perpetual time bomb waiting to explode and does not have Michael's scruples. The middle son, Fredo (John Cazale) is much more passive, but not very intelligent.<br/><br/>It is for these reasons that Vito sees Michael as the key to legitimizing the family and washing away the blood of years past. We will come to recognize, however, one of the themes that echoes relentlessly throughout all three films: the sins of the past can never be fully purged.<br/><br/>Now knowing what happens in all three films, it is painful for me to watch the monumental opening wedding sequence of The Godfather and hear Pacino speak the words, ""That's my family, Kay, that's not me."" This comes, of course, following Michael's conversation with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) regarding one of his father's involvements with crime. We then see Michael insist that Kay join the family picture, despite her protests. This subtle shot suggests a symbolism that will become indicative of their relationship (one of the few subplots that extends through all three films).<br/><br/>The opening sequence, which lasts for almost a full half-hour, is the wedding of Vito's youngest child and only daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Yet this half-hour flies by effortlessly as it introduces all the major characters fluidly and economically. Everything we need to know is expressed, often without dialogue (a tribute to the fantastic performances). And there is still time to revel in the joys of a rich cultural tradition, expressed by the myriad festivities.<br/><br/>Shortly thereafter, however, the joy is replaced by dread, as we begin to learn of trouble brewing for the Corleone family. A powerful drug supplier named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) presents the heads of the ""five families"" (those with Mafia ties) with deals that will create huge profits. Only Vito refuses the deal, which also entails refusal to give aid to the other families through use of politicians, police, and members of the press that Vito has power over. His reasoning is that drugs is a ""dirty business"" that will destroy the families in the years to come. The public turns a blind eye towards duplicitous activities like gambling, liquor, and prostitution, but narcotics, he feels, is different.<br/><br/>This refusal stirs up the beginnings of bloodshed and engenders nothing short of a violent tribal feud that will claim several lives. At great risk, of course, is Vito himself, and Michael becomes torn between his desire for a normal, legitimate life with Kay and devotion and care for his father and family. Unfortunately, his father's immediate danger causes his concern for the family to win out, and we begin to watch the great tragedy of Michael turning from innocent outsider to ruthless manipulator, even more so than his father. This happens following his guarantee that he would never follow in his father's ways.<br/><br/>Along the way, we become witness to some of the most suspenseful and well-thought out scenes in cinematic history, not the least of which is the scene almost directly in the middle of the film. In this scene, which excruciatingly defies time and seems to extend indefinitely, Michael must choose whether or not he will commit the final act that will secure him as a participating member in the family's illegal ways.<br/><br/>It is the painful watershed, and again, knowing what happens down the road, I often find myself wanting to scream out, ""No, don't do it!"" To be compelled to do this towards a movie I have seen repeatedly means two things. First, yes I know, I am a freak. But what an achievement it is to have a film so well directed, shot, lit, and written that it stops being fiction and takes over you, despite repeated viewings.<br/><br/>In addition to these moments of suspense, The Godfather also has one of the most romantic sequences I have ever seen on film. This is, of course, Michael's encounter with the young Sicilian girl, Apollonia (Simonetta Stefanelli). The breathtaking cinematography of the Sicilian countryside and the exquisite melodies of Nino Rota's Sicilian Pastorale perfectly capture the ambience of Michael's capricious affair.<br/><br/>Needless to say, The Godfather is filled with memorable performances. Of the five nominees for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscar ceremony for the films of 1972, three of them belonged to The Godfather. These belonged to Al Pacino, James Caan (for his explosive performance as Sonny), and Robert Duvall (with a low-key, but highly effective performance as Michael's half-brother and consigliere to the family).<br/><br/>None of the three won, but Marlon Brando did win the Best Actor Oscar (and later declined to accept it as a gesture against the poor treatment of Native Americans by the industry at the time). There are also a number of memorable smaller roles, such as Lenny Montana as the oafish Luca Brasi; Abe Vigoda and Richard Castellano as Vito's assistants, Tessio and Clemenza; and Sterling Hayden as the corrupt police captain, McCluskey.<br/><br/>Despite a monumental directorial effort, Francis Ford Coppola did not receive the Best Director Oscar, but he did share the screenwriting Oscar with Mario Puzo for the adaptation of Puzo's novel. Special note should be given to cinematographer Gordon Willis for his phenomenal use of lighting. Few films I have seen make such heavy use of shadows and darkness (there are a number of medium and close shots in which we cannot see the subjects' eyes), and Willis's work here leaves an easily distinguishable impression.<br/><br/>Then, of course, there's the climax during the final 20 minutes of the film, which is nothing short of a masterwork of editing, cross-cutting, pacing, timing, and style. The music during this sequence is so perfectly chosen that it never gets old no matter how many times I watch it. The sequence drips with an irony of the highest magnitude. Some have cited it as their favorite moment in film history.<br/><br/>The Godfather truly is a film unlike any other. Some films make good epics, some good character studies, some good tragedies, some good action or suspense films, and some good historical dramas. It is hard make a single great film in any of these categories. The Godfather does it in all of them.<br/><br/>By the end of the film's 170-minute length, we have witnessed a complete 180-degree shift in several characters' lives. Yet still, only part of the story has been told. The harsh sense of tragedy, loss, and deceit that accompanies the end of this film is something that only expands and deepens with an even greater destructive resonance in The Godfather Part II."

","The Godfather is the classic mob movie. The film is totally different from all the others in its genre. The way Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo wrote this film so that the viewer actually sympathizes with the characters of the Italian mafia. Within the first scene the writers introduced all the main characters and all that's left to the film are twists, suspense, surprises and thrills.<br/><br/>The film also has many romantic scenes. Michael Corleone (Pacino) is in Sicily and walking through the open country when he and his two bodyguards stumble upon a beautiful young woman leading a school of children. Their eyes meet and it's love at first sight.  Michael being brought up with the utmost respect went to the girls father and asked to meet her in the presence of their family. The viewer can't help but think `How sweet.' Fortunately the father approves and love blossoms into marriage.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is like no other and with so many big stars the viewer can't help but be excited to see so many great names in one film. Marlon Brando plays the role of the Godfather AKA Don Corleone, the leader of one out of five Italian mafias in the New York area. The way Brando developed his character was amazing and his famous voice in the film that has been mimicked for 30 years now sounds untouchable in it's originality. Al Pacino plays Brando's son Michael Corleone, who actually wasn't wanted for the part at the time but the studio cast him with the recommendation from the Director (Francis Coppola). Pacino actually sets the bar for himself when he took this role, and for all the future roles he would play in Mafia movies. His acting is compelling, and his looks are almost unrecognizable.<br/><br/>There are actually no innocent by-standers that get hurt or victimized in the film that you might see in other mafia movies. Infact everyone that ends up dead were people that were a part of one of the mafia families. The whole film is about respect and the closeness of family if you can see behind all the violence.<br/><br/>The film is quite long to sit through in one sitting but is totally worth it by the end. The film will grab you in an instant with curiosity to the underground world of the mob.<br/><br/>This is undoubtedly the best mob movie ever.

The performance by the then young Al Pacino as the youngest son Micheal was also first class. His portrayal as a young man, recently out of the army, who was determined to stay well out of his fathers business but through a series of events transformed is quite stunning. Far greater than part two and one of the best films ever made.

The Plot makes a huge effect on viewers feelings and emotions while characters battle between life and death. This is probably the best performance of Pacino and Brando. In my opinion everyone who sees this movie will absolutely say it is good and will understand waht godfather means.

","I have to admit, I didnt like this movie at first. At first was when i was about 15 or 16 and didnt really pay attention to any of the dialogue and just waited for something to happen.<br/><br/>Some time later, when I actually payed attention to the dialogue, and reading the book after, I realized this was the greatest movie ever made, without a doubt. This of course poses questions for debate. But if your likes mainly exist in special effects, of buildings, cars, or people being constantly blown up, then you wont really get a kick out of anything in this movie. Ive realized almost all of the people who dont like the Godfather are more interested in action flicks. Again, no offense taken, thats just the way I percieve it. Many people say, ""I was waiting for something to happen and nothing did so I turned it off.""  If the restaurant scene with Solozzo and the Police Captain was not enough for you, its your loss.<br/><br/>The whole point of it being a mafia movie is about respect and morals. Not really constant shootings and killings. But the bottom line of the movie is about one of the sons, who happens to be the brains and the innocent one of the 3, but gets involved in the family business because of family values, and sooon thereafter becomes entangled in a struggle for power, which turns him, a good guy, into a monster. Its incredible. Pacinos acting is amazing. And so are the rest of the casts, including Duvall, who is severely underrated.  People complain about Brandos voice and not being able to understand him. Thats because he got shot in the throat in a hit earlier in his life.<br/><br/>There are alot of great movies out there. Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino...But this is in my opinion the greatest time piece ever, and most genuine. The whole movie is realistic, something that alot of people can identify with, with family morals and values and so forth. Theres hardly any bs in the movie, and the entire movie is severly captivating once you understand what is going on.<br/><br/>Lot of good movies out there, but this one tops them all.

As a kid I didn't understand it and couldn't watch it and I loved gangster movies. But as I got older I finally understood the movie. The violence only makes the point of Mike's turn even stronger as he shows no remorse for what he has done. In the beginning of the movie he tells Kay the story of Johnny Fontane's contract. But he basically tells her that's how my family operates,not me. Then as the film pushes on he becomes worse then his father ever was because he kills with no remorse and does only what his mind tells him instead of listening to his heart sometimes( classic struggle).

The one thing that amazes me most about this movie is how much of a pain it was for Coppola to make. Listening to the commentary by Coppola on the DVD was great. It really showed the hell he was put through while making the movie. Some examples are: 1) He had to fight to get the actors he wanted (Vs. Paramount). The studio said no way to Brando. 2) He had the threat of a ""Studio"" director hanging over him at all times to take over at any time. 3) He had various crew members talking about him behind his back about how horrible he was. 4) The entire scene where Carlo is fighting with Connie was filmed because the studio felt that the movie didn't have enough action in it so there were going to bring in an action director to finish the film.<br/><br/>And that's just some of the troubles he had. Listening to the commentary, it seemed like a real nightmare. And after all that, we are blessed with one of the, if not the, best film of all time. It's really a miracle in my opinion.

","This is Coppola's crowning jewel, if not the 20th Century's. The story follows the legacy of the Corleone Family, one of the Five Families of New York in the 1940's. With accuracy in the time period and perfect accents, the cast of All Stars take over the screen with grace. A young Al Pacino heads the cast as an innocent and yet murderous Michael Corleone. Robert Duvall also gives the performance of his life as the Irish American Tom Hagen. And of course, Marlon Brando steals the scene as Don Corleone. The story tells a tale of family, trust, honor, and respect. Even though the characters are murderers and thieves, they are also fathers, sons, and husbands. This is a must-see for any movie goer. You have not seen American cinema until you have seen ""The Godfather."""

","I was entertained by the Godfather. A lot. So don't think that this is a negative review.<br/><br/>The godfather has kind of set it self up to be kind of like a joke now. Come on. ""Don't forget the canole!"" It is kind of stereotypical of Italians, even though Coppola himself was an Italian and didn't intend it to be that way. Marlon Brando is great, but he is still way overrated. Al Pacino, however, is amazing, and made me rethink my earlier opinion that he was an overactor. James Caan of course is great, as is Diane Keaton. Unfortunately, this movie isn't as good as Part Two, which is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Oh, and one more thing...

","This movie isn't just about mafia or crime or just killing people. Some people thing that this movie is only about violence (mostly female people ;) ). The movie is more about family, how the people in a family are connected together, how a complete innocent son, can become a very violent guy.<br/><br/>It changes the way you look at mafia. Some think that mafia is just a group of gangsters that kill for money. Well, the movie tells you that it's not just that, there is honor. Of course, I'm not saying that they are right, but they aren't just a group of violent assassins. The music on the movie is very well made, the acting is fabulous, and Al Pacino is great. So is Marlon Brando. The movie starts at a good point and ends at a good point too. Some might think that it's not a good ending, doesn't explain enough. But I just love the way in which the movie ends, great music, great scene and great look on Kay's face. I know that there are people who will call this movie a boring one. I accept that it's long...very long, but it's necessary and it explains the entire story very good. Overall, it's a fabulous movie, the best movie experience I ever had. 10/10"

"Basketcase247","10","0","3","7 February 2004"," The greatest movie ever made
","**** out of four fear the few spoilers<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster drama is the perfect film. A combination od drama, violence, even family responsibilities. It goes deep inside the Corleone family business, and shows that even gangsters have families they have to worry about.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando gives one of the greatest screen performances ever, as The Don Vito Corleone. True, he spends most of the movie bound to a bed, but he is definately the main character of this epic. After a failed assassination attempt on Vito's life, its up to his sons, Michael(Al Pacino), a nice college boy who never got in the family business, and Sonny(James Caan) the hot head older son who cant wait to be in charge.Michael puts his legit life behind, in order to save his father, and kills two men in the process.<br/><br/>
Brando won his second oscar for this one, but didnt except it. Either way, The Don is one of the greatest, and most recognizable characters in cinematic history. Caan was robbed of his supporting actor oscar, cause he is the life of the movie, playing Sonny. Robert Duvall snagged a nod for being Tom. The cool conselerie who wants everybody to stay cool. Pacino in his first big role amazes as the son forced to turn to a life of crime.<br/><br/>Great performances by Sterling Hayden and John Marley add to this amazing film. Hayden as a crooked cop, and Marley as a perverted movie producer, with a love of horses, and really young girls.<br/><br/>Made in 1972, there wasnt a film before, or after that was like The Godfather. The original gangster flick, before Scarface, Goofellas, or Donnie Brasco. The Godfather is a classic, and a movie beyond all bouderies. It changed the history of movies forever, and it still does.<br/><br/>THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER!!!"

Revenge is also Rampant. Every body takes revenge on every body-there is no place to hide. I really like the wedding scene that takes place in the first 25 minutes. This sequence took a week to shoot and involved 750 extras!<br/><br/>Marlon Brando plays Don Vito Corleone, the head of the Corleone crime family. No one plays this role better than he does. He gives a powerful performance. Al Pacino is Michael, who takes over after Sonny(James Caan) is gunned down at a toll booth. Sonny was in line to be the next don.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a good film-but how can it be no. 1 in the top 250 list? This list is determined by the votes people give, but it's not the best movie ever made. Citizen Kane is IMHO.<br/><br/>This film is part of the ""Godfather"" DVD collection.

","For certain,my review will be regarded with great disdain.Before I viewed the movie,I read the book by Mario Puzo.The similarities are right on target.Coppolla accurately conveyed the book to cinema in an engrossing style,however,I honestly believe that these bigger than Life characters were more suited for a documentary.The movie itself in a technical sense is excellent,but It's stature is overstated in the archives of movie history.The Mafia,never referenced,oh really,do we really have to struggle with this enigma,in light of the fact that Michael goes to Sicily,to hide from u.s.authorities,and the mob,He kind of got a surprise there.I find the adoration of the Don,Brando to be sickening and offensive.He is displayed as an arbritator of honesty and intergrity,a model to admire? Did this group forget the concept about when in Rome.A unique culture can effectively be blended into any society,providing they play by the rules of their host country.It is amazing to me,that such a small island nation,could have such a dominating influence or admiration in our western culture.Moreover,these thugs have done absolutely nothing in aid of their native home of Sicily,such a charming snake pit that has still not joined the 19th century.We now see a myriad of Mafias all over the world.If this is to be put in proper context,it is troubling to me,that we adorn and admire such cultures.I find the tributes to be troubling,not just in the movie making sense,but in it's implications to family values,and morality.I'm certain that the commercial revenues from this movie,could have assisted areas of the world that do not enjoy the privileges of our generation. On the movie again,I found the soundtrack beautiful,however,certainly a contradiction to the henous overtones and behaviour of the plot line and characters.There is even some morbid undertones that express love and loyalty.The only emotion I detected here was greed,violence,self-gratification,hideous marriages.The most contempt is explored in this group's demands for respect,that is an oxymoron.The mindset of this movie has caught up with today's corporate mentality of greed and power.Did this movie require more sequels,so that we could start reading a book from the last page and work our way to the beginning,Like ""Memento"".Your user ratings are engulfed with shallow praise for barbaric cultures.After this movie was released,every clown italian or not,was emulating the behaviour of these thugs,as if to pontificate their significance in the real world.There are a ton of movies past and present,that are more significant and artistic.I see no artistry in corruption,I only see an endorsement of bizzare behavious fabricated on a shallow premise.Whatever happened to love and sensibility?Are we compelled to view the ugliness and darker sides of our nature,and,if so,there is indeed no hope for future generations.I guess I will have to check under my hood every morning now,well that kind of say's it all!!"

","This movie is the best I've seen. Very Good!!!Perfect!!!I also saw the God father II&III, but I think I is the best , the I story also the best!<br/><br/>Throughout his long, wandering, often distinguished career Francis Ford Coppola has made many films that are good and fine, many more that are flawed but undeniably interesting, and a handful of duds that are worth viewing if only because his personality is so flagrantly absent. Yet he is and always shall be known as the man who directed the Godfather films, a series that has dominated and defined their creator in a way perhaps no other director can understand. Coppola has never been able to leave them alone, whether returning after 15 years to make a trilogy of the diptych, or re-editing the first two films into chronological order for a separate video release as The Godfather Saga. The films are our very own Shakespearean cycle: they tell a tale of a vicious mobster and his extended personal and professional families (once the stuff of righteous moral comeuppance), and they dared to present themselves with an epic sweep and an unapologetically tragic tone. Murder, it turned out, was a serious business. The first film remains a towering achievement, brilliantly cast and conceived. The entry of Michael Corleone into the family business, the transition of power from his father, the ruthless dispatch of his enemies--all this is told with an assurance that is breathtaking to behold. And it turned out to be merely prologue; two years later The Godfather, Part II balanced Michael's ever-greater acquisition of power and influence during the fall of Cuba with the story of his father's own youthful rise from immigrant slums. The stakes were higher, the story's construction more elaborate, and the isolated despair at the end wholly earned. (Has there ever been a cinematic performance greater than Al Pacino's Michael, so smart and ambitious, marching through the years into what he knows is his own doom with eyes open and hungry?) The Godfather, Part III was mostly written off as an attempted cash-in, but it is a wholly worthy conclusion, less slow than autumnally patient and almost merciless in the way it brings Michael's past sins crashing down around him even as he tries to redeem himself.--Bruce Reid"

I still have a hard time believing that Mario Puzo, knew nothing of the mafia, but for a guy that didn't know much, I don't think his movie was so bad, lol. and for some of the commentors that say that this movie drags on too long i say, if you can't appreciate it because you have the attention span of a 5 year old, go watch cartoons on the disney channel and keep it to yourself, this movie doesnt have a weakness. the story explores many things about life and society, one of which being that, in the character of Michael Corleone, the will of evil is too often, stronger than the human heart. the entire movie was put in a very dark setting without a single bright spot, I dont think real gangsters go through their entire lives in the mob without laughing or having fun, even periodically, but I can believe the fact that for the most part there lives are pretty devoid of happiness. The concept of Vito being forced out becuase he didn't want to deal in narcotics explores that the gang world is also so devoid of morals that there is little or no room for them and that showing any is a sign of weakness, and if you do, your likely to get forced out by somebody more agressive and with less of a concious."

To make a perfect film is an achievement, to make a perfect film with another touch is near impossible. I've only ever once offered a film 10/10 and The Godfather won't be my second.

","No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.<br/><br/>And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.<br/><br/>Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.<br/><br/>Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.<br/><br/>Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).<br/><br/>Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.<br/><br/>My Grade--- Part I: A Part II: B Part III: C-"

","I can remember the first time I  saw this movie, it just totally blew me away. There has never been a better movie and there never will be a better one and I'll tell you why. Everything came together for this movie, the acting, music, screenplay, setting, the characters and the story. It did something rare it brought crime and family together in an almost mythical way. Also it brought Marlon Brando (The Godfather) as a passing Don to a new generation (Al Pacino), in essence the transfer of  power  was being passed from one generation to another Brando to Pacino, and in the second movie it was Brando to DeNiro. Aside from their great performances, James Caan and Robert Duvall were flawless. James Caan turns in the performance of a lifetime as Sonny Corelone, and Duvall is flawless as Consilgere to the Don. If you have read the book you know will know why it was perfectly transfered from the book to the big screen. Their will never be legends such as Brando and Pacino ever again, they became the characters, they weren't acting, THEY BECAME the characters. I still get chills down my spine at the end of the movie when that the door closes and the transfer of power is complete from Father to Son. Don Corleone to Michael. It is unforgettable, and the legend grows with every viewing of the film."

","I cannot add anything about this movie that hasn't already been said by people a lot more experienced about movies than I am. <br/><br/>
I can say this though.  Few movies have ever grabbed my attention and not let go like this one has.  Look at the expression on Al Pacino's face when he tells his brother never to take sides against the family again.  There is no doubt about the enormous anger he is fighting to control or about what the results will be if he ever loses that control.  Look at Marlon Brando as the reserved dignified old Don spending his last moments playing like a child with his grandson in the garden.  And look at Robert Duval when Sal pleads for the favor of his life after he has turned traitor to Michael. And last, look at Dianne Keaton in the last scene when she realizes the her husband IS the Godfather.<br/><br/>These are the things that make a movie great.  Standout moments of acting by those who define acting.  These are the moments that elevate acting to an art form (and film is just as much an art form as painting or music or poetry).

"ActJef1077","10","0","2","25 June 2003"," What else can be said?
","What else can be said about this cinematic masterpiece that has not been said a million times?  What exactly is it about this movie that ranks it the #1 movie of all-time on many lists, including imdb.com's list?  It isn't just the plot.  While masterful, I have seen better plots before.  Not many, of course, and not better by much, but there still are a couple.  It's not just the acting.  Again, I am hard pressed to think of better performances, but there are a few out there.  I will say that Brando's acting, Pacino's, Caan's, Duvall's, Keaton's, and so many others all mixed together were awesome.  But it's not only the way each one acts, but also the way each one acts off the others.  But still, the acting alone could not make this movie #1.  The cinematography, the lighting, the sound, the musical score, all these were terrific, but none of them made this movie.  So then, what DOES make this movie what it is?  I would say that it is taking all of these elements together and breathing life into them.  Rather than simply being a voyeur, watching all the action from the outside, the viewer is thrust into the middle of it.  He becomes surrounded by the action and to a certain extent becomes part of the Corleone family.  And as the movie races towards its climax, the viewer is pulled emotionally at every turn, forcing hatred towards good people, love towards evil people, respect for those who do not deserve it, and ultimately a great deal of sympathy for a man who rules with an iron fist and seems to be too concerned with his own well-being to care about the feelings of anyone else.  And yet, at the same time, we see that he does care, and he does feel, and he does love.  There is a tremendous feeling of family in this movie, a great sense of belonging.  And I believe that is the secret to this movie.  The viewer is not left on the outside, but brought inside warmly to share the innermost thoughts and feelings of men he might normally avoid and fear.  And the viewer learns a profound secret by watching this movie: There is no greater desire than the desire to belong, to be a part of something, no matter what that something may be; and this desire will be ultimately fulfilled no matter how much it is ignored or resisted.  Underneath it all, we are all the same."

","The epic of epics, in my wholehearted view, remains to this day one of America's most accomplished feature films. This movie is so good that it's not just a movie, it's a movie that has dominated and defined their creator in a way perhaps no other director can understand. Even without understanding the dialogue's nuances or the elaborate twists, one is still inexorably drawn to the movie, as I found myself to be since the earliest time.<br/><br/>One thing that makes this movie a classic is that it defined how bad violence in a movie can be. When you see movie character Luca Brasi stabbed in the hand while he's being strangled to death, you realize that the director likes to take this movie seriously and make an example of how far a movie can go when it comes to violence. I'll admit that when I saw this movie for the first time in my life it wasn't very good in my opinion. When I saw this movie being #3 on AFI's {American Film Institute} Top 100 American Movies Of All Time, I thought it really didn't deserved that spot. But when I gave it another chance, my opinion changed. I said to myself, ""This movie represents the best of movies like what the Statue of Liberty represnts to America"".<br/><br/>In short, this movie is fantastic. What Star Wars is to Sci-fi is what Godfather is to Crime-Drama, meaning it's a perfect example of the genre. There will probably never be another movie like this in many decades to come."

My favorite performance is one that often goes unnoticed:  Robert Duvall's muted, pitch perfect Tom Hagen.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most neglected aspect of the film is how brilliantly Coppola and Puzo adapted the novel.  If you read the book, you'll find that all the novel's strengths are on display upon the screen, while none of its weaknesses, or even interesting extraneous material, appear in the script. Since Coppola had recently written a great script for ""Patton,"" a notoriously difficult feat considering the subject matter, and Puzo went on to co-write the unfortunately hilarious ""Earthquake,"" I think most of the credit should probably go to Coppola.<br/><br/>This is simply one of the greatest movies ever made."

","""The Godfather"" is an exquisite mafia epic which constructs a compelling Italian family saga, with an insight into violence, power, crime, corruption, and honor. ""The Godfather"" (1972) is a superb gangster film, situated in New York in the late 1940s. The family is dominated by the aging Godfather `Don Vito Corleone' (Marlon Brando). There are five Italian American families and `Don Corleone,' is the head of one. The film shows the Italian American families pursuit of profit through corruption and governmental protection. The film's screenplay was based upon Mario Puzo's best selling novel based on the Corleone family. It was about three hours long and had excellent acting, besides beautiful and outstanding photography and choreography. The recreation of the period of time with the ending of World War Two was authentic. ""The Godfather"" opens with a man known as Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) in the dark, then as the light fades in, he is in the home office of the Don Corleone. There he conducts his business while outside in the garden area his daughter's wedding reception is taking place. The Don is accompanied by his overseer known as the consigliore, the legal advisor, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The `Don' promises favors to Sollozzo and expects favors in return. The youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) transforms his shy character into the future `Don' of the family. Michael was influenced to make this decision from the shooting of his father; he felt the family was in need of support. When Michael becomes `Don,' he has taken revenge upon one of the Italian American families, Tattaglia, where he makes an arrangement to meet Bruno Tattaglia (Tony Giorgio) and Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden) in an Italian American restaurant planning to kill them. As Don Vito Corleone revives, he tells Michael when he passes on a betrayer working for one of the families will approach him, thus revealing who will betray the Corleone family. Michael arranges a massacre during the baptism of his sister's child for the revenge of his father's shooting. This becomes a major turning point in Michael's life and in the film. His loyalty to the Corleone family is now unquestionable, and his future is sealed. It was a very interesting, emotional, and entertaining film. I was intrigued with the Italian language and culture and the scenery of Italy filmed throughout the movie. The drama was intense and the unexpected movements stirred my imagination. I would recommend this film for viewing for the appropriate adult aged viewer. ""The Godfather"" will always be remembered and go down in film history, especially with the line by Don Vito Corleone, `I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.'"

","Whenever i saw a list of the top 100 movies, ""The Godfather"" was always on top.  I had no clue why.  I heard it was really good so i felt i should see it.  So one evening, after all my homework was done, i sat down on the couch in front of the TV and surfed through the channels and i land upon a memo saying, ""The Godfather: Next at 8 pm""  So i decide to just watch maybe an hour or so of it and then go to sleep.  I stayed up the whole night watching it.  The acting in the movie was excellent and the cinematography was great. The characters were so believable that whenever i see a picture/movie of any character in the movie, the first thing that pops into my brain is their character name.  After watching the movie, i couldn't stop talking about it to all my friends.  Now i understand why its always on top of top 100 lists."

","The first time I saw this movie was not too long ago.  Coming into the movie I'd heard lots of little things about the Godfather movies (mainly I and II).  Most, if not all, of my friends told that the second Godfather movie was better than the first.  I couldn't say anything then having seen neither, so I decided to see both.  After seeing both, my humble opinion is that the first one IS better than the second; however they're both very good movies.<br/><br/>I liked both movies for their tremendous acting.  Both boasted Al Pacino, John Cazale, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall.  The second had Robert De Niro's Academy Award winning role as Vito Corleone.  The first one had James Caan and, one of my favourite performances of all time, Marlon Brando as the older and wiser Don Vito Corleone which is shared by De Niro.  Because Brando won the Academy Award for his acting, the character Vito Corleone holds a record for being the only character to have received two Academy Awards; shared by no one.  I think what made the first movie for me was Marlon Brando.<br/><br/>There's no way in the world to tell whether the first Godfather is better than The Godfather Part II.  Leonard Maltin finds the second one better, I find the first better.  The only opinion that really counts is one's opinion to themselves.  I highly recommend everyone who hasn't yet to see the Godfather trilogy (primarily I and II, I haven't seen III yet.)  They're good movies that shouldn't be missed to anyone."

","The Godfather is without a doubt the Greatest Movie of our time and of anybody else's time. The brutally brilliant and passionate film is about the violent Mafia family, the Corleones. Don Vito Corleone (Best Actor Academy Award Winner Marlon Brando) is passing on the family business to one of his sons-but which one? He decides to skip over the oldest son, the hotheaded Santino (Academy Award Nominee James Caan); He also decides to skip over cowardly Frederico (John Cazale); In the end he passes it down to youngest son, the intelligent Michael (Academy Award Nominee Al Pacino). This movie won the Academy Award for best picture in 1972 and deservedly so. Great performances by Brando, Pacino, Cazale, Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and Robert Duvall. It deserves to be the IMDB's highest rated film and #3 on the American Film Institute's Best List. It should be number 1. On a scale of one to ten, this gets a 100."

","Made in the last era of great Hollywood movies - the 70s - ""The Godfather"" today is as relevant, fresh and even groundbreaking as it was some thirty years ago. Jewels handcrafted with this much care are seldom made anymore. But even if they still were the order of the day, it would be truly hard to recapture something this revolutionary.<br/><br/>Perfect movie in pretty much every way, ""Godfather"" starts off in celebratory atmosphere as the aging Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) receives clients' asking for favours while his daughter Connie (Talia Shire) is getting married outside. It's 1946, and through the events at the wedding we're getting a stylish introduction to the patriarchal mafia family - reasonable and wise old Don Vito with his three sons: hothead philanderer Sonny (James Caan), inadequate Fredo (John Cazale) and strong willed WW2 veteran Michael (Al Pacino) who's reluctant to enter the family business. From the shocking introductory vignette involving a horse's head and a Hollywood studio head (Copolla's not-so-subtle dig at the movie business) memorable scenes follow one another: attempt at Don Vito's life, a visit to his wounded father at the hospital which for young Michael ends up being the watershed event that pushes him over to 'the dark side', Sollazzo-McCluskey killings in the Bronx restaurant, Michael's subsequent exile in Sicily with tragic marriage to beautiful Apollonia, Sonny's assassination and the final sequence intertwining scenes of Michael attending his nephew's baptism as his capos are eliminating competing mafia heads and traitors within the family....<br/><br/>It all takes place within a closed world where not being loyal is the only crime and everything functions according to those rules so that audience can understand, even sympathize with characters when they're exhibiting truly monstrous behaviour.<br/><br/>There's no doubt in my mind this is a highly romanticized version of mafia business, but who cares  this movie is so much more. A true epic, that works on so many levels."

With the slow panning shot in the dark room, it seems to intend to do just that.        Reading some of the negative reviews here, I am reminded of just how different people can be in this world.  I can't imagine giving this movie a negative review.  Incredibly intense and emotional, beautifully shot, dramatically delivered, rings completely true.  The best ensemble performance ever. The best performance of Brando's career. This is simply the perfect movie. I confess that I have never been able to sit through Citizen Caine, but do not let reviewers here confuse that movie with this one.  Watching this movie is pure joy.        For the unique effect of taking the viewer into another world, I can only think of a few movies anywhere near the same ballpark.  The African Queen comes to mind, Terminator maybe, North By Northwest perhaps, Casa Blanca, Pulp Fiction and Rocky are candidates, maybe Cast Away. (Even First Blood was pretty good at that, strangely enough.  The Outsiders, the book, but not the movie.) Hopefully you get the idea.  This is incredible film-making.

Directors often get a book all wrong and screw up the translation from the book to the movie, and that's only logical, because a book is art and that's personal. THe movie would have been completely different if Coppola had written the screenplay on his own without Puzo telling him what the real essence of the story is.

","Unbelievable as it may sound, the first time I watched The Godfather I got too tired and we stopped the tape. After that I didn't forgive myself until I finally decided to rent it again. The second time around I made it to the end and I loved it. Of all the movies I've watched, I feel that this one has had the biggest impact on me. To me, being allowed to watch The Godfather is a gift. It's more than just watching a great movie: It's like observing a timeless piece of art by Leonardo Da Vinci. <br/><br/>The Godfather is a movie that tells the touching and invincible tail of the Corleones, an Italian family living in New York that is involved in the mafia affairs in the city. A drug lord named Virgil Sollozzo wants to start shipping drugs all over New York and asks Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) to help him with his affairs. Corleone does not approve of the idea and would rather stick to his own business. Angry with the rejection, Sollozzo sends two of his thugs try to kill him, but he survives. Michael (Al Pacino), the youngest of all the sons, wants to be the man to protect his father, although the other members of the family don't want him caught up in the affair. The plot rises in levels of drama and thrills as the film goes on, and it just gets better and better. Most of the scenes easily stand out as some of the greatest moments in movie history, such as:<br/><br/>
The beginning. What else? No one could ever forget the thought provoking scenes with Brando stroking his cat and negotiating with his close friends and relatives.<br/><br/>Michael's assassination of the cop and Sollozzo at a small diner.<br/><br/>
Michael being named the new godfather. <br/><br/>The killings of family enemies during the baptism.<br/><br/>Of course, these are not the only fantastic scenes in the movie. The Godfather also has an A++ cast, like almost everyone who has watched it will tell you. It practically made the careers of Francis Ford Coppola, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and of course, Al Pacino. Best of all, it has Marlon Brando at what could be his finest (I still haven't seen Apocalypse Now). I know it's been said many times, but I'll add my two cents anyway by saying that The Godfather is a classic and is pretty much flawless.<br/><br/>

"mrbrown19","Null","0","2","14 January 2003"," A true test of times
","Francis Ford Coppola was once asked why ""The Godfather"" had been placed amongst the greats of American Cinema.  His answer:  longevity. <br/><br/>
Longevity in the cinematic world is a piece of work that stands the test of time.  A film is amongst the greats when it doesn't conform to the current pop culture or the specifics of issues.  The Godfather is not only an example of ""some mafia movie,"" but rather an example of an excellent storyline adaptation, great actors accomodating to their roles, and simplicity in shots that show how pictures are worth 1,000 words.  (Take into the consideration of the film coming into the scene during 1972, which is such a minuscule moment in camera development and shot technology compared to the everyday advancement of computer graphics.)<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola works well with Mario Puzzo to turn such a great novel to such an excellent movie.  The only backstep is that the novel gets more indepth with the character of Johnny Fontane.  However, the focus is still on ""family values"" in general, and displays the actions of a mafia.  Al Pacino (although undermined by film producers to play the role of Michael) is excellent with his gestures and voice confidence as the film proceeds. The lighting is also an admirable display of how simple shots can be more wholesome and effective.<br/><br/>The Godfather is a great film that truly denotes a stand through the test of times."

"sjoshi64","10","0","2","5 January 2003"," Precisely why I feel this is the greatest movie of all time
","I honestly think this is the finest piece of cinema I have every viewed (but then again, I can't claim to have seen vast quantities of movies). Firstly, the aesthetics mark it out as a classic: some shots, such as those of Vito Corleone in his study, could be removed from the film and considered art by themselves. Not only are the costumes beautiful, the lighting, sets and movement makes the film absolutely stunning, visually. All scenes appear to have a mild sepia tint and the lights particularly focus our eyes on peoples' expressions.<br/><br/>Of course a film cannot survive on aesthetic beauty alone: the subtlety in the acting is superb. Al Pacino's face fleshes out his character perfectly and the mannerisms and prescence of each character is distinct and revealing. Although it is occasionally difficult to understand Marlon Brando, his screen prescence is astonishing and he, as the head of the family, he dominates his scenes. Yet there is something in Michael Corleone that singles him out, and Al Pacino really brings this to the role.<br/><br/>I am less interested in the film's social commentary, although it is present and strong. The film has a distinctly 'epic' feel to it and as a result seems relatively objective. It does an astonishing job of presenting the characters as human beings and brothers and fathers and friends. In most films, the same characters would be painted by the film as either violent thugs or murderers. Of course, the director does not insult our intelligence, and this is what makes the film so good: Michael Corleone is a murderer and a thug, and the film does not hide this; yet we identify with him and we understand his motives and his mind. By the end of the film he is cold-blooded, a killer and has his brother-in-law murdered. Yet we look at him as a member of a family, not as a Mafia Don. He is one of the finest characters in movie history."

"ifoster","Null","0","2","27 November 2002"," Great Movie, worthy of its reputation
","In general, this film portrays the institution that is the crime family. The family is powerful because it is connected, intimidating and brutal. Either you are a friend of the family, or an enemy of the family. If you are a friend of the family, then you are subjugated by the family--you owe the family for being your friend. If you are an enemy of the family, then you are first threatened,and if you are still recalcitrant, then you are killed. (Evidently, the family operates in much the same way as the Roman Empire operated in its hey day.) Respecting everyone with whom you are involved and playing by the rules of the game are necessary virtues during times of peace and breaking them is a virtue during times of war. Because the aesthetic of this crime world is understandable to the viewer, the brutality that permeates it is palatable to the viewer.<br/><br/>As the seminal work of a genre that is now well developed, the movie still stands out, head and shoulders, both over all other movies in the crime-family genre and over most movies in any genre, period.  What makes it so poignant is how it shows the chance transformation of university-educated war hero, into the head of the crime family. The viewer has high expectations for such a promising young man, for him to maybe become a lawyer, a businessman... to become anything but the leader of such an inhumane institution. But by circumstance or fate, he is forced to overcome a gauntlet of dangers and difficulties just to survive. And by surviving them, he becomes the don. But the transformation does not take obvious steps. The viewer does not realize what he, the university graduate, is becoming until the last scene when the viewer realizes what he has become--a reincarnation of his father, a don. Because every scene in the movie is gripping, we have a tendency to lose sight of the big picture.  When we finally see that the war hero has become a don, we are compelled to reflect on his life, to see how his experience informed his choices and his actions, to see what got him to where he is, in the same way that we are, ever now and then, forced to reflect on our own decisions in life. 5/5"

"mssandlin","10","0","2","25 September 2002"," The ultimate depiction of America's obsession with power
","Mario Puzo's book The Godfather is one of the greatest works of fiction this country has ever produced, and Coppala brings it to the screen almost perfectly. Both the book and the film have been so popular, in my opinion, because they provide a stylistic and romantic view of power-a subject which we Americans have always struggled with. <br/><br/>Most Americans (especially men) like and admire Vito and Micheal Corleone. The fact that they are criminals doesn't bother us at all. Usually a character must be empowered by the law or seeking justice in order for us to sympathize with him or condone actions we normally view as evil. That is not the case with the Corleones. We like them because they are powerful in and of themselves. The actions of the Corleone family are sometimes motivated by revenge, but more often the goal is to simply gain more power. We excuse them of murder because we see them as being outside of and above the law.<br/><br/>
The reason that this film is so appealing (beyond the phenomenal acting, the wonderful quotes, the artistry and originality or the director, etc.) is because deep down, most of us want to be Vito Corleone. We want to be powerful enough to protect our families and our friends. We want our enemies to fear us. We want the money that goes hand in hand with such power. (You'll notice, that in all three Godfather stories, the power brings in the money, not visa versa.) Sure, most of us would rather come by it honestly, but in the end we just want that kind of control. For most of us, Vito Corleone embodies the American dream."

","What makes this movie so great is that the characters seem to leap off the screen, often after only a few minutes. I've never quite figured it out, but it's as if you already know these guys, their habits, their mannerisms, their strengths and faults. Like Clemenza, a guy you hate to love - he'd just as easily kill you as he would pick a weed off his lawn, yet you can't help but respect him. Respect him? What am I saying? But that's the ticket with this movie, Clemenza, Pauli, Tom, Santino, Sal ... these people are so real, it's scary. Oddly enough, the only person who seems an ill fit is Michael, at the start that is. How can anyone so clean cut be related? But Pacino makes it work (unbelievable acting) and nothing is more engaging that watching the 'transformation' he goes through as he becomes the Don."

","Goog God, this movie is too great and I certainly dispise everyone who dislike the film by sayin...which shoul I say? Boring? Plot less?<br/><br/>Well God Damn them. The Godfather is one of the best pictures ever made, and the one with the best plot in cinema history. And the sequel is even better.<br/><br/>
I read some comments saying that you can't fell anything for the characters. That isn't so at all. Vito Corleone is the best explanation of what evil is like. Not something supernatural, but something that comes out of human being (in fact, evil is one of the most human things there are). The Godfather tries to help people, and he does, only he kills and violate laws in the process. And what about Kay. Not much people talk about her because the movie is about men's power, but she was my favorite character, just the same, and it was a pity for me that Mario Puzo didn't tell her story in the film as he does in the book. She is lovely because of her love (a love, just as love is: strange) she is willing to pass through the good and the bad of the Corleone family.<br/><br/>Connie was bitchy, but not enough to be beaten by Carlo and it was horrible the way her father just ignore that. Good for Sonny, although he was killed. Fredo is a shame because he is good in so many things, and he complains about not doing what he'd hate to do. You have to watch the Godfather II, or read the book to understand.<br/><br/>After watching it several times, I understood how Michael became the monster that hits Kay. At the beggining he tells her something like he is not like his family, and at the end of the sequel he talks about murder like it's as normal as going to work.<br/><br/>Really the movie is good, but is hard, it takes time to tell its story, and you have to watch it several times to understand it completely (is the kind of movie where a simple name someone says once at the beginning can affect the entire movie) or read that wonderful book."

As the bulk of the train screeches by, Pacino stands there, contemplaiting his next move.  As the train begins to fade from hearing, Pacino goes back into the restaurant and murders the two clients at his meeting.  This scene shows the change of Michael from the war hero, to the family's next hit man, as he steps onto the first rung of the ladder of eventual family succession.  The train, in the eyes (or ears if you prefer) of this reviewer, is symbolic of his transition.  Before the train: war hero; after the train: Hit man.<br/><br/>This film is one of a kind.

","Francis Ford Coppola made his breakthrough directorial effort with 1972's Best Picture (according to AMPAS and numerous circles) is unquestionably the greatest american film.  This isn't to say that Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull, Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon and Orson Welles' Citizen Kane aren't as good as it.  In fact, Apocalypse Now (also directed by Coppola) is probably better in terms of visual style and cause, but Mario Puzo (who also wrote the novel THE GODFATHER) and Francis Ford Coppola's screenplay is surpisingly cohesive, and Gordon Willis' stunning photography accentuates the period feel of the film.  It is like no other work of cinema to come out of the 70s and will never be topped.  Not even by Coppola.  The story is so reminiscent of Shakespeare and Greek tragedies that Corleone seems almost mythological.  All in all this is a film about finding the American dream.  It's a film about honor, respect and tradition.  The word mafia is never used because unlike GoodFellas and Casino, this is not an expose or biography of the mafia, but is an epic story of an American family.  The best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be."

I.e.: how they gained political influence among society, how michael grew distant and how the rest of them drew close, and then skip 40-50 years ahead to vincent corleone losing the bussiness that was worked upon so hard to gain, through drugs and loss of all political influence and respect, whilst haunted by the loss of his cousin love, and ironically have one final scene with Michael and vincent before michael died. i.e.: this would be a part 2 narrative.<br/><br/>This was majorly discussed, but time was not on puzo's side to write it, and francis refuses this to be done without puzo.<br/><br/>One might say ""How about Scorsese?"" but lets face it, this was a coppola/puzo thing.

"mjensen-3","10","0","1","23 June 2002"," ""One of the Best Films of the Decade.""
","The ""Godfather"" is Frances Ford Coppola's best film. Marlon Brando gives the most memorable performance in film history as Vito Corleone. The Movie is based on the gripping and compulsive book, The Godfather. Al Pacino gives a legendary performances as Michael Corleone.<br/><br/>The beginning is set late in the summer of 1945. The films roots, however, are set in the gangster films of the early thirties. The plot is about rival gangs murdering each other, and now we see the inbred corrupt system of loyalty and terror, in which killing is a preferred way of dealing with the competition. We see how the gangs encroach on each other and why this form of illegal business inevitably erupts in violence. We see their subculture, based on a split between the men's conception of their responsibilities, which they keep dark form there families, and the false world the create to shelter the women and children.<br/><br/>The visual scheme is based on the most obvious life and death contrasts, the men meet and conduct their business in deep toned, shuttered rooms, lighted by lamps even in the daytime, and the story moves back and forth between this hidden, world and the sunshine that they share with the woman and children. The tension is in the meetings  held in the underworld darkness and one gets the feeling that this secret life has its own poetry of fear. The dark and light contrast is so operatic and so openly symbolic that it perfectly expresses the basic nature of the material. Noting the Catholic background of the characters and the eternal battle of good and evil, of innocence versus knowledge, knowledge in this instance equates with shame nd guilt. <br/><br/>BRANDO<br/><br/>The enormous cast is lead by Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, the ""Godfather"" of a powerful Sicilian - American clan, with James Caan as his hothead son, sonny, and Al Pacino as the thoughtful, educated son, Micheal. Is Brando marvelous? Yes, he is, but then he often is, he was marvelous a few years ago in ""On The Waterfront."" He's shockingly effective in a current film, the ""Score."" The role of Don Corleone, a patriarch in his early sixties, allows him to release more of the gentleness that was so seductive and unsettling. Don Vito could be played as a magnificent old warrior, a noble killer, a handsome bull, but Brando manages to humanize him. Brando internalizes Don Vito's power, makes him less physically threatening and deeper, hidden within himself.<br/><br/>THE CAST<br/><br/> However, Brando isn't the whole show; James Caan is very fine actor , and so are Robert Duvall and many others in lesser roles. Don sons suggest different aspects of Brando, Caan's Sonny looks like the muscular young Brando, while his heir, Michael, and Al Pacino comes to resemble him in manner and voice. Like Brando in this film, Pacino is simple, you don't catch him acting, yet he manages to change from a small, fresh-faced, darkly handsome college boy into an underworld lord, becoming more intense, smaller, and more isolated at every step. Coppola doesn't stess the father and son links, they are simply there for us to notice when we will. In the end of the ""Godfather"" nothing is resolved, because the family business goes on. Terry Malloy didn't clean up the docks at the end of ""On The Waterfront"", that was a lie. The ""Godfather"" is popular melodrama, but it expresses a new tragic realism.<br/><br/>I don't have to recommend this film. I give it a 15 out of 10."
"randypeterson","Null","0","1","18 June 2002"," A modern Shakespearean tragedy...
","First of all, if you watch this movie and don't go ahead and watch The Godfather, Part II, you haven't seen the whole work.  They are a single piece and are best experienced that way.  (If you don't have the six hours to kill, at least view each movie on consecutive nights.)<br/><br/> Having said that, this is the story of Michael Corleone, a man whose need to protect his family at all costs ultimately destroys it.  While Michael's father, Vito, often used violence as means to bring security and prosperity to his family, for him it was always ""just business"" -- nothing personal. Michael, on the other hand, proves unable to approach the dirty business of running a crime family with the same detachment. From the first murders he commits  to the last, it's always personal with Michael. Because the violence is personalized, Michael is corrupted by it in ways his father never was.<br/><br/> I think it's about as close to Shakespearean tragedy as 20th century American culture ever came.

"jbirtel","10","0","1","5 June 2002"," As Perfect as Godfather is: No Definitive Version!
","Godfather and PART II are examples of elite filmmaking. Anyone seeing them for the first time should introduce themselves to the theatrical versions (Part III is good - the Vatican sequences are brilliant - but it's just not in the same league; many scenes were just recaps of what we saw [better] in I & II) ( PART II also recaps some scenes from the original, but they were presented on the ""flipside"" - and it worked).<br/><br/>Now a very positive gripe: ""The Godfather: A Novel for Television"" was first broadcast in 1977, it has recently resurfaced on some cable channels (covers I & II in chronological order and retitled The Godfather Saga). What's frustrating is that now, no matter what version I see, I can't help feeling I'm watching an abridged film. For 99.9% of all films, who would care; but this is storytelling at its finest. PART II was innovative for its prequel/sequel presentation that shows (SUBTLE SPOILERS) the irony of the rise and fall of a powerful crime dynasty. But now (I know I'm not alone) after seeing the outakes inserted where they should be, this has made the viewing so much more enriching, especially if you've read Mario Puzo's novel. The problem is that not only is the saga censored (reasonable enough for TV fare), but they've trimmed some lines of dialogue from the theatrical version (I'm not talking about lines containing profanity) apparently for time constraint. What makes the theatrical version more difficult to enjoy now is that the outakes are better pieces of filmaking than 90% of the movies out there (I knew this gripe would turn into a compliment). And in putting it in chronological order, the irony is lessened, but in no way is it lost. The viewer is allowed to see an American tragedy unfold.<br/><br/>I did tape a local broadcast of the ""saga"" in 1988 and again on AMC recently and both versions of THOSE have little scenes that the other doesn't have. EXAMPLE: At the end of Godfather, the scene fades to black (1955), then fades up to show Michael Corleone (now in 1958) walking along his Nevada lakeside estate in the wee hours of the morning of his son's communion/celebration. It's a well done transition scene that's in the 88' telecast, but not in the recent ones (from a fade to black, it almost jump cuts to the party and Fredo's entrance with wife Deanna). Even the bonus disc of the DVD that contains deleted scenes (separate from the films) don't contain all of them. Just one example is (from Godfather I), the first scene that introduces Don Corleone, after the undertaker Bonasera exits the Don's study, Sonny is sternly chastised by the Don for not paying attention (that was worth seeing just to hear Marlon Brando whistle). It's duration is only about 10 seconds long, but it cements the fact that Sonny is the intended Don in training who still needs tweaking by his father.<br/><br/>This is damn fine filmmaking that captures the texture and atmosphere of the time told in the story; be it early 1900's, mid 40's thru the late 50's and Coppola successfully borrowed from the styles of moviemaking, styles lifted from the 20's, 40's and 50's. Movies over 50 years ago didn't have fancy subjective camera moves and Coppola's decision to film using old fashion techniques makes you feel you're watching a film from that time era (I realize this was early 70's, but new wave style and zip zooms had been around for 10 years[?] ).<br/><br/>I'm confident that hundreds of thousands (millions ?) of movie lovers would immerse themselves in a longer UNCUT version that is no longer constrained by theatrical time factors. 7 hours and 15 minutes (not including end credits and no Part III) would be impossible in a theater, but this is the age of home entertainment (still can't beat watching a movie in the theater) that allows freedom AND a stop button (2 or 3 well placed intermissions would be better). That means you're saddled with more footage of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, Robert Duvall, James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire...ect giving us some of the finest performances in their careers. Any complaints about that?? Special mention to all but especially James Caan who lost so much footage to the cutting room floor. During the 2nd act of the Godfather, James Caan and Al Pacino are the stars of the movie as the story flips back and forth between the two; after all Sonny is the heir apparent. To show how instrumental he was to the family by exposing his leadership ability and softer side made what follows that much more shocking.<br/><br/>No, I didn't buy the DVD (I did rent the bonus disc) for these reasons. I'll wait till they reconstruct the saga on a new DVD edition(if rumors are true) but please...no Part III.<br/><br/>(Subtle Spoiler) Note: Never was comfortable when Godfather PART II changed Vito's birthday from April 28,1887 (The Godfather -cemetery monument) to 1892 (from the opening ""In 1901 the godfather was born Vito...he was nine years old!) Marlon Brando's closing scenes led you to believe the 1887 birthdate.<br/><br/>Francis Coppola is an artistic genius, he's never made up his mind to stop tinkering with editing the saga. Even the Godfather Epic 1902-1959 contained only some deleted scene and excised 2 or 3 scenes from the theatrical version. I'm looking forward to THE version where all the scenes are left intact.<br/><br/>The Godfather   10 out of 10 The Godfather PART II   10 out of 10 The Godfather Saga (uncensored)  a  10+"

","If there is one movie that I can say have touched me more than any other I would have to say The Godfather has. It is more than just a movie to me. It is a movie that I will never grow tired of, and will never forget. I enjoy movies like Casino, and Goodfellas, but they can't compare to The Godfather, but to me The Godfather isn't just some mob movie. It is a flawless masterpiece of family and the life of crime. Each actor seems perfect for his role. The Baptism scene is one the greatest scenes in the whole movie. I don't know  how to make this review flashy or stand out, but all I can say is that if you are a movie lover, and are easily touched by movies then you will love The Godfather whether you like Mob movies or not. Just a classic."

"DHMJr","Null","0","2","15 August 1998"," The Godfather-The Greatest Film In Modern Times
","The Godfather-The Greatest Film In Modern Times<br/><br/>There is no other film that embodies the greatness of American film making such as `The Godfather'.  The film communicates many different things on many different levels to the audience.  First and foremost is the importance of family.  The Don has never made any apologies for the life that he leads and did it all for the sake of his family.  It is true that there is no honor among thieves but this is a movie.  For the mere sake of the story, Don Vito Corleone is an honorable man.  His word is bond and he is not a selfish cheat.  Don Vito Corleone's most appealing asset is his relationship with his family.  Although the film starts with Don Vito Corleone's reign as Godfather, the film is focused on the reign of Michael. There are things that I learned in this film and the other two films that I carry with me today.  `Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer' is just one of the things that I think are important from that film.  `Never hate your enemies for it clogs your judgment' is another.<br/><br/>The film shows that even the best made plans can go off course.  Don Vito never planned that life for Michael.  Without telling too much of the picture I can say once again it is the greatest film that I have ever seen and I have seen a great number.  Gone with the Wind is an epic and as all time period pieces go, it does make us think about when times were different.  I never could relate to GWTW.  Living in Atlanta it is forced upon you but still does not quite cut it.  It is much different than Star Wars because it appeals to a more earthly and realistic side of movies. Sci-Fi is a favorite of mine but this does not compare.  Good overtakes evil in the Star Wars saga and in the Godfather films we are always cheering on the bad guys.  They pay for their sins in triplicate, but still they would never change the lives that they lead.<br/><br/>Finally, the film is ageless.  I still get the same rush from the movie that I did when I was first old enough to comprehend the true dynamics of the story so many years ago.  We will always have corruption, murder, and power brokering in the underworld and it will in many cases be intertwined with certain political figures.  Another thing that will remain a constant is the love for family and the undying care a father has for his children.  A father will give the lesson, may it be right or wrong by other's standards, this is who we are, this is what we do, and this is how we do it.<br/><br/>The Godfather will reveal the many different things in the family, but most of all...it is about a father , his sons, and their business.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola did a wonderful job bringing that story to the people.<br/><br/>DHM"

","Possibly my favorite movie, this is an unsurpassed gangster film and well deserving of the universal praise it received.  It scores a 10 in my book, not surprisingly, but I will include what I consider to be some minor flaws. First and foremost, the kindheartedness of Brando's Vito Corleone character is extremely misleading.  I don't believe that any mob boss of that era, or even today, possesses anything but heartless greed for money and power. The viewer is left thinking that Vito is warm and gentle and had no choice but to enter the life of crime to support his family--bulls**t! The sequel (another gem) tries to explain this, but I still don't buy it.  Also, I don't think James Caan was cast well as the hot-headed Sonny.  He looks about as Italian as James Cagney.  His acting is superb, but I think someone like Robert DeNiro (who also auditioned for the role!) would have delivered a far more accurate portrayal.  On that note, it also struck me that Richard Castellano, who plays Clemenza, could have just as convincingly played the Don as Marlon Brando and, perhaps, saved the producers millions. Brando is, of course, phenomenal, but I think it's important to point out that the less recognized co-stars are comparably as talented.  Aside from this, The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece not to be missed."

Marlin Brando's very believable don Corleone was not a hateful character--we do not see him held responsible for any civilian deaths or anyone completely innocent.  You get to like him, despite his less-than-honorable job.<br/><br/>It helps to know a little about the movie before you watch it.  The symbolism is indeed thick here, and knowing such things like oranges=death makes it a more acessible film.  Also, Brando's attention to detail led him to stuff his cheeks with...was it cotton?--well, something, to achieve that ""bulldog look.""  That strict dedication to the character on the actors' part, as well as Copolla's taut directing style and Puzo's terrific story line make The Godfather a worthy recipient of every prize it has earned."

Coppolla's vision will forever be labelled his diffinitive work. The saga which is the Godfather is the greatest story ever told, the characters are authentic and the story is timeless.

Coppola, as always, is given to the grandiose, but here it fits like the proverbial glove, and he guides smoothly from ultimate tension (the ""gun-in-the-toilet"" scene leaves me dry-mouthed in fear even after the umpteenth viewing)to ultimate calm. The score is by now a classic, but like the entirety of this work, never satisfies merely on the memory of what it WAS but always fresh with what it still is.  Overwhelming every time."

","The Godfather is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>It has been criticised in the past for its violence, and I will agree, it isn't a film for children.  But compare its violence to the gross and tasteless violence of many horror movies and you'll see it's there for a reason; a life of crime is a violent one.  Crime, the Mafia, isn't really what this film is about though.  It just provides the situation and events to tell a story about a family. It is the family that really moves you about this film.  It is the love that he has for his family that redeems Vito Corleone.  He does what he does for his family.  The relationship between Vito, his wife and his children is so strong, they would kill for each other. ""The Godfather"" truly is beautiful.  Francis Ford Coppola's style is so unflashy that it is as if he is just photographing the scene.  There are no clever, ""arty"" camera angles.  It just adds to the majesty of the film.

The story of the Corleone family is one that endures. It is less about crime and more about the trials of any normal family.  It casts light on the hypocrisy of the establishment through showing society its own dark underbelly.  The thought that a mafia don is no different than a Senator or President (Kay and Michael's discussion after Michael returns from Sicily and tells Kay he is running the family business), shows how naive society can be and how quick it is to offer blame on people who believe in something as opposed to nothing.

","""The Godfather"" is one of the crossroads one must cross before proclaiming oneself a movie fan and a genuine movie buff.  Francis Ford Coppola's film is probably his most flawless, although it is NOT my favorite Coppola film (that honor belongs to the unmistakably problematic but highly visionary ""Apocalypse Now"").  Still, in the midst of a 90s cinema which seems to re-evalutate itself every five years or so with new computer-generated images and thusly cannot enjoy the same degree of timelessness of several earlier, better movies, ""The Godfather"" will undoubtedly hold its own as one of the most artistic endeavors in the relatively new medium of cinema.<br/><br/>The story has been told many times before: based on Mario Puzo's bestseller, the film examines the aura of the Italian Mafiosi as exemplified through the Corleone family, led by patriarch Vito (Marlon Brando, an Oscar winner in a very professional bit of acting).  WWII-hero Michael (Al Pacino--the real star of the film as well as the real Best Actor of that year) comes home and breaks family tradition at his sister Connie's wedding ceremony not only by wearing his military uniform, but introducing his family to his WASP-ish girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), the epitome of modernistic feminine and Protestant intentions in the Corleone's traditional Catholic--and increasingly outdated--worldview.  The wedding scene is one of the great expositions of cinema, and yet the film lives up to all expectations by dashing us headlong into the Corleone's violent world.  Of course who can forget the severed horse head in the mansion of the luxurious Hollywood producer, the murder of Luca Brasi, ""sleeping with the fishes"", Santino's bloody murder at the toll booth, Brando's death scene, the intercutting between the baptism and the murders, and especially the final scene as the door closes and Kay realizes the deceit her entire life will become? To launch into a detailed discussion of Coppola's masterly filmmaking would take beyond 1000 words, so let me just echo the comments of many when saying ""The Godfather"" is that priceless canoli one should always cherish amidst the decaying corpses of escalating Hollywood trash."
"vbz","10","0","1","20 April 1999"," Most accomplished US film
","This epic of epics, in my wholehearted view, remains to this day America's  most accomplished feature film. Even without understanding the dialogue's nuances or the storyline's elaborate twists, one is still inexorably drawn to the movie, as I found myself to be since the earliest time. What makes it so enormously appealing and deeply satisfying is Copolla's masterful direction. Every frame is constructed in such an ingenious manner, that if taken out of context and hung up on a wall as a painting, it would take up another value, becoming as work of art in and of itself. Indeed, it is tempting to compare the dark indoor compositions (the mise-en-scenes' arrangement especially) to Rembrandt and other Dutch masters, without exaggeration. The staging of each scene is handled with the kind of technical and spiritual balance advocated only in Eastern religions: no extreme close-ups, no jittery or stale camera movements. On a visual level, ""The Godfather"" possesses an ethereal beauty regardless of content. The picture's other aspects reveal an astounding proximity to irrefutable perfection: an immortal original score with at least three distinguished motifs; the superlative acting by all of the Corleone Mafia clan and their enemies; the compelling plot which swiftly unfolds before us through, among other things, the most riveting montage since ""Battleship Potemkin"", no less. Even its minute details are widely quoted today: what comes most easily to mind is the shot-by-shot parody of Brando's botched assassination in '99's ""Analyze This"", and the more obscure slang term : ""to pull a Fredo"", coined  in ""Swingers"" (one of the 90's hippest comedies). Just to decipher the later (decidedly dirty) reference should be a good excuse to watch ""The Godfather"" yet again."

It's not about the crime and the underworld. It's about a family who have the strongest ties to each other and respect each other. It's about family values and issues and who you put first.

"SodaGuy","Null","0","1","11 April 1999"," A truly epic masterpiece that was informative too
","This was a great film in every sense of the word. I loved it because it was so believable and everything that was done was most likely true. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan were excellent. Brando's voice, Pacino's youthful look, Duvall's innocence, and Caan's brutality all drew me in and it never bored me. In only his third film of his long and brilliant film career, I saw Al Pacino's attitude gradually change for the worst. First we see Pacino the war hero, then as he gets into the Corleone family business he becomes a changed man and starts to gain the right to put his two- sense in. I also saw the innocence of a young looking Robert Duvall that I felt compelling and most interesting to watch. Also, the way that all the scenes of violence were orchestrated I could tell it was accurate or Francis Ford Coppola and the rest of his crew spent time researching the accuracy and made it as close to accurate as possible. Everything about this film was disturbing and that is what made it so darn good because it was so true. As great as the Godfather series of movies were it is my opinion that the first Godfather could have stood on its own without making two more parts. By the end of the first part, two family members have died, and one makes a significant climb in power inside the Corleone family; for the answers, you must watch the film. This was a great film and I first saw it in my college film class and since I loved it the first time around I re-rented it. I also plan to rent the following two parts at a later date so I could soak this first part in.  Nine hours of The Godfather is a lot to take in at one time so enjoy this wonderful epic, but over time.

","The Great Contribution to Cinema and American History itself... because, let's face it: If you're not part of any religious or ethnic minority in the good-ol' US-of-A (and we all came from another country; American Indians being the only true Natives), then the Godfather franchise means nothing to you except slickly-packed violence.  <br/><br/>A masterpiece of American filmmaking; less derivative and more seminal than other films previous and since.  <br/><br/>Novelist-screenwriter Mario Puzo and screenwriter/director Francis Ford Coppola care for the characters they wrought here, and the two sequels. Maybe not all of their individual efforts work for us, but they are still products of meticulous filmmaking, and each Godfather film deserves a serious examination in this esthetic sense.<br/><br/>Godfather lays down the groundwork, introducing us to Don Corleone and his sons, each of which have their own tragic destinies.  The Don's youngest son, Michael, prooves to be the wisest and most formidable, and takes over the Family Seat.<br/><br/>Godfather Part II gives us the Don's family history in Sicily, and Michael's transformation into a paranoid 'monster.'<br/><br/>Godfather Part III examines Michael's pain, panic and remorse, for having gone this far (1979) and not having become ""legitimate.""<br/><br/>

"AntiYourFacePhD","Null","0","1","21 March 2002"," A Mafioso Masterpiece!
","The Godfather makes you an offer you can't refuse. The offer is that if you give up 3 hours of your life, you can see one of the greatest, and most thought provoking films of all time! Why? A number of reasons actually...<br/><br/>1) The characters are multi-dimensional. Don Vito Corleone is without a doubt an evil person. He commits murders in cold blood, and sends especially brutal men (Luca Brasi) to do them. But, you wouldn't think so from he manner. He is a kind man, a dignified man, and a religious man who will do whatever he has to for both his families. He almost makes you forget (or want to forget) what his business is.<br/><br/>2) It's obvious that a lot of research was done into this subject. In the 1950's and 60's, there was a mobster named Carlo Gambino who appeared to be a very gentle being, but became one of the most power mob bosses ever! Sound a bit like Corleone? Bugsy Siegel built a gambling paradise called Las Vegas and his name became synonymous with casinos. Moe Greene anyone? Frank Sinatra was an old washed up lounge singer who got a part in ""From Here to Eternity"" through rumored mob connections. Johnny Fontane and ""Ol' Blue Eyes"" have something in common.<br/><br/>3) It's true to the book! After film adaptations that feel the need to change this part of the story, or that part of the story, or even the ending, it's nice to see a movie that actually brings a story into reality. Sure they change this and that, and leave out numerous characters (Jules Segal, Nino Valenti, Jerry Wagner and Kevin Moonan... the two punks who maimed the undertaker's daughter, old consigliere Genco Abbandando {but he does appear in the 2nd one}, Wax Baines the pimp, etc.), and they had to take out certain things to keep the movie from being 5 hours (Like a stomach churning story about Luca Brasi's child.), but most of the story and dialogue was pretty much quoted from the book.<br/><br/>I would recommend that you read the book first then see the movie(s), you won't regret either."

"cjholland","Null","0","2","3 April 2003"," Film Perfection
","When a person asks the question, ""What is your favorite movie?"" I hesitate to answer because it has almost become cliche to name Francis Ford Coppola's epic, ""The Godfather.""  However, to name any other film would be a grave injustice to the majestic perfection that is indeed captured in these three hours of artistic achievement.  Instead of referring to the cliche without explanation, I am quick to point out that which makes this film deserving of such accolades:<br/><br/>1.  Screenplay--Basically the essence of the film rests in the adaptation of Mario Puzo's best selling work of the same name.  Dialogue, scene dissection, etc. all are what truly makes the foundation of the film. <br/><br/>
2.  Acting--How can you go wrong when you have Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and on and on?  The names spill off the credits with wonderment.  Of course, keep in mind these names were not the household names of the day (albeit Brando's) but to look back thirty years ago and see these masters of their craft all working together, it is easy to see the dynamics of the acting and how it automatically makes the script look like a cakewalk to perform.<br/><br/>3.  Direction/Technical Quality--cinematography, editing, sound and the direction of Coppola himself makes this film as ""tight"" as it can be in the timeframe devoted to the first chapter in the saga.  <br/><br/>In sum, 1,000 words cannot even begin to spell out why ""The Godfather"" is my favorite film.  All I can say is that from the first frame until the final, you are left wanting more.  You are satisfied with the character development, the story line but even after three hours, you only become hungry for much, much more.  Thankfully, you can find that ""more"" in the second installment."
"JVe5462530","10","0","1","22 February 2002"," The greatest movie of all time.
","Warning(slight spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>What is perfection? Perfection is, according to my dictionary, perfect condition, faultless quality, highest excellence. These phrases perfectly describe ""The Godfather"". There is truly no greater movie. There is no superfluous scene, plot twist, nothing. Marlon Brando, with the exception of Robert De Niro, is the greatest film actor of all time, and he more than proves why. It's funny how no studio executives wanted him because in the '60s he made some bad movies and killed ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" the way Michael Cimino killed ""Heaven's Gate""....but he was in top form in this film. His character, Vito Corleone, was one who was deeply committed to his family, that was of paramount concern. Sure, the film romanticizes violence, and that in reality is a bad thing, but you just cannot help but love it. Coppola is a genius, and this film more than proves why. Al Pacino is one of the greatest actors ever, and his transformation from naive, innocent young Michael Corleone to ruthless, cold-blooded killer is so subtle you have to watch the film again to see exactly how he did it. The theme song, of course, is unbelievably melodious, Nino Rota is another genius, everything associated with this movie is nothing but genius. God bless Mario Puzo, who passed away a few years ago, for writing the novel. This movie has so many famous quotes it's unbelievable. It's ironic given the serious tone of the film, that I laughed my *** off(don't exactly know what your rules are on the ""posterior"" word) when Clemenza instructed the guy to ""leave the gun"" and ""take the cannolis"". Diane Keaton is very pretty, and an excellent Kay. My only gripe with the film is that Robert De Niro was not in it. Yes, he was in the sequel, and won an Oscar for his performance, but this is in a way superior to Part II and I wished he was a part of this one. I also smiled when Brando smiled when he knew that Michael was going to protect him when he was in the hospital, family. The bond between family that should not be broken. Oscars for best picture, Coppola and Puzo's screenplay and actor Brando(in arguably the greatest acting performance in cinematic history)(rivaling De Niro in ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Raging Bull"", himself in ""On the Waterfront"", Anthony Hopkins in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and Jack Nicholson in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", Meryl Streep in ""Sophie's Choice"") On AFI's 100 Greatest Movies at #3(should be #1).

Funny how he never got a Golden Globe or Oscar for this part but yet it's that character that he is known for most. Francis Ford Coppola got this production perfect down to the smallest detail.

","I have seen many films far more ambitious in their scope and execution, I have seen more than a dozen films that made far more important statements about the world, and I have seen films that moved me far beyond anywhere The Godfather could have moved me.  But can the greatness of this film really be denied by anyone with even a vague knowledge about the filmmaking process? To call this film garbage is idiocy, there is no excuse, anyone who might make such a statement obviously has no clue about movies, even if they try to state otherwise.  Despite the fact that in many ways it glamorizes the criminal life, The Godfather is the peek of excellence in film.  It's a shame that people buy into the gangster formula created by Hollywood, it's a worse shame that people expect it, and when they do not see it they demand it!  This film breaks out of the formula, and it does so shamelessly, but it doesn't do it thoughtlessly.  There are truly excellent ironic statements all throughout the film, it surprises me that some people who claim to have some knowledge about film miss them.  The baptism that Michael Corleone attends is just one example, the shots of the baptism are juxtaposed with intercut shots of brutal killings taking place at approximately the same time, killings that were ordered by Michael as he took over the ""family business"".  It's a very powerful scene, almost revolting, it creates a very definite question mark as to the glamorous nature of the first part of the film.  Once again, this is far from the greatest film, but it's a definite 10 - there is no question about it."

","The reason why I value this movie so high, is because of the brilliant casting of its players. Especially the young and not yet well-known Al Pacino. The director Coppola insisted that Al Pacino would play Micheal while the production company wanted someone else. The great pressure on Al Pacino to proof himself as a worthy actor is perfectly seen during the entire movie.  Its seems that Pacino has a lack of self confidence which fits the exactly the type of character he has to play. In The Godfather 3 you see an entire different Al Pacino. His qualities are already well known and thus there's no need to proof himself anymore.<br/><br/>Also the role played by Duvall as Hagen is beautiful and is really missed in the third part."

"Sisiutil","10","0","1","30 December 2001"," Deserving its regard as one of the best films of all time
","There are so many reasons why this is a great film: unforgettable music (especially that theme that adapts itself to so many different moods), striking cinematography, strong pacing, but first and foremost are the performances. The entire cast shines; no wonder so many of them--mostly unknowns at the time, like Pacino, Duvall, Keaton, and Caan--went on to stellar careers. But two performances stand out: Brando's and Pacino's.<br/><br/>
Don Corleone is, in reality, little more than a well-dressed thug. But Brando infuses the Don with a regal manner: he carries himself like a king and speaks in dignified cadences. He dispenses vengeance and vice, but calls them justice and business. Even that infamous mumbling adds to the effect--it makes everyone (including the audience) lean forward, in respectful silence, to hear this powerful man speak. We should despise Corleone, but Brando's charisma in the role--arguably his best in a remarkable career--wins us over.<br/><br/>It's Pacino, however, who carries the bulk of the film, along with our sympathy. He is, we are led to believe, the hero of the story: when Michael first appears, he's outside in the light, whereas the Don first appeared in a dark, shaded lair. He's in love with a woman from a brighter world (it's no coincidence Diane Keaton's hair was coloured blonde for this movie), and assures her that he's not like the rest of his family. We want the best for him: we hope he'll escape his family's unsavory business.<br/><br/>But gradually, Michael gets drawn into those dark rooms his father inhabits. Pacino masterfully portrays a character who tries to be a hero, who tries to defend or avenge those he loves, but loses himself in the process. By the end of the film, Michael Corleone is positively reptillian--cold-blooded, predatory, calculating, a creature without remorse or morality. He has gained the world but lost his soul. <br/><br/>Normally, we would regard a man like Michael Corleone from afar with a mixture of revulsion and fear. We would think him inhuman, refusing to recognize anything of ourselves in him. But Coppola makes us identify with Michael, sympathize with him. If he's become a monster by the end of the film, we've been forced to recognize that we, too, could become monsters in the right (or wrong) circumstances. We have stared into the abyss, and found that it contains a dark, distorted reflection.<br/><br/>With The Godfather, Coppola et al took rather base source material--a pulp crime novel--and elevated it to the realm of Shakespearean tragedy. This is great story-telling, great movie-making, and great art. 10/10."

"jacob rosen","10","0","1","7 December 2001"," An Icon
","At once an observant homage to crime films of the Thirties and Forties and a loving portrait of an Italian-American family, Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Mario Puzo's superlative novel (Puzo also co-write the script) is an achievement few films can hope to approximate. Coppola, along with his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, and his production designer, Dear Tavoularis, have created a history wholly realized, burnished brown as if a memory that will never completely fade. The world of the Cosa Nostra they present is closed and stuffy which provides an intimacy that generates an extraordinary amount of warmth and a feeling of lives being affected. The cast is flawless: the actors, to a person, inhabit the characters with such understanding and affection that they will be forever associated with them. (Al Pacino as Michael in the trilogy will never be able to match this work elsewhere.) But it is Marlon Brando in the title role that delivers such devastating work that you can only sit and stare in wonderment. Brando has a presence wise beyond his years and his gentle, thoughtful manner is never once betrayed his calculating, violent acts. Every movement, every vocal inflection is detailed and planned but he offers a spontaneity that never reveals technique. Guided by Coppola's abiding dedication to realism, Brando pushes this film to icon status. Not to be missed."

","""The Godfather"" is truly one of THE greatest films in cinema ever.  With the help of possibly one of the greatest casts, Francis Coppola's film is one that should not be missed.  It all involves the rise and near fall of a mafia family.  Many of the young talents have gone to other great roles. Among them are Al Pacino(who steals the whole film), Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and the late John Cazale.  And of course, there's Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone.  He deserved the win for Best Actor, though it might have been a little dumb to refuse the Oscar.  Pacino should have been the real winner for the role of Michael.

The film was as powerful and beautiful full size as you would expect, but what really struck me was the viewer reactions.<br/><br/>Many people in the audience were seeing the film for the first time and a lot of scenes which I remember as being downright chilling or foreboding got laughs.  Granted there are some genuinely funny moments in The Godfather (""Leave the gun, take the cannoli"" ""We don't talk business at the table.""), but there were some laughs at what would be considered some very inappropriate places.<br/><br/>For instance, the infamous horsehead in the bed got some chuckles.  When the scene of the house fades to Don Corleone, it gets an outright belly laugh. I really don't remember this as being funny.  Also, the scene in Sicily where Michael's bodyguard leaves so skittishly, forecasting some bad things happening to Michael's car... outright laughter.<br/><br/>The American viewing audience has changed since 1972.

","As long as movies exist, The Godfather will always be relevant and stand out as one of the all time best.  When most people think of a perfect movie, this one comes to mind, and for good reason. Every single aspect of filmmaking is executed down to the finest detail with flawless results, most notably the violence, which is graphic but never gratuitous. The ensemble acting is arguably the best ever, with every performance being beliveable and memorable. The story of a mafia family trying to survive amidst a crumbling empire is very compelling, but it's much more than a mafia movie. It's a story about family and the importance of staying together.<br/><br/>
Over the years, The Godfather has become nothing less than an American institution, inspiring several imitations as well as parodies and creating many phrases and expressions that have made their way into pop culture. There is something in The Godfather that appeals to everyone and every generation. For this, it will always find favor with the masses and truly remain a timeless classic of cinema."

","The Finest gangster epic of all time . The Godfather set the benchmark for so many mafia films to follow but till now it can not be rivaled for it's excellence in almost every department .Whether it's is the brillant performances , enchanting background score by Nino Rota and of course great direction by Francis Ford Coppola .I had heard of this movie when i was a kid , but with no interest in watching it , but on a sunday night H.B.O.(the indian version ) telecast this movie and i was hooked . Perhaps not knowing how successful this movie was helped , i watched the movie  without knowing it 's background or having read Mario Puzo's bestselling book . Instead i happen to see the Last Don before seeing this movie . The movie haunts you long after u have finished seeing it whether it 's the godfather theme or Marlon Brando and Al Pacino's ground - breaking performances ( who could he lose to at the oscars in the best supporting actor category ? ) .<br/><br/>Until now , there are very few gangster moives that make use of so few expletives , it 's amazing even in the 70's it gives credit to the script for creating an impact without using forceful language. The ideal of the film is what stands out that the youngest son in the family underestimated from day one saves the family when they are close to being destroyed by the other families .Although it's Micheal Corleone who holds centre - stage towards the second half of this movie and the subsequent two sequels .I feel that it 's really vito corleone who is the stand -out character of the series played by both Brando and De Niro (both earning oscars ) . In conclusion , There is no doubt this is the greatest movie of all time , very few can match this movie except for probably it 's sequel PT-II was brillant as well , but still could not match up to it's predecessor .So , there's no doubt that it 's the most watched movie of all time and will continue to be for some time to come . just can't wait to get my hands on the DVD version ."
"Onlyindreams17","10","0","1","5 October 2001"," The greatest landmark on American cinema.
","The Godfather is great. For almost thirty years now audiences have been captivated and intrigued by the Corleone family. And no other mafia movie has ever come as close to being this good. The story is just amazing and the directing by Francis Ford Coppola is nothing less than spectacular. Coppola has taken the concept of organized crime in America, something that was once looked down upon, and has built a cult following around it, with Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as their leading figures. And I don't think any single film has produced as many memorable scenes as The Godfather. Who could ever forget Marlon Brando, as Vito Corleone, buying those oranges on that fateful day? Or James Caan, as Sonny Corleone, getting massacred by the barrage of machine-gun bullets? And lines that will forever be repeated by fans like, ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" The bottom line is that The Godfather has changed the way we look and judge films. It has made cool what is sinful, crime a family value, and dynamic characters the modern-day icons of several generations of storytelling in film. Alongside all the revolutionary pictures of all time, The Godfather earns it place at the very top. Whether it is the #3 greatest film by the American Film Institute, #1 by IMDb, or #2 by me, this movie should very well be agreed by all to be a landmark in American film history."

","This is one of the most eagerly anticipated film series ever (along with Alien Saga, Die Hard etc) and marking Paramount´s greatest DVD effort yet. The First Godfather film involves the epic story of The Corleone Family, where each member is supurbly acted by a superb cast, top notch from the principle parts to the smaller ones. As head of the Corleone family Don Vito (outstanding Marlon Brando) is ambushed and shot and put to hospital, his sons, Michael youngest of them, unwilling heir of the family top spot (Al Pacino), hot head oldest brother Sonny (James Caan), and quiet middle brother Fredo (John Cazale) must take control over the family business while he is gone, and rely on Don Vito´s new consigliere Tom Hagen´s (the always great Robert Duvall) and end the conspiracy bestowed upon them. The story is perfectly vowen, marvelously executed violence scenes. It´s a movie that must be seen by any movie fan, this is as perfect as movies become. No different is The Godfather Part II, even possibly better than the first one, this movie however is longer and is split up as two stories intercutting in parts, one showing the life and rise of younger Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) and the other his son Michael tightening his grip on his family business, alienating his wife kay (Diane Keaton) in the 1950´s. The third and weaker of the Godfather movies but not all that bad, involves middle-aged Michael legititimizing his earlier crime business, while trying to win back his ex wife Kay. However new enemies within and outside the family ultimatelky corrupts the business and resulting in his retirement, as his son in law Vincent (Andy Garcia) ascend as the new Don, with the help of Michael´s hardened sister Connie (Talia Shire). The weakest performances come from George Hamilton as Michael´s new lawyer B.J. and Coppola´s own daughter Sofia as Vincent´s cousin and lover, which isn´t to say Sofia is all bad but doesn´t really have the experience for this pivotal role. The Video transfers aren´t all that top notch showing some grain but never-the-less show flawless detail and color resolution, the audio transfers are deliverd in powerful detail and gives the subwoofer a run for its money. The special features are all good and interests showing good value, Coppola´s commentaries on all three movies is as informative and interesting as they come, commenting on the cast behind the scenes facts, the how´s and why´s, his feeling about the third movie´s pointlessness. The facts are all here, the features as great as can be expected from a highclass trilogy such as this.<br/><br/>Godfather: 5, Godfather 2: 5, Godfather 3: 3"

Marlon Brando is at his best in his Oscar winning role, and Al Pacino delivers a superb performance as one of the most well known characters in movie history.

There's the brutal killing of Sonny, the gunning of Don Vito(Marlon Brando) across from his office, the car bombing of Apollonia, and the opening scene with Amerigo Bonasera(Salvatore Corsitto) telling the Don about how his daughter was beaten brutally.<br/><br/>Though the most incredible scene is the Baptism Sequence.  Word's cannot describe it.

","I am glad to see that it is still #1 on the IMBb.  I just watched ""The Godfather Saga: A Novel for Television"" on American Movie Classics.  It was great except it had to be edited for telivision.  I have just looked up that that theres a ""Godfather Trilogy 1901-1980"" which features ALL THREE films re-edited.  I shall sure want to see that some time.  If you have seen all three films you should surely try to catch the program I just saw on a movie or even network channel and see a very good deal of cut scenes, or better yet you should see the one I just looked up which I have not seen, but surely will.<br/><br/>
The first time, unfortunately, I saw this film was not a very good experience.  I got tired and fell asleep during the half-hour or so. Except I didn't sleep, I struggled to stay awake which is just aggravating.  This, of course, is not the film's fault.  It had been a normal hectic day.  I tried to watch the entire film again the next day, but I found I couldn't get it all in because I had priorities the next day, so I just watched some of the stuff I had struggled with.  I still hadn't gotten any emotion of opinion, really of the film, except for the good directing.<br/><br/>
Finally, probably over two months later, I rented it from my local library along with the second one.  I watched the whole thing straight through and neadless to say, I was amased.  From the great opening scene where Abandando tells of the justice he wants for revenge of what has happened to his daughter to the Sicilian wedding, I was witnessing film greatness.  At the beginning of the film, you know that this is a powerful empire and that the ruler is wiser then ever.  You get glimpses pf the inside aggresiveness. When Sonny goes and finds that the FBI is monitering he he spits down and wrcks apart one of their cameras.  Then out the shake of keeping it together, throws money for the camera at the ground.  What goes on in that office while the wedding preseeds is some of the best diologue put on film. Any two year old who has watched movies or telivision woulld know ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" several years before the film is witnessed.<br/><br/>
With Jack Waltz, a brutal Sicilian way is performed when he finds the gift of his six-hundred thousand dollar horses head in his bed.  Then there's the rejection of Sollozo's narcotics when Luca Brasi is stabbed throught the hand and strangled.  Later a Sicilian message is given of his bullet proof vest with two fishes in it.<br/><br/>
It is obvious that Michael Corleone is having a splendind life.  He's a World War Two hero and he has a girl.  So, it could very well be wondered why did he decide to be the one to do the hits with the upmost volunatry. Because of his compassion for his family who ha had wanted no part of as far as business.  Indeed the job is done nervously, but thoroughly even with only one bullet for Solozzo and waiting a few seconds instead of dong so right when he cam eout like he was instructed to.  When The Don here's news of his beloved son's job, he is disturbed for he truly didn't want him in the business despite ""plans"" he may ahve had for him.<br/><br/>
In Sicily, Michael finds new romance with Appolonia.  He marries her and soon finds himself in danger.  Appolonia is killed by a car bomb planted from Michaels own trusted Fabrisio (A reason wht you should see one of those sagas).  In America, Don Corleone's daughter connie is in jeapordy with her husband.  This jeapordy is the link the enemies use to trigger Sonny.  In one of the most absolutely brilliant scenes ever, he goes to the tollbooth. He notices that the car infront of him is clutching.  As the tendant reaches over to give him his change, he drops it and reaches down as the window shuts.  A line of hitmen with Thompsons then appear in a booth and two others come out of the clutching car.  They burst fire into the car and Sonny is swarmed with bullets.  He makes his way out of the car where he is swambed more.  He lets out a yell.  The firing stops for second.  Then the firing continues untill they fianally stop and one of the men kicks him in the head and they go off leaving the dead Sonny with bunches and bunches and bunches of bullets in him.  It is a fabolously directed scene.  Then there's the aftermath of Vito's ""Look how they massacred my boy.""  This with the favor being returned from the opening scene where the favor is actually sorrowfully doing the best he can to make Sonny look better.<br/><br/>
When Michael returns from Sicily, he takes over as don.  After awhile he goes to Kay and marries her telling her ""His way of things is done.  Even he knows that.  In five years the corlenone family will be completely legitamate.""  In Las Vegas, Fredo has a job for the big-shot Mow Green. When Michael wants to buy his hotel out, Moe refuses with insult and threat. Wehn Fredo critisises his brother for his conduct, Michael responds with ""Fredo you're my brother and I love you, but don't ever take side with anyone against the family again.  Ever.""  This lives out.  Before Vito dies, he tells Michael that the one who comes with the meeting is the traitor. He also expresses his regret for his son's position.  ""I never wanted this for you.""  ""You could have been Senator Corleone.  Governor Corleone. Something.""  The Don dies playing with his grandson.<br/><br/>
At the funeral, who should be the informastion deliverer for the meeting, but Sal Tessio.  While Michael stands as godfather for Connie and Carlo's baby, he orders the hits of the five families.  The sequence has very elegant cuts of preparation and preseeding while interceeding with the holy ceromony.  Clamenza does his work at an elevator, firing two shots with a rifle while others take scare of their prey by locing in a revolving door, busting in and spraying the bed with Thompsons, coming ans shooting in an eye through glasses, and shooting at the bottom of exterior stairs of a building.  When the ceromony is over, Michael goes to Carlo's house and snags for a confesion for Sonny while assuring that his life will be spared. He then goes into a car where Clamenza is in a the backseat with a ""Hello Carlo.""  He then stragles him with him struggling, moving his legs up, breaking through the winsheild as the cars goes forth.  It's as well as everything else in the film, very greatly directed as the shoe gets to the camera.  Then Connie rushes in with her terror and recenment for Michael's action.  When Connie is taken away Kay asks about wether it's true.  After a few entences Michael breaks through with ""ENOUGH!""  Then he calms and says. ""All right.  This one time you can ask me about my affairs.""  When she quietly asks ""Is it true?""  Michael casually responds softly ""No.""  Then there's the great close of Michael being kissed as royalty and Kay watching with the door shuting in front of her, closing her out.<br/><br/>
This film is fabulous and worthy of it's praise.  It's one ofthe few films that is very popolar, but very few people critisize it despite anything. Story, acting, directing, cinemotatography, art/set direction, everything. I have not seen Cavalada, but I am most petrifide that Francis Ford Coppola didn't get the oscar for best dierector.  This is an incredible classic about crime and life that must be seen.  It will always remain, as long as film, a fabulous film."

The period detail is beautiful and atmospheric, the tension between the actors in preparation for the violent conflicts is contagious, and the intensity of the performances pulls the viewer right into the characters' world. It is easy to understand how the characters in THE SOPRANOS fall in love with this film and want to see themselves in it.<br/><br/>Few films are as loyal to its source material as this one, and simultaneously become the stuff of legends. THE GODFATHER has as many casting legends about it as GONE WITH THE WIND, which is appropriate, as this has been called the GWTW of the 70s.<br/><br/>We must give special praise to Francis Ford Coppola for refusing to cave in to studio pressure to cast Ryan O'Neal or Robert Redford as Michael. While that would have brought people to the box office, none of them would want to see this film again and the video version would be in the bargain bin, never to be re-released. Al Pacino IS Michael Corleone; no one else could have done this character nearly as well.<br/><br/>Because this integrity is all but gone, this may be one of the last classics of American film."

The Godfather is possibly the most brilliant film ever put on tape. Oscar winner Marlon Brando is great, but it is Pacino who steals the show in this one.

","The greatest American movie of all time, the Godfather marked a new era of film making much closer to the old studio system style. It was also an early example of a new appraoach to film-making ushered in by new wave of directing talent. Known as the Movie Brats, an including The Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola and the likes of Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese, they were directors emerging through the study of the film medium in the 1960's and here it definitely shows. Coopla brings in a new innovative, stately style and substance to the production.<br/><br/>Coppola takes the classic gangster genre and, complete with an all star cast and a brilliant, perfectly judged and written screenplay, turns the film into an epic work of beauty. Every scene is beautifully and perfectly composed, with the composition owing much to the classic Italian Reniassance era, in particular the of Caravaggio. The dark, warm colours make the film look a painting; a work of art to be more precise. Coppola direction is masterful, evoking classic Hollywood film-making elements, such as the close-up up and shot-reverse-shot, as well as new innovative forms of film-making including tracking shots coupled with the delicate use of sound and precise cross-cutting editing. He is helped by a wonderful script, co-written with Mario Puza, a lush score by Nino Rota and a masterclass in acting from everyone involved, particularly Brando and Pacino. A brilliant, visceral riveting, flawless masterpiece, quite possibly the greatest film ever made.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Francis Ford Coppola achieved perfection on film with this great work. He directs so subtly that he makes it seem simple. But watch the subtleness of the scene outside the hospital when Michael (Al Pacino, at his best) lights the cigarette of Enzo the baker. One quick shot of Michael's hands, and they aren't shaking, and we know that he was born for the family business. The great Marlon Brando ad-libbed the films most important scene, that in the garden with his grandson, as the Don dies in peace, ironic for a man that lived such a violent life. The moody cinematography of Gordon Willis is the best ever caught on film. And the score by Nino Rota (I know the Academy didn't believe it belonged entirely to Rota, but who cares what the Academy thinks?) is a classic. The rest of the cast, which includes Robert Duvall, James Caan, John Cazale, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda, Richard Castellano, Richard Bright, Alex Rocco, Richard Conte, John Marley and Sterling Hayden is in top form. Every film and television show about the mafia since this one has borrowed or outright stolen from this film. It is a story of profound depth, an American tragedy, told in three acts, and this, the first act, is the best. And yet at its root, it is a very simple story, as Don Corleone prepares his children for the lives they will have to live and the world they will have to live in. It can be summed up as family values, mafia style."

"Duck_of_Death23","10","0","1","31 May 2001"," ""I Believe In America.""
","""America has made my fortune."" This is the opening quote to The Godfather and in my opinion, the best movie in American history. And what would America be without it's greatest cinema-piece? It would be a nation lost of entertainment, a nation without a character as undeniable as Marlon Brando's Godfather. Without him, there would be a missing link to every actor in the history of cinema minus the few previous such as Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine from Casablanca. The performance of he convinces anyone that Don Vito Corleone is truly alive. Not only alive in the film,  but alive as an actual person who speaks to us in volumes, a man who's moral guidelines and love for his family make him a respectable role model, even though he is the head of a mafia family. Don Corleone reaches out to all that see this movie and he is instantly respected as a person of honor, one who we know is of high power, yet is more a democrat rather than a fascist like other corrupt crime lords. Sonny, his son is in fact, fascist in a manner of speech and it shows when he must take over the business. Tragically, Michael the youngest son of the Corleone family is molded into the form of ""zero tolerance"" throughout the picture. The film really isn't about the Mafia; it's about family. The most important thing in The Godfather isn't the rise of power or the loss of it, only how much the other people in your life mean to you.<br/><br/>
Many movies inevitably become boring and have scenes that are meant to be remembered but are easily forgettable. The Godfather never becomes boring. It hooks you the minute it begins and keeps you attached. Impressive for nearly a three-hour movie. An undertaker gives a speech to convince Don Corleone to avenge his daughter against the decadent hoods that attempted to rape her. From there on, the movie continues as a sweeping epic. Death strikes many times in this movie; all the moments of this are breathtaking and at many times, heart-wrenching. I sympathize for the many characters in The Godfather that meet with tragedy because they are so lovable. The 1972 classic takes you inside of the crime syndicate; a place I am oddly enough, happy to be. I feel like a member of the Corleone family every time I watch. Prior to viewing, I must admit that this world wasn't my most desired destination. Many parts and lines are memorable in this movie. What's so amazing is that most of them are back to back, which is a trademark of director Francis Ford Coppola. Most of his films achieve continuous scenes, ones that are embedded in our minds forever. For further proof, see Apocalypse Now or The Godfather Part II.<br/><br/>The Godfather is however, better than it's sequel. Even though the second film may have a more powerful and haunting conclusion and may also have more of a meaning, it still doesn't dig as deep into your soul like the original. Why is the first movie better you ask? Because The Godfather is in this one. Not Robert De Niro's version, but Marlon Brando's. To attempt to replace Brando is a ridiculous waste of time. Brando is The Godfather. No one else can compete with that."

","Mario Puzo's ""The Godfather"" is an excellent, epic story in the life of an organized crime family.  Marlon Brando plays Vito Corleone, the head of the family, with such brilliance that we forget ""it is Brando who is portraying Vito!""  As the film progresses, Vito is critically wounded in a mob hit. Eventually, his son, Michael (Al Pacino), assumes control of the family business.  The movie is so authentic in how it relates to the mafia that we, as the viewer, feel as if we are eavesdropping into the lives of a ""real"" mob family.

"Andy C-2","10","0","1","11 April 2001"," A masterpiece in every sense of the word
","In my opinion this is undoubtably one of the best and one my favourite films ever made. What is surprising as anything is that two years it was followed by Part II which is just as good (and then 20 years later and money-grabbing, dull and unnecessary third film). The first time I watched this film, I thought it was very good but overly long. But the second time I watched it, it didn't seem overly long at all, but beautifully detailed and concise - despite being nearly three hours long. I didn't find myself become bored, because the remarkable thing about this film is that almost every line, ever scene adds to the story or unfolding the characters, and their interaction with each other. The acting is believable, the direction is superb, and cinematography excellent.<br/><br/>As well as all this, the film avoids cliches and over-dramatising deaths, but instead shows the Italian culture and strong importance of relations with your family. The differemt characters seem to perfectly gel. Micheal who changes from being relatively uninvolved ('a citizen') to heading the family, Sonny -overly volatile, Fredo - not clever enough (he's more involved in the 2nd film), and Tom - the level headed, sensible lawyer, who doesn't let his emotions run away with him like the others. My only (slight) criticism of the film, is that the Scilly scenes didn't run as smoothly as the rest of the film. Although it was interesting to see where family orginates from (again the 2nd film covers this more), Micheals falling in love and then his newly-weds' death seem a little unrealistic. Well in didn't make as well sense to me in a way.<br/><br/>In summary this is a brilliantly detailed and enjoyable film, if not as 'entertaining' as Armaggedon (supposedly) or other rubbish.  I can see how this film wouldn't be for all tastes, but anyone interested in the more 'classic' style which people remember for years to come, as well as the storyline, this is a MUST see. Also note its a good idea to watch Godfather Part II shortly afterwards, while Part I is still fresh in the mind, as they link together brillantly. 10/10"

","`Do you spend time with your family? Good. Because a man that doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man,' remarked Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando. By reading that quote, one might have thought that Vito was a virtuous and wonderful family man. However, he was the Godfather to the most powerful crime family in New York who dealt with murder every day. Little by little throughout the film, the viewer easily bought into the myth of the mafia: the family togetherness and their rich traditional background. But, director Francis Ford Coppola also exposed the viewer to what actually goes on in the mafia: death, blood, and calculated murders. Coppola used the elements such as camera angles, lighting, editing and dialogue to compare and contrast the myth versus the reality if the mafia in the scenes in the film, which were the events during Connie Corleone's (Talia Shire) wedding, the baptism of her child and the confrontation between Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) and his abusive brother-in-law, Carlo (Gianni Russo). Before the Corleone family lures the viewer in, they should take into consideration what is actually going on. 	<br/><br/>A drastic difference between the reality and the myth of the mafia was blatantly expressed during the scene in which Connie Corleone got married. While everyone gathered around outside for a traditional, family oriented Italian wedding, the inside of their Corleone compound hosted crime negotiations between Don Vito Corleone and various members of his crime family. Outside of the compound, the Corleone family members gathered together to sing traditional Italian songs, wore traditional and classic wedding attire, danced joyously and took the family picture. Meanwhile, indoors, Don Corleone granted favors for the wedding guests, these favors often involving murder. To contrast the two scenes, Coppola implemented them with camera angles. Outdoors, the camera angle represented an onlooker and followed the festivities during the day. This gave a sense of belonging to the audience, and helped them `buy into' the myth of the mafia. Simultaneously, during the negotiations indoors, the camera angle represented Don Corleone's point of view. This made the viewer realize the intensity of the mafia and the importance of the role of the `Godfather' because everyone gathered around Vito and was humbled by his presence. Also, Coppola contrasted the scenes by the use of lighting. For example, outdoors, the lighting was very bright and there were barely any shadows. This created an air of happiness and showed the audience how the family made each other happy. In contrast, indoors, everyone and everything was cast in dark shadows to show the dark underworld of what was actually occurring in the mafia. 	<br/><br/>Another scene that showed a comparison of the myth versus the reality of the mafia was the baptism montage. Coppola ensured that this scene was implemented by using an editing technique called parallel action, in which two scenes are shifted back and forth to compare and contrast. In this example, the parts of the scene undergoing parallel action were when Michael was witnessing his godson's baptism and when the murders of all of the Dons that Michael had planned were being executed. At the baptism, the Corleone's proved their family togetherness and showed their belief in God. Michael even renounced the devil and pledged his allegiance to the church. However, he knew that as he as saying this, the murders he had planned were taking place. The brutal murders obviously showed how fiercely protective the mafia is and also served as irony, considering that Michael was renouncing Satan as people he ordered to die were being slain. In the order that the scenes were placed proved how both aspects of the mafia were considered to be alike in some ways to Michael. For example, the dripping of holy water off the baby's head and the dripping of the blood of the victims and the crying of the baby and the murders blended together to show how they were perceived as being quite mixed up and distorted in the heads of the mafia. 	<br/><br/>Lastly, a scene that contrasts and compares the myth versus the reality of the mafia was the confrontation between Michael and Carlo after his child's baptism. Coppola accomplished this comparison chiefly by the use of dialogue. Michael explained to him how he knew of his beating Connie and his plan to kill Sonny. After Carlo obviously feared for his life, Michael gently explained that he would only banish him off to Las Vegas and that he wasn't allowed to partake in the `family business'. He then said that he would never make his sister a widow, rather kill the father of his godchild. This showed that Michael had family values and prioritized his family over his `family business'. Then, Carlo was escorted to a car, and then strangled. The reality of the mafia, in this case, was that they would deceive anyone to achieve revenge and wouldn't let anyone stand in their way, even their families. 	<br/><br/>I believe that the mafia isn't all about killing and crime. The people involved truly believed that they were doing the best they possibly could to protect their families, even if that meant murdering people along the way. However, I admitted that while watching The Godfather, I bought into the myth of the mafia. I found myself legitimizing the terrible events that Michael had orchestrated because his was trying to carry on his father's legacy and to protect his beloved family. This was a product of Coppola's intent to create almost a `home video' from the Corleone family: the frequent murders were as essential to them as their lavish weddings and their family dinners. So, if a viewer heard the quote, `a man that doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man' might think that Vito Corleone is incredibly enraptured with his family but which one?"
"mga220","9","0","2","25 March 2001"," This classic inferior to GoodFellas.
","The Godfather Part I deserves to be seen for what it is, not what its reputation is or what Part II added to it.  With that in mind, my review: The first 2 hours are rather aimless, shabbily edited to look like a discordant bunch of too-thoughtfully-crafted ""moments"" without a common center.  The actors' portrayals, while very strong throughout the cast, frequently overshadow what they are talking about.  I tend to think that the story is usually the most important and interesting part of films, but here it is put on the backburner by, dare I say, too rich character-development. Actually, is that what it was?  I come away from it without any true understanding of Michael's motivations or concept of morals, or why he chose to totally ignore them in the pursuit of power.  I often felt that Don Corleone himself, who is not in the film as much as one might expect, is also hidden behind his own famous mannerisms and the reputation that goes along with being the Godfather.  Having said that, the last hour, with Michael as the new head of the family, finally gains a focus and becomes interesting.  The cross-cutting of the christening and the murders was perfectly masterful and thrilling.  However, how the film morphed into Michael's story (and how he himself morphed into the cold blooded killer) is rather abrupt and unconvincing, though I am grateful for the change in tone.<br/><br/>Most importantly, it is inferior to GoodFellas, and thus can't even stake a claim as the best film of its genre."

The dialogue borrows heavily from the book, but what source material! From ""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"" to ""Leave the gun; take the cannoli,"" this was inspired stuff. (In fairness, I must admit that Coppola and Puzo took the screenplay for Part II to an even higher level.)<br/><br/>Brando's performance secured his place in movie history. Although his on-screen time is limited, he dominates in every frame that he appears. From a simple whisper (""Where's Michael?"") on his sickbed to the scene where he peers at an aquarium while Michael conducts family business to the final scene in the garden, Brando becomes Vito Corleone and, like Clark Gable in Rhett Butler, is the only actor one can imagine playing the part so well. The transfer of power between Brando and Pacino in the garden, a scene written by Robert Towne (""Chinatown""), ranks with that in the taxicab between Brando and Rod Steiger in ""On the Waterfront"" as the most powerful in American cinema.<br/><br/>What we have is a cinematic masterpiece, pulsating with excitement until the final scene, when Al Neri shuts the study door on Kay in the kitchen _ Coppola here paying homage to the final scene of ""The Searchers,"" as he would do also in the two sequels.<br/><br/>I'm torn between ""The Godfather"" and ""Casablanca"" as my favorite movie.

Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and the rest of the cast has brought to life one of the most acclaimed film of all time.  The popularity of this film is not surprising because it contains memorable music, moving scenes, thought provoking dialogue/phrases and extraordinary acting by an extraordinary cast.  At the risk of sounding redundant, which in the case of giving thoughts about this movie is a given, it is so much more than what it seems storywise.  If I try to even explain this aspect of the movie, I'd lose myself.

The characters are composites of real men and women in history.  The scenes fictionalize real historical events.  The Don's granting wishes to his neighbors remind you of Marranzano's despotic rule in the early 30's. The shooting in the restaurant mirrors Luciano's assassination of Masseria.

","I remember when I was about 13 when I first watched the Godfather. I turned it off after half an hour. Three years later one of my friends had it on video. At first I was reluctant to watch it, but I became entranced by what I saw. Not only did it contain probably the best ensemble cast I have ever seen(Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Keaton and Shire), but it is also one of the greatest stories in modern cinema. The predominant theme in this film is not violence or power as some might say it is, but family. Without giving the film away, the most moving and evocative parts of the film are when the members of the family are involved. I must admit I have not seen a great deal of Brando's work (Apart from 'Apocalypse Now'), but he deserved an Oscar here, for one of the greatest performances of our time. Caan, as the explosive 'Sonny' should have got 'Best Supporting Actor' too, as well as other magnificent performances by Pacino as Michael, and Duvall as Tom.

","MARIO PUZO'S THE GODFATHER (that is the full name of the film) is haunting, gothic, thought-provoking and an excellent sociological study. On the surface, this is a story about organized crime, loyalty, and family. On the subsurface, Coppola weaves brilliant themes about parallel identities and the profound influence of example. In essence, THE GODFATHER isn't a gangster film; it is too intricate and genuine of a film to be characterized as simply a `gangster film'. Much of the importance of the movie lies in the actual character of the Godfather. Marlon Brando's Godfather seems to represent an individual who is world-weary, but yet, not disillusioned to the point of extending loyalty to others. We look at THE GODFATHER from the standpoint of an individual on the outside looking in. Even though the opening scenes take place in the midst of a wedding, this is a closed society to us. Criminals and cold-blooded killers dance, sing, and play with all the innocence of children. And yet, we want to be close to many of these people once the movie ends. When an undertaker named Amerigo Bonasera asks the Godfather to perform a service for him the patriarch reminds him of the fact that Bonasera never ""wanted his friendship"" and that he couldn't remember the last time he was invited over for a ""cup of coffee"". We may relate to the many times that we, like Don Corleone, extended our friendship and loyalty to others but never got it in return. I know too many people that are more concerned with having someone else do something for them than returning any sort of favor. It's amazing that as powerful of a figure the Godfather is, he also looks at the small acts that characterize friendship. I began to relate to him so much I began to wish that all fathers could retain many of the beautiful characteristics that this man possesses. This is not to deify the character lead of Coppola's film. After all, the Godfather is a criminal. And yet, when he dies in the film, it's as if the World has suffered a great loss. I actually cried during this scene the first time I saw it when I was a kid. It is interesting to note that we are not supposed to respect the criminal organization in this film. After all, the extent to which a person is protected in the Don's extended criminal family is often related to the extent to which a character is willing to shed blood. A good member must be willing to break the law and deny one's friends but never their family. In essence, the movie is filled with paradoxes (not in plot, but in the characters themselves). We see a grandfatherly figure that pulls the strings of a criminal organization. We witness the transformation of the good son to the calculating killer. We see benevolence in many of the supporting characters that are willing to kill. THE GODFATHER is a movie that is more complicated and intricate than people are willing to admit. As a result, at our access is one of the most fascinating character studies."

","Francis Ford Coppola's movie about the Corleone family is the story of the ultimate Hollywood family. Although ""The Godfather"" has lost some of it's original steam. In 1972 the causal treatment of violence was beyond shocking. With films like ""Natural Born Killers,"" ""Goodfellas"" & ""Pulp Fiction"" (any Tarantino film for that matter) savage violence done in an ""every day life"" manner is no longer as shocking. Although there are a few scenes that stand out, even today. When Michael Corleone paid back those gentlemen for the attempted murder of his father. That is one of the greatest scenes in the history of film. And of course the scene were one of Mr. Ed's comrades makes a cameo. The most amazing thing to myself is how much of a family this really is. The Corleone's love each other, and that shines through above everything else in this film. But even with all it's greatness it lasted too long. So this great film just doesn't make the 10 cut for me. 9 (would be 9.8) out of 10."

I didn't see it until about 5 years ago and was mesmerised at the ability of film to translate a tale with such a respect for the characters it is portraying.<br/><br/>I believe Francis Ford Coppolla adapted the screenplay along with the author of the original Godfather.  His young, fresh and hungry talent is the reason we have this film today.<br/><br/>Every element of the film adds to tell the tale of family and loyalty, memorable characters with settings, wardrobe and cultural experiences that I will enjoy forever.   The rich sadness of ""The Godfather"" theme (composed by Coppolla's father) alone brings tears to my eyes.  The Godfather is the result of a truly gifted filmmaker.<br/><br/>In ""the Godfather"" the infallible image of ""Don Corleone"" combined with the performance of a lifetime is horribly disrupted with the multiple attempts on his life.  We see his humanity in the once believed unstoppable Santino Corleone when his own fall takes place.  The growth of character of Michael Corleone is like none other I've ever seen, this innocent school boy, turned in to this cold-blooded killing machine, in the name of ""business.""<br/><br/>
Only in film can we, the audience, sympathise with such heartless killers and admire the strength of Sonny, the honourability of the Godfather, and the resurgence of the new Godfather.<br/><br/>Who knew a bunch of Italians and non-Italians could come together a portray such a glorious image of an Italian family?<br/><br/>And thank God, Francis Ford Copolla stuck to his instincts and prevented Danny Thomas from playing Marlon Brando's part, Burt Reynolds from playing Sonny and Robert Redford(there are blond haired blue eyed italians) from playing Michael.  There's a nobility in the final cast, including his own sister, who plays Connie.  It's a film about loyalty, and family, ""Do you spend time with your family?  Good, because a man who doesn't spend time with his family, can never be a real man.""<br/><br/>And for the length?  A film is to transport you into another world, one that you may or may not be familiar with.  For those of us who suffer from short attention fans, you should not see this film.  Films today are about packing as many violent, sexually explicit images, and colourful special effects,as possible in order to entertain the Attention Deficit Generation.  Thank goodness the Godfather was created before this time and thank god there is a segment of society that is able to enjoy the quality of this film.<br/><br/>I give this film a 10 out of 10, an honor that no film I have ever seen, besides, The Shawshank Redemption, has ever been bestowed by myself."

","Coppola has given us the most wonderful thing anyone associated with film techniques could ask for- the perfect movie. I say this on three points.<br/><br/>1. The Story. Of all of America's past times, gangsters and the Mafia have been two of the most controversial and painful to express. You don't see often in the history books about the ""Five Families.""  In fact, America has not portrayed the power of the crime lords in the late forties until now. Coppola has done something unreal. As ""Some Like it Hot"" was origionally panned because it's fingers touched on the brutality of gangsters and crime a little too much, the Godfather has taken what Some- left in the box. 2. the cast. Brando has never performed as well as now. this should be the highlight and acme of his career. yet he refused his oscar on account of the rights of Native Americans. Pacino delivered a highly riviting, and somehow psychological performance as he stepped into the spotlite. Duval played his game as the perfect partner. Caan portrayed his violent, yet human character so welll, when he was gunned down, i did not know whether to laugh or cry. as for the rest, i only have 1000 words so... 3. the reality if anyone has ever seen the movie ""The Untouchables"" and the amount of blood exposed, you have only seen the beginning. the Mafia were some bad dudes, anyone knows that. but the realisim in this picture is so wonderful. the tension between siblings, the violence and paranoia of a man with his dying father in a hospital he thinks is about to be invaded by gang busters, the murder of the brother in law because he was in the wrong ""family"" it astounds me.

Coppola, despite a shaky career of hits and misses, created a structural story so memorable and unmatched that it must have the three hour length to fully develop into a nuanced story, setting the stage for its successors.  And I challenge anyone to find a more memorable screen performance than Marlon Brando.

","What makes this movie so good?  Just about everything.  Good acting, good direction, good story, good development...it's weird, but this is one of those cases where the sequel makes it better.  Godfather II is the best sequel ever made, and I just don't think you can really say anything about this movie until you've seen that one.  Really, you have to look at the first one as the rise of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), and the second as his fall.  Despite the fact that he doesn't lose power, he loses almost everything else.  You don't really get much character development of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) in this movie, because it's all being saved for the sequel (in the form of Robert De Niro).  The way that the two are intertwined is just absolutely brilliant. As a movie by itself, The Godfather is still a masterpiece.  One of the things that I think makes it so compelling is the blurring of the line between good and evil.  Just about everyone in this movie is a bad guy. But there are good bad guys and bad bad guys, and we're on the outside trying to decide which ones we want to root for.  We end up cheering on the Corleones, the focal point of the movie, but it's very reluctant as the climactic scene unfolds.  I found myself right there with Kay (Diane Keaton) at the end, torn between what I know to be right and what has to be done for survival. I cannot imagine this movie being any better.  It's fascinating, and the sequel does not do anything to diminish that sense of awe.  It's a timeless classic about the battle between good and evil.  But does evil really win out?  It's impossible to tell."

","""The Godfather"" is one of those movies that everyone has heard of, everyone knows scenes of, and is quoted, parodied, and paralleled in everything from major movies to children's cartoons.  There's the raspy voice of Don Corleone, the bloody horse's head in bed, and the actors for which the film defined their careers (Robert Duvall, Al Pacino that make this film).  All of these things make this film a unique addition to American cinema and a classic to remember for years.  The plot follows the trail of the Corleone family for several years after the assassination attempt of the family patriarch, Don Corleone (Marlon Brando).  After the Don is unsuccessfully gunned down by five shots from rival's gang, his son Michael (Al Pacino) is forced to take over through a series of unfortunate events.  One of the beautifully tragic events in this movie is Michael's transition from naive to a mob leader in his father's name.  This movie has it all-action, drama, love, beauty, and politics.  It is a must-see of American Film and a institution for mafia films and will be for years to come."

"witch king","10","0","1","28 October 1998"," A family tragedy
","Most filmgoers who rhapsodize over this wonderful film probably place an inordinate stress on the violence and the politics which connect not only one family, but several, in this sprawling tale of post World War II America. With apologies to those of Italian heritage, I think the tragedy of the Corleones is less a matter of ethnicity than their ruination by blood which is set in motion by two evils: greed and a lust for power. The film is one which sets off the family or clan, [the neighborhood as victim] against the larger, unforgiving American society. The characters are wonderfully realized and splendidly acted. They appear as if drawn to life for the first time. The sinister atmosphere of the film, from its great opening sequence to its frightening close, is a nearly three-hours-long treatise on the disintegration of a family. The Corleones are revealed as equal parts melting kindness and merciless vengeance. The Godfather's turning point is Captain McCloskey's unnecessary assault upon Michael. The meanness of the violent act unhinged the human ideal in the Don's young son. From Michael's understandable love and need to protect his helpless father in an unguarded, creepy hospital emerged his irrevocable decision to cast away any desire to become successful in the eyes of legitimate society. The slow, sure gestation of the plan to assassinate both Captain McCloskey and Virgil Solozzo is one of the major rewards for anyone who loves this film. The seamless transition of Michael Corleone from a patriotic, dutiful, obedient son into a cruelly vengeful and malignant weapon is terrifying portrait. The title of the movie applies to both Don Vito and to Don Michael, with the son slowly eroding the warm and loving family, painstaking built by the father, into a loveless, cheerless collection of individuals adrift on a sea of loneliness and treachery."

"psivaji","Null","0","1","21 June 2000"," An exercise in morality
","The acting, directing, and script of The Godfather was excellent and beyond reproach. I cannot think of another movie (esp. one that was 3 hrs.) that captivated me and kept me glued to the screen from start to finish.<br/><br/>
However, for me the Godfather is an exercise in morality. And by that I do not mean that they are monsters, etc. Although they are no Mahatma Gandhi, they are moral in their own way.<br/><br/>Eg. most other gangster movies portray their characters, even the protagonists as womanizers, heavy drinkers, people who get pleasure out of causing pain to others. In short they are portrayed as deplorable and morally corrupt individuals who abuse their power and use it to rise above society. For example in Goodfellas, the mobsters park wherever they want without fear of getting a ticket, they can play loud music without consequence etc.<br/><br/>Also, if someone were to insult a Goodfella, then they would be killed or severely injured.<br/><br/>However, the Godfather is not so base. The characters (except for Sonny and poss. Fredo) do not indulge themselves in petty vices. You don't see Michael Corleone chasing women, drinking, indulging in violence, etc. And those who do succumb to sensory pleasures come to an unfortunate end. In the end, although Michael is a ""killer"" he only survives because he is disciplined and does not excessively use his power for his own benefit, but only for his family.<br/><br/>Also in the Godfather is a Gandhi like forgiveness. Vito, when his son his killed, says ""I want no acts of vengeance."" Even in part II when he is insulted by the landlord, he is calm. Mike is also calm when he is insulted by others and does not react.<br/><br/>
The killing in the Godfather can be considered as that of a soldier. Killing is not looked down upon currently in western society. Warfare is accepted. People kill animals for food. The west frequently engages in warfare to ""protect"" others. Some even argue that the US never has humanitarian interests in mind when it goes into another far away country, but is only acting to protect its own interests and force its philosophy upon others.<br/><br/>
In this way, the killings committed by the Corleone family pale in comparison to what the government does. And what the govt. does is no secret. It is accepted by the American people!<br/><br/>So according to this line of reasoning, it makes no sense to criticize the Godfather for violence, both on the part of the filmmaker and the characters.<br/><br/>This movie helped me realize, when i was much younger, that real power is not boisterous and loud, and does not assert itself even when provoked. On the contrary, the person who does not react when confronted and insulted by others, holds the trump card and is the real victor. Gandhi knew this. And the fictional Corleone family knew this and that is why they were the best!!!!"
"Marty G","10","0","2","21 June 2000"," Perfection!!!
","This movie is well deserved of its glittering reputation.  It simply blows its would-be contenders of the same genre (ie. Goodfellas, Casino etc.) out of the water.  It is perfect in every way, from the flawless acting to the stunning cinematography.  I think you would be hard pressed to find a Marlon Brando movie, an Al Pacino movie, a James Caan movie, a Robert Duval movie or a Diane Keaton movie where they turn out a better performance.  And I think that the credit for all of this has to go to the films director, Francis Ford Coppola.  And anyone who tries to tell you that this movie is anything less that the greatest single piece of cinema of all time simply does not know what they are talking about (although the Godfather part 2 comes extremely close...).  So I plead with you, please, please, please go out and rent (or even better, BUY!) this film, even if you have read the book (although if you have done that I suspect you will have seen the movie too!) because I guarantee you will fall in love with it."
"neale.apps","Null","0","1","8 June 2000"," Great movie, but because of even better book
","I saw The Godfather at least seven or eight times before I read the original Mario Puzo novel. While the movie reached me on several levels, I never quite understood why. Then I read the book: I was stunned. I don't know the exact contribution Coppola made to the screenplay (both he and Puzo are credited), but in some scenes the actors were reading Puzo's original lines direct. And with good reason: they simply couldn't be bettered.<br/><br/>Clearly, the entire cast had studied the book well; I admired the way they subtly wove in much of the character development explicitly dealt with in the book but (largely) left out of the screenplay: Sonny's warm-heartedness and genuine brotherly love for Michael; Luca Brasi's monstrous reputation; Don Corleone's tendency towards peasant simplicity; and on it goes. I urge those of you who have seen and admired the movie but who have not yet read the book, get hold of a copy; surely no other movie bears quite this relationship to the novel that preceded it."

I have to give it to Gordon Willis, he made it look like an epic which it is, the shading, the colors, everything. Mario Puzo is a great storyteller. Coppola is at his finest moments even though his original plans was to make Â‘Apocalypse Now'. He gave all his devotion to this picture and it shows.

Excellent as he is in the role, he still doesn't match the pace and glory of the next generation of Mafia hoods he is tutoring as the role of Don Corleone. The true gem of the bunch is obviously Pacino who controls the screen with a performance that he has never bettered in the 28 years since, but don't forget the arrogant Sonny (James Caan), the in control Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and my personal favorite, the runt of the litter Fredo, expertly executed by the late John Cazale.<br/><br/>All in all a story of love, power and above all, family."

"Joseph_Gillis","10","0","1","22 April 2000"," Cagney at his peak would have been proud to be in this one.
","The gangster film was pretty much the property of Warner Bros during the 1930's. And rightfully so. With their star line-up of Bogart, Edward G., Muni, Raft, O'Brien and the magisterial Cagney , how could they fail?. Public Enemy, the original Scarface, the Roaring 20's, Little Caesar. Even today these films still have a great raw power no matter how certain elements may be dated. And with White Heat Warner proved they could still come up with a truly great gangster film in the late 40's .<br/><br/>But when The Godfather came along in 1972 it blew away all the opposition.<br/><br/>The hype had really gone into overdrive by the time it reached Ireland in the Summer of 1973. Although it was the film you had to see at the time, for boys of my generation, Marlon Brando was yesterday's man.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood was our idol, with the spaghetti Westerns and Dirty Harry.<br/><br/>And, to be honest, the wedding scene, the scene with Brando's pottering around in the garden with his grandson, and the scenes of family banter did seem to me, then, to get in the way of the undoubtedly brilliant set-pieces of violence and pad out the film unnecessarily. Seeing the sequel two years later largely helped me to confirm my original view that the original was more a star vehicle to revive Brando's career and I went along with the perceived opinion that the later film was the masterpiece of the series.<br/><br/>Almost 30 years later, having greatly expanded my vocabulary of World Cinema, The Godfather still ranks in my Top 10 of all time,(and I can't see that ranking will ever change) whereas the sequel, while I admire it as a great film, would be some way short.<br/><br/>What marks the film out as particularly special include many of the features that I found boring as a teenager: the family relationships; the jostling for positions in the family and mafia hierarchy, but especially the carefully plotted change in Michael's character. Has Pacino ever been better? Like Jack Nicholson, he was at his best in his early films, before the fame thing went to his head. And Coppola undoubtedly kept his performance and character on  a tight rein in contrast to Part 2, where there may just have been a touch of caricature.<br/><br/>The great scenes were masterfully directed: the toll-booth assassination; the various violent deaths, Michael's cafe killings; the shocking church murders, but, overall, its the pacing and  development of the film, and Coppola's masterly handling of the actors which will make this one run and run. And I haven't even mentioned Nino Rota's spellbinding music.<br/><br/>Of course Coppola has mostly disappointed since then, (although I will always maintain that Rumble Fish is a minor gem, )one acknowledged masterpiece is more than most directors could even dream about.<br/><br/>Cagney at his peak would have been proud to be in this one. What higher praise can I give it."

","The Golden Era of Hollywood in the late sixties and early seventies produced unbelievable work, but there are a handful of films here that set a different standard for masterpiece. Why The Godfather is at the top of them I do not know, but it definitely reaches out and pulls you in that direction. In its company are perhaps only four pictures: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, 2001, Midnight Cowboy, and Chinatown. The only actor left out of this realm is De Niro, and if you include Taxi Driver, you have to mention Dog Day Afternoon, A  Clockwork Orange, Don't Look Now and Apocalypse Now- all bonafide masterpieces, but missing something in the breath of the first five.

","Most say this is the best film in the history of film.  That statement is just about as true as they come.  Some say it's not the best film in the history of film.  That statement is also true, The Godfather II is equally as good and can be considered the best.  Then some say it doesn't even make their top 10.  That statement tells you that that person hasn't seen enough films. Finally there are some that say this film sucks.  Those people are an absolute disgrace to the history of film entirely and shouldn't comment on another film as long as they live. <br/><br/>This film is as flawless as they come.  There is not one thing that can be considered wrong with it.  The directing, superb.  The acting, brilliant. The screenplay, outstanding.  The cinematography, far above it's time.  The film in general, one of the most stunning films ever made.<br/><br/>This isn't a film you can rate on the 10 scale, because it's far above it. For those who haven't seen it, it's a must.  For those who say it's a poor film, like I said previously, they have no taste whatsoever in good films or they just try and get a rise out of just about every other person that hold their copies of the film with pride.  This is The Great American Film in all of it's glory.<br/><br/>******************************"

","Hmmmm... well... I spent some time thinking about what I would write about this movie. First off, I am very disappointed I can´t give this movie a 11. Because you see... it is that good. It is nothing more and nothing less than perfection- if they cut a part of the moive, I would miss it. If they add anything to it, I would discard it. Acting is top-notch. Direction cannot receive comments enough to describe how good it is. The story is one of the best ever. I mean... what more could anyone want?<br/><br/>I am very sad a lot of people that voted for American Beauty made it look like as good as this one. I mean... we cannot compare both movies, can we? If this one drops one rank because of pityful American Beauty, i will be very sad. And I just can imagine anyone giving this one a 1. 7 at least. Not 1 or 2 or 3. People who give ratings like this to a movie such as The Godfaher must only like unimaginative amateur movies such as American Beauty. Sorry I am talking about another movie, but I just can´t imagine The Godfather loosing one rank to American Beauty."

","In my opinion ""The Godfather"" is the best movie ever made.  It is far and away the best conceptualized film from a novel that has been made, even when compared to ""Gone with the Wind""."
"dean keaton","10","0","1","18 February 2000"," a short comment
","It will not take very long: The Godfather is just...THE MOVIE. It's not my favorite movie, it's not the funniest movie I've ever seen or that of which I remember the dialogues as if I had studied them, but there's no single movie since 1972 (and maybe before) that hasn't taken something of it. It's poetry in motion, it's tender, wild, violent...again, it's THE MOVIE."

","Much of my male wisdom and philosophy on life is derived from THE GODFATHER. It is one of the most powerful, poetic, dramatic, stories in history, elevated from pulp to high art by a brilliant ensemble cast, mythical direction and a riveting script.  Brando is forever enshrined by his performance as Don Vito head of the powerful Corleone crime family.  Al Pacino stars in his breakthrough role as the Don's son Michael, who is ironically transplanted from war hero to mafia chief during a pivotal existential murder scene.  It is a comment on the fallibility of the American dream.  How every good boy has the capacity for bad.  Every character resonates with authenticity.   Every subplot relates back to the theme of redemption through dedication to family.  THE GODFATHER above all raises moral questions about how far one should go for their family.  It is a tribute to an age long before organized crime had been washed away by drugs and rock and roll.  When loyalty was ensured through family connections, and the power of the mafia was as strong as the national government.  A film that is truly epic in scope, and all encompassing in wisdom.  A masterpiece."

","What  could I possibly say that has not been said about the Godfather that has not already been said because there has not been a better film. There has been comparable films in my opinion but it is in that elite class. No other movie could excite me thinking about it, like this one, The character studies were amazing, Some of the greatest characters ever. The direction,score was Amazing. Al Pacino secured his place in history thanks to this movie, a Perfect 10, whoever said this movie was bad, I don't see how anyone could respect their opinions about anything."

","Simply put, this movie is the oracle, answer key, the blue print, for all mafia films.  There has never been a better mob movie, and there never will. Goodfellas comes pretty close, but The Godfather and Godfather II are the mold that Goodfellas was made from.<br/><br/>I first saw this film in 1983, 11 years after it was released.  I'd heard about it, but VCRs weren't quite common household items back then.  I had a cinema class in high school, and to view this film, the teachers got us out of all our classes for a day and showed The Godfather on the big screen in the school auditorium.  So I was fortunate to see it for the first time in a crowded theatre on a big screen.<br/><br/>Afterwards, the entire class asked for the movie to be shown again in place of one of the other films we were due to see.  They offered to play it after school in the evening for us instead.  The whole class turned out the second time plus another 100 to 150 tag-alongs.<br/><br/>This movie is full of fantastic performances from top to bottom. To try to convey how great this film is in words is almost silly.  It has to be seen."

","Well, after reading the other comments I can only conclude that I have nothing to add. This is the best movie ever made. I can recite what others have said, but I won't. Thank God he created everybody who has helped making this film. And to the one person on this world, who didn't like it: Sorry for you, you're life won't be complete."
