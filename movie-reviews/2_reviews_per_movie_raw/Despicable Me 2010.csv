","Since Toy Story 3 is in theatres, it's rather knee-jerk to compare Despicable Me to the animation giant. But you shouldn't. Despicable Me doesn't have the heavy, dark tones of the final Toy Story and, therefore, is probably better suited to smaller children. As with the best family films, though, adults will love this story as much - if not more - than their little ones.<br/><br/>And here's why. It is incredibly rare to see a single dad portrayed in such a positive light. While Gru has an admittedly ""bad"" vocation, there are unbelievably sweet moments between him and the three children, probably aided by the juxtaposition of tiny girls to a large, ""bad"" guy.<br/><br/>The nepotistic supporting cast from Saturday Night Live (even Jack McBrayer works for Tina Fey) is fantastic. One pleasant surprise was from Gru's minions: they did not steal the show. Not that they should've- the little yellow guys were funny and entertaining, but one would expect from the previews they would ultimately be the best part of the film... and I'm happy to report that wasn't true.<br/><br/>Despicable Me is LOL funny throughout, warm, goofy, and will not disappoint. I'd say you're a despicable parent if you don't take your kids to see it immediately."

","When one pyramid of Egypt is stolen, the despicable suburban villain Gru feels frustrated since he considers himself the greatest criminal mind ever. However he plans to steal the moon, in the greatest heist of history, with the support of the evil Dr. Nefario and his army of minions. Gru intends to hire a loan in the Bank of Evil (former Lehman Brothers) to build a rocket and steal the shrink weapon to reduce the size of the moon. But the banker Mr. Perkins intends to invest in the young Vector, who actually had stolen the pyramid. When Gru robs the shrink weapon, Vector steals it from him and kept the weapon in his impenetrable fortress that is protected by state of art security system. Gru sees that the orphans Margo, Edith and Agnes from Miss Hattie's Home for Girls have full access to Vector's house to sell cookies. Gru plots a scheme, adopting the three girls to use them to recover the shrink weapon from Vector. But the three little girls change the behavior of Gru and his minions.<br/><br/>""Despicable Me"" is a sort of contemporary version of the Charles Dickens' classic novel ""A Christmas Carol"" and a highly entertaining animation with one of the sweetest villain ever, three adorable little girls and a group of adorable minions. The story is not corny but human, and the jokes with Bill Gates that is the source of inspiration of the nerd Vector and with the investment banking Lehman Brothers Holding Inc. that declared bankruptcy in 2008 and affected the lives of small private investors are witty. In the end, Gru is not the criminal mastermind that he supposed to be. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Meu Malvado Favorito"" (""My Favorite Meanie"")"

","Despicable Me's teasers and trailers seemed to represent a few different movies, and that's reflected by the general segregation of comedy styles that the film begins with. At the film's start, Gru (Steve Carrell) handles the dark comedy, the trio of orphans get the cutesy comedy, and the minions handle the slapstick. As the film progresses, though, these lines begin to blur, building to a strong emotional finale and a satisfyingly complete tale. (This is one of those rare non-Pixar animated films that doesn't seem destined for sequel-dom.)<br/><br/>The tale of rival villains isn't terribly original. Nor is the idea of a villain having his heart melted by adorable children. But the way Despicable Me blends these two ideas is just fantastic. There's humor, action, and heart -- what more could you want from an animated film?<br/><br/>Also notable is the way the star-studded voice cast handles their characters. While there are a ton of big names filling out the roster, most of them use accents which render them familiar but not too much so. It's a different route than many animated films take, and it's refreshing. Julie Andrews and Steve Carrell especially do well at straddling the line between their trademark voices and their characters' accents. The voice that steals the movie, however, is the adorable Elsie Fisher as Agnes. Almost every line gets either a laugh or an ""Aw..."" (On a related note, I love that the orphan girls are named Edith, Margo, and Agnes. I love old names for young people.)<br/><br/>The plot has enough twists and turns to keep things interesting, and the antics of the minions provide a nice side of fun to the proceedings. Also, their reaching contest during the credits is a fun use of 3-D that had the kids in the theater reaching for the screen.<br/><br/>Last year was a banner year for animation, and this year seems to be following suit. How to Train Your Dragon amazed, Toy Story 3 is one of the best animated films of all time, and Despicable Me impresses. A very pleasant surprise."

","First of all, I am real, not one of those big studios planted minions that come to IMDb to talk wonders about their new releases. You can check my history to prove that.<br/><br/>Second of all, to make your time worth, let me tell you what kind of movies I like and/or dislike (you know, to see if my taste is compatible with yours).<br/><br/>Taking into account only what would be considered ""family friendly movies"", Pixar cannot be topped. From Pixar I believe that ""The Incredibles"" is its under appreciated best product, although I have a soft spot for ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Up"" (hey, I agree, ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters Inc."" are awesome!). Their worst effort is without a doubt ""Cars"" (I almost don't even like it), but even that is above a lot of other crap from other studios.<br/><br/>I like the first ""Shrek"", ""Kung-Fu Panda""; found ""9"" and ""Coraline"" a little bit boring (but interesting, both!), and totally dislike ""Shark Tales"", ""Planet 51"", ""Space Monkeys"", ""Surf's Up"", the first ""Madagascar"" (except for the penguins and the king lemur, lol).<br/><br/>In a broader sense, my all time favourite animated movie (although not CGI) is ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"".<br/><br/>Enough of that! With that very well established, let me give you my opinion of this movie.<br/><br/>It is amazing! It is charming without being corny; hilarious without resorting to stupid pop-culture references; exciting without being overly loud.. and the best thing: it plays like a fable.<br/><br/>It is absurd! ... but in a good way. The whole plan is to steal the moon, for crying out loud! How ridiculous could that be? And yet, we are led to root for the evil genius to be able to do just that. The whole thing is so tongue in cheek that you will pee in your pants laughing at the effects of having no moon for a few minutes (it is a quick flash of things, for they are so funny).<br/><br/>The movie is incredibly intelligent. The jokes are dead on and VERY imaginative (for example - and this is not a spoiler - pay attention to how they manage to produce light when Dr. Gru and two of his minions are in a ventilation duct at Vector's fortress - just delightful).<br/><br/>You will fall in love with his minions, and if you have a soft heart, with the three orphan girls.<br/><br/>OH, I almost forgot!! The 3D... this is the best usage of 3D I've seen (excepting ""Avatar"", of course) in a movie. There is a roller coaster ride scene that will literally ""tickle your tummy"" (like my kids said). For the first three seconds it easily compares to the effects found in ""The Simpsons Ride"" at Universal Studios.<br/><br/>The action sequences are thrillingly enhanced by the right amount of 3D, and make sure you STAY while the credits roll on. There are some OBVIOUS usage of 3D on those scenes with very funny results. Actually, here's a hint: sit down and enjoy these scenes while the people in the rows in front of you try to exit the theatre; the point of reference they offer will enhance the 3D in such a cool way that it will seem that they will bump into the staircase and the minions protruding from the screen (I suppose that was the intention of these bonus scenes, and boy they nailed it!) All in all, do yourself a favour and go WATCH it... I am sure I will do it again! <br/><br/>Cheers!<br/><br/>P.S. Be sure to learn a little, tiny bit of Spanish so you can ""get"" one of the jokes... my family was the only one laughing like crazies during that scene.. cheers again!"

","If Warner Brothers and Disney Animation Studios had ever had a baby they might have named it Illumination. The machine behind ""Despicable Me"" takes the wacky bits from old school cartoons and applies 21st century animation technology to produce a hip and well articulated masterpiece. From start to finish, the film was absolutely captivating and sophisticated with an engaging narrative and imaginative characters.<br/><br/>All of the characters were well-voiced, but I found Jason Segal's ""Victor/Vector"" villain particularly inspired. The little yella fellas were uniformly charming and I expect they'll probably have their own aisle in toy stores very soon. Carell's crazy villainy was perfectly tuned, as was Julie Andrews whose new voice adds a delightful note as the Despicable mother. The juvenile vocals brought both sass and sweetness to the story, and Kristen Whiig was smarmy in a distinctly southern way. <br/><br/>The humor is rich, with winks at classic cinema like ""Taxi Driver"", ""Apollo XIII"", and others. The Bank of Evil is staffed by former Lehman brothers execs, and recurring motifs and jokes create a comic continuity that is sustained through the credits. ""Dispicable Me"" was my second choice, but now I'm very happy was running a little late this evening."

","Despicable Me, the new animated from produced by Chris Melandandri, who also produced Ice Age: The Meltdown and Horton Hears A Who, is one of the summer's stand out movies. Steve Carell, Jason Segel, Miranda Cosgrove, and Russell Brand are perfect actors to lead this at times hilarious, at times tear jerking animated tale. Will Arnett, Kristen Wiig, Danny R. McBride, Julie Andrews and Jermain Clement make for a worthy supporting cast.<br/><br/>Gru (voiced by Carell) is a evil genius who only wants to win the affection of his cold-hearted mother (voiced by Andrews), something he has NEVER had. His only friends are Dr. Nefario, a aging scientist (voiced by Brand), and his army of minions (voiced by directors Peiere Coffin and Chris Reneud, and Jermain Clement), Twinky like creatures with both one and two eyes, it varies. <br/><br/>When a mysterious newcomer named Vector (voiced by Segal) steals the Great Pyrimid of Giza, Gru decides to pull off the greatest heist EVER: stealing the moon! Then, three orphan girls, Margo (voiced by Cosgrove), Edith, and Agnes (both voiced by newcomers who names I don't know.) The three of them don't hit it off with Gru instantly, but they see him as the first real parent they've ever had. Gru slowly begins to warm up to the girls, and they're interactions make for some truly heartfelt, and also hilarious moments. Case in point:<br/><br/>Edith: Are these beds old bombs? Gru: Yes. But, they are very old and highly unlikely to blow up. Try not to toss and turn.<br/><br/>Despicable Me pulls off something almost unheard of: a film that is enjoyable for both parents and children that does NOT involve humor centered around bodily functions, or violence. <br/><br/>Final grade: A Plus infinite number of times!"
"boblipton","10","82","122","6 July 2010"," Not an Animated Feature
","DESPICABLE ME is not an animated feature. It is a flat-out feature-length cartoon, a rare bird in the field, and the first really successful one since THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE. If anything, it's better.<br/><br/>Animated features are typically fantasies, taking us to places and stories that cannot be filmed in live action. They can be dramatic, fantastic, inspirational, terrifying, all the range of emotions. Cartoons are different. Cartoons inhabit a universe that is a cross between Krazy Kat and the Keystone Kops. Walk off a cliff and you don't fall until you notice. Fall a thousand yards and hit the ground and you wheeze like an accordion until the next scene, when you're fine. Cartoons are silly.<br/><br/>And this one is very very silly, from Steve Carell's indecisively Eastern European-voiced Grue to Julie's Andrews who, as his mom, sounds like Beaky Buzzard's mother in Bugs Bunny shorts, to the seemingly indistinguishable minions who talk like Chip and Dale on helium -- Grue knows all their names. A modern supervillain has to have people skills.<br/><br/>The gags are all spot on in relevance and impeccably timed. The plot advances at a good clip and even the heartwarming aspects of the plot never descend into mawkishness -- the little girls whom Grue adopts to advance his plan to steal the Moon are endearing but frequently annoying.<br/><br/>I saw the 3-D version and the question arises, should you spend the extra money to see it in 3-D? I don't think so -- but then I am happy looking at stuff in black and white and even silent films. You may get a little more out of the 3-D version, particularly the credit extras. But that's up to you. See it in whatever form you like, but see it."

","What a year it has been for animated films. So far in 2010 we have had three great films from three rival studios. DreamWorks kicked things off with the surprise sleeper hit How to Train Your Dragon and animation juggernaut Pixar countered with the hotly anticipated Toy Story 3. Now Universal's Illumination Entertainment has released the audaciously titled Despicable Me and while it may be the ""worst"" of the trio, it is certainly the most purely entertaining.<br/><br/>The strengths of Despicable Me lie within veins commonly found in animated features, but his entry simply utilizes them extremely effectively. Along with jumping on the 3-D bandwagon (my theatre was screening it in normal dimensions) Despicable Me boasts an impressive voice cast, a ploy first used with Robin Williams way back in the days of traditional days of animation with Aladdin, superbly executed slapstick and what I will call the sidekick factor. Whether cute or wisecracking, you would be hard-pressed to find a film in this medium that does not employ this tactic. Even so called ""art-house"" animated pictures like WALL-E follow the trend (in fact, that particular film contains two such supporting characters) and Despicable Me ups the ante and adopts thousands.<br/><br/>The villainous central character of Gru (voiced my Steve Carell) operates his evil lair with the aid of a multitude of adorable little yellow workers, and along with their ""awwwee"" factor, are the subject of a healthy portion of the aforementioned slapstick. Nestled in between the easy laughs however is ample heart and if you are prone to do so, you may very well shed a tear or two. This warmth is generated by three orphan girls, Margo, Edith and the doe-eyed Agnes, but perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. <br/><br/>All Gru has ever wanted is to be accepted, and what better way to achieve that goal than by resorting to supervillainy. After a fresh- faced rival villain Vector (Jason Segel) outdoes Gru by stealing a pyramid from Egypt, he devises a plan to obtain a shrink-ray from a government testing facility and use that technology to shrink, and then steal the moon. Things do not go according to plan after Vector steals the shrink-ray right out of Gru's spindly clutches. What's a supervillain to do? Devise another plan of course, this time using the three aforementioned orphans to infiltrate Vector's lair by selling cookies. It's all very complicated in writing but works very well on screen.<br/><br/>Steve Carell does an admirable job in the lead voice role, and his Russian accent helps us to forget it is an A-list star nestled behind the animation. Russell Brand gives an unrecognizable performance as Dr. Nefario, the brains behind Gru's operation, and Kristen Wiig is hilarious as the head of the orphanage. The most disappointing is certainly the great Jason Segel whose underwritten character fails him as does his voice. Half of the allure of Segel is his physical presence and that is neutered in a voice-only role. While the physical humour will no doubt please the kids, there is perhaps even more for adults and if a movie is able to make me double over in the isle, then it must be doing something right. With Shrek Forever After being the one misstep for this medium, I look enthusiastically forward to the remainder of the year. What I know for certain is I (and the audience I joined) had an absolute blast with this flick, that is despicable in name only.<br/><br/>Catch all the latest movie news and reviews at http://playeraffinity.com/movies.html"
"dvc5159","6","50","76","9 July 2010"," Very cute and adorable animated film.
","As a reviewer mentioned, this year is set to be a great year of animated films, much like the previous two years. This is proved with Pixar's unmatched (touching wood) winning streak and Dreamworks' surprise turn ""How To Train Your Dragon"", which proceeds to continue the ever- increasing ""golden years"" of computer-animated films. Universal's ""Despicable Me"" is yet another gem in an already quite-heavy bag of diamonds.<br/><br/>With nice direction, the filmmakers were able to combine two quite unoriginal plots into one with ease and without force, and they managed to add wit, charm and smart humor to it as well. Not to mention heart. I have never heard of the filmmakers before, but this is a heck of a debut from two first-time animated film directors. The humor is also not too over the top, yet utterly hilarious and ingenious when they pop up. Most of the jokes had the entire audience rolling in the aisles. The three girls end up being adorable and lovable characters, as per the main character/protagonist/villain, whom you can't help but cheer on and care for, no matter what he does. Steve Carell is spot-on as Gru and he makes the role funnier than it should be, I mean his voice and humorous style is there behind the funny accent. And what Gru plots and does is beyond ridiculous and far too funny to be deemed ""serious"" by any cynic. Some hilarious supporting characters round out the primary cast, most notably Gru's assistant Dr. Nefarious played by Russell Brand, and I could not believe Julie Andrews was Gru's mother, I hardly recognized her voice at all! Jason Segel was hilarious as Gru's vain nemesis Vector. And let's not forget the utterly adorable and hilarious minions and their wacky antics.<br/><br/>Technical wise, the animation is gorgeous, bright and nicely rendered with a deft touch of simplicity to it, causing it to be not too overly glossy and polished. This makes the animation look less artificial and more fluid, and this especially shows when it comes to the practical jokes. The music score is just wonderful and suits the moods of the film as they come along. The 3D is great and used quite a number of times in the movie during many effect-driven scenes, which is very impressive considering the poor up-conversion to 3D of MANY movies of late.<br/><br/>Overall, this animated film is a great fun time for the kids and family to see, and even some teens will get many laughs out of it as well. This is a very adorable film, full of charm and heart, and with a funny and lighthearted storyline, and may the powers that be reward this at the box office, if the mediocre ""Eclipse"" isn't taking all of its viewers already. Looks like Universal's animation days are returning.<br/><br/>Entertainment value: 10/10<br/><br/>Overall: 7.5/10"

","""Now, the rest of the plan is simple. I fly to the moon. I shrink the moon. I grab the moon. I sit on the toilet.""<br/><br/>Any animated movie that was released during 2010 is inevitably going to be compared to Toy Story 3, so let's get that out of the way, first. No, Despicable Me is not ""better"" than Toy Story 3. On an emotional and story-telling level, it's not nearly as profound or involving. But Despicable Me isn't trying to be profound, it's aiming for amusement and entertainment. And on those two fronts, Dreamworks has a definite success on their hands.<br/><br/>My favorite thing about Despicable Me is how humorous it is. This is seriously the funniest animated movie that I've seen in quite a while. It has the expected amount of jokes that will give kids (and older people, too) the giggles, as well as lots of comedy that only the grown-up crowd will appreciate. It's fun to see what will pop up next (keep your eyes open for a particularly amusing reference to a particularly un-amusing scene in The Godfather).<br/><br/>Despicable Me is also a vivid, bright movie that's pleasing to the eye in all the right ways. The character designs are stylized and fun, the soundtrack is a nice change of pace for this kind of film, and the pacing is excellent, with nary a dull stretch. The voice talent is great, but I will admit that most of them were pretty much unrecognizable. I wouldn't have known that Jason Segel, Kristin Wiig, Russell Brand, Julie Andrews, or Will Arnett were even involved, if not for the credits and the fact that I had read about them beforehand. Steve Carell and Jack McBrayer (in a small but hilarious part) are really the only voices that are easily recognizable. That's not a criticism, just an observation. <br/><br/>So yeah, it's pretty clear that I liked this movie a lot. It reminds me most of Monsters, Inc. (a movie I absolutely love) in the way that it combines sweetness and humor in a manner that's never cloying or annoying. Watch it with your kids, watch it with your friends, watch it with your significant other, or watch it by yourself. You'll laugh, you'll cheer, you'll say ""awwww"", and you'll fall in love with Agnes, Edith, and Margo even faster than Gru does."

","I was pretty surprised by the quality of this film. As usual, the animation was stunning, but I digress. What kids' flick isn't on par with the animation now-a-days, aside maybe the few nobodys that no one ever cares for. Disney and Dreamworks are no longer the only real competition. The emotion in the film is definitely its strongest suit, for you'll probably find yourself very touched by these characters by the end of the movie. This makes up for the rather simple story actually, one you probably have seen in some cartoon show somewhere.<br/><br/>The voice acting was pretty on spot, with Steve Carell Russel Brand, and Jason Segal. And for the record this is probably the only production starring Miranda Cosgrove that I actually respect. The only other I have to knit pick about is perhaps the score; not the most stunning I've ever heard, but it holds my attention rather well. So definitely check this film out, because it's worth it."

I recommend that you also watch the end credits, especially if you're viewing the 3D version. Gru isn't a very outgoing person as far as showing affection but as you watch the movie you will understand as to why he is this way. The hyperness of the little girls is pretty accurate as any parent will testify too. There is a scene at the amusement park involving a stuffed unicorn that many parents can probably relate to and wish that they could have delt with it in the same was that Gru did.

","Never one to pass up a good cinematic curmudgeon, maybe I was predisposed to enjoy Universal's ""Despicable Me."" I mean, when it comes to off-brand animated entertainment, ass-kicking Pandas and pet Dragons only take me so far—It wasn't until Russian supervillian Gru (Steve Carell) put his adopted children to bed in the hollowed-out casings of ""probably"" inactive bombshells that I finally felt like the target audience.<br/><br/>Ever since animation studios began better emulating Pixar's secret sauce, they've met with varying degrees of success in combining raw, gooey emotion with their signature lighthearted recipes. ""Despicable Me"" grapples with it, and though it may be one of the most consistent examples yet, it's still about as nuanced a dish as macaroni and cheese — which, fortunately for me, I've never outgrown.<br/><br/>However, of the two conflicting senses of humor at play, there is one I absolutely have outgrown. Rarely has a family film so distinctly set aside its kids' humor from its more mature fare; In ""Despicable Me,"" it's a difference personified. Gru's subterranean lair is crawling with his ""minions,"" little, yellow jellybean-like creatures who make butt jokes and slap each other around. They're cute purely for the sake of being cute (in effect, a sort of artificial cuteness) and anytime they're on screen, the comparable intellect of the rest of the film is suffocated by indecipherable high-pitched chatter and broad gags that make vaudeville look like the Divine Comedy.<br/><br/>The good news is that the minions are never on screen for particularly long, and there are a few laughs to be had at their expense when they become the unfortunate casualties of Gru's experiments. Conversely, most of film's jokes have an avant-garde sensibility that jived better with me; Gru must acquire a loan from the ""Bank of Evil"" in order to fund his diabolical scheme to shrink and steal the moon. Coupled with a ""Spy vs. Spy""-esquire kinetic goofiness, it still averages out to be a fairly funny film.<br/><br/>No surprise, a lot of upper-echelon voice talent is involved, and I remember being impressed months ago at the wall of names that played after the teaser-trailer. Admittedly, I haven't been the biggest fan of Carell's work since he left ""The Daily Show"" back in 2005, but he doesn't distract as Gru. He plays well off of a cast eerily similar to that of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall:"" Jason Segel as his nemesis, Vector (who is, interestingly, another supervillian —""Despicable Me"" doesn't have a hero); Russell Brand as an elderly inventor by the name of Dr. Nefario; Kristin Wiig as the proprietor of the orphanage from which Gru adopts three young girls in a ploy to infiltrate Vector's fortress.<br/><br/>But perhaps most interestingly, ""Despicable Me"" has some of the most easily-missed cameos in the history of animation. Danny McBride plays Gru's neighbor with a line and a half of dialogue, and Jemaine Clement from HBO's ""Flight of the Conchords"" (apparently) voices one of the minions. Other than stacking the deck as an advertising vehicle, it seems pointless to pay such funny people for such inconsequential roles.<br/><br/>But I think their presence signifies, if nothing else, that ""Despicable Me"" is a project worth being attached to. It may fall back on certain cyclical annoying tendencies, catering occasionally to lowest-common-denominator comedy (the avoidance of which even the best emulation of Pixar hasn't managed), but the world of the film is comically rich, and no amount of disposable, annoying minions can wreck that — though not from lack of trying. The heart of the story, Gru coming to begrudgingly love his adopted daughters, may not win any prizes for revolutionary storytelling, but it's well executed and 'cute' in a legitimate way.<br/><br/>As something of an amateur curmudgeon myself, please disregard my smile."
"neil-476","8","5","7","22 October 2010"," The kids will enjoy it, and so will you
","I probably don't need to explain that villainous Gru, annoyed that rival Vector is in the process of outvillaining him, adopts 3 orphan girls as part of a masterplan to regain the ascendancy, only to find that the girls turn him into a softie.<br/><br/>This CGI 3D animated feature is daft, charming, and very funny. It manages to have its cake and eat it, the cake in question being real vs fantasy - Gru lives in a variation of a suburban house, drives his villainmobile around suburban streets and, in many ways, lives a completely conventional life, but he also freeze-rays people in the coffee shop, has an enormous secret laboratory under his house, and is assisted by a host of small yellow non-human minions.<br/><br/>The plot serves two purposes. It is a vehicle on which to hang a number of gags (most of which greatly pleased the young audience in the cinema - there is no question that this movie works very well with its target audience). And it delivers a gently sentimental message in a fairly non-glutinous way.<br/><br/>The visuals are very good. Character design is excellent, especially the girls and the minions. Voice characterisation is solid with, again, the girls and the minions standing out, although Steve Carell's Germanic/Russian Gru is also good fun. The 3D is occasionally effective but mostly irrelevant, although the end credits sequence, where various minions vie with each other to get closest to the camera, is well done and very funny."

Non-Pixar animated studios has finally know how to make a great animated movie.<br/><br/>The story is just simple it's not bad it's just simple that makes the movie feel short and small. But the runtime and scale doesn't matter. The important ingredient of animated movies are the jokes. The jokes were non-stop laughter especially the yellow minions.

","Living up to the advertising buzz DESPICABLE ME is absolutely a hoot. Steve Carell voices Gru, a bumbling egotistical villain with life long plans of stealing the moon. Gru's personal weapons specialist Dr. Nefario(Russell Brand)creates a shrink-ray so the reflective orb can be shrunk and brought back to earth. But as Gru and his diminutive little yellow pill-shaped helpers called Minions can get the rocket assembled and ready for blast off...three little orphans Margo(Miranda Cosgrove), Agnes(Elsie Fisher)and Edith(Dana Gaier)enter his life. The biggest heist in the history of the world is ready to come about and the devious Gru discovers he has a heart with a soft spot.<br/><br/>I will probably never be a Carell fan, but stealing the show are the gibberish spouting Minions. After all they were a huge part of the movie's marketing campaign. Most of their voices were supplied by one Pierre Coffin. Also in support are the voices of: Jason Segel, Will Arnett, Rob Huebel and Chris Renaud. This film is heartwarming as it is humorous."

The lush blending of colors is truly eye-popping; however, the animation isn't necessarily top-notch! I couldn't help but compare the animation to that of Toy Story 3 and feel disappointed! However, the 3D is truly state of the art!

He is helped by his loyal legion of (VERY adorable) minions who are the main generators of laughs through-out the film! The film-maker found a brilliant way to make the audience fall for the evil master-mind; imposing upon him the task of taking care of the 3 orphans.<br/><br/>Some jokes are a big success, while others are tired out gags that fall flat on their faces. Their isn't much focus on plot here, but , let's cut tot the chase, the only people who know how to mix plot with great emotional core is Pixar! (It goes without saying, anyways). In other words, don't walk into the theater expecting a masterpiece.)<br/><br/>Several people have enjoyed this film - including me- but I didn't find anything here worth of excessive praise. A kid sitting next to me kept on jumping in his seat,laughing hysterically; he truly enjoyed it and was captivated by it.

","'Despicable Me (2010)' is one of the most passive cinematic experiences I've had in a long time, with the franchise bleeding into itself to the point where it's genuinely difficult to tell which of the various 'bits' come from which of the three films. It's this lack of engagement that kills any real enjoyment, let alone emotional attachment, that could be found here. On the positive side, there are a few jokes that successfully land even though the humour is generally quite broad. There's also something to be said for the relatively believable and complete central character arc. Plus, the feature is generally well-made, even though it looks cheaper than most animated fare from the time. Some things are still just off, though, like how the feature struggles to establish spatial orientation or how the primary relationship wildly fluctuates from scene to scene, almost to the point where it feels like some sequences have been shifted retroactively. This is frustrating and makes it hard to become invested in its evolution, and the evolution of the relationship really is the cornerstone of the entire piece. Additionally, you can't forget that this is the feature that birthed the endlessly annoying pop-culture phenomenon that are the 'minions', so perhaps it can't be forgiven for that. 5/10"

","I'm a girl who loves kids movies. Especially recently. They have been done very well, so that adults (such as myself) can be thoroughly entertained. I take no children, just my close friends and we giggle like we are five years old again. <br/><br/>When I first saw a preview for Despicable Me, I was very on the fence... it looked like it could be borderline stupid, and I am very poor so I don't take a gamble on movies that look even borderline stupid to me. However, more previews came out and, like the rest of the world, I became obsessed over the cute yellow minions, and checked it out further. Upon seeing several of my favorite's among the voice talents of the movie, it became my mission to see this movie, ASAP. I found out that my town had a midnight showing of it, and me and my oh-so-giggly best friend went to see it. If you are anything like me, it will make you snort with laughter, aww at the cuteness, and even cry- out of laughter, happiness, and sadness. Steve Carell does a FANTASTIC job voicing Gru. The character goes through an apparent transformation because of the three little girls. Jason Segel's voice makes for a wonderful nerdy villain. Russel Brand plays an entirely different type of character than normal (of course I am basing his ""normal"" on Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him To The Greek, in which he plays the same character, so there's not much to compare him to...) and it works for him.<br/><br/>As for the animation, this movie is DEFINITELY worthy of paying the extra 3D fee... I get mad when I pay more to see a movie in 3D and then there is hardly any out-of-the-screen action. Gru's nose, for one, is ALWAYS popping out of the frame when he is facing the audience. Arms pop out, faces, the tip of the rocket was out so far that my friend and I actually reached up to touch it. Absolutely fantastic 3D animation.<br/><br/>And if you have the capability, you should really download the Best Buy Movie Mode app for your iPhone or Android phone... the end credits feature the minions speaking incomprehensibly... but the app translates for you and there are some definitely quotable lines. My friend and I were the only ones cracking up during it because we were the only ones looking at it.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a fantastic movie. Definitely worth seeing. Twilight watch out, because your #1 Box Office Status is going away after this weekend... I can tell..."
"jgeorge4","5","21","46","18 July 2010"," Pretty Weak
","The problem with animated family fare is the bar is set very high by cable TV. There is a ton of great humorous animated shows out there--Penguins of Madagascar, Phineas and Ferb, Fairly Odd Parents, Dexter's Lab, Powerpuff Girls, SpongeBob...just to name a few. Additionally, Pixar can do no wrong. So when Hollywood invites America's families to drop $40 at the multiplex to watch a cartoon, they'd better bring it strong, and in my opinion, Despicable Me didn't deliver. Yes, it was mildly entertaining and the audience seemed to enjoy it, but overall it just kind of bored me. Like so many movies nowadays, it seems like we've already seen every funny bit in the previews. What bothered me the most however is absolutely EVERYTHING in this movie seems to be derived from something else or is a cheap imitation. Dr Gru talks like the kid from Dexters Lab and looks like Monty Burns. His nemesis looks like Dexter's nemesis Mandark. The minions all sound like Wall-E. So bottom line, you and your family won't storm out of the theater and demand your money back, but you would probably find more innovative animated humor at home on your TV."
"FilmFanatic03","7","7","12","16 October 2010"," Good...(not brilliant)...but very good :D
","I love the concept of this film, how the viewpoint is of the villain and that conflict and battle of the egos' for the best villain title. But i think the film really kicked in when we are introduced to the cutest little orphan girls: Margo, Edith and Agnes (Agnes being the youngest and cutest) I loved the character development of Gru, who turns from failed villain to loving father and big softie. But sadly this film kept being interrupted by silly characters such as Vector (who just simply wasn't funny) and Dr. Nefario who was just a British idiot. But then when we are brought back to Gru's storyline which simply make the film what it is. So it did feel inconsistent, the storyline of Gru and the little kids is the best and i guess you can cope with the in between bits. Of course it's not as good as a PIXAR animation: because it didn't have that emotional depth as PIXAR does (it was emotional and sweet but thats it, nothing more) and a PIXAR film feels right and feels so nurtured by a group of enthusiastic artists and animators but this felt like just a good film. But putting that aside this is no doubt an enjoyable film, of course the little minions were cute, and there was some great character development in this film so i would say it's a good watch."

It was so refreshing to not have to sit through potty humor, fart jokes (there was only one) and double entendres that everyone hopes will sail over the kiddies' heads.

","Despicable Me is a wonderfully enjoyable yet totally forgettable animated feature from Universal Pictures that follows an eerie criminal mastermind as he works to become the greatest, most despicable villain in the world. The film, starring the voice of Steve Carell as Gru, a criminal intent on executing the largest heist in the history of the world, is often funny, always entertaining, but unfortunately much more forgettable than the animated films it goes against (see Toy Story 3 and How to Train Your Dragon). Regardless, for young kids or an adult audience alike, it provides enough wonderful visuals and comedy to keep you fully competent for it's fast paced 95-minute run time.<br/><br/>Despicable Me opens and ends with Gru, an awkward individual dressed in all black with a pointy nose, bald head, skinny legs, and fat body. He, much like the other characters in the film, features characteristics that we don't often see in animated features. No one necessarily looks human, but in the age when apparently we're able to build shrink rays, spaceships, and squid launchers, who knows what mankind will look in the making.<br/><br/>When Gru meets Vector, the criminal most famous for stealing a pyramid in Egypt, the film immediately becomes a competition of criminal minds, a battle for the bigger idea, and a race to outwit the other individual. It's only when Gru adopts three young girls, originally planned as bait to outwit is sympathetic suitor, that the film goes from funny and action oriented to sappy and heartwarming.<br/><br/>There's absolutely nothing bad about Despicable Me from a film-making standpoint. I was very much impressed by the visuals, the design, and the overall flow of the script. I guess the reason the film was somewhat forgettable for me, is the fact that it was such a lighthearted piece of entertainment, with characters that exited my head just as easy as they entered into it. With films like Toy Story 3, we're brought back to our childhood with toys, muppets, and mascots that we remember from our yesteryears. With How to Train Your Dragon, we're transferred into a world of magical, mystical dragons. With Despicable Me, we're still in the States, but the inventions we're capable of coming up with are just a bit more complex.<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend Despicable Me for what it is, a lighthearted, funny, fantastic looking animated feature. Is it the best animated feature I've seen? No. But in the age of the Alpha & Omega's and the Alvin and the Chipmunks, trust me, you could do a whole lot worse.<br/><br/>Michael Buffa Editor, Popcorn Jury http://www.popcornjury.com"
"MovieManPat","8","5","8","10 July 2010"," A most enjoyable film
","The second half of the summer movie season is now in full swing and I couldn't be happier. The first half of this summer has been downright infuriating with half-baked sequels and unnecessary 80s TV show adaptations that only serve to prove Hollywood is out of ideas. It seems the last vestige of original stories lies in animated films. At least, that is what this summer has shown me, as the best film so far has been Pixar's Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>Enter Despicable Me, film studio Universal's first foray into CG animation. They do a damn good job their first time out. What could've been clichéd and pandering is instead a charming, touching kid's film that should appeal to adults as well. Steve Carell voices the character Gru, the villain of the movie. There is no hero, however. Gru is not the antagonist, but rather, the villain we are meant to root for, as he is being challenged by a young upstart, Vector (voiced by Jason Segel). After Vector steals the Great Pyramid of Giza, Gru needs to one-up him to maintain his status as baddest villain of them all. He announces he will steal the moon. Unable to procure the much-needed shrink ray from Vector's fortress, Gru adopts three orphan girls to use as a distraction. Of course, the three girls are just as cute as buttons. Will they melt his heart? Despicable Me deals with some pretty mature themes for some entertainment directed towards the 6-10 year old set. Gru has a disapproving mother (voiced by Julie Andrews, in a great bit of casting against type) who (as we learn in flashbacks) was very emotional distant during his childhood. The movie also brings up the downside of growing older. Gru has tried many schemes, most of which has failed. The new villain on the block is suddenly a much more attractive option for the Bank of Evil (formerly known as Lehman Brothers, a great little wink to the adult audience), leaving Gru out in the cold. The orphans are not without their own issues, either. They are forced to sell cookies for the orphanage they live in, which is run by an uncaring woman, more interested in sales quotas than the children she is charged with guarding. It's all pretty heavy stuff, though the story deals with it in a very lighthearted manner.<br/><br/>This being a kid's film, the three girls work their way into Gru's heart and we see the guy open up a little. Most of this transition takes place at an amusement park. This particular sequence is one of the highlights of the film, showing us the transition gradually and in a rather original way. It was actually quite moving.<br/><br/>The movie throws in some great visual references to the movies that inspired it. Gru's megalomaniacal scheme echo some of the best Bond villain schemes. Gru himself looks like an animated version of the Bond villain Blofeld, right down to the indistinct Eastern European accent. I also saw some visual similarities between Gry and The Penguin, particularly the one Danny DeVito played in 1992's Batman Returns. Both have the long curved nose and while The Penguin in that film had an army of, uh, penguins at his disposal, Gru has a loyal following of minions, cute little yellow creatures that obey his every command. These little guys provide a lot of the comic relief, thanks to their gibberish language, and though they are in almost every scene, they do not overstay their welcome. Chances are these yellow guys will be getting their own film soon enough.<br/><br/>The film is being shown in 3-D. In this case, the filmmakers use the technology effectively, which is a welcome change to most other 3-D movies that have been released this summer. Unlike films like The Last Airbender, Despicable Me makes sure we notice the depth of field with some great set pieces throughout the movie and some very amusing gags during the end credits. There's a part where Gru and the girls are riding a roller-coaster where the 3-D added a thrilling dimension to the viewing. It was much more compelling than watching CGI globes of water being hurled around the screen.<br/><br/>There is not much I can say that is negative about Despicable Me. The film is formulaic, following a blueprint that is almost as old cinema itself. The Vector character gets just a little grating as the film moves forward. It's also hard to believe a guy who makes guns that fire various aquatic life is in any way threatening or fiendishly clever. But maybe I'm being picky.<br/><br/>Despicable Me is great family entertainment. While it is not quite Toy Story 3, it does offer a great, original story that doesn't pander to the audience, no matter what age. Indeed, I saw the movie at a 10:10 showing, where there was not a child under 16 to be found and almost every seat was filled. It kept everyone is stitches. If this movie is any indication as to what we can expect for the rest of the summer, things look promising.<br/><br/>http://tinyurl.com/2eglbmc"

","I heard that this movie was very good, and after seeing seeing it myself, I have to say I heartily concur. While not my favourite film of the year, and the film never tries to be that, Despicable Me is cute and wonderfully inventive. While it could have been a little longer, what made Despicable Me work was a number of things. The animation for starters is stunning, I liked the colours and character designs but it was the backgrounds and retro-futurist design that blew me away, while the gadgetry is ingenious.<br/><br/>The music fits very well with the film and is memorable without being overly ambitious or simplistic, the story is ceaselessly inventive and fast paced with a surprisingly clever subplot about the importance of family. The characters also add a lot, Gru is wonderfully zany especially and I found it impossible not to fall in love with his minions, they are so cute. But my favourite assets of Despicable Me are the humour and the voice cast. The writing is just excellent, it was so funny and incredibly smart without feeling too much, while the voice work is exemplary especially from Steve Carell whose brilliant vocals add a lot to the film's success.<br/><br/>Overall, a truly great film with a lot to like. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"MartinHafer","8","4","6","30 November 2010"," Despite being rather predictable, I had a great time watching this film.
","I should note that I did NOT see this film in 3-D but at a non-3-D equipped theater. I am not sure that this impacted my viewing experience very much as most 3-D films I have seen really didn't benefit much from this technology--the most notable exception being ""How To Train Your Dragon""--a film that fully utilized 3-D and was amazing to see in all its glory.<br/><br/>I should also point out that I knew exactly where this film was going long before it got there--and I am sure most adult viewers and kids probably felt the same way. Heck, just by watching the preview for the film a few months back, I knew exactly where the film would go. But despite being a formulaic film where the big curmudgeon has his heart melted by some adorable orphans, I still had a wonderful time watching the movie. Why? Because it did something that many family movies forget--it was fun!! And, on top of that, it was super-cute--but not in a cloying manner. Unless you are Genghis Khan, you WILL find the countless little yellow minions to be completely adorable and funny--a real high point for the film. Heck, a couple months before the film was released, I was at Universal Studios in Florida and just HAD to have my picture taken with one of these characters as it roamed the park--it was just so freaking cute! And, I even liked the adorable little orphans--something I usually hate in films. They had a good balance between cute, sassy and endearing.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a wonderful 3-D movie because parents can enjoy it. I loved the characters and thought the French animators did a terrific job--with artistry that stacks up very well against the older and more established CGI studios, Pixar and Dreamworks. A pleasant treat that won't change your life...but who cares if it's so entertaining?! <br/><br/>By the way, the plot for this film sure looks a lot like ""Megamind"" that was released just a few weeks later. I have yet to see ""Megamind"" and plan on doing so soon, so I'll update this review to reflect which of the two films I preferred. I just can't imagine how ""Megamind"" could be that much better!"

","I consider a family film geared towards an audience of all ages (ie Toy Story, Dragon) and I think children's films like Nanny McPhee and CareBears the Movie do nothing but entertain the youngsters while we older folk sit and watch mindlessly - but perhaps chuckle occasionally. That is what Despicable Me is: a children's film. I loved the previews and thought it would be hysterical (It's Steve Carell!) but I was disappointed. Ever since the first preview with the pyramids, I expected greatness. Not so. But it was not bad. Just... okay. It's decent. There are funny bits as the minions do nothing but slapstick, saving the day in the process... And the cute little girl everyone is raving about? Slightly annoying at times. She's is THAT kind of cute. I kinda liked Edith who had a flair of dark comedy in her. It is worth a matinée ticket.

Shrek 4, not so much. Then comes Toy Story 3, the latest adventure with Buzz and Woody. While it was great to see them back on the big screen, I wasn't as impressed with the third film as many critics and fans of the series were, and I feel that the inevitable fourth Toy Story film should go back to basics and focus on the central characters like Buzz and Woody again.<br/><br/>Which leads me to Despicable Me. Now, like most other people, the trailers really didn't interest me at all. It was only after my young daughter had heard from her classmates how great the film was to watch and how much that children had really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>So, I took my family to see this film, and man, I really enjoyed it! Steve Carrell's Gru is the first animated anti-hero that I really enjoyed watching. Where Toy Story 3 was filled with many mean spirited characters that actually frightened many small children (I heard many children screaming at times.) Despicable Me was definitely more light hearted. Was Despicable Me a better written movie than Toy Story 3? No. But was it more enjoyable? Yes, I would have to say so. I enjoyed the light hearted spirit of the film, rather than the dark tone of the latest Pixar film and the minons easily steal the film.<br/><br/>I can see Despicable Me become a series of animated hits for Universal and with great word of mouth spreading, I think that the filmmakers have made one winner of a great animated film. Despicable Me was far better than the last Shrek film, and more enjoyable than the latest Toy Story film for me and my family.

This dubious distinction seems to be slipping out of Gru's grasp, as most recently the Great Pyramid of Giza has been pilfered by upstart Vector (Jason Segel), a nebbishy young guy in a jumpsuit which — like everything he owns — is embellished with a giant letter ""V"". Gru determines to top this feat by upping the ante and stealing  the Moon!<br/><br/>To do this, however, he needs financing, so he returns to the place which has always backed his fiendish endeavors in the past, the Bank of Evil and its pompous but imposing director, Mr. Perkins (Will Arnett). Unbeknownst to Gru, however, Perkins is Vector's father and is secretly rigging the game so that his boy will prevail in the end.<br/><br/>The oi in the flyntment comes in the most innocuous form, as 3 little orphans from Miss Hattie's School for Girls — responsible oldest sister Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Geier), and unicornphile Agnes (Elsie Fisher) — appear at Vector's front door selling cookies. Vector effusively welcomes them (since he just loves coconutties), and Gru, hiding in the bushes doing recon, hatches a scheme to infiltrate his rival's headquarters. He adopts the girls, then sneaks robot cookies into the order his new wards deliver to Vector.<br/><br/>At this point, true to his villainous nature, he figures the girls have outlived their usefulness and tries to get rid of them. But they're really adorable, and they inveigle him into a carnival where he becomes incensed at one of the rigged games; grossly overreacts; wins the big stuffed animal for the little girls; earns their admiration, gratitude, hugs, and devotion; and loses his heart. He soon finds himself dithering over competing entries for May 26 in his appointment calendar: Swan Lake (the girls are taking ballet) or Steal the Moon.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Nefario grows increasingly exasperated at his boss's loss of focus. His own reputation is on the line, too. Unfortunately, his hearing is starting to fail him, and he's been turning out noogie robots and fart guns instead of cookie robots and dart guns. And the whole movie is like that, basically a joke a minute, almost all of them winners.<br/><br/>This is an immensely good-natured film, with a plethora of visual gags and the occasional bone tossed to the adults (like the subtitle ""formerly Lehman Brothers"" under the Bank of Evil logo).<br/><br/>Despicable Me is also completely shallow. Everything is on the surface. There's not even as much character development as in, say, How To Train Your Dragon (another animated kid flick that had a more serious bent to it). But it never pretends to more. It's a chuckle-delivery vehicle, and it performs completely up to its design specs.<br/><br/>My only serious complaint was that Hans Zimmer's score featured too much loud, pervasive drum banging in the early going, but fortunately he stopped after awhile.<br/><br/>Story by Sergio Pablos, screenplay by Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul, direction by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud. Bravo! More, please."
"moviemanMA","7","5","9","14 July 2010"," It's so cute you might die
","Despicable Me is the latest animated film in what appears to be an endless assault of 3D cinema. Luckily for us this movie actually does a fairly decent job of utilizing the 3D technology in creating a pleasant looking and functional 3D landscape. Here we follow a master villain named Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) who aims to become the worlds most notorious super villain. Along with the help of Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) and a host of little, yellow creatures known as the ""minions"" (though Gru knows each one by name), Gru finally gets his shot when he attempts to steal the moon. The only problem is he doesn't have the weapon needed or the money. Not to mention he is being out-hustled by Vector (Jason Segel), a young, upstart of a villain with more money and one big heist already under his belt.<br/><br/>In order for his plan to succeed, Gru requires the help of three orphan girls, which he adopts, and misleads them into helping his evil cause. What appears to be a simple plan turns out to be disaster and ultimately leads to Gru connecting with the girls and distracting him from his master plan.<br/><br/>There's a point during this movie where I just gave up analyzing the story and how it makes sense and just sat there and watched, taking each joke one line at a time and then moving on to the next one. It kind of worked. The story and the logic doesn't really matter, like where the minions come from, why Gru became a villain, or why he doesn't try to go after something easier.<br/><br/>The crowd favorite was without a doubt Agnes, the youngest of the orphan girls that Gru adopts. She looks like a bobble head doll with puppy dog eyes and an obsession with unicorns. She is the punchline in just about every scene she is in, but that works. As far as moving the story along, she does nothing to that effect. To be quite honest there really only needs to be one girl, but having three personalities gives us some variety. Even though there could probably be a solution that doesn't involve using the girls, it is necessary for the girls to try and change Gru into a better person.<br/><br/>In regard to the voice acting, this is a pretty solid performance all around. Carell does a pretty decent job while the others almost go out of their way to not sound like their real selves, which is refreshing. Unlike Dreamworks films which is basically just hiring big name stars to talk into a microphone with some feeling, just some. Brand does a nice job as well as Segel, but I was very surprised to see others like Will Arnett, Kristin Wiig, and out of left field...Julie Andrews! All of which did a sufficient job.<br/><br/>After looking past overwhelming cutesy nature of the film, this is actually a pretty well made film. I would absolutely recommend seeing this in 3D. The 3D isn't as fluid as Avatar, but nothing will be for a while (except maybe Toy Story 3, but that's a different story entirely). The characters are so disproportionate in all physical areas, which can be amusing, but after a while you don't even notice. The big winner here is the depth. I feel like every time I talk about 3D movies this is my number one concern, but it helps so much. It makes an average scene look great and a great scene look spectacular. There are examples of both in this film. Some parts had hints of genius, only to be followed by a slap of cuteness that almost ruins the moment. Almost.<br/><br/>This is just a fun film that kids and adults can go see together and not sit in agony. I would fork up the money for the 3D if you can to really give you the full experience (especially during the end credits). I wouldn't go too out of my way to see this one, but I wouldn't avoid it either."
"Queer_As_Brian_Kinney","10","5","9","11 July 2010"," Despicable were the ones who didn't find this movie hilarious!!!
","I went to see this movie just yesterday with one of my best friends. I was actually surprised at how empty the theater was (we got great seats, to say the least), especially since it only came out the other day. I guess people were just out seeing that God forsaken teen flick ""Eclipse"". Well boy were they missing out! My friend and I sat through an hour and a half (I think) of funny comments, changing hearts, and confusing (but impressive) accents. When I say the accents were confusing, I simply meant GRU'S accent. Was it French, Russian, or German? I couldn't tell, but I have to say that it annoys me more now than it did while I was watching the movie. I would suspect this is because...well, because it was a great movie! I found myself thinking time and time again that Gru was not meant to be an evil genius! No, he was destined for something else, something fatherly. And this is exactly what happens. Without those three little orphan girls (Margo, Edith, and Agnes), there would have been no (interesting) storyline. Gru would never have gotten the shrink ray, he never would have had his heart stolen by those adorable little girls, he never would have developed as a character. That being said, I find it suffice to say that the despicable people were the ones whose hearts didn't warm at the sight of the little girls, were the ones who found this movie a waste of time and money, and were the ones who didn't find this movie hilarious!"
"dslowen","3","14","35","15 August 2010"," Eh... yawn...
","This movie had potential to be a great film. The idea of a villain taking care of three little girls, surrounded by bug-eyed minions, while trying to steal the moon, seemed like it would be worth a few laughs. Sadly, it wasn't. <br/><br/>What's with all the praises?<br/><br/>Most of the scenes were only to show of the 3D, so the overall film was bland. Any time the movie came close to conveying real emotion or care for the characters it jumped to a new scene. It was disappointing, I wanted to care about the characters, but couldn't. I was excited when they began to show Gru's back story, but all we got were snippets, nothing substantial that fully explained his relationship with his mother, his notions of parenting, or turn to villainy. His fascination with the moon was barely touched upon, and could have helped support the film. Giving Gru some ray guns, gray clothes, and thick accent does not make him a villain, unless we know why he became a villain in the first place.<br/><br/>The movie was overall bland. The jokes fell flat. Perhaps little children who have yet to develop a sense of humor beyond burps and farts enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The voice work of Steve Carell was great, but the random addition of Julie Andrews, who in my opinion is a great voice talent, was a pointless waste of talent, seeing as how she couldn't have had more than three lines.<br/><br/>I will say one thing positive about this film, I really enjoyed the music."

","This week the heat exceeded 90 degrees until today -- when we've had rain -- so my grandchildren whom I watch during the day have been inside. As a reward for good behavior, on Wednesday we planned that we'd go to the movie theater today to see Despicable Me in 2D.<br/><br/>On the ride home, Brandon, 10, said, ""The previews were funny. The movie wasn't."" Then Sophia, who's 7, piped up and asked, ""Wait. What did we just do?"" After Brandon and I looked at each other, I replied, ""Saw Despicable Me."" To which she replied, ""Oh, yeah."" <br/><br/>Steve Carell's Mr. Gru voice characterization was memorable and I was looking forward to hearing Russell Brand's comedic delivery. However, there was no character with an English accent, so it wasn't until the credits ran that I discovered he was the voice of an unfunny Dr. Nefario.<br/><br/>Humor? ""The Evil Bank (formerly Lehman Brothers)"" The roller coaster scene would have been fantastic to have seen in 3D. It was still enjoyable in 2D.<br/><br/>Who laughed? The elderly woman sitting behind us. Rarely anyone else. If it hadn't been 11:00 AM, I would have easily (and gladly) taken a 90-minute nap. As it was, I had to sit quietly waiting for the end. That said, it could have been worse: It could have been a 91-minute movie."
"merrywood","10","6","12","16 July 2010"," The best animated feature thus far for 2010.
","DESPICABLE ME has toppled the two giants, Pixar and DreamWorks Animation in this animated feature that is far above this year's animated feature products as we enter the mid-summer releases. Those of us who are grown-ups can forgive the predictable story since we know that we are not the primary audience for this film. Animated features are still made for children although the art form itself has long hungered after adult fare. It is quite capable of being applied to adult stories although very few Hollywood suits have yet to grasp that concept. The one exception that quickly comes to mind was the Ralph Bakshi animated films. Unfortunately, his work was illiterate and vulgar.<br/><br/>Designed beautifully and with whimsical cleverness the characters are matched by superior writing. Although the scenes borrow concept humor from the once great Warner Bros. animation teams, the best-known being ""Termite Terrace,"" the presentation is continuously funny, whimsical and entertaining. Steve Carell does his usually fine comic dialog--- as Gru, the villain that we know we will grow to love. Fortunately, for those who are very familiar with this fine comic voice, he masks it with an odd European accent that sometimes sounds like Bela Lugosi on steroids.<br/><br/>This brings to mind having to sit through three Toy Story movies (thus far) and having to fight the image of Tom Hanks every time the character, Woody, would speak. Walt Disney was, of course, correct when he cast Adriana Caselotti as Snow White instead of the ""A"" listed movie singers of the time because he wanted his audience not to have to go through that painful exercise. No doubt, greedy agents have sold modern animation producers a bill of goods but the tots who go to see these films could not care less about the names behind the voices even if they knew who they were, which they do not. Known, ""A"" list voices needlessly pump up budgets for these films.<br/><br/>Above the entire picture is the most amazing fact that DESPICABLE ME comes to us from Universal Animation, which was originally cobbled together from the Sullivan-Bluth efforts and other entities less than ten years ago. Whatever happened to bring this formerly humdrum studio to life let us hope for morewe will certainly look for it."

"blackmambamark","7","6","12","9 July 2010"," Pretty entertaining. But it was missing that WOW! factor.
","How can any other movie company possibly compete with PIXAR and Dreamworks in the animation department? Well, you either get really lucky to get your film funded....or, you get a studio like Universal to shell you out a couple million. And that's exactly what they did with this movie. I like to see something fresh and new in the animation department......well, you always seem to get that with PIXAR, but not so much with Dreamworks. Hopefully this will add a new level of competition in the realm of animation.<br/><br/>Well, i was kind of hoping that this movie would offer something a little different, but instead, it came off just like a mediocre Dreamworks picture. In fact, i actually forgot that this was produced by Universal, and assumed it was a Dreamworks Animation project. Don't get me wrong, the movie kept my attention and was mildly entertaining.........but much like Dreamworks movies, this movie failed in the second act. You know how some animated movies tend to get a little dull and boring in the middle.....yeah, that somewhat happened with this.<br/><br/>Also, the humor was in little doses, and at times, it seemed like they were begging for your laughs. Yes there were some sequences that had you lightly chuckling to yourself, but after a while, the jokes fall a little flat. Yeah the story is a little on the cute side, which is alright with me......but it's emotional level isn't as high as say....PIXAR? Okay, I'm sorry for using so many comparisons to other animation companies. But it's kind of hard not to, when you basically have only 3. So your easily going to compare and contrast.<br/><br/>Bottom Line, yeah, it's pretty entertaining, and has you laughing just a little bit. But it wasn't as good as i was hoping it would be. The kids will love it, maybe even some parents. But it certainly doesn't have that WOW! factor we all expect when we see an animated feature."
"jandersonpwco","8","4","7","20 July 2010"," Pleasantly Surprised!
","Despicable Me was on a double feature at the drive in while we were vacationing in Maine. Our kids had never been to a drive in and we wanted to see Toy Story III, so we figured we would ""sit through"" ""Despicable Me"" in order to get to Toy Story III. Much to our delight, the trailers and ads for this gem did it very little justice. My impression from the commercials was that this was a juvenile and pointless kids cartoon. To the contrary, Despicable Me was funny, poignant and thoroughly enjoyable. It probably falls just a shade behind TSIII - which was on par with I and II - but not by much. The ""voice"" cast was excellent, the animation was great and the story - which is not conveyed at all in the trailers - was fantastic. One of the better animated flicks I have seen in years."
"echozdog","8","4","7","16 July 2010"," Not perfect, but funny
","Despicable Me tells the story of Gru a master villain who just hasn't made a major splash. Some other major villain just did a big job and now he sets his sights even higher. In order to accomplish this he needs something his arch-enemy has and find the only way to get it is to employ 3 little orphans who can get inside his lair by selling cookies.<br/><br/>The movie goes exactly where you think it will and some the jokes fall flat, but at its core is good feeling story of redemption and parental love. There is something for everyone in this. I took my wife and 4 kids (11,8,4 and 4) and everyone loved it. It's not perfect though. Some jokes just were not that funny to me (although a lot of people in the theatre were laughing at them). I also didn't see it in 3D and it looks like it would have been fun to watch in 3D. During the credits they add stuff just for the 3D that is over the top 3D. It looked like that would have been fun.<br/><br/>I recommend it at a 8/10. Kid friendly. Grown up entertaining. Heartwarming. Exciting. Not bad for $5 on a Thursday."

Gru then adopts three little girls from an orphanage so he can use them to trick Vector in order to get the ray back, but before that happens Gru has to look after the girls and over time even the villain's heart starts to melt.

The voice cast is spot on with Will Arnett, Kristen Wiig, Russell Brand and Julie Andrews (who voices Gru's mother) round out the cast, Despicable me is funny and although the animation is not as good as a Pixar movie, it still stands on its own.

"Brandon7221","7","8","18","2 July 2010"," ""Despicable"" mostly for kids
","Right in the center of a normal neighborhood, in normal suburbia, sits  an odd house with a dried out lawn and large spires. Inside is the  secret lair of an ambitious super villain Gru (Steve Carell) and his  army of mischievous minions.  Gru is wallowing in the shadow of a highly publicized heist completed  by a competing super villain named Vector (Jason Segal), so Gru  attempts to raise his game.  Along the way, Gru crosses paths with three orphaned girls who view him  not as a villain, not as cold or uncaring but most importantly, not as  a failure. The orphans see Gru as their savior from the orphanage.  The three girls (Margo, Edith and Agnes) are the key to Gru's  transformation, his master plan and the overall plot of this Universal  answer to ""Shrek 4″ and ""Toy Story 3″ Unfortunately, they are not in  the same class.  First, there is no reason for this to be in 3-D as it offers nothing to  improve the story. The animation as several flaws, dark shadows drag  lines and poorly portrays the emotions of its characters compared to  Pixar's Woody and pals.  Second, this is a child's film first and foremost. There are plenty of  laughs, especially from the minions, but your kids are going to enjoy  this film much more than you.  There are plenty of big names offering their voices: Russell Brand as  Dr. Nefario, Julie Andrews as Gru's Mom and Miranda Cosgrove (iCarly)  is Margo. It was only Steve Carell's Gru that stood out.  Sierra, age 11 said: ""It was great to see a story from the villain's  point of view."" My eight-year-old didn't have a bad thing to say ""I  liked all of it"" and the 5-year-old from our group (not a Jones) loved  it so much that she thought she could go see it again. The teenage son  was much more critical of the animation and was moderate in his praise.  I concur.  ""Despicable Me"" is a good film, not a great one even though it's great  to their target audience:10-year-olds and younger. There are a ton of  great gags, funny lines, but the story is predictable and derivative  lacking the depth and meatiness that audiences have found in the Pixar  films. The trailers have ruined a couple of the better moments, which  is always frustrating. Most important is that the parenting theme is  inferior to great films like ""Up"" or ""Finding Nemo""."
"StevePulaski","5","9","21","15 July 2010"," Despicable When Compared to Toy Story 3
","A.O. Scott, journalist of The New York Times, said ""while there's nothing to hate, there's not much to remember"" about Despicable Me and he's 100% correct. While Best Buy does have a special app for Smartphones and iPhones for this (will state what it does and is at the end) called ""Best Buy Movie Mode"" which is something I can pretty soon seeing all movies have at one point, this film is still just a poor copy of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Surely Universal Pictures did a great job animating it and it really looks like the equivalent to a much more recent (and better) film, Toy Story 3. But still, it has the ability for animation, but it doesn't have the fun and morals that are packed in a Pixar film.<br/><br/>To sum it up, after a pyramid is stolen in Egypt, we are introduced to Gru (Steve Carell) who is the second best super-villain in the world, right behind Vector (Jason Segel), who stole the pyramid. To fight back, Gru then develops a plan to shrink the moon which he believes will make him the best super-villain. After Vector steals his shrink ray which was to make Gru able to shrink the moon to pocket size, he adopts three girls; Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith, and Agnes to sell cookies to Vector for Gru to be able to take his shrink ray back and continue with his plans. Gru is also armed with thousands of yellow one and two eyed minions. They are the cutest and best thing by far about the movie. Though their English is below average and some words you can understand, but most you cannot, which is where the app comes in.<br/><br/>The cute Minions make up the entire film.<br/><br/>Best Buy Movie Mode was created so when you ""enter Movie Mode"" on your phone when directed by the screen itself, your phone will sync the movie and when the credits come your phone will vibrate (no confusion since the app disables your ringer) and it will subtitle what the little yellow fellows are saying. Its kind of cool, and since I was the only one in the entire theater laughing at the screen when everyone just watched trying to understand them, I felt like I knew more than they did (when I did).<br/><br/>Still, it would make more sense if the app buzzed and dubbed what the Minions were saying throughout the movie rather than just at the end. But it was just as equally impressive. I was worried about starting it to early because I thought if I started it during the previews, the phone (which is a Motorola Droid) would think its the beginning and start dubbing when the credits weren't there yet. But the phone syncs it with the film which is almost amazing. Ahh, technology.<br/><br/>But the movie itself, wasn't great. Below good, mediocre is the word. The film is a first degree knockoff of The Grinch and next to nothing is memorable. Ill remember the app (which isn't in the movie, so it doesn't count) and Ill remember the Minions. But the Minions are like the penguins in Madagascar. Their the best part, they deserve their own film, instead you are boring us with a back story and basically shielding the good parts away. At least Madagascar still holds up with jokes and doesn't let the secondary characters put on a one (or one thousand) man show.<br/><br/>Many kids will love this, but when compared to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia 2000, Pinocchio, and most recently Toy Story 3. The film just doesn't do it. Take Toy Story 3. The art in that is not only the animation, but the fun the film has. It takes your imagination on a whole new route reintroducing characters that have grown like us. A.O. Scott says its like ""art and junk"". Which it rightfully is. Besides the great voice work (mainly from Carell and Cosgrove) and good animation, the film is just despicably fair.<br/><br/>With Voice Talents of: Steve Carell, Jason Segel, Russell Brand, Julie Andrews, Will Arnett, Kristen Wiig, Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, and Elsie Fisher. Directed by: Pierre Coffin."

","Despicable Me is a film that is aimed for kids under 10, and indeed gets there. Unfortunately, it only gets there. If you're over 10, then you won't be into it. There's just too many fart and booger jokes and not enough sophisticated humor for adults or even teenagers like myself. Sure, I laughed once or twice and felt some emotion once or twice but you can't depend on one or two laughs and one or two emotional scenes to sustain a whole movie, especially at $10 a ticket. Steve Carrell's funny voice got annoying after a while, but the minions are funny. I mean this film had a lot of potential. This could have been something bloody brilliant and just plain great, but there's simply not enough of that here. The little girls are somewhat of an annoyance and get in the middle of an interesting story of a super villain. The characters are (mostly) 1-Dimensional and rather than not trying enough like most movies, this movie tries too hard and ends up stuffing too much into its own film and becomes the victim of its own clever game. Overall, I can't recommend Despicable Me, it's too overstuffed and boring. There are better kids movies out there for your kids to see, so skip this one and go see Toy Story 3 again."

But it was nice to see Love as the central message of a movie.<br/><br/>Love of a mother for a son, a son for his mother, children for their dad.<br/><br/>And the minions love for ..um.. Grul.<br/><br/>The message is that we sometimes lose track of what is important to us (family) when success gets in the way. And that wanting to please other people (Grul wanting to please his mother) stops us from being whom we were meant to be.<br/><br/>The minions were cute, but felt they could have been used more...<br/><br/>The cast was very good, and while the animation is not up to Pixar quality, the film was always watchable.<br/><br/>Ironically, my theater could only get the 2D version. Somehow, I think this would have been more fun in 3D.<br/><br/>Fun for the whole family - though there is one scene that looks like blood that could scare very young children.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"Jonny_Numb","8","5","10","10 July 2010"," A Fiendish Delight
","Gru (voiced with faux-eastern-Euopean gravitas by Steve Carell) is a nefarious Supervillain in the midst of crisis: a younger nemesis named Vector (voiced by ""Freaks and Geeks"" alum Jason Segel) is stealing his fiendish thunder, his most recent acquisition being a Shrink Ray. In order to engender the good faith necessary in the bank that gives Gru loans to carry out his schemes (even Supervillains aren't immune to the bureaucratic red tape we normal citizens must contend with), he adopts three precocious orphan girls to unwittingly aid in his scheme to steal the moon, a heist so astronomical it will place him back at the top of the Supervillain ladder. That's ""Despicable Me,"" in a nutshell. Yet the film is so richly textured (in both its exquisite animation and storytelling) that it becomes something transcendent of the usual doldrums of summer popcorn fodder. The character arcs are well-executed, the gadgets and gizmos are awesome to behold, and the eventual tenderness that seeps into Gru's dark heart is affecting without being sappy. As for Gru's squeak-uttering, cyclopean yellow ""minions""--they're a riot, adding an extra layer of slapstick humor to the proceedings. With so much overuse and abuse of the 3D medium as of late (with the cynical cash-grabs of ""Clash of the Titans"" and ""The Last Airbender"" being the most high-profile), it is refreshing to see it used so well in ""Despicable Me""--it is a visual feast that helps bring its underlying emotions into even sharper focus."
"tavm","5","8","19","12 July 2010"," Despicable Me was only mildly entertaining as a 3-D computer animated flick
","Unlike the other summer computer animated movies I've seen, Toy Story 3 and, yes, Shrek Forever After, Despicable Me was sort of blah for me. Yes, Steve Carell is pretty amusing as the voice of the leading character and seeing that character in scenes with his minions, those three orphan girls, and some others I won't mention provided some good laughs. And it's also amusing recognizing Julie Andrews as his mother while I couldn't place Kristen Wiig or Jason Segel until after the credits which was a nice surprise for me. And the 3-D effects are awesome as usual. But the story wasn't tight enough and seemed to rely too much on cuteness to provide much comic bite. Not to mention I was fighting sleep during the middle part. So in summation, Despicable Me was mildly entertaining but didn't totally hit it out of the ball park for me like the other two computer animated movies I mentioned at the beginning of this review."
"sarm123","5","3","5","17 September 2014"," I was expecting more
","A lot of recommendations and positive things I've heard about this movie. I must admit that when I started to watch the movie I expected a lot from him. My expectations were too high and that the movie progressed, I realized it's a little overrated. The first thing that I did not like is the plot. The plot was boring and had no way to tell attract attention. It was definitely the biggest minus the movie. Because if the story is bad and can you interested, then this is a big problem. Positive things of movie is animation and minions. The animation is actually done really well and everything looks beautiful. Minions are the brightest point of the film. They are yellow creatures that will always make you smile. I do not know if that's funny their speech or behavior. I really love to see a good animated movie and enjoy them. I enjoyed and with ""Despicalbe Me"" but my to the opinion a bit overrated."
"oneguyrambling","6","3","5","25 April 2011"," Come for the movie, stay for the Minions.
","Despicable Me never seems to aim for any lofty heights, but despite myself I enjoyed it in a very lightweight sort of way.<br/><br/>The film revolves around Gru (Steve Carrell), a character of (I think?) Eastern European origin, who looks like the Critic from Ratatouille – with an extra 40 kgs and an even pointier nose.<br/><br/>Gru is a wannabe supervillain who desperately yearns for notoriety – only in this bold new era of younger and better equipped supervillains performing larger and more evil acts of villainy – it is becoming harder to stand out from the crowd. In fact Gru's last several attempts at major crime have actually resulted in capital losses – something that has damaged his Credit Rating at the local Bank of Evil (I thought after 2008 that was the name for ALL banks?).<br/><br/>Gru doesn't work alone however, he has an evil scientist sidekick named Dr Nefario (Russell Brand) who pops in and out of the story. Nefario is hard of hearing and a bit scatterbrained, but he keeps bringing Gru back to reality and devises new weapons and gadgets to aid his evil schemes.<br/><br/>Gru also has many minions that all look like tennis-ball-coloured overall wearing Twinkies about 2 foot tall. Their number of eyes varies between one and two, and they speak a nonsensical (for the most part) language. They seem perpetually happy and adore Gru and obey his every instruction implicitly. While the rest of the film provides a fair number of chuckles make no mistake, it is the minions that are far and away the funniest characters in Despicable Me.<br/><br/>But what of the plot? Gru decides with the help of his fiendish scientist buddy Dr Nefario that their next project will merely be stealing the Moon itself – what they'll then do with it is never discussed in any detail The problem is to fund the scheme Gru needs money, and the Bank of Evil won't give him money without proof that he has the shrink ray that everyone knows is required to complete the task.<br/><br/>As Gru does not have a shrink ray he steals one, only to have it onstolen by new hotshot on the block, a nerd named Vector who has made his name by stealing world landmarks, Vector looks like the offspring of Bill Gates and McLovin' and constantly wears an awful orange tracksuit. So starts an ongoing battle between the two, Gru repeatedly tries to get into Vector's heavily armed fortress – complete with killer shark! – and repeatedly fails to do so Upon spotting how easily a group of orphan cookie sellers gain entry Gru hatches a devious plot.<br/><br/>I'll fast forward through the next bit but suffice to say Gru decides to adopt these three adorable orphan girls Margo, Edith and Agnes (about 8, 5 and 3 ish respectively) and use them to gain entry. There is a subplot about how the orphanage is being run as something of a money-making sweat shop by a supposedly nice (but really evil) woman named Miss Hattie – but for some reason this is never explored much beyond establishing the premise.<br/><br/>The kids are relieved at being out of the orphanage – and they love playing with the minions – the minions similarly love playing with the kids. Gru himself refuses point blank though to play, or really do anything relating to the kids initially.<br/><br/>Gru firmly believes that true supervillains can't afford the emotional distraction of having a family, so in the early going he deliberately avoids any real contact or discussion with the girls, Dr Nefario in particular resents the girls presence and wants them gone.<br/><br/>But this is a kid's movie, so we know Gru can't really be that evil. While he initially intends simply to use and rid himself of the kids as quickly and easily as possible he finds them growing on him, and even stranger he finds himself – gradually mind you – enjoying their presence more and more and with the launch date of the moon-stealing mission clashing with the girl's scheduled dance recital a decision looms The voice acting is OK but lacks a WOW factor, Brand simply thickens his own accent and Carrell comes across as a ""Gary Oldman as Dracula"" clone, and Segal merely plays Vector as a cocky kid – which is what he is so go ahead Jason. The songs by Pharell are – to be frank – twee, simple and boring – though I think that was supposed to be a big deal as the film keeps showcasing these boring little ditties over montages and key scenes. But that was really the only true negative to a surprisingly funny and entertaining film.<br/><br/>Even though Despicable Me is a totally lightweight and fluffy kid's flick it manages to navigate a fine line between funny and cutesy, the girls are cute and adorable without being saccharine sweet and Gru and Nefario are more naughty than evil or diabolical. The ending to the film is quite well done actually which is a change nowadays when animated films simply stop once they run out of jokes rather than build to a big finale, but as mentioned before it is the Minions that steal the show. Like a funnier Scrat (from the Ice Age films) they bumble and dodder about the place with inane grins jabbering away, each time at least eliciting a smile. Repeat viewings might dull their impact and amusement level, but on first viewing I couldn't help but chuckle at them frequently.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 6 / 10. See it for the plot, stay for the Minions. If you must choose between Megamind and Despicable Me this year, this film wins by a country mile."

","I'm surprised. I,m easy to get along with movies, so i thought i'd like it but it would be horrible from critics and IMDb users.Well, this movie touches your your heart and has the laugh-a-minute comedy that can appeal to anyone.I about died from laughing when the minions went into the grocery store.Which ,in my opinion, are the star of the show.Is this a classic? No. Is it worth a watch? Yes.people can say ""Oh, I don't get the point of that movie.Well,it's to entertain and hysterical,yet with a good message.At the end i wished that there was more of it.I'll probably forget this movie sometime in my life, but it was still worth a watch.<br/><br/>My rating:*********-/10"

","my mother loves animated films and i adore them my self. my mother walked out of this film. I stayed and watched, because i had to see how bad it really was. It was a great cartoon, it would do great with kids and on Saturday morning, but not worth it pass the kids.<br/><br/>If only kids go see this, it will do well, but honestly its not a great animated film, its like Jimmy Neutron that movie won an award for best animated film, even though in the same year final fantasy spirits within came out, and was a better movie Jimmy Neutron won cos it had kid appeal. This movie has Kid appeal, and thats it.<br/><br/>For adults it failed, they might do better making a minions movie."
"Diapertime","3","12","33","18 July 2010"," Shrek meets The Pacifier, UNORIGINAL
","This movie is so bland something had to be said, its no good, it relies on cheap plot devices to try and make the viewer feel emotionally attached to the characters. I can't find one ounce of originality in it. Cute innocent orphans (Annie, 101 Dalmations), a renegade who learns to love (Lilo and Stitch,), Minions who offer comic relief (Wily Wonka and the Chocolate Factory), its all been done before people. Like i said, the plot is basically The Pacifier meets Shrek. Like if they literally worked both plots in the same movie and changed the characters names. Only Shrek had good humor, where a lot of this movie's humor falls flat, i only laughed maybe once or twice at it. The physical humor will be funny to your kids, but the word of mouth jokes are odd and awkward. And i know its meant for little kids, but this movie looks like a TV movie i could watch on Nickelodeon. The animation is good but pretty unimpressive by todays standards. Take your kids to see Toy Story 3 instead, and if they've already seen Toy Story 3, go rent ANY of the other movies i mentioned in this review, people need to stop supporting half brained unoriginality like this. Take your kid to watch a movie that will stimulate their mind, not rot their brain with fart jokes."
"3xHCCH","7","4","8","10 September 2010"," Loved the Touching Parts More
","I watched the 2D version of ""Despicable Me"" with my kids this afternoon. The trailers were not really very good or enticing for me to be excited about it. It was honestly quite a mixed bag for me.<br/><br/>The story involved a super villain named Gru whose status was threatened by a nerdy upstart named Vector, who upped the evil ante by stealing the Great Pyramid of Egypt. (Is it my imagination or is Vector a dig at Bill Gates?) Anyway, to top that heist, Gru plots on stealing the Moon itself. To do that, Gru saw the need to adopt three orphan girls, named Margo, Edith and Agnes, in order to infiltrate Vector's lair. Initially, harsh and compassion-less towards the children, Gru eventually warms up and ends up actually caring for the kids. But can his love for the kids triumph over his obsession to be the top villain in the world? <br/><br/>The initial scenes building up the story was too slow for me. In fact my wife and I both confessed to have dozed off in these parts. However, for me the fun and action begins when Gru went to adopt the girls. I liked the movie the most when it showed heart, and the developing love and sense of fatherhood of Gru towards the kids. Those two bedtime story reading scenes were the highlights of the whole film for me. The whole rivalry thing with Vector was not too good for me, mostly owing to the ""blah"" way Vector was rendered and written.<br/><br/>The comedy could be too rude (like how Gru acted during his interview with Ms. Hattie of the orphanage), or even gruesome (like red stuff coming out of a spiked box when a girl gets caught inside). However, when the movie tones down its hyperactivity and cranks up the human drama, I can't help but be very much touched by these scenes. Gru's scenes with Little Agnes (who positively loved fluffy unicorns!) were all executed to tear-jerking perfection.<br/><br/>The voice acting by Steve Carrell was also instrumental for us to actually root for Gru despite his initial villainy. I was very surprised to see at the end that it was no less than Ms. Julie Andrews who voiced the funny character of Gru's mother. The voices of the three girls, especially the very cute Agnes, were very well rendered. The yellow blob-like Minions of Gru were also portrayed very cutely (but what are they, really?).<br/><br/>Compared to the excellent animated films so far seen this year, which included ""Toy Story 3"" and ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" ""Despicable Me"" falls behind in my opinion. The start may be quite annoying and uninteresting, however investing more time to watch will make this rather brash comedy prove to be a most heart-warming adventure instead."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","6","4","8","18 July 2010"," Cute... nothing more
","When I saw the trailer for Despecible Me, I honestly couldn't wait to see this movie. Ever since I was a little girl, I watched animated movies and it wasn't so much the lead characters that I was interested in as it was the villains. They always seemed to have more life goals going on rather than the hero or princess and had better personalities, not to mention betters songs. So to make a movie about the villain as our leading character was just awesome. What makes them tick, what motivates them and do they ever feel the pressure of keeping up the competition to be feared? So we introduce Dreamwork's new piece: Despecible Me. While I thought the film was going to be great, it didn't live up to my expectations. Not saying that the movie was bad because it did have some really cute moments, that's all it turned out to be: cute. I wanted it to be a little more clever, but I suppose with all the animated films that come out each year, we're spoiled. With Toy Story 3 also being released this summer, I suppose I want more. Because the animation is nothing special and the story was a bit too predictable.<br/><br/>In the middle of a suburban neighborhood sits a black house with a dead lawn, hidden deep beneath this home is the vast secret hideout of the super villain Gru and his army of mischievous little minions. He wants to pull the biggest heist in world history: stealing the moon. Gru tries to get a loan from the local Bank of Evil, where he meets Vector, and finds out that Vector stole an Egyptian Pyramid. Mr. Perkins, the bank president, refuses to give Gru a loan until he obtains the shrink ray for the plan. Vector promptly steals the shrink ray from him; Gru makes several attempts to get it back, but cannot get inside Vector's base. After seeing Margo, Edith, and Agnes, three girls who live at a local orphanage and are selling cookies door-to-door getting inside the base, he adopts them to get to the shrink ray. Gru begins to bond with the three girls and finds something that he's been missing in his heart for a long time.<br/><br/>I did like this movie though, despite some flaws, it was still worth the watch. It's the first half of the movie that really slows it down, but it did pick up. One of my favorite moments of the film was when Gru tries to steal the shrink ray away from him, I could have honestly watched a movie of just that the way they handled that heist. Also one part that killed me was when Gru takes the little girls to the carnival and they can't win a game so Gru takes out his ray gun and just blasts the game away. The story is still very clever, Gru and the little girls were great to watch. Now one character that let me down was Vector, I loved the idea of Gru having competition with this guy, but Jason Segel was not the right voice. I would have preferred a more nerdy voice, maybe even a little Bill Gates, Jason's voice was too deep and didn't seem to fit. Also his father, who is the owner of the evil bank and denies Gru his loan was a little too basic and something that has been seen before. I would say this movie is a matinée price, because while not being a great movie, it was still very cute and worth the watch. I just wanted it to be a bit more clever, but like I said, I'm spoiled, I need Dreamworks to up the bar.<br/><br/>6/10"
"wishalotbear","9","4","8","18 July 2010"," Better than I expected
","(Note that this review was written by a teenage girl, I'm no movie critic.)<br/><br/>When my grandma invited me to go see Despicable Me with my cousin, I hesitantly obliged. From what I had seen, this was just another crappy movie. Walking out, I had a smile on my face, and I knew I was completely wrong about it.<br/><br/>Despicable Me was a story about Gru, a broad shouldered, skinny legged man who wants to be the Worst Villain Ever. Unfortunately, he's not that great at villainy. All he can manage to steal is Las Vegas stuff. (Super valuable, Gru.) And make thousands of little goggled minions.<br/><br/>But then: AN IDEA! Gru can steal. . . THE MOON! Such a wonderful act of awfulness! <br/><br/>It's so awful that you should go see the movie yourself. The rest consists of three orphan girls named Margot, Edith and Agnes (Aren't little girls adorable with old lady names?), dance recitals, an orange- clad (teenager? young adult?) named Victor--ahem. I mean Vector, a few unicorns, and lots of love.<br/><br/>Don't be too doubtful, just go see it. If you hate it, remember not to take my advice again."

","Based on from the trailers, i thought this movie was going to be knee cracker. When i saw this movie.. it made my day really happy. When you see Toy Story 3, it makes you cry and the story is dark. It is better to see this movie after Toy Story 3. The story was kinda stupid but hell, it's an animation. The stealing the moon part was really stupid. Another thing about this is that, there are mixed stories in the movie and there just going on at once. 1. Taking care of the girls. 2. Stealing the moon 3. Vector. You see? there are so many stuff going on at once. But this movie was insanely funny. Especially the yellow minions.

"callumhough97","3","5","11","29 July 2013"," Disappointing
","I watched the movie because of the huge hype about the sequel, Despicable Me 2. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about as this appeared nothing more than a little animated film that would never be heard of again two months after release. So it must be a good film, right? No. It was very dull with a shallow and predictable story. Also, I thought animated films were supposed to be funny. I found myself being forced to laugh at times despite this being (apparently) 'a funny film'. There were a couple of genuine smiles but I can count on one hand the amount of times I nearly laughed. This is just like most animated films, it has a silly story, poor voice acting (at times I thought Steve Carell sounded like Shrek) and just generally average. I don't know why it's so popular. Actually, I have a theory... Them Minions! Everyone loves them because they are cute and funny. No they're not. They're annoying and stupid. It's so blatant that they are an advertising tool to cover up for this poor movie. They are the thing that little kids remember from this movie and that's why it's so popular. It wouldn't surprise me if they had their own movie soon! To sum up then, Despicable Me is just another animated film. The reason people like it might be because of the Minions but I can find no other reason at all."
"jgregg42","7","5","11","9 July 2010"," ""Despicable Me"" – See it with your favorite minions.
","They are never going stop, are they? Kids' movies, that is. Hollywood is going to keep churning them out year after year until one day someone stands up to say, ""I think we have had just about enough pandering to this market. The jokes have been cut, edited, rehashed, and remixed to fit every possible demographic. We have taken the imagery and 3D format to an all-time high. Let this sleeping dog lie for a while and go focus our efforts elsewhere."" I don't see it happening any time soon and I only saw a glimpse of the standard kids' movie formula deviating slightly in ""Despicable Me."" We are introduced to Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), the film's protagonist/ antagonist, right after a major landmark goes missing. The audience is supposed to deduce that Gru has a history of being an evil genius. No real example of his evil doings is given until he delivers a speech to his minions. He makes plans to get back on top after it is reported that another supervillain stole the major landmark. It's all about ego with these supervillains.<br/><br/>Gru has a team of hundreds of little, yellow minions who speak in undecipherable chirps. They work in his laboratory and research facility. He also has a mad scientist, Dr. Nerfario (voiced by Russell Brand) that converts Gru's orders into actual working devices. There is a humorous downfall here. Nerfario doesn't hear the orders so well and the wrong items are developed.<br/><br/>Gru is soon faced with an obstacle that is not part of the standard formula; he is a super evil power with money issues. The movie brings up a valid point: where do these guys get their financing? Out of all the superheroes and super villains in movies, I can't think of a time where this issue has been addressed. With the state of the economy being as it is, now is a good time for a movie to bring up money issues. The story breaks character and it's not about the kids at this point, Mom and Dad are now drawn closer to the story. They think, ""Hey that's right, I just paid $40 to get my family of four into this theater and I had to take out a second mortgage to pay for sodas and popcorn. I totally get what this guy is going through."" (Sorry for the dose of realism on the situation, but do the math, going to the movies isn't cheap).<br/><br/>Gru meets with the Mr. Perkins (voiced by Will Arnett), the president of the Bank of Evil, to ask for a loan. At the same time we are introduced to Vector (voiced by Jason Segel), Gru's soon-to-be arch nemesis. The back and forth quickly begins for power of a shrink ray. Gru needs the shrink ray to apply for his loan and to complete his plan to steal the moon. Vector just needs it to keep the story going. Vector was funny for about five minutes, as far as enemies are concerned, he is five years too late. His catch phrases and body gestures have been done over and over again in similar kiddy flicks. Like chewing bubble gum, the flavor didn't last for long.<br/><br/>To keep the story going and to give the kids something to connect with we are introduced to three orphaned girls that Gru incorporates into his plan by adopting them. The orphans unknowingly help Gru break into Vector's fortress to steal the shrink ray back. After that plan goes accordingly, Gru tries to ditch them at an amusement park but after a day with the girls, he finds that his tough exterior is slowly being chiseled away by their childish antics and puppy dog eyes. It's cute, too cute. Couple that with the adorable mannerisms of the minions and we are talking about some serious charm. On the cuteness scale of 1-10 you can rate this at an 11 or 12. (These minions will also be great plush toys, which means Mom and Dad's trip to the movie just tacked on a trip to the toy store and another $30.) Once Gru takes a liking to these three orphans the conflict between him and Vector climaxes. Mix in the fact that the date of Gru's evil plan coincides with the dates of the orphans' dance recital. Lastly add a dash of change-of-heart-syndrome to the final scenes. Have you heard this one before? I have a feeling you know how it will end.<br/><br/>Should you see this movie? I think you already have. But, see it again for the minions; they do bring a new, fun feel to the story line. Put the kids in the car; fill up on $3 per gallon gas; stop for dinner on the way to the theater, $50; enjoy the movie in 3D, $40; buy the toys, $30; and enjoy the time with the kids because it is all new to them. Priceless."
"Maggie5554515","3","9","24","5 October 2010"," Rather disappointing
","I usually only write reviews of movies which I particularly like. But ""Despicable Me"" provoked me to ask: Did you ever have the feeling that after seeing one movie made in Hollywood, you've seen them all? The cast, the music and the setting vary of course, but the storyline is somehow always the same. This is one of those VERY standard movies that makes you wonder if a script is actually being written after a great deal of brainstorming and creative discussion or if it is just being copy-pasted from the last blockbuster. ""They liked ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" and ""The Incredibles"" - now, let's put the two together!"" The only good thing about the film was the animation and the voice-overs. The soundtrack is terribly outdated (think 70ies), and the story is zero - literally - I've heard stories from 5-year-olds with much more fantasy and innovation."
"estreet-eva","6","2","3","5 December 2011"," Light but original entertainment.
","""Despicable Me"" has what has become an almost unheard quantity in an age where sequels, prequels, reboots, TV to movie transfers, video game to movie transfers and children book to movie transfers -- originality. Unfortunately, it doesn't have much more than light entertainment value to go with the creativity. Steve Carell voices the hero-villain Gru with a Russian accent for reasons that seem related to perhaps Steve's feeling that he had to do something to earn all the money he was making for the voice work. There didn't seem to be anything in the plot that necessitated that Gru be Eastern European. Jason Segel voices Vector the villain-villain, a character who is nearly wholly uninteresting. The 3 children who eventually soften Gru's heart (oh, like you were unaware how this would end!) are cute but ultimately forgettable and actually a little whiny. Gru's allergy pill-shaped minions are not that cute either and also a little whiny. Like Gru's accent no explanation is offered as to just what the hell they are supposed to be. The movie tilts a little at trying to be more than just a summer popcorn movie by given some insight into Gru's mother's lack of sympathy but the backstory would have made much more sense if she was the father instead. There is also some hinting at larger issues with Gru representing old-fashioned Victorian-house owning villainy and Vector representing sleek, modern space pod-house villainy but it never really goes anywhere. There are some laughs particularly a sign underneath the one announcing ""The Bank of Evil"" where Gru tries to get a loan indicating that it used to be called ""Lehman Brothers"" but they generally of the slight smile and giggle variety. In short, if there is a heat wave near you and you have kids this is a reasonable way to get come air-conditioning and darkness time in."

","Last Saturday, I managed to watch Despicable Me. Yeah I know that it isn't new for it was shown last year.<br/><br/>I still decided to write a short review of it though I KNOW it's already late.<br/><br/>Well it really moved me and I just wanna share some of my thoughts about it.<br/><br/>I believe Despicable Me is among the best animated features of 2010. Yeah I know Toy Story 3 is great but this film definitely deserves a watch too.<br/><br/>But before mentioning the good sides of the movie. Here's some weak areas from my observation.<br/><br/>The story has some inconsistencies. Like when the kids were showed in their first sleep that they prayed first before sleeping but they were never showed praying again in the following sleep scenes.<br/><br/>Vector was also a techy villain so I just can't figure out how he came up with the not-so-cool octopus gun invention, (I've read though that it was done purposely to come up with a scene close to a Jules Verne's novel).<br/><br/>The presence of the minions was also kinda questionable for it isn't a monster or alien movie.<br/><br/>However, considering the fact that it is a fun-filled animated feature, all those minimal errs are kinda excusable...hehe Now here are the strong points.<br/><br/>I love this film for IT IS FULL OF LOVE.<br/><br/>I love the characters in the movie too especially the very endearing Agnes. (She also reminds me of the lil girl from Monsters Inc.) The movie did not fail to show the right emotions. It was very accurate and very witty.<br/><br/>In addition, the cinematography was nice, the sounds was just and the direction was splendid.<br/><br/>One of the most remarkable scenes for me was the roller coaster ride which proves that great 3D rendering was done in the film. It kinda made me feel like I was in the ride too.<br/><br/>I also love how the movie indirectly pointed out that we have let go of the bitterness in the past.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely a good reminder that no matter how bad our past is we can still live a good life if we choose to.<br/><br/>So as I end, I encourage everyone to watch the film if you haven't watch it yet.<br/><br/>Very cute, funny and lovable. 8 out of 10 for me..."

","Another awesome animated movie to hit us movie-lovers in 2010.<br/><br/>""Despicable Me"" is a really nice movie, both in story and appearance. The movie is very colorful and superbly animated. There are so many little details going on in every scene, and it is just wonderful. I think it is great how far animation movies have reached by now. And there is somehow somewhat of a Tim Burton-feel to the way ""Despicable Me"" looks like, I mean the way the characters look and such. Not that the style here is dark or semi-Gothic, but they bear some resemblance.<br/><br/>The story of ""Despicable Me"" is a warm story, of how the villain Gru's life gets turned upside down when he adopts Margo, Edith and Agnes for a scheme, but ends up thawing up his frozen heart. That is enough said about the movie plot, and it is all that need to be said actually. The story is fast paced and takes you on a roller-coaster of fun and excitement - and superb animation, of course. It is the type of story that will warm your heart and sink right in, probably one that you will have with you for quite some time actually.<br/><br/>The impressive cast does a very, very good performance in their voice acting, and all characters have a lot of personality and quirky traits that you just want to see more and more of them. From the villainous Gru to the small yellow minions, you just simply love them all.<br/><br/>I hadn't thought ""Despicable Me"" would turn out as cool as it was, so I was thoroughly surprised when I watched it. If you haven't already seen this phenomenal animated movie, get your butt in gear and do so. It is definitely one of the better animated movies of 2010. Universal Pictures actually nailed it right on the head with ""Despicable Me"". Thumbs up, way up!<br/><br/>""Despicable Me"" can be enjoyed by adults and children alike. And it is a movie that should be on every movie collector's shelves."
"Rizar","Null","2","3","3 November 2010"," Despicable Me (2010, PG)
","For kids, Gru is an outlandish villain. More importantly, he has a fun and whimsy minion of little, yellow servants, perhaps another robotic creation of Gru's associate, Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand), or a cartoon species of some sort. They look like Twinkies with human features (little arms, little legs, huge eyes) and they wear worker outfits (protective glasses, blue overalls, work gloves). They mostly act like kids, but they are obedient to their boss, Gru.<br/><br/>Gru shows all the signs of losing his touch. He was once a despicable villain, but now he's mostly grouchy and unsuccessful. He reacts negatively against things that annoy old people: he uses his freeze gun on other customers to get around waiting in lines, he threatens his neighbor about a dog dirtying the lawn, and he warns three little girls to avoid making any annoying sounds. The ultimate death blow is his failure to go green (he drives in the worst pollution machine on the road) and his failure to conform (his lawn is dead and his house probably violates every local law in existence). Mix his old age rage and anti-green offenses with a bit of dark demeanor, antisocial attitude, and mean mom, and you get the basics of his villainy.<br/><br/>In other words, he's not very despicable as advertised. He wasn't nearly as funny as one might expect from the trailers and title of the movie, but it doesn't ruin the movie in the least. It still has lots of little witty details, funny side characters, and cool gadgets. No one truly expects him to be bad in a kids movie anyway. No doubt his character will pull in an audience looking for a bad guy in the star position, but it wouldn't necessarily be any greater than if a well known, nice superhero was the star (which is a common misconception: just look at the popularity of Spider-Man or Superman).<br/><br/>Far funnier is Gru's adversary, Vector. Gru wants to shrink and steal the moon to regain his position as the greatest of all villains. However, he can't deploy his plan because Vector (Jason Segel), a ridiculous, inventor villain, laughs his way to stealing the shrink gun. Vector is a geeky, rich kid who, when he isn't one upping Gru by stealing the pyramids, invents worthless weapons or sits around watching TV. Perhaps someday he would get around to stealing the moon for his own glory (and lucrative prospects). He's much more despicable than Gru, and Jason Segel (his voice) makes him sound something like Jon Lovitz, an egoistic loon. He certainly doesn't make intelligent plans. Vector's great accomplishment is to have better results copying Gru's tactics and thwarting Gru's plans.<br/><br/>Gru is just the opposite. Dark, serious, devious, he's a hard working, constantly scheming villain from the suburbs who's had bad luck. Steve Carell voices him with a menacing accent that he reportedly takes from a mixture of Ricardo Montalban and Bela Lugosi. But the truest and most villainous characters in the entire movie are the evil, underground bankers (named Lehman Brothers) that refuse to fund Gru's moon ploy unless they see the shrinking gun in his possession.<br/><br/>Being him, Gru devises another plan to take advantage of Vector's weakness for cookies. He adopts three girls from an orphanage to distract Vector and try to steal back his shrinking gun. This sets in motion a typical story of his reversal from insensitive to sensitive, dark to colorful (his spacesuit becomes pink after the girls mix in their clothes with his), or, as the tagline says, ""superbad to superdad"". Some of these sequences are enjoyable, especially with Gru putting out bowls of food for the kids, and having to read them a bedtime story about kittens.<br/><br/>The youngest of the girls, Agnes (Elsie Fisher, voice), is the funniest of the girls. She fearlessly dominates the relationship over Gru and his vicious pet. She's particularly funny at an amusement park, which not only gives the audience an easy thrill for the roller coasters on the big screen but also allows Agnes to win a unicorn toy and joyously exclaim, ""it's so fluffy,"" with the amusement park game burning in destruction behind her.<br/><br/>The various side characters around Gru were funniest. A few of the best jokes are at the expense of the little yellow minion sidekicks and Dr. Nefario, an old genius who has hearing problems (he mistakenly invents the wrong gadgets sometimes). The film also has its share of fun gadgets down in Gru's secret lab, including a NASA like mission control setup. It may disappoint some adults expecting a more humorous and evil villain, but it's very watchable, fun, and fast paced.<br/><br/>The image quality of ""Despicable Me"" didn't seem negatively impacted by the 3D treatment. The 3D was more enjoyable and noticeable than in ""The Last Airbender"", but not so frequent that you get a huge advantage. The audience seemed to enjoy the film, but many of them had to stay for the credits since the yellow minion give a nice send off."
"cesarbau","9","2","3","25 October 2010"," Crunchy humor, richly textured animation, melt-your-heart recipe
","Every three minutes or so, ""Despicable Me"" doles out cookies. They're alternately of the crispy, chewy or melt-in-your-mouth variety, but never crumbly or too sugary. This is just one way of describing the delights of this movie, its crunchy humor, richly textured animation and melt-your-heart recipe. <br/><br/>Cookies happen to be a crucial device in the plot, the one that brings three little sisters and a super-villain together. They're unloved orphans from Miss Hattie's Home for Girls while he, Gru, is a heist artist of the first order who's in danger of losing his standing to an upstart geek (drawn with shades of Woody Allen). The villainous rivals start a madcap race to the moon to put the ultimate prize, literally, on the palms of their hands: the moon itself. In order to have any hope of winning, Gru maneuvers to adopt the trio. This situation is fraught with danger, namely the slide into triteness, and the predictability of the story's outcome could only be outweighed by clever filmmaking. By many a yardstick, ""Despicable Me"" has beat the odds. <br/><br/>Save for a cruel pointy nose, there's really not much particularly gruesome about Gru. Neither his menacing eyes, his SUV from hell nor freeze gun could terrify the younger kids in the audience, or even Agnes, the youngest of the orphans. ""Yeah, he's scary. Like Santa,"" she says with a yawn. With a thick Transylvanian or Gothic accent that recalls The Count in ""Sesame Street,"" Steve Carell's voice captures the put-on quality of Gru's gruffness and his frustration over the put-downs by his frigidly aloof mommy (Julie Andrews). <br/><br/>Ms. Andrews is just one of the ""Despicable Me's"" multicultural assets and sources of its insistent charm. Wry English humor is evident in many lines, written by Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio with understated wit and a sense of decorum. <br/><br/>The only juvenile joke in the movie, about bodily functions, uses another four-letter word, ""dart"". And parents in the audience may recall some visual motifs from the James Bond movies, especially ""Goldfinger"" and ""Moonraker"" -- veddy English. To dupe Miss Hattie into letting him adopt the girls, Gru uses words dripping with false sentiment then butters her up by telling her that she has a face ""como un burro"", Spanish for like a donkey, by implication, an ass. She doesn't speak the language and is completely taken in. <br/><br/>France (where the French-voiced version is ""Moi, moche et mechant"" -- Ugly and Mean Me) has provided the technical finesse. French directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud kept the story progression fluid and every technical and artistic business under control. A team of some 280 artists and technicians from Mac Guff Ligne worked on the finely-styled digital animation and design for over two years. Around 50 of them also acted out the parts. Mac Guff still doesn't measure up to the resources and inventiveness of Pixar, though. For instance, those much-publicized impish tube-like minions, cute as they are, may have only a slim chance to catch on in an overcrowded toy market. <br/><br/>American audacity and feel-good cravings drive the storyline of ""Despicable Me."" The premise of the theft of the moon, the giddy roller-coaster sequence and the family-values sentimentality over Gru's failure to attend the orphans' ballet recital are vintage Hollywood. <br/><br/>When Gru's mommy finally utters words of praise for him, slyly of course, he basks in the glow of the moment. The moon was his, no matter how briefly, and he has become a full- fledged dad, and son as well. That's three cookies for Gru, and a whole box of wholesome goodness for us."
"jboothmillard","7","2","3","18 October 2010"," Despicable Me
","The 3D concept was still making big business at the box office, and Pixar had the stronghold on the computer animated movie market, so Universal hyped up this movie for a while. Basically the real Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt has been stolen, and there is news coverage to find the great master criminal who did it. In a regular suburban neighbourhood of white picket fences and roses is a single black house surrounded by dead grass, it belongs to wannabe master criminal Gru (Steve Carell). Hidden beneath the house is the large secret hideout where Gru, with his hundreds of short yellow pill-shaped characters known as the Minions, plans his next big scheme. To become the greatest master criminal of all, Gru has a master plan to puzzle the whole world, he plans to steal a shrinking ray, shrink the moon, and steal it from the sky. He does try to steal the shrinking ray, but the criminal responsible for stealing the famous pyramid, Victor, aka Vector (Knocked Up's Jason Segel) takes it from him. With the high security stopping Gru taking the shrinking ray back, he has an idea to get in, by adopting three orphan children, Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and Agnes (Elsie Fisher). He spots them selling their sweets, biscuits and cakes to Vector without any problems, and he wants to use this to his advantage to get into the Vector compound. It takes Gru a while to get anything done to get the plan on the road, as the three orphans are very needy and annoying, this is frustrating both him and his sidekick Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand). As time goes by and he does spend more time with the children, Gru finds himself becoming very fond of them and almost forgetting the plan completely. Gru does manage to get the children into Vector's house, and with the help of some cookie robots and some of the Minions, he does get the shrinking ray, but he doesn't convince the bank of evil manager about his plan. Gru gets the funding instead from all the Minions, and it finally comes to the night where the moon is in the best position to shrink and steal it. However, it is on the same night as the three girls dance recital, and after the moon plan does succeed and the tides go out of control Gru finds out that Vector has taken the children. In the end, Vector is defeated when the moon grows back to its normal size and he stuck on it back in space, and Gru has completely changed his opinion of the children, becoming surprisingly nice. Also starring Dame Julie Andrews as Gru's Mom, Will Arnett as Mr. Perkins, Danny McBride as Fred McDade; Pierre Coffin, Chris Renaud, Jemaine Clement as the Minions and The Hangover's Ken Jeong as Talk Show Host. Carell with his mixed accent makes Gru a great anti-villain that you can both like and dislike, and the Tic Tac looking Minions all bring out their lovable individual personalities very well. It is a simple story using a James Bond style villain and slowly turning him against type, the animation is as good as a Pixar picture, the gadgetry is both cool and funny, and the visual jokes make for fun viewing, so it is a good family comedy. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Film. Very good!"

","Went to see this with my partner and not really knowing much about it I was just hoping for a reasonably entertaining experience. On entering the cinema we were presented with 3d glasses and a free bag of popcorn (nice touch), this was a screener so probably a one off and not to be expected again.<br/><br/>The place was packed with kids and I must admit I did have some misgivings at first but once the film started I realized how wrong I was , this is the kind of film that must be watched whilst surrounded by hordes of laughing children.<br/><br/>The animation was very well done and so was the story line, the jokes were easily understood by all and overall the humor was fit for all ages, the 3D effects in most films usually rely on objects appearing to fly out of the screen directly at you but it was more subtle in this movie, which I find more appealing.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anyone, with or without kids, it has great appeal to all ages, and stay through the end credits.<br/><br/>And on a final note for anyone who like me is sure that the main character ""GRU"" is familiar think back to the old comics ""Wham"" and ""smash"", remember Grimly Feendish."
"zippidog","10","2","3","14 August 2010"," Caught me by surprise
","Everything already said has been said. I caught this movie as a second choice today as what I wanted to see was not available. I was ""aware"" of DM but the marketing never intrigued me to make the effort to see it. Toy Story 3 and Inhception are my 2 favs so far but this gave it a good run for top 2. My vision doesn't allow me to adjust to 3D well and I almost left during the previews. Thank goodness I didn't. Once the feature started my vision adjusted and thought the beginning sequence was odd and intriguing. On the visit to the Bank of Evil and you see the former title of the bank name I thought to myself this just might be for me.<br/><br/>As I giggled myself silly from scene to scene I caught myself thinking about just how funny some of the earlier scenes were and when it was quiet in the theater I was still giggling. The very odd character story line yet familiar looking characters blended well from scene to scene. The pleasant surprise reminds me of when I saw the original ""jackass"" movie. I had never seen the TV show and had a little familiarity with what it entailed. My son was too young to see it at the time and he was in another theater with his buddies watching something I had no interest in. ""Jackass"" is simply that in a nutshell, however something struck a chord with me and my screwed up youth. Very stupid, very funny, yet highly entertaining. There were times I couldn't catch my breath from the insanity and i feel that same way with DM. Worth every penny and a very worthy ""Blindside"". Looking up the writers and directors I'm very impressed with the quality of what some ""newbies"" to the biz have given us. I look forward to the future screenings of their work."

","i've got to tell you that the standard of animation movies is really touching the sky. this movie is yet another addition to a number of really good animation movies in the last few years- ""toy story 3"", ""wall-e"", ""up"" and ""kung fu panda"" just to name a few. the plot of the movie is quite different as the main protagonist of the movie is in reality an anti-hero but never during the movie do you realise this. it has a bit of warmth, a little sweetness and off course, the emotional component but the greatest thing about the movie is its humor. in the whole running time of 1hr and 35 min, you find yourself laughing most of the times and the movie springs up some really good originality in the form of ""minions"" and techie- air as well as road vehicles. the voice- overs of most of the characters are well done although gru's accent might appear sometimes as overdone. the only complaint i could have were a few clichéd moments of family bonding and the character of gru's mother. but over all, the movie is a real fun filled ride and a more than nice entertainer."

","When the Summer of 2010 in movie-going goes to a close, most moviegoers will remember what movies they enjoyed the most. Among those movies was a surprise hit called ""Despicable Me"". Created by Universal's CGI animation studio, Illumination Entertainment, this is the struggling studio's first CGI film, and it delivers. The plot is original, the animation up there with other CGI studios, and the laughter plenty. The plot centers around Gru, a madman intent on stealing the moon from the sky with the help of his minions while taking care of his orphan kids. I saw this in 3D, and the 3D works well in this movie, even to the point when they make fun of it. Not as good as Toy Story 3 but the 3D and humor make up for it."

","A kids film that's very much for the kids. Nothing wrong with that really, but there wasn't much there for even my fairly childish tastes.

A simple bit of fun, but probably not one I'd bother with again."
"zkonedog","6","1","1","10 March 2017"," A Different Approach Than Pixar
","After pretty much working my way through all the Disney/Pixar animated films, ""Despicable Me"" was my first venture into Universal territory. The filmmaking styles are most definitely different, although I would argue that Pixar still holds a big edge.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Despicable Me"" tells the story of Dr. Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), a supervillian trying to stay on top of the supervillian world. While dueling with the young, up-and- coming supervillians, Dr. Gru gets involved with a trio of orphan girls who eventually lend him some basic humanity.<br/><br/>Clearly, Universal utilizes a completely different formula than Pixar. Here, the animation is a little goofier and the action almost never ceases. A bit of emotion is still injected into the film, but nowhere near Pixar levels. In this case, the never-ending action gets a bit tiresome and the emotion is actually a bit too little, too late.<br/><br/>Overall, however, ""Despicable Me"" will entertain all children with its fast pace, quirky humor, and abundance of sight gags. For folks any older, though, it just doesn't measure up to the Pixar stable of emotional depth and all-ages humor."
"phubbs","5","1","1","30 November 2015"," Despicable Me
","At a time when we had the likes of 'Toy Story 3' and 'How to Train Your Dragon', a time when Pixar and Dreamworks ruled supreme (Pixar winning of course), along came Illumination Entertainment and gave us this supervillain animation.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty unoriginal really, jumping on the over used superhero theme. A supervillain is getting old and rusty, losing his flare for evil, at the same time a younger new supervillain threatens his status. So he devises a plan to steal the moon, the greatest feat of supervillainy he can come up with. But in order to carry out this plan he must enlist (adopt) the help of three very young little girls.<br/><br/>The whole superhero concept has been popular now for quite some time and in CGI animation its no different. Along with other similar flicks such as 'The Incredibles' and 'Megamind' the whole idea is beginning to feel a little swamped I can't deny. This film mainly centres on the supervillains point of view, how he lives, his daily habits, his job being an evil mastermind etc...a nice angle that was original until later in the year when 'Megamind' came out.<br/><br/>At his side are an army of little yellow minions that look like old 8-bit video game characters not too dissimilar from Pac-Man. Now at first these little guys are quite amusing with their pratfalls, face slapping and general simple minded tomfoolery, but it wears thin fast. Their whole routine is the same all the way through the film and I'm sure even kids may tire of it. I'm not even sure what the hell they are suppose to be seeing as all other characters in this film are human.<br/><br/>I really liked the initial idea of this film and the start, I loved Gru's big Gothic house squeezed in between a line of regular houses. I liked his outrageously over sized supervillain vehicle, his little demon-like dog and the interior of his lair which was like a cross between James Bond and Hammer horror. Lots of ingenious gadgets, secret doors/trap doors etc...in a thick Gothic German expressionist-like design.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the film becomes way too sickly and sweet for me (yes I know its for kids mainly). After he adopts the three little girls and starts to realise he enjoys them being around, losing sight of his evilness, it just becomes quite lame frankly. The film isn't sure what it wants to be or where its going, even the humour begins to lag.<br/><br/>In the end all we're left with is a semi decent animated film which does look glorious no doubt, but with a plot that can't decide which route to go down. None of the characters are particularly interesting or fun, Steve Carell doesn't help make the evil Gru any more memorable and the old scientist character that works with him is dreadful!. He's actually quite scary looking I think, plus with that awful cockney accent from Brand...utter fail.<br/><br/>Very wishy washy kids film that struggles to keep you interested and in no way competes with the big guns. Clearly trying to be zany and full of fresh ideas but you can see its not really worked out, its not a bad film, its just rather flat and anti climatic. How on earth this film was popular I don't know, the sequel was no surprise but I just don't see the hype over this.<br/><br/>5/10"

","I, together with my English Major class watched this movie. I am not a huge fan of animation and therefore when I heard what movie we were going to watch I lost interest. As the movie progressed I enjoyed the humour and the story line. Since i have a four year old sister I am always skeptical about what types of movies she watches, but after watching Despicable Me i can definitely see why adults also have an interest in animation. The best part was watching Him grow throughout the movie, going from villain to good guy. He seems very embarrassed to show the softer side of him and with that came humour. The minions I would say were his first children, as even though there are so many of them he knows each ones names. One of the best animations I have watched thus far, certainly unforgettable!"

There is a bit of cartoon violence, but it is definitely a laugh out loud film that everyone will enjoy.<br/><br/>There is one grim aspect I have picked up on.

","Lovely, humorous movie about the underlying themes of 'belonging' and family. I thought that the movie brilliantly depicted these themes in a funny yet heartfelt way. Here, we actually find ourselves routing for the super villain; Gru and watch how his heart of stone, transforms into a marshmallow after the entrance of three adorable little orphaned girls. Emphasizing that so called ' bad people' can actually become good. The highlight of the movie for me, were the adorable minions,which I am sure everyone will enjoy, though they can not actually speak English, or are not humans, we find ourselves still being able to identify and understand them as well as feel with them.

Despicable Me has managed to to get the balance of entertainment for children and entertainment for the parents just right!<br/><br/>The main character Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) is incredibly funny with his dark sense of humour. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Gru's character growths from a sadistic villain to a warm, loving dad. Its easy to understand why Gru is the way he is, when you see the neglect he received from from his mother as a child (one of the things that create this 3 dimensional character). His growth is the result of 3 sweet girls that he adopted (""that changed his heart""). Without these girls there would be no storyline. <br/><br/>Gru's character shows us that no matter how bad a person is, they can always change. <br/><br/>Despicable Me is light-hearted, enjoyable, funny, heartwarming, and even at times tear-jerking (only because I am a happy-cryer). It is possibly my favourite animation.<br/><br/>With its range of characters -some lovable, others not-so-lovable - Despicable Me will leave you wanting more."

","A highly entertaining animated film. <br/><br/>When I see an animated film, I am drawn to comparisons with the wonderful PIXAR films. This film takes many clues form those and packs it up nicely and gives a film which is entertaining and nice. I can simply say. it's a nicely done formulaic animated film. It's formulaic coz we have seen such stories, a normal getting acquainted with kids and then going overboard to keep them happy. This reminded me Monsters Inc and even Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>The purpose is different and so is the approach, but the crux remains the same and yes there is wonderful animation to admire. The army of minions is a treat to watch. The films has some wonderful moments too, where we feel something, we root for Gru, the supposed best villain of the planet, voice given by Steve Carell. Also, there are moments of hilarious laughter, cannot simply mention one but many.<br/><br/>Essentially, there is a hero and there is a villain, the hero wins over villain. As simple as that this film can be pigeonholed, yet it gives the humane touch of feeling for one's own kids. A bad human trying to be good with those he loves. These themes are embedded well into a rather clichéd script and they make it interesting. Although, I did not die for it, I can safely say I like it, maybe I will not get back to this film, but any kid who would watch this, will more or less appreciate it. But since we are now acquainted so many films that such themes and have great quality. Those aspects might be demeaning this film.<br/><br/>All the way down, I was mostly comparing the film, let me take it as a single film, now I love it. I love many things about this. The detailing of the characters, their brow to legs and even that wonderful story of Gru and the ballet story. Nice, and wow.<br/><br/>Only that since it makes me compare films and lets me down by some bit, I am going with 4/5. This film is surely like able and for a few it may be even wonderful. Perspectives differ, yet the content remains the same."

","I was about 14 years old when I saw this film and it was in 2011. When I saw the movie on TV, I thought that it was a good movie. Also there were some hilarious moments, like the part where Gru is telling Mr. Perkins his plan for the moon heist and he's going through the papers and there's an illustration made by Edith showing Gru on the toilet, leading Gru to say, ""I sit on the toilet with the- wha?"" Also the minions were funny too, not just Gru. One of the funny moments in the film is Josh on the photocopier scanning his rear and they're all laughing. I also love the part where Paul the Minion fights another minion over the keyboard and the crowd of minions chant, ""Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!"" Very funny. But still, the good music is also what makes it a good film. Throughout the movie, you may hear some music that matches the scene. Like when Gru discovers he loves the girls, the song that plays after the girls loan some of their money to Gru and he decides to build his own rocket out of stuff from the lab, a song plays and it's called ""Prettiest Girls"" by Pharrell Williams. It's a really good song and when I first saw the film I liked it. And I still do to this day. So basically the movie has great music and the minions are also what make the movie entertaining and great (and awesome). I'd recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it, really. Good film."

","After such a wide success with a couple of animated films in the mid 90s and early 21rst century, a boom occurred in the full CGI animated family films and it hasn't stopped. Several productions have came into play and flourished and or fizzled. Recalling a couple franchises that fizzled was Shark Tale (2004) & Hop (2011). Unfortunately, along with the power of the technology, came the abuse of it. But just like Pixar, Illumination Entertainment put in a lot of effort and time into a family film that packs a punch for all ages.<br/><br/>Despicable Me is the story of a troubled genius named Gru. Gru isn't truly evil, he just doesn't have much of anyone to care for. And like many other troubled characters, it is because of a rough childhood. Thus leading to hard times as an adult trying to connect with the outside world. Thankfully, with the help of three little girls, Gru learns more about himself than he ever thought he knew before. A good thing to note is that the writers to this movie have the experience. Cinco Paul & Ken Daurio have written screenplays for various animated films and directors. And along with the story come some very entertaining characters.<br/><br/>And I think we all know what those characters are - the yellow skinned minions. As many know now, the minions are the mascot to the famed ""Despicable"" franchise. With their innocent yet reckless nature and garbled language, the minions are the ones that'll have audiences rolling over the floors. But these aren't the only characters that make the movie fun. The main voice actors do a great job as well filling in their roles. Steve Carell as Gru was a perfect casting choice. Gru's assistant, Dr. Nefario voiced by Russell Brand was also a great achievement. I didn't even realize it was him until the credits rolled.<br/><br/>Along with them are Jason Segel who plays another villain named Vector, Will Arnett voices the head of bank and many others. It's interesting to try and figure out who voices who because the characters are masked so well. The animation and score to the film produced by Heitor Pereira and Pharrell Williams is well executed too. Each scene represented the right emotion and had a consistent tone. Though I would have preferred to hear a main theme. It probably would have made the film even more memorable.<br/><br/>The voice cast is awesome which makes the characters likable allowing the comedic moments to bring out the fun in the movie. Many people will consider the minions to be the best part."

"Stompgal_87","8","1","1","29 November 2013"," One of the most creative animated films with an original concept if somewhat similar to 'Megamind'
","I saw this in the cinema three years ago when I could watch it in 3D, the best part with that effect being the roller coaster scene. Re-visiting this film today I had the same feeling about it as 'A Turtle's Tale: Sammy's Adventures' by enjoying the 3D version more but I still found it as creative and funny as ever.<br/><br/>The animation standard is on the same level as Pixar and Dreamworks CGI films with oddly-designed yet appealing characters, original weapons, a combination of modern, retro and futuristic backgrounds, some clever uses of colour such as Vector's orange suit matching his couch and other belongings and some realistic elements such as the moon and the pyramids despite the one Vector stole being thinly disguised amongst the sky. The story has an original concept of a villain as a protagonist in a similar manner to 'Megamind,' although the opening scene of the soft pyramid looked as if belonged to a different film altogether. While the girls' names are old-fashioned, they have their own personalities (the smart Margo, the tomboyish Edith and the adorable, unicorn- loving Agnes) and make the film worthwhile. The musical score is powerful and reminds me of the sort of music one would hear in a spy or mystery film. It even includes hints of disco music. Other aspects that made this film worth watching were the minions (they were all funny and in my favourite colour yellow), Dr Nefario's misunderstandings of Gru's demands (boogie robots instead of cookie robots for example), the 'Annie' reference, the use of the famous Wilhelm scream when Gru's mother hits the punch-bag and sends the instructor flying and the hilarity of Agnes puckling her cheeks when she asks if it counts as annoying. There was also an element of visual trickery with Edith briefly becoming trapped inside Gru's iron maiden along with other dark moments such as Miss Hattie keeping girls inside the Box of Shame and Gru leaving out food and water bowls as well as newspaper for a toilet for the girls because he perceives them as animals to begin with. Some parts of the film were slow and initially forgettable but these are balanced by the stronger scenes I have already mentioned. While Steve Carell seemed unrecognisable, he played his most unique role yet as Gru while Russell Brand was superb as Dr Nefario and Julie Andrews was a pleasant surprise as Gru's mother. The voice actresses for the girls did a solid job as well, especially Elsie Fisher as Agnes.<br/><br/>In spite of this film being more enjoyable in 3D, it still entertained me and I hope to see the sequel soon. 8/10."

","The day I showed ""Despicable Me"" to my daughter was the day we knew we had a new favorite movie. Now there's Minion paraphernalia all over the house, she's quoting lines left and right and I'm not even sure how many times she and I have watched this movie. <br/><br/>But that's just the sort of film this is; the kind that sneaks up behind you, worms its way into your heart, and before you know it, it's all around you. Everything about ""Despicable Me"" from the voices (Carell nails it here), the action, cool songs and winning sense of humor (the Looney Tunes-esque violence of the Minions, the satirical jabs at American culture) is just spot-on. But most of all, it's the endearing sentiment at the core of the movie that shines. Just loads of heart. <br/><br/>This is an all-around winner, full of heart, talent and sentiment. My whole family loves this movie.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>... Also, can anyone honestly say they knew that was Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario? Anyone?

"philip-ct","8","1","1","26 September 2013"," Not at all despicable!
","Animated films aimed at younger children seem to have a dual audience, the kids and the adults. This film succeeds on both levels. (I currently use Up! as part of my media course, but Despicable Me is a close 3rd - The Lion King, a 2nd) I am biased, unashamedly so, but the stand- out for me in this dizzying film, ending with a sense of belonging, and acceptance / redemption, dotted with wit, throw-away lines, aha moments, and emotional connectedness, is Julie Andrews, who voices the terrible mother, with aplomb and a good accent. She, in an essentially supporting role, is excellent. And the main voices are equally as good!! See the film: it is well worth it."
"freemantle_uk","8","1","1","21 June 2013"," The Looney Tunes meets a Saturday Morning Cartoon
","Despicable Me is the first feature film for Illumination Entertainment and it was a hit in 2010, a popular film for families and has made the minions a very popular pop culture creation.<br/><br/>In a world of sci-fi and supervillains a new villain, Vector (Jason Segal) announces himself by stealing the Great Pyramid of Giza. Gru (Steve Carell), an older supervillain has had his thunder stolen and to reclaim his position as top dog by planning the biggest heist in history, by stealing the moon! But to do this Gru needs a shrink ray and he has formed a rivalry with Vector who steals it off Gru after he stole it from the Chinese. But Gru is not a villain who could be kept down for long and plans to steal the shrink ray by adopting three orphan girls, the sharp witted Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), the tomboyish Edith (Dana Gaier) and the innocent Agnes(Elsie Kate Fisher). Despite Gru's ambitions he slowly starts to warm to the girls.<br/><br/>Despicable Me is basically a cross between a Saturday morning cartoon and the Looney Tunes. The film has the design of a Saturday morning cartoon, the lair, the weapons, the design and the plot. Many of the designs of the vehicles and the weapons were overblown and felt like something a 10-year-old boy would create, and I am saying that as complement. There is a clear influence from Pixar's The Incredibles in its design and the music which borrows some Bond ques and basic set up and there are some parallels to Megamind (which was released in the same year) about a villain who finds his good side.<br/><br/>The style of humour is very physical and visual: there are plenty of slapstick humour, particularly involving the minions and their bickering and the experimentations on them. One great example is early on in the film is when Gru tries to break into Vector's home/lair which looked like it could have been a Looney Tune short. There are some verbal jokes and The Bank of Evil offers the only real cultural/political joke.<br/><br/>The script itself is screen writing 101, the structure is predictable and Gru is a typical character who a dream he thinks he wants (i.e. stealing the Moon) and what he really wants is a family. His dream during the film changes as he realises what is really important to him. The film does do a good job at setting up why going to the Moon is so important to Gru and it is more then just make a name for himself.<br/><br/>Like most animated films these days Despicable Me has a big name cast. Carell was solid as Gru, giving him an ambiguous Eastern European actor. He gave us a character who does changes during the film. Russell Brand was surprising good as Gru's scientist and friend, his voice was unrecognising and he was funny throughout. There are strong supporting characters played by Kristen Wigg and Will Arnett but Segal was a disappointment as he felt like he was just playing teenage Marshall from How I Met Your Mother. Also Julie Andrews' casting as Gru's mother was pointless seeing she was only in the film for three screens.<br/><br/>The girls were very well defied with the personality and felt more like real children in the context of this world. This is especially the case for Margo as she acts as the leader of the girls but still acts as a child when she is around Gru. But I would have thought Edith would want to take her hat off sometimes.<br/><br/>Despicable Me is a fun and enjoyable film for the whole family. There is plenty of slapstick humour and fun designs and whilst it is a simple affair it does not patronises children.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","This movie is one of my favorites of all time, even though I'm only 13 years old (I love movies; I watch at least a new one every day during the summer! Don't try that at home.). Some of the jokes are a bit childish, but I found myself laughing at those the hardest. The characters are lovable and cute, but the plot is not very original, and that is why I did not give it 10 stars. However, this movie keeps you smiling, and very few movies nowadays are able to do that. I am constantly quoting lines from this film, and searching up my favorite scenes on YouTube. An excellent lesson, cute characters, and humorous jokes are what make this movie what it is - AWESOME! And definitely worth your time!"
"ajs-10","8","1","1","18 October 2011"," Highly enjoyable animated fun!...
","I seem to remember this getting a fairly patchy response from the critics when it came out probably all that 3D nonsense. Fortunately I managed to avoid all that by waiting for it to appear on TV in the correct number of dimensions for the screen. As for the film, well I really enjoyed it! Likable characters, a nice plot and some great comic moments who could ask for more!? I'll give you further thoughts after this brief summary.<br/><br/>Gru is a villain, he's been a villain for a long time, but now his evil deeds are being superseded by much younger up-and-coming villains. He's not happy, even his mother finds him a bit of a disappointment, but he has a plan. It's a very cunning and dastardly plan, but he'll need to steal a shrink ray gun and borrow some money from the bank first. He steals the ray, but it's stolen from him by a young upstart villain called Vector. Gru tries to retrieve it but cannot gain entry to his compound. Seeing three orphan girls get in by selling cookies, Gru forms another plan. He goes to Miss Hattie's Orphanage and adopts the three girls; Margo, Edith and Agnes. His plan: to get them into the compound so he can plant something there that will allow him to gain access to the ray gun. His many minions and Dr. Nefario help him with this clever scheme and it is a success but the girls have other ideas about Gru and, it seems, they just might be turning him away from his ultimate goal To steal the ****! Oops, hope I didn't say too much there Sorry Spoiler Police I, I'll come quietly.<br/><br/>As I've already said, I enjoyed this film very much, it must me my kind of humour or something, but there were far more 'laugh out loud' moments (for me) than usual. The animation was very well done, I'd go so far as to say it was almost up to Pixar standard. I loved Steve Carell as the voice of Gru, his Russian accent was hilarious. Also worthy of note were the voice talents of; Jason Segel as Vector, Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario, Julie Andrews as Gru's Mom, Will Arnett as Mr, Perkins, Kristen Wiig as Miss Hattie, Miranda Cosgrove as Margo, Dana Gaier as Edith and Elsie Fisher as Agnes.<br/><br/>One of the things I like to write about when reviewing a film is how it makes me feel. Well, this film did pull at the heartstrings a little, but much more than that it made me laugh. It's definitely one I will re-visit at some point because I'm sure there are many subtle little jokes I missed first time around. Whether you're young or slightly older (like me), I'm sure you'll get some laughs out of this one It's not perfect, but I very much enjoyed it nonetheless Recommended.<br/><br/>My Score: 8.4/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 7.5/10 (based on 68,835 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes Score: 81/100 (based on 187 reviews counted at the time of going to press)."
"siobhanmckibbin","6","1","1","10 September 2011"," Despicable-ly enjoyable!!!
","Animations are never my first choice of movie genre, but i must admit Despicable Me was not only entertaining but hilarious indeed.<br/><br/>So the narrative centres around Gru, an evil genius who only wants to win the affection and love of his mother, something which he has never been able to achieve. His only friends in life are Dr Nefario, an ageing scientist and his army of minions. When Vector, a mysterious newcomer to the evil genius world steals the Great Pyramid of Giza, Gru decides that its time pull off the most memorable crime in history; by stealing the moon. Three orphan girls soon become entwined in the story, and although there in no initial relationship with the girls other than for his own selfish needs, Gru soon becomes a father figure.<br/><br/>What makes this film so enjoyable, is that its not only for kids. It has several gags and one liners designed for an adult audience. My favourite being when Gru goes to visit ""The Bank"", and under the sign it says ""formly known as the Lehmann Brothers."" The animation is done well, and the music which accompanies it, helps to move the narrative along. The music is also quite modern, which helps to give the film a contemporary twist, which is something i don't really expect from an animation.<br/><br/>The stars of the film for me are in fact the minions. They are just comical in their actions and lack of words. I especially liked the floating minion who appears again right at the end.<br/><br/>Despicable Me is a light hearted animation, filled with unique and surprisingly funny characters. Although the plot and themes portrayed in the narrative are not original, it is definitely worth the watch."
"laurenk93","8","1","1","20 July 2011"," Delicious Despicable Me
","Let me make this clear from the outset; I'm one of those people who think animations are suitable for all ages, sometimes even more appropriate for adults. I was eager to see Despicable Me before it even hit theatres and it did not disappoint.<br/><br/>Steve Carrell lends his voice to Gru, a self-professed evil genius, however, it becomes blatant that he's kind-hearted beneath it all. He's almost unrecognizable, putting on an accent of some sort, possibly Russian. He takes in three orphans in a bid to involve them in his next evil plan, and finds himself caring for them more than he intended. This is where the film becomes hysterical. From the moment we meet youngest child, Agnes, it's impossible not to laugh. While the whole script is funny, it seems the writers gave Agnes the best jokes, which result in side-splitting laughter. One of my personal favourites is, ""It's so FLUFFY!"" Like all children's animations the plot is a little less developed than adult audiences would like, however, the hilarity and chaos that lasts throughout the film is enough to keep everyone entertained. The Minions are another factor which cause endless laughter. Their ability to cause destruction rather than helping Gru with his plans is stupidly funny.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this film to everyone, whether you want to watch it alone or with your family. It's completely age-appropriate, I can't think of a single innuendo throughout the film. Definitely one of the best animations of this decade, if not ever. Despicable Me embodies everything you could want from a kid's film; laughs, a touching story of growth and, of course, chaos."
"bob the moo","Null","1","1","13 March 2011"," Funny and cute but needless to say it's no Pixar
","In an attempt to pull off a job that gets him noticed in the world of criminal villains, Gru comes up against plucky young rival ""Vector"", who is very well equipped to say the least. In trying to steal a device from Vector, Gru adopts three young girls so that he can get robot cookies into Vector's lair. However, as successful as this is, he is still now legally parent to three girls – made all the more challenging by the fact that they are starting to grow on him, even if it is just a little bit.<br/><br/>Years ago, I started writing down my thoughts on films in an attempt to try and put more thought into what I liked or didn't like about them; too often I would come out of the cinema and be asked what I thought only for me to say ""yeah, it was OK I guess"" and nothing more. So mostly now I try to have more to say than just that. Of course sometimes it is hard because the truth is that some films are just ""OK I guess"". Despicable Me is another of the animated films that Pixar have helped to create by virtue of their success and it is one such film because it will not stand for the ages and it isn't as strong as Pixar can do (the most obvious comparison is the much better The Incredibles) but it is still a perfectly fine little film that amused and pleased me while I watched it despite me being unlikely to ever have to watch it again.<br/><br/>The story is a simple enough one in which a villain finds a heart through three small children, it was always going to happen but I guess this is part of watching the film. Fortunately within this plot there is plenty that is funny, cute or cute and funny. Although it feels a little like ideas from other places, the project is still quite clever with good comic timing and imaginative touches that generally made me laugh. Plus I am a sucker for the cute – the little yellow creatures were a hoot and the three children were a constant delight to me with ""It's so fluffy"" being my favourite line of the film by about a million miles. This charm carried it for me because otherwise it isn't quite as smart or as cleverly funny as I would have liked – the adult jokes in particular tended to feel more ""inserted"" than being part of the film in the way Pixar (sorry for mentioning them again) do so effortlessly.<br/><br/>Carell's voice work is pretty good. At first I thought it was a shame he is sort of hidden behind that accent but actually he makes it work well. Those doing the kids voices also work very well – getting the levels right to be cute and funny – even those that dislike children will be won over by these three (which I guess is key to the story and the film when you think about it!). I didn't think Brand was well cast – his accent stands out too much and his character and his voice didn't match up for me in the way it did for others. The supporting voices have some good names but none of them really stood out or ever threatened to distract from Carell in the lead.<br/><br/>As an adult, Despicable Me is ""pretty good"". It isn't brilliant and it tended to remind me of other films and other ideas but it has enough laughs, enough cute and enough charm to easily entertain. Children will love it and, while not Pixar (sorry!) adults will find themselves quite charmed by it as well."

","Despicable Me is a fun film. It is a simple story coated with wonderful moments, and characters that are pleasing to watch. From Gru with his aim to become the most evil villain in the world to his eccentric but utterly lovable Minions (a great creation).<br/><br/>Giggles, and there are lots of them work through a certain subtlety. The moving of a characters face, voice or body (special mention to the Minions)or the sweet scene stealing 'Unicorns I love them' Agnes really does work. When Despicable Me does try with a more slapstick, or crash, bang wallop it does full a little flat. Arch-nemesis Vector and Gru's assistant Dr. Nefarious are at times in Despicable Me a little weak. Indeed it is Gru but more so the orphan girls and Minions that we want to see. <br/><br/>I must mention the animation which is very good and well-brought to life but also the musical presence in the film, as I really noticed it. The music is rather modern and funky for an animation, and gave for me a contemporary twist, which I enjoyed. <br/><br/>I admire Despicable Me for its simple yet highly creativity tale. There are many scenes that are highly memorable and you would have to have a heart of steel not to be touched by the manner it draws the film to its loving and charming conclusion."

","It seems to me that with every year we get smarter, funnier animated features. Those just for the kiddos, and those for kids and adults alike. Despicable Me is amusing for all ages. I love a good change of heart plot. In Despicable Me, the hilarious Steve Carell voices Gru. Gru is an evil genius of sorts who is being shown up by someone who keeps getting to all of the good heists before he can.<br/><br/>In an effort to get the spotlight back, Gru goes to the bank to get a loan for his newest project: shrinking and stealing the moon, of course. While at the bank we meet Vector. Vector (Jason Segel) is obnoxious and appears immature and incapable of being a great villain.<br/><br/>After being turned down by the bank, Gru discovers that Vector is miraculously the one behind the latest great heists. In order to infiltrate Vector's lair, Gru seeks out the girls he saw selling cookies at Vector's house. They live in a local orphanage and are adopted by Gru to carry out his master plan.<br/><br/>Margo, Edith, and Agnes (Voiced in order by Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, and the extra adorable Elsie Fisher) come to live with Gru and you can imagine what happens then. Picture it: three young girls in the house of an evil genius. With weapons, ray guns, potions, and trap doors at every turn there is plenty of mischief for them to get into.<br/><br/>Let's not forget the minions. The minions are many and they are all over the place causing trouble and acting as guinea pigs to Gru and Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) as they build their rocket ship.<br/><br/>Despite his best efforts, Gru starts to become attached to the little girls. Particularly enjoyable is the scene where Gru takes the girls to an amusement park. Agnes, who had a little stuffed unicorn that was disintegrated when the girls arrived at Gru's house, sees another, much bigger stuffed unicorn and shouts ""He's so fluffy I'm gonna die!"" I hope I'm not ruining anything for anyone, but Gru wins the unicorn for little Agnes.<br/><br/>Adorable, I know.<br/><br/>No kids movie would be complete without some sort of gas-passin' joke. This one comes in the form of a gun that when fired emits a large greenish cloud and makes a farting sound, to which Gru says ""I said dart gun, not"" well, you get it.<br/><br/>With laughs, warm fuzzies, bad guys, cute kids, and little green minions, Despicable Me gets the recipe for a great animated film just right.

","First off, where on earth did Steve Carell pull this performance from? Sure he's great in the office and I really like the guy. But here we have such a powerful performance from him in voice only that just doesn't sit well with anything I've seen him in before. He went from a funny guy that you can't help liking to a powerhouse of a performer dragging you by the scruff of the neck into the movie. I loved the voice he came up with for Gru so much. Everyone else puts in just faultless performances too. Russell Brand isn't a fave of mine, I avoid movies he stars in, just not my cup of comedy tea but he's superb here. Even bit parts like the fat Texan? lady that runs the girls home, the performances were superb.<br/><br/>And then we have the animation itself. I'm not sure whether it's the software that just took a technical leap in 2010 or not but the animation here is just Pixar perfect. You cannot fault it on any level. Everything from the imaginative, colourful set design, the brilliant character designs and the silky smooth emotion rich animation itself, it all just impresses the hell out of me.<br/><br/>The story while simplistic enough for younger children to follow, has such warmth and heart that you really can't poke holes in it either.<br/><br/>I adored this film and fell in love with the minions, the little girls and Gru. I'd happily have minion plushies on my couch and I'm an old fart of a guy. I keep saying ""It's so fluffy!"" to people and they look at me like I'm mad. I care not, they will eventually learn the line from the movie and if not, well there loss.<br/><br/>Recommended for anyone who has a heart, a love of animation or just digs really well made comedies."

","I admit I didn't like the title, but the trailers to Despicable Me did look like fun. I have no excuse on why I missed it in theatres, but dang, I wish I had seen it there.<br/><br/>This was a wonderful movie, all around. Even the movie's shortcomings were overcome. Such as: old story at first glance, but enough twists and personal stamps to make it original and the minions ALMOST overstayed their welcome before the inevitable sequel – like what happened to Scrat in Ice Age: The Meltdown. They didn't, thank goodness, and were kept fresh, fun, entertaining and great to watch through to the end.<br/><br/>You may not even like Steve Carell, but even here, in animated voices, he shows his comic genius and absolutely shows depth, much like what Robin Williams did in Aladdin.<br/><br/>The world's full of super-villains, as this movie cleverly focuses on, and ""poor"" Gru (Carell) is getting older and out-thieved by others so he schemes to steal the moon. Like that's been done before.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for him, right when he's getting shut out by the evil bank – what bank isn't these days – and his peers, a new rival appears in the same mold, but creatively different, as Syndrome from Pixar's The Incredibles and three girls come into his life that need adoption. This also sounds like Pixar's Up, but they take it in a different direction.<br/><br/>Sure, you know he'll grow to love the girls, but Carell (and the writers, of course – it is animated after all) does a wonderful job of showing the bond grow through deception – he needs them to penetrate his adversary, Vector's (Segel) not-so-secret lair for a device to shrink the moon.<br/><br/>It's been awhile that I saw a movie that made me want to put on ""repeat"" as Despicable Me did. And it wasn't a one-note film involving the cute and resourceful little, yellow minions that aid in Gru's plight. Sure, they were wonderful, as well, but as a whole, this movie is highly recommended to kids and adults. It's heartfelt, adventurous, absolutely hilarious, enormously creative and leaves you rooting for the bad guy. Let's hope they don't spoil the sequel with twice the number of minions forthere's already hundreds in this one."

","Despicable Me's first quarter is average and didn't really hook me much. However, the rest of the film improves and throughout remains a very good animated film. Carrel is amusing, and the best parts of the film involve him interacting with the three orphan girls. We know what to expect from this film, but it still remains very satisfying and the end credits are a blast to sit through. The kids were laughing throughout the film, and it seems as of this is more of a film for them than us. There are also some very touching moments, so in that respect check this film out. It may not be as great as Toy Story 3 or even How To Train Your Dragon, but it is definitely a strong addition to this year as far as animation goes."

","An animated feature that is not from Pixar, but is still really good? Yes it can happen! Despicable me might not have the values and depth of the movie ""Up"" or other Pixar movies, but on entertainment value alone this does not have to hide behind any other movie. I was a bit skeptical, but the movie really got to me.<br/><br/>Steve Carrell is adorable rather than frightening. And he does manage to walk the line between being cruel and a bit mean, but also still a nice and warm character. Kudos for writing him like that, but also for his voice performance (he does have an accent you see, one of his specialties apparently).<br/><br/>You might have seen quite a few scenes in the trailer, but there is still quite a few things to discover in the movie itself. Fun and light, but still with a few punches here and there. Sweet and sour so to speak. Open yourself up to the movie and you will relish the experience!"

","OK seriously. This is now at the top of my animated film list. I laughed so much in Despicable Me it was ridiculous. coming from the girl who hates all this 3D blah, blah,blah - this one has to be seen in 3D. I was a little nervous about seeing this one because the overall plot is indeed redundant in use, but I was pleasantly shocked. Gru stole my heart from the very beginning. I loved Agnes before I ever saw the movie. The whole thing just works. My family and I are huuuge movie buffs. If we like a film, we'll quote it from here to kingdom come. If we dislike it, your simply mentioning it is reason enough for you to be kicked out of the room. My niece & nephew (both of whom are over 18) and I were quoting almost the entire movie right after we saw it. Definitely one for the DVD collection. I loooove this movie!!!!"

","Though its materials are mostly cliché and have been used in Hollywood for a long time, Despicable Me delivers its high-class materials with charms, cute, and heartfelt style. Steve Carrell's voice performance is probably the better ones of voice performances I've seen in years. His cute minions also helped add to the film's quirkiness. Gru, a criminal mastermind voiced by Steve Carrell, was on his way to conquering the world when he ran into three orphan girls and adopted them. Margo, Edith, and Agnes was in a home since they can remember and being adopted by anyone at this point is a joy for them. But after staying with Gru for a day, the kids were horrified. After months of teaching and nurturing, the kids were able to get Gru to be nicer. The story progress with Gru choosing between his evil plan and his kids. It is heavily borrowed from other children films, but Despicable Me stabbed at the materials at a different angle and succeeded in bringing Hollywood something new. OscarBuzz: Best Animated Feature, I has a good chance of being nominated but winning is a long shot."

"NinjaCoachZ","1","21","73","31 July 2010"," A forgettable kids's movie.
","Despicable Me was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Scratch that, it was THE worst movie I have ever seen. It is in no way ""cute"", ""charming"", or even ""funny"". You can't be taken seriously when you're a CGI kids' movie starring a bald guy with a bizarre accent. It ruins the pitiful attempts at drama.<br/><br/>The voice actors seemed to have been hired based on recognition factor and not skill. Miranda Cosgrove's performance is unconvincing, and Jason Segal was cast clearly because of his comedic background. An experienced VA like Jack Angel could have been hired instead and nobody would tell the difference. Jack McBrayer has all of three lines. The main character ""Gru"" is the worst. Sure, in comedic parts, you can ignore his horrible accent, but the rare ""serious"" moments in the film are ruined because of this accent. The only good voice actor is Will Arnett, playing a stern boss. He's probably the only aspect of the movie I liked.<br/><br/>The characters are all ugly and none are memorable, visually. I had to look away from the screen at some parts. They were also one-dimensional. The three girls have no personality, and the minions are forced kid-appeal characters. Gru himself is flat. What's his motivation to become number one villain? The climax is particularly baffling, with one of the girls trying to choose between getting crushed by the moon, or jumping to stay with her sisters. The plot does not captivate imaginations, try anything new, or pump you up. The writing contains plot holes. What happened to the pyramid everyone made a big deal about? It's never returned! In addition, the movie contains several horrible sights. Gru's butt, Gru on the toilet, and Gru's smiley-face pantsu. Did we need to see any of that?<br/><br/>The comedy is basically toilet humour and minions getting into wacky shenanigans. A lot of it is really just padding; the movie could have been done as a 7-minute short and still be coherent. The hyped up ""IT'S SO FLUFFY"" yielded about two laughs and a cough at my theater. The only amusing part was Gru telling the girls to ""GET BACK IN THE KITCHEN"", and that wasn't even intentional. Maybe some (read: some) kids will find it entertaining, but only if they are between 3 and 9.<br/><br/>Overall, Despicable Me is forgettable. You're not going to look back on it years later and think, ""Man, that was a great experience."" You'll think ""Despicable Me is an example of how not to make a movie."" The only reason I gave it one star is because the rating system can't go lower. It's that bad."

","To anticipate the experience of viewing this film, imagine spending 2 hours listening to the The Chipmunks chattering away without stop. Except that the giggling creatures in the film are not the Chipmunks. They are violent and vicious, constantly clobbering each other.<br/><br/>To pick one example out of many : two characters appear on screen, one holding a hammer, the other a spike to be planted. The character with the hammer suddenly smacks the other character on the head with it. No reason. Just to get a 'laugh'.<br/><br/>To me, a most disconcerting thing was to see the Mom sitting next to me in the cinema with her two toddlers burst out laughing.<br/><br/>The violence in this film is not at all like what we used to see in Roadrunner cartoons. No attempt were made then to portray the Roadrunner or the Coyote as three-dimensional human beings. There was no possibility of associating the characters on screen with real people. <br/><br/>The attempts at humor"" in this film are more like that of the Three Stooges.

"MovieProductions","6","4","9","16 July 2010"," Amazing? Not even close, but ""Despicable"", it is not
","**1/2 out of (****)<br/><br/>Despicable Me is one of those movies that are completely disposable, but in the moment, are fun, lighthearted, and humorous. And in the end, that's really all you can ask for. Surprisingly, the third dimensions actually please both audiences: those who despise 3-D as a gimmick, and those who despise 3-D as just an ""in-depth"" experience. I can say that I really don't care where the third dimensions goes, but this is probably the best 3-D film since Avatar. Despite the 3-D, the film is still pretty decent. The performances are strong, the premise is actually original, and the movie moves at a smooth pace. However, it has nothing on ""How to Train Your Dragon"", also released from DreamWorks. Still, it is forgettable fun and while not mind-blowing, it still has substance.<br/><br/>""Despicable Me"" revolves around Gru (Carell), who wants to dethrone his opponent, who is also running for the world's most evil villain. Gru's plan is to steal the moon, but he adopts three children, which distract him from his plans. <br/><br/>First off, the premise may not be entirely inventive, but it's just a tad more original than most children's films. Furthermore, I thought this movie was entertaining. Yes, it started a little slow at the beginning, but near the middle, the film picks up momentum. Moreover, I thought the performances were strong. Even the antagonists were pretty likable. Additionally, like I mentioned, the 3-D is the best since Avatar, no hyperbole. This 3-D is not conversion, it was actually shot in Real D 3-D which is certainly refreshing. Also, I just love those little minions. They are hilarious and just steal the show. You could make a movie about them and nobody else, yet you'd still enjoy the film.<br/><br/>While the pros outweigh the cons, there are still some flaws. First off, the movie starts off a little tedious. It isn't a chore to sit through in the beginning, but nothing is incredibly entertaining. Furthermore, this movie's direction is uneven. The director has a plethora of ideas, but none of them stick together. It's just kind of all over the place. Moreover, this movie is way too predictable, but that's kind of what's expected. Also, it is a somewhat original, but a subplot or two has been used before, which was a little disappointing.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Despicable Me"" is a pretty enjoyable family film. The jokes aren't too shabby, the performances are strong, and the premise is a little original. The 3-D is also an added bonus. It doesn't pack a punch like ""How to Train Your Dragon"" or ""Toy Story 3"", but it's still worthwhile on its own merits. Amazing? Not even close, but ""Despicable"", it is not. Despicable Me gets a mild recommendation in my book."
"moviewizguy","7","3","6","24 July 2010"," It's so fluffy I'm gonna die!
","Gru delights in all things wicked. Armed with his arsenal of shrink rays, freeze rays, and battle-ready vehicles for land and air, he vanquishes all who stand in his way. Until the day he encounters the immense will of three little orphaned girls who look at him and see something that no one else has ever seen: a potential Dad. The world's greatest villain has just met his greatest challenge: three little girls named Margo, Edith and Agnes. (Universal Pictures)<br/><br/>DESPICABLE ME is a film that reminds us that it's okay to have an animated film that can be watched as nothing more than entertainment. It doesn't have the heavy handed themes of death and moving on like in TOY STORY 3 nor is it profound and enlightening like many Pixar films are. But that doesn't make the film bad. It's just light-hearted entertainment for the whole family to enjoy. When is that ever a crime?<br/><br/>The film sports an *gasp* original premise and succeeds mostly due to Ken Daurio's clever and comedic script. The characters are also very lovable. Steve Carell is excellent as Gru, the main character. He provides an excellent Russian accent and gives the character a big heart. Still, I felt that they could have done more with Jason Segel, Russell Brand, and especially Kristen Wiig. These actors are comedic gold and their characters ended up to be more underwhelming than hilarious. However, the minions stole the show, providing some of the film's biggest laughs. They were so cute! And speaking of cute, Agnes is my favorite character. She was so adorable.<br/><br/>I saw the film in 3D, and I have to say it was really good. It's used in both the gimmicky and subtle way, which I thought helped the film. Overall, it's nowhere near as good as TOY STORY 3 and HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON, both brilliant films. However, it's a really sweet film that just melts your heart. Parents should really take their kids to see it because you could do a lot worse. Watch the film if you want to have fun for an hour and a half."
"Quinoa1984","7","3","6","18 July 2010"," irresistibly cute and clever on a silly cartoon level and a few dark edges, no more no less
","Sometimes a movie can just aim to be adorable fun, and Despicable Me is nothing else if not that. The film features a hook-nosed villain named Gru who has a bunch of little yellow pill-shaped minions all with one eye and speak gibberish and who adopts a few cute little orphans so he can infiltrate the lair of a nerdy would-be villain named Victor (or ""Vector"" as he tries to call himself), and who ultimately loves the little rascally girls who just want the big guy to take care of them. It's like a fluffy little dark comedy, if that can possibly be combined, where the movies doesn't lose its edge entirely, but over the course of the story it gets fluffier, a little more heartfelt. But, thankfully, it's always funny. <br/><br/>Maybe it's funny in that silly old-style cartoon way where we see characters who are no good doing crazy things like trying to scale the walls of other no-goodniks. Or, as it really is, it's like one of those cartoons on the Cartoon Network only extended feature-length (think, perhaps, Dexter's Laboratory, which had a character wanting nothing but to be an evil mad-scientist and usually did pretty poorly at it; Gru as Dexter's bald uncle). Others out there may also think back to Lemony Snickett, which also featured a curmudgeon who becomes the ward of some kids and the kids start to get the better of him. This isn't Lemony Snicket, however, nor exactly Dexter's Lab or other cartoons. It's entirely familiar, but its original in its details.<br/><br/>The movie is aimed at children for a large part, but it also has a lot of jokes and just a general attitude at times for the adults. Gru early on is a Grinch-like character (there's an obvious connection to Seuss stories, a Lorax t-shirt seen included), and has a lot of mean-spirited quips at people or little tricks like a freeze-gun that are just delightful to watch. It's fun to see a character be as bad as he wants to be, and at the same time isn't very good at it - and, too, neither is his exercise-suit wearing nemesis, Victor. But it's pretty clear once those little yellow minions come into the fore-front, as do those little girls (especially the really small one with the love for her unicorn and bedtime stories about kittens) that it's a cute-fest. You want to hug this movie once you give in to it.<br/><br/>And whether or not you give in to it will probably determine how much you respond to it. It's a treat for kids, who will want the high- spirited comedy and the progression of the story of Gru becoming more and more likable (unlike the total grime of Lemony Snickett's character). For adults, the story will be familiar, especially if one's taken their kids to see something like it recently. Everything is done in good fun, and even the ending with its Bee Gees music playing during a dance recital is meant to give everyone a big smile. It's a minor treat following Toy Story 3, and a welcome respite from the likes of The Last Airbender as entertainments for the ""family"" this summer. Oh, and Steve Carrell is great by the way as Gru."

","This movie was so hysterical! Laughs rocked the room at every scene played for humor. The voice-overs were amazing and so was the lipsynching. Most of the humor revolved around the minions and Gru. For more humor see the 3-D version and sit through the credits and you will laugh your head off. Another fun part about Despicable Me is actually seeing the challenges criminals face. This experience makes you feel a lot different about the actions Gru makes. After hearing the wonderful pros of Despicable Me you might want to Know why it's not a perfect ten. The reason is the plot. Although the movie is funny the plot keeps it from reaching it's full potential. The plot is very basic and could have been more developed. So overall this movie is an eight out of ten."

They are just truly adorable, cute and funny. If you listen to their language, it's insanely hilarious. Their actions are truly silly and laughable. <br/><br/>The story is very clever. I truly loved it because it's different than most of the other children movies where the protagonist is a good guy rather than having a little bit of a twist where the main character is a villain. <br/><br/>Steve Carell's accents on Gru are also excellent. They're unique and amusing. Not only the sounds, the model for Gru is also cool. His nose is like so long that it looks strange like Pinnochio's. The three little orphans are also cute especially Agnes, the smallest one. Vector was also hilarious.<br/><br/>The 3D effects were also good. The depths were really seen and some of the scenes really got things towards the audience.

","Despicable Me is a short term film. It's playful, snappy, colourful and sporadically humorous. Watching it in 3D with my family was 95 mins well spent. Past that point it didn't offer much. Once the end credits rolled I barely gave the film a second thought. I have a feeling that a repeat viewing at home will render it dull and unwatchable. Well, for the parents at least. Only a few key moments have stuck with me since, but all of them can be found in the trailer anyway. This isn't to say the ephemeral Me isn't a movie worth watching, far from it in fact. It's just a very 'in-the-moment' experience, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.<br/><br/>Steve Carell supplies Gru with an intriguing Russian-esquire accent, it adds another level of fascination to the character but Carell is talented enough to not let it slip into a camp Bela Lugosi parody. Gru's voice defines him and seems to be a perfect match for the super-villain's physical appearance, I would be interested to know which came first. The rest of the voice cast are strangely forgettable. Julie Andrews and Russell Brand are unrecognisable as Gru's mother and elderly sidekick respectively, whilst Jason Segal doesn't conjure up any laughs as the nerdy Vector.<br/><br/>The animation is solid, if not groundbreaking. The creatively cute minions are visually funny and whenever they were on screen I had a smile on my face. Other images weren't as eye-catching as they should have been, such as Gru's stock-standard Addams family house and his over-sized automobile. The third dimension has been utilised well by directors Coffin and Renaud, depth is present throughout and the infrequent instances where an object lurches from the screen had the kiddies in awe, even if the adults won't find it all the spectacular.<br/><br/>Take the children and enjoy it while it's on, don't be expecting a lasting impression though.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"

","When you come out with an animated film weeks after the largest grossing animated film to date (Toy Story 3 if you live under a rock and haven't read this), your expectations have to be tempered. The same must be true when going to watch such a film. If you do, you will be pleasantly amused with Despicable Me. The film's plot is fairly original as super-villain Gru (voiced by Carell) learns to father three young girls that he has adopted in order to use for his dastardly plan to become the greatest thief of all time. The story is entertaining for both young and old. Children will enjoy the gentle humor and goofy minions while adults will sympathize with some of Gru's lot and will appreciate some of the jokes intended for a more mature audience (including a jab at the company formerly known as Lehman Brothers). The difference between this film and Carell's other recent ones is that it is not based solely upon his character. Gru is in no way similar to Michael Scott and so Carell can successfully create a character that has no ties to what made him big.<br/><br/>Despicable Me is a fun movie that does not try to do too much, but lets Carell break away from what seems to be a patterned typecast. Its humor is driven by good writing, and I'll say it again, good stories make good movies.<br/><br/>Check out this full review and all of my other reviews at http://clawandnussmoviereviews.blogspot.com/"

","It has something for the whole family, and there is no wasted space in it. The story is pretty simple - There is a self named ""super villain"" named Gru who wants to steal the moon, but his plan is being thwarted by another wannabe super villan - Vector. When Gru sees Vector's weakness for cookies, he figures his ticket into Vector's well armed castle to steal back a needed weapon are the three little orphan girls who sold him the cookies in the first place when they come back to deliver the cookies. So he has to adopt them in a hurry.<br/><br/>You can pretty much tell how this is going to play out from the beginning. Gru is not THAT bad of a bad guy. In fact, well placed flashbacks show it was negligent parenting by his mom that likely made him want to do big showy things in the first place. How bad could he be if he is taking care of dismissive mom in her old age?<br/><br/>So many of the characters are stereotypical - Vector the nerd villain, the evil morbidly obese banker, the older scientist working with Gru who gets confused about what kind of invention he is supposed to be building, and the three little girls who act delightfully on key for their ages.<br/><br/>The fun is in all of the one liners, the character development, and the minions. Before Universal Lucasized them into the main point of the franchise, the minions were delightful if unintelligible comic relief. Highly recommended."

","Despicable Me: 9 out of 10: Yes the movie that started an industry larger than some small nations GDPs Despicable Me is better remembered for what it launched than as a stand-alone movie itself. And that is a bit of a shame.<br/><br/>Despicable Me has one thing that none of the sequels had. A true villain. No, not the antagonist Vector I am talking about Gru. Gru, for at least the first half of this film, is a proper bad guy. When one of the girls apparently is crushed in a torture device Gru's reaction is that his scheme will still work with two of them. This, of course, gives Gru a proper character arc in this film which leads to taking out the tissues at the end. (Why is it always kids movies that start the waterworks with me).<br/><br/>The rest of the film is also top notch with the minions ( Yes a slightly less obnoxious version of Ubisoft's Rabbids) fully formed and delightful, Gru's evil cohorts delightful and a macabre world that seems to live just on this side of an Addam's family cartoon. The three girls are well drawn (character wise) with distinct and easily recognizable personalities and the whole story is some nice slapstick silliness with great call outs for the parent's in the room (That Godfather reference was particularly well placed)<br/><br/>Overall a great start to what ended up being a fun franchise that never was quite as good as its first outing."

I have to confess that against all expectations I found the film endearing and funny with a healthy dose of cynicism and sarcasm. Steve Carell and Russell Brand do a great job voicing the bad, Gru and his henchman (although it was ponied out to me at the start that the terrible Gru wasn't all bad). The animation is top notch and if i didn't find the baby like antics of the Minions particularly amusing, I could see their charm and enjoy the main protagonists falling over themselves to achieve their aims. Easy to enjoy and there is plenty of adult humour that sails over the heads of the very young (much as it did in the pantomime the next day)."

","The charming story of an evil genius who attempts to get revenge on another evil genius by adopting 3 orphaned girls. Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) is the complete evil genius, he has the car, he has the killer pet monster, he has a scientist to make evil weaponry, and he even has henchmen (or minions) to do his bidding. When a young upstart of an evil genius gets one over on Gru and steals the shrink ray that Gru has his eye on, a dish of revenge is prepared. Adopting 3 orphaned girls to fulfil his plan Gru never expects that his life will change as much as it does.<br/><br/>This is a great film, a beautiful imagination of what animation and creativity can produce. Gru is the perfect Evil Villain, the kind of bad guy you'd expect to be facing off against a James Bond or Batman. Steve Carell voices him with such charm, making him seem awkward but at the same time confidently menacing when required. Other stars have lent their voices to this film to great effect - Jason Segel, Julie Andrews, Will Arnett, Kristen Wigg, I would never have guessed without being told that Russell Brand voices Dr Lothario. The comedy and cute element of the film has to be the minions, they have clearly driven the film and have spawned their own movie and merchandise. Based on trailers, and against other animated films which try to make a cutesy/comedic element of the film the main driving force, it's nice to see that the minions didn't completely steal the show. You still have the film in its own right, with its own weight to drive the show forward - they just really compliment it.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this as an adult, and my 2 year old nephew enjoyed watching it too. It's a good family movie with enough adventure, action and humour to appeal to the entire family. I'd rate this as 8 out of 10 and could happily re-watch this anytime."

","A very sweet movie I'm certain that many can relate to in terms of 'adoption'. I wasn't adopted, but I spent almost 4 years in a foster home before my real parent came back to get me. So that feeling of abandonment was with me for many years and I saw myself relating to the three little girls in the orphanage. I finally figured out that it didn't matter after all. But I held a grudge for several years that finally dissipated with my own resolve.<br/><br/>So warm was this movie! It melts the heart when a father-figure (alone or together with a mate) wants to raise children with proper morality and values. Cool role modeling kind of movie!<br/><br/>I have not seen the sequels to this movie yet, but I probably will check them out at some point. The children were adorable, especially during bedtime and at the theme park when trying to win the unicorn stuffed animal, my favorite parts of the film. I recommend this film, especially to all 'wanna-be' dads and children who have come from parental or guardian 'abandonments'."

","The first Despicable Me movie kick-started Universal's most lucrative animation franchise, and the first one to have any real meat to it since The Land Before Time, and An American Tail. It's interesting that a film about a super-villain named Gru, voiced by Steve Carell, becomes Universal's biggest franchise since the Jurassic Park Back to the Future film series. Well, it's definitely worthy of being a successful franchise, even if it is just the original film in this case.<br/><br/>Despicable Me is a villain-lead film that gets away with some naughtily subtle humor relating to villainy. The story is this: Gru wants to pull of the greatest heist in history, in the form of stealing the Moon! That all changes when these three little girls come into his life; and they're very good at evading top-notch security. So, later on, he decides to adopt them and raise them as his own: at least as accomplices in crime.<br/><br/>Despicable Me is a nice little unique trip in the field of animation, and I can see why it's become a beloved classic since its release. Good for the kids, good for adults thanks to its subtleties and yeah, just watchable all-around."
"Horror-yo","7","0","0","30 March 2017"," Fine
","This sort of production needs a few things to be proper at all, and this here does tick those boxes fairly decently enough.<br/><br/>It's for kids and therefor ultimately it needs some form of moral that develops through the whole film, something you can see building and follow and finally come to a successful conclusion. It's well emphasized from the very title, to particular scenes, that the main character is terribly selfish so this is more of how he finds love through others, love he himself never received as a child from his parents, so that's well emphasized and well made, and important for children to assimilate at a young age. And it's done with emotion and sentiment here as to be more effective and long-lasting.<br/><br/>Another thing needed is a fun authentic universe of some sort: the minions introduced here in this one, along with the particular awfully caricatured character designs, so that box can be ticked as well.<br/><br/>Another thing would be humor. Obviously, this has a moral and everything but isn't a documentary. Voice actors like Steve Carell or Segel aren't picked for anything but to be amusing comedians, which they are, and so the jokes have to be there. The humor is fine, some of it is really funny but it's rare and most of it is pretty standard for this sort of thing.<br/><br/>Overall, one wouldn't call it rushed so much as it is very formulaic. You wouldn't imagine it would take all that much to produce such a story and characters, but eh, it's alright and it's got some substance and material to it.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

","When a new, unknown villain, steals the Great Pyramid of Giza other villains feel somewhat inadequate. One such villain is Gru, he has a plan to steal the Moon! Before he can do that he will have to steal a new shrink ray. He manages to get the ray but it is promptly stolen from him by young villain Vector. He tries to get it back but has no luck; then he sees three orphan girls get into his house while selling cookies. He swiftly hatches a plan; he will adopt the girls then infiltrate Vector's lair by getting them to deliver 'robot cookies'. Of course he has no idea how to deal with children but as he does things with them grows to care about them and must ultimately choose between the girls and the moon.<br/><br/>This film is lots of fun and not just because of the little yellow Minions that proved so popular they would later get a spin-off movie. The minions are lots of fun in a way that should amuse children and adults alike. Gru is a good protagonist and his character develops nicely throughout the film; early on we see him tormenting a crying child but by the end he is reading a story, which he has written himself, to the three girls. Gru's schemes are suitably over the top and both he and rival Vector have suitably villainous lairs. The three young girls were cute in a way that was fun rather than annoying. The animation looks really good and while there were moments that were probably designed to show off the 3D in the cinema they didn't seem too obvious when watching on television. The voice cast did a good job bringing their characters to life. Some of the jokes are a little bit crude but not excessively so; for example in one scene a minion photocopies his backside. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of animated film, both young and old alike."

The film also has the Minions, the villain's helpers. These adorable creatures speak an incomprehensible language and look curiously like cheese snacks in jeans, but they star in some of the film's most hilarious and absurd moments. The humor is intelligent, not forced or stupid and knows when to give way to the story in order to keep the film coherent and with a good rhythm. All the characters were very well thought out.

I smiled a lot, laughed frequently and even cried a little, learning that adults too can enjoy animated movies. It needs to be this way as children are drawn to watch animated movies and the adults are the ones who accompany the children when they go to watch the movies. There was lots of humour and ""silly"" parts which did not seem silly as it is animated and all is possible in animation. <br/><br/>Animated movies always accompany morals or life lessons and there are many you can gain from this film for example: family should stick together, nothing with great magnitude can be accomplished alone, when you give to others, you will receive, don't give up, and more! however I do not want to give spoilers as to how!"

","Despicable Me begins with the news revealing that an Egyptian pyramid was stolen. When super-villain Gru hears of this, his pride is wounded and he plans to pull the biggest heist of the century by stealing the Moon. Gru adopts three girls to fulfill this heist, soon to realize, after many events, that the moon is not more important than the three girls. As the movie comes to an end it is clear Gru has changed and it is all for the better that is.<br/><br/>Great comedy, brilliant animation, and killer actors/characters all make a great animated movie. It all in a way goes into a certain order a nice definite pattern: plot, characters, and then comedy. A movie is like a steak. The plot of the movie is the steak raw and uncooked. As time continues the steak is coated with different seasoning and is cooked, those are what characters are, the seasoning. To finish off the steak sauce is put on top, and that's what brings it all home, which makes the comedy like the sauce.<br/><br/>The plot of the story is simple. A villain wants to be the best villain, and in order to do that adopts three girls. As time moves on he falls in love with the girls and they become his daughters. By the end of the movie Gru drops his villain ways and becomes a great father. It is a nicely organized plot, the flowing of events, mostly everything seamlessly right after each other, for an example the scene in the lab where the ship grows back to size, to Dr. Nefario saving Gru with that ship and telling him about the after effects of the shrink ray. One or two things during the movie seemed a bit out of the blue though. For example the carnival visit stop, the girls have never been to a carnival before so begged Gru to allow them to go. Nothing new came out of the visit, except maybe the deepening of the bond between Gru and the girls.<br/><br/>""His (gru's) army of florescent yellow henchmen"", Gru's many helpers minions are a few of the most beloved characters off of the movie (Bob house, Despicable Me, Pluggedin). These little creatures are really what hold the comedic torch for the movie. Between speaking gibberish to each other, fighting each other, and working with each other the minions grow a strong character hold in the movie. Despite their very few showings. <br/><br/>A great character in the movie is Gru, ""a hunched super villain conducting all his plots from the suburbs""(Katey Rich, Despicable Me, CinemaBlend). Steve Carell, the voice of Gru, creates the best ""thickly accented Gru"" ever. He hits the perfect notes every time he opens his mouth. Three other great voice actors where the three adopted girls Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, Elsie Fisher ""They know exactly how to convey hurt, disappointment, joy, and wonder -- not an easy task for young actors""(Dulcie, Despicable Me, Commonsensemedia).<br/><br/>In light of all things said Despicable me is a great movie. The movie might be geared to younger aged children but it's definitely not just for them. This is a movie anyone can get into, it has the right characters. The right amount of comedy and silliness. And the perfectly picked actors for the characters."

He does this by trying to be the most evil villain and throughout the movie he progresses from being evil to showing parental qualities in which his mother never possessed, not only to the girls but also to the minions, knowing their names and personalities individually. At first he seems selfish, rude and evil but becomes kind and selfless putting his 3 girls first. The minions display the 'playful' and happy part in the dark twisted animation, they in fact form part of Grus family."

","Released in 2010, ""Despicable Me"" is an animated film about a strange eccentric, Gru, who wants to be the greatest villain on earth. His newest heist is to steal the moon, which is hampered by his annoying rival, Vector. To accomplish his goal, Gru adopts three girls from a local orphanage who have an unexpected impact on his nefarious goals and motives.<br/><br/>This is a great cartoon movie for the same reasons ""The Grinch Who Stole Christmas"" is so great: It's consistently amusing – and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny – plus it's a tale of redemption. The story reveals why Gru turned out the way he did; all he needed was a little affirmation and someone to open his heart. On top of this, the Minions are great.<br/><br/>The movie runs 95 minutes.<br/><br/>GRADE: A-"

","Animated family comedy movies usually follow a clichéd plot involving a happy-go-lucky hero who has an adventure which involves defeating an evil villain, and living happily ever after. Despite being shamelessly predictable and ridiculously simple, they are fun to watch and are favorites of many people. But what if we change the plot drastically, what if we destroyed the fun and jolly atmosphere of the movie, what if the hero is a character so grim and evil, despicable becomes an understatement? Would we enjoy the movie to the same extent, would we be able to accept the protagonist as the main character, and the most important question: will it still be fun to watch? If you want a movie which satisfies all the above constraints and is still an entertainer, Despicable Me is the movie you're looking for.<br/><br/>Despicable Me inherits the cheerful and simple plot usually associated with animated movies. Seems like a normal comedy movie, right? The catch lies in the movie's protagonist, he's an evil genius aiming to become the world's most infamous criminal, named Gru. Leading an army of hundreds of artificially created uncontrollable and ever hungry minions, ready to devour any thing in their way, Gru's journey to the top seems simple enough, but is it? Does it still seem like a cheerful animated movie? I would advise getting a check-up if it still does. Contrary to the description, the movie is simply hilarious, it'll amuse you till no end. Even though it has an evil villain as the main character, the atmosphere remains cheerful and light with the movie continuously entertaining with it's share of weirdness, for example, 1. Stuff happens and Gru eventually captures the moon. 2. Remember the army of minions? I apologize for the misleading description, but the minions are the cutest and most adorable things you would find in the movie, aptly put: they are angels of stupidity. Some people watch the movie only to witness their magnificence. One does not simply get enough of minions. 3. The rest of the movie...<br/><br/>The characters are quite unique, it's difficult to find resemblance with characters from other movies (with the exception of the little girls and some background characters) which makes the film all the more interesting. Our protagonist Gru, is shown as a grumpy, tall, bald man with blue eyes, long nose and broad, powerful physique. If his looks aren't enough to make you laugh, his accent promises to deliver the final blow. Other major characters include three girls who are subsequently adopted by Gru in order to aid in his super evil plan. They are kind, clever and also add another pinch of cuteness to the movie. They're involved in the emotional parts of the movie which make it more appealing. Even though, Gru and the girls are great, but the spotlight is stolen by the ever-so-lovely minions. These yellow creatures are incredibly funny to watch, almost all of the funny parts in the movie involve them in someway or the other. The way Gru treats the minions and the girls add another aspect to his character and proves that he isn't rotten to the core.<br/><br/>The movie has enough elements to remain interesting throughout. As mentioned earlier, it's filled with humor; even in parts which are supposed to be serious. There are a few emotional scenes related to the three girls, highlighting Gru's inner conflict between good and evil. All the elements fit well to give us a pack good enough to spend a couple of hours on.<br/><br/>In terms of technical details, the movie has great animation. The attention to details shows the hard work done by the creators to make it as enjoyable as possible. The clarity and sound effects are top- notch, as expected by Universal Studios. <br/><br/>Despicable Me promises to be an enjoyable package which is fun to watch with family and friends. It shows the gradual transformation of a villain into a loving father, even though the plot is simple, it is worth watching due to the wonderful characters, awesome graphics and of course, the Minions!"

","I love Animated films but for some reason I always have time getting around to seeing a lot of them. Some of the best movies being made are animated and they are always entertaining. Despicable Me and the entire franchise including those beloved and brutally overused Minions completely penetrate our entertainment world. Finally, my daughter just now getting into TV watching, we sat down to watch Despicable Me. She was down after a half hour but I kept watching and had a blast. I finally get the love for this movie. It is completely and utterly adorable, brilliantly performed by the vocal cast, so sweet and a ton of fun. The story was age appropriate and didn't even use a lot of hidden adult jokes or messages which a lot of animated films do nowadays. I would put this more in the camp of Toy Story where it made a smart, sweet movie that doesn't play down to kids and instead aims to impress and tell a great story. Despicable Me is also a unique story in that the villains are the heroes and of course we watch a world class villain overcome with redemption and love for three rambunctious little girls. I can't wait to watch the sequel!! <br/><br/>Steve Carell is absolutely one of my favourite comedians and actors in general. I don't think they could have chosen better for someone to voice the ""evil"" Gru. He brings passion and life and so much emotion to the character. His voice is recognizable but you'll come to know him as Gru before you know it. Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier and Elsie Fisher do a terrific job as the voices of the three little girls. Carell and the girls just completely draw you in and make you love this story. Jason Segal, Russell Brand, Julie Andrews and Kristen Wiig round out the main supporting cast and they are all fantastic. I think the important thing in an animated film is to be so good at voicing your character that you're indispensable to that character and everyone I mentioned is exactly that.<br/><br/>Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud direct the film and I can honestly say they obviously have a fantastic talent for this type of movie. They also do a majority of the work voicing the minions who are way more likable than I anticipated and have such distinct personalities and really balance out the comedy aspect of the film. Despicable Me is just so well put together with a wonderful story and great morals and just a little bit of edge (being all about villains.) Everyone can watch this and just have fun and all for the same reason and not for hidden innuendos. Absolutely should be a staple in any family library. 8.5/10"

","This film was the beginning to the super successful ""Despicable Me"" franchise. A second film followed three years later and right now we are experiencing the success of a prequel movie about the Minions. These Minions are probably the most famous aspect of the films so far, but I would not say they are the best really. It's just a perfect example of how to write animated characters. Really everybody from this film from five years ago is somewhat memorable: Gru, the Minions, the three girls, Vector, Vector's dad, the orphanage lady... And all these deliver in different areas. Gru carries the film, adds his own brand of humor, but also makes an impact in terms of drama as his transformation is the core of the film. Of course you could say that it was entirely predictable, but I did not feel that this takes away anything from the story or film in general. The three girls add some nice heart and emotions, but also lots of fun, especially in their interactions with the Minions. These Minions are the comedic soul of this film as all their scenes are really truly funny. Initially, I had a bit of a problem with the nerdy antagonist as he wasn't just convincing enough as the main villain, but looking at how this film is really about Gru becoming who he is at the end of the film and not about good defeats evil, it is fine the way it is. I guess that is also why we did not hear about Vector's dead at the end again, which is also okay, although I believe he is also interesting enough to carry his own film as the main antagonist.<br/><br/>""Despicable Me"" runs for roughly 90 minutes and mostly works because of the smart writing. I won't give specific scenes, but there are really a lot of funny moments from start to finish (just one: when the Minions ask for kisses too, this one also helps that the film does not seem to take itself too seriously). In terms of emotion, there are of course the scenes when Gru is in the room of the three girls and reads them a night time story, the unicorn references (especially the one at the amusement park) or when Gru sees his real priorities and he is in space and rushes back to Earth to see the girls' play. Will he get there on time? This movie is the beginning of a real success story for everybody involved with this project. Coffin and Renaud were fairly unknown before they made this (apart from an Oscar nomination in the Animated Short category), but it shows that one great idea can instantly give you a career and you can build on this idea for many years to come. And that's what they did. The cast was obviously not unknown at all. Steve Carell, Julie Andrews, Will Arnett, Kristen Wiig and the rest all had good careers in 2010 already, but this movie is nonetheless a worthy addition to their careers. I think this is truly a delightful watch, also for very young audiences, mostly thanks to the Minions. And you will find the usual approach of not becoming too serious if you take a look at characters swearing in here or how they bring back all the characters who seem to have disappeared. One minion defies gravity and flies up to the skies, but he is not dead. He is on the moon now still enjoying himself. And finally, the music is pretty good too. I especially enjoyed the song ""Despicable Me"", but this film also has some good music which already existed long before 2010. Certainly among the best animated films in recent history, I very much recommend ""Despicable Me""."

","Despicable Me (2010): Dir: Pierre Coffin, Chris Renaud / Voices: Steve Carell, Jason Segel, Russell Brand, Kristen Wiig, Will Arnett: Animated comedy about the temptation of wrong. Gru is an evil mastermind competing against a much younger villain foe. He is assisted by his many minion workers but as a secret weapon he adopts three girls in hopes of stealing back his shrink ray, which he plans to use on the moon. That is at least a different target as oppose to the heavily targeted planet Earth. Directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud who employ the latest animated film to hype comic affect out of an otherwise likable villain Steve Carell voices Gru to great comic effect until the predictable sentimental conclusion where he grows to love the girls and become a father. Jason Segel voices the young foe full of teenage delusions and an ability to counter Gru. Russell Brand voices the senile inventor who coaxes Gru to abandon right for wrong. Perhaps his change of heart later on is rather unconvincing but Brand is on target with the personality. Kristen Wigg voices the underused social worker. This is unfortunate since Wiig can be one of the brightest female comedians given the material but here she is not given a lot to work with. Will Arnett voices the president of the bank of evil and that is pretty much the extent of this character. The animation is simple but works especially since Gru bares great likeness to Dr. Evil of Austin Powers fame. It will appeal to families particularly with its grand theme of good over evil, which keeps the formula from becoming despicable. Score: 7 ½ / 10"

","This is an animated feature produced by Illuminations Entertainment for Universal. There will be spoilers ahead:<br/><br/>This film features an interesting variation on the whole super villain concept. For one thing, the super heroes don't seem to exist. The story revolves around Gru, a super villain who hasn't really been terribly successful at his calling. His mother, banker and assistant take great pains to remind him of this as often as possible.<br/><br/>A younger super villain named Vector steals Gru's thunder (and a pyramid) causing Gru's bank loan to be called. Who knew being a super villain was so challenging? Gru has cash flow problems, a lot of employees (most of them little yellow critters called Minions) and a deadline on his next project-stealing the moon, which has been a dream of his since he was a little super villain.<br/><br/>Enter plot twist, namely three orphaned sisters selling cookies. Gru turns them down. Then through a series of events, he decides he needs their help getting a shrink ray from Vector, so he visits the orphanage where they live, ""charms"" the rather obnoxious harridan running the place into letting him adopt them (a knowledge of Spanish makes one joke particularly good) and off they go to deliver cookies to Vector.<br/><br/>The girls stay with Gru long enough to grow on him and for them to become fond of him in turn, until the harridan takes them back. Much of the rest of the film deals with the stealing of the moon and a race against time to get to the girls' dance recital, which Gru has promised he would attend.<br/><br/>Vector manages to grab the three girls, demanding Gru give him the moon in exchange. There's a thrilling rescue of the girls by Gru and Vector's fate is most satisfactory, given that he's an arrogant twit. The ending of the film is rather touching and funny. I won't spoil it here.<br/><br/>This film is available on DVD and Blu Ray and is well worth watching. Most recommended."

","Gru thought he was the worst villain in the world and he enjoyed punishing people who got in his way even children. One day when he came back home, his old friend Dr. Nefario told him someone had stolen the pyramid, which enraged him, and he came downstairs to his secret lab. He told the minions, his yellow robot helpers, he was a bit upset about the missing pyramid and declared he would steal the moon as his crime of the century. But Dr. Nefario worried about the lack of funding. Gru went to the Bank of Evil and wanted to borrow money from Mr. Perkins, the owner of the bank. However, Mr. Perkins said he was too old to complete his plan unless he could steal the shrink ray first. Mr. Perkins also told him he preferred to support those young villains who were faster and stronger like the guy in orange on the sofa outside named Vector, who just stole the pyramid. Gru used his freezing gun to freeze Vector when he left.<br/><br/>Gru flew to East Asia with two minions and stole the shrink ray successfully. But on the way back home, Vector came and stole the shrink ray from Gru bringing it back to his fortress. Gru surveyed many times outside Vector's fortress but failed to get inside. One day he found three girls who sold cookies to Vector could easily get inside. He thought it would be a good chance and decided to adopt the three girls from Miss Hattie's House of Girls. He pretended to be a dentist and said something in Spanish which Miss Hattie thought meant she was beautiful. Miss Hattie was happy and gave him the girls. The girls did not like him at first because he did not look a father and was ugly. He asked Dr. Nefario to invent cookie robots and the girls to deliver them to Vector. The girls insisted they had to go to the dance class first. In the dance class, Agness gave Gru a ticket to the dance performance they would be in. After the class, Gru sent the girls to Vector's house and stole the shrink ray successfully. <br/><br/>On their way back home, the three girls wanted to go to the theme park and Gru thought it was a good place to abandon them. However the staff said he could not leave his daughters on the roller-coaster alone. His agenda failed and he had to play with the girls all the day. He began getting well with the girls. The girls also started to like him a bit. When he arrived home, he showed the shrink ray to Mr. Perkins when the girls appeared on the screen. Mr. Perkins refused to fund Gru and called his son Vector angrily to show the shrink ray. Vector found he was deceived and wanted to revenge. At the same time, Gru told the minions they would have no money and could not go to the moon. Agnes was sad and gave Gru her savings, three coins, which inspired other minions to chip in. Then Gru got enough money to build the rocket. <br/><br/>Dr. Nefario began to build the rocket while Gru was accompanying the girls. He wanted to put off the launching date because it coincided with the dancing performance. Dr. Nefario was angry with it and called Miss Hattie telling her the truth. Miss Hattie came and fetched the girls. Gru lost the girls sadly and the girls also left the house grudgingly. Then Gru flew to the moon on time and used shrink ray to steal the moon successfully. He went back in a hurry but found the girls had been kidnapped by Vector. At that time, Dr. Nefario realized the moon would return to its original size immediately and piloted a plane to save Gru and the girls. Finally the girls were saved by Gru and Vector was sent to the moon.<br/><br/>Gru was a real father now and he wrote a puppet book for the girls describing his love. <br/><br/>In my eyes, Gru was not a really bad person and can be a good father. His mother always ignored his effort when he was young. Gru made his efforts to become a villain so that his mom would be proud of him. It seems that Gru was a lovely person and eager to be loved. After being alone with the children for some time, he began to like them. Though he was unwilling to go to the theme park in the beginning, he was really happy when he came back home with the three kids. He read books to the kids, made special meals for them, and wanted to put off his plan that he had planned to the moon since he was a little boy. There are so much evidence that Gru can be a good father. It is a story about how children's love changed a ""villain."""

","Despicable Me better Than i expected, Steve Carell lends his voice to Gru, a self-professed evil genius, however, it becomes blatant that he's kind-hearted beneath it all. He's almost unrecognizable, putting on an accent of some sort, possibly Russian. He takes in three orphans in a bid to involve them in his next evil plan.<br/><br/>While the whole script is funny, it seems the writers gave Agnes the best jokes, which result in side-splitting laughter.<br/><br/>And here's why. It is incredibly rare to see a single dad portrayed in such a positive light. While Gru has an admittedly ""bad"" vocation, there are unbelievably sweet moments between him and the three children, probably aided by the juxtaposition of tiny girls to a large, ""bad"" guy.<br/><br/>A Must Watch MOVIE :)"

","Despicable Me is Super Funny and it will make the whole family laugh.If you have watched Despicable Me, You saw that Gru was evil, Gru (Steve Carrell) is the greatest villain in the world. Or at least he was until someone managed to steal the Great Pyramid of Giza and replace it with an inflatable substitute under the nose of the entire world. There's also a lot of sweetness to Despicable Me. The girls are cute, especially Agnes, the little unicorn-obsessed girl who bears some resemblance to Boo from Monsters Inc.she's got one of the best lines ""It's so fluffy!!!"" Despite all the film's weirdness, the relationship between Gru and the girl feels tender and real as it develops.Despicable Me scores extra points for quality animation. I really enjoyed this movie and I honestly think labeling it ""average"" or ""played it safe"" is quite unfair. Furthermore, the amount of screen time given to the minions gives the movie it's comedic charm. Without them, the movie would fall short of comedy, and be considered an emotional drag. i can relate tho this movie particularly because i can connect with girls. i grew up with a single parent so i know how it feels to want and search for that love and affection from your guardian.Overall it is a great flick for a family movie night that both parents and kids can enjoy without getting bored. i always say no work is perfect of course this movie could use some critiquing and could have been better, but i have to commend Pierre Coffin for his creativity and diversity displayed in this film."

There are gadgets, gizmo's, varying villains and sweet kids that finally melt mean Gru's heart. In some ways it shares sentiments with Scrooge.<br/><br/>The story is strong without it getting too schmaltzy and the animation is good."

","The star of the movie is Gru, who has an accent I think might be from East Berlin, but honestly, it's Steve Carell trying to sound sinister. Gru has evil-bad-guy tendencies, but he's on the same scale of evil as the Grinch. His evil exploits consist of stealing the Times Square megatron, and a couple Las Vegas landscape items. The other stars of the film are a trio of orphan girls: Margo, Edith, and Agnes. Apparently, you can show up to an orphanage in a doctor's lab coat, have your minions make up ridiculous facts, and get three daughters. <br/><br/>The story is pretty simplistic, and as a kid's movie, I wouldn't expect complex subplots. There are bits that are obviously meant to keep the adults engaged, such as the scene where Agnes gives Gru the ticket and he becomes the object of dance-mom-judgement. There are times of absolute absurdity (boogie robots, etc), and a lot of imagery that relates to children of all ages and genders. The comedy is also a good mix of dark humor from Gru, cute and childish humor from the girls, and slapstick from the minions. <br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes a good laugh, adorable walking Twinkies with eyes, and Julie Andrews playing a no-nonsense granny. However, if men in track suits, a woman that reminded me of Umbridge, and/or evil banks are not in your comfort zone, ignore this review and skip the film."

","This is one of my favourite films. I would say this is a comedy mainly because it makes me laugh so much.<br/><br/>I would rate this 8 stars because no film is perfect.

He has to choose between his job and 3 children. <br/><br/>The animation in the movie is great and the sound and visual effects are awesome.

","Gru (Steve Carell) is a horrible villain. Horrible as in he's not that good at it. He's petty. And when he is overtaken by another villain, he finds that he's not up to taking on Vector (Jason Segel). When he couldn't break into Vector's home, he notice 3 orphans selling cookies got in. So what's a respectable villain's suppose to do? Adopt them of course as part of an evil plan.<br/><br/>Gru is a weird character to like, and it's not that much fun to watch at first. His minions help a lot. Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) is also good. But it's the 3 orphans causing all kinds of problem that makes it all alright. It's pretty good animation work. And there's a good story of how a bad guy learn to love. It has its funny moments and it has the minions."

","How could anyone not love Despicable Me? I couldn't stop laughing long enough to actually watch the movie and understand the plot. But I did.<br/><br/>I am by far not a Steve Carell fan, but I am learning to love his movies. I liked Evan Almighty and 40 Year Old Virgin, they were pretty funny. Unfortunately, and I am probably in the minority, I never could get into The Office.<br/><br/>Anyway, I loved this movie. There aren't any parts of this movie I didn't like. I thought the animation was awesome. The script was great. The voice overs were exceptional.<br/><br/>The best part of the whole movie is... the minions. How could you not love these guys? I thought it was hilarious when the minion who floated out of the skylight kept showing back up. Or the three that went to the store dressed as a mother, father and baby to get a unicorn for Agnes (Elsie Fisher).<br/><br/>My favorite scene of the whole movie has to be when Gru (Steve Carell) gets talked into stopping at the amusement park. I couldn't stop laughing. The best part of that whole scene is when the three girls are trying to knock over the spaceship, but can't. The Carnival Barker (Jack McBrayer) makes condescending comments about how they can't knock over the ship. Gru takes it upon himself to win the top prize... a unicorn bigger than Agnes. Gru pulls out what I can only describe as a laser pulse cannon and fires at the spaceship. He basically disintegrates the whole booth and says, ""Knocked Oooover!"" Awesome!<br/><br/>I can't even pick any other scene I liked because I liked them all. Well, I didn't like the end. You know where the credits start rolling and you have to get out of the seat or turn off the DVD player. That was my least favorite part of the whole movie.<br/><br/>I give this 10 out of 10 stars."

The movie just went on like a dream and before I realized I have to wake up the dream was over. <br/><br/>It also shows what a person wants in life, goal vrs love and surely sometimes its hard to pull on both in life but you need to weigh your options.

","The story in this film is very strong as GRU wants the shrink ray to steal the moon. He adopts 3 young girls, and there is a subplot where he gradually becomes a better dad. And this movie is hilarious!<br/><br/>The animation in this film is absolutely phenomenal!!!! Especially since this is Illumination's first animated feature. The background is good, but the character animation sticks out more than anything, while they all look similar, The minions are insanely well animated.<br/><br/>The characters in this film are all strong. Firstly, there's Gru the main character. Steve Carrel's Russian accent is outstanding, making GRU a hilarious character. There's his sidekick, Dr. Neofario, voiced by Russell Brand, and he can be very funny from time to time. Then there's Margo, the oldest of the 3 girls that Gru adopts, she's the sensible one, and to be honest, the most forgettable. There's Edith, who's the middle child, who likes pink and is funny. And then there is Agnes, the unicorn obsessed youngest child. She is my second favorite character after the minions, who are impossible to hate! Then there is the villain Vector, he can be very funny from time to time.<br/><br/>This was amazing for illumination to start with this. It's just a shame that (seeing as I haven't seen the sequel yet) they haven't made any other good movie.

","I admit, I'm not the biggest fan of the current CG animated style, and based on that, outside of the occasional Pixar film, I don't always give new animated films a chance. I know I shouldn't think this way, but part of me can't help but lament the move away from the classic cel animation of the Disney era. I'm here to say this is one of the films I was wrong for neglecting.<br/><br/>I won't describe the plot, but once you read it for yourself it's pretty easy to see what direction the movie is headed in. Sadly, it's nothing new, but does that mean the film is not worth seeing at all? Absolutely not.<br/><br/>The film has a lot of laughs, and is also really cute, both the little girls and Gru's minions. Steve Carell does a good job here, and the voice actors for the kids are endearing. If there's one thing that I didn't like, something that tends to bug me in any animated movie, are the dance numbers to some techno/hip hop beat. There's a couple here, and yes they're bright and whimsical and kids will no doubt enjoy them, but I never really saw the point in them. I'm sure there's another joke that could be used in it's place, but it's not hugely detrimental to the film.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm happy I finally got around to watching this film. It was funny, cute, and I'll probably end up seeing the sequel on opening night."

","Yet another charming and funny animation based on comic-book-type super-villainy as Mr Bad Guy Groo gets side-tracked in his grand plan to steal the moon by the initially unwelcome intrusion into his life by three little orphan girls with a combined cute factor of about a bazillion. That last detail alone signposts in advance that sentimentality is going to play a major part in the story and sure enough it all ends happily if of course tearfully ever after.<br/><br/>Along the way, we get some terrific animation, the 3D version I watched being particularly impressive, with lots of inventive set-ups, none better than a roller-coaster ride simulation as well as Groo's final spaceship-to-spaceship rescue of his three charges at the end.<br/><br/>The essential aspect of humour doesn't fail either, the three distinct personalities of the orphans (one matronly, one pesky and one cute) offering plenty of scope for laughs, as do Groo's heart-of-stone mother (improbably voiced by Julie Andrews), his nerdy super-villain rival Vector, not forgetting Groo's mute but otherwise multi-faceted lemming-like bots. Less successful though, I thought was the characterisation of Groo's crime partner inventor Dr Nephario, although this may have a lot to do with my ingrained aversion to the non-talent that is Russell Brand.<br/><br/>I also found the soundtrack by Pharrell Williams (who he?) very Michael Jackson-lite, no doubt Justin Beiber's brand of baby-pop will feature in the sequel. No, I'll remember better the genuinely funny moments inserted just for us adults like Groo's bots rallying round with their worldly possessions to fund his master-plan to steal the moon, very ""It's A Wonderful Life"" where buffs will surely remember James Stewart also trying to lasso the moon for wife Donna Reed, likewise the nameplate for the Bank of Evil (which funds criminal plots), which bears the legend ""formerly Lehman Brothers"".<br/><br/>In the end though, all you can do is chalk up another plus to the animator whizz-kids who demonstrate yet again their ability to create another hugely entertaining, funny, occasionally witty and yes, family-friendly entertainment."

","Despicable Me Has some issues, but it's 80% amazing.<br/><br/>It touched me. And I don't remember Toy Story 3 provoking the same emotion or not even an emotion at all.<br/><br/>Visual art is clear and simple. At least at a first look. Because if you give it more attention you can see amazing lights, shadows and reflexes effects. Faces expressions are also pretty well expressive. Even when they're simple like moving half a lip. You can feel what the character are feeling. This is hard to get even from an good actor...<br/><br/>Soundtrack and other sound effect are also good. All voice acting are pretty well interpreted. Characters come alive.<br/><br/>But the best part are those woompa loompas Gru's little helpers. They're are really funny in every scene they appear. And it's amazing they could be design so funny looking just like yellow capsules. NICE! It's simple and they walk funny, express funny, and talk funny.<br/><br/>But Despicable Me misses on balance. If by one side, Gru doesn't take too little or too long to be attracted by the 3 little girls, the plot seems to forget very often the focus on how bad he is and his quest to steel the moon. Another issue is the way he does that could be better worked, because he spend just 5 to 10 movie minutes to do so.<br/><br/>Once he becomes a better person, everyone around him becomes Mr Nice Guy too, and that's boring.<br/><br/>Despicable Me is really a good movie and pretty well made, but some little issues takes away the chances for me to rate it as a 10."

The voice acting is well done and also well synced to the animation. One of the good things about this film is the fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously, although it does deal with some drama. Although, several things I didn't like were the amount of detail on the strange yellow minions was well underwhelming. Also by the end of the film the name ""Despicable Me"" doesn't seem to have much relevancy to the story. But, overall it is highly enjoyable and a great 3d experience as well.

","I recently watched 'Despicable Me' after a while of discussing it. I personally believed it would be such a childish book, full with bad effects etc. This movie proved me wrong. It contained great animations, a lovely storyline, great voice overs and great comedy. I recommend this movie to children of all ages. I, being a 14 year old loved it. The characters were very interesting, especially Gru being influenced by the children. The ending was a very sweet ending, and unlike many animated films, the characters were realistic.

"juliakhatri","9","0","0","28 November 2011"," Funny movie with unique characteristics
","Despicable Me (2010), directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud, is a film for all ages. It is extremely funny with jokes not only for children but for adults as well; such as the sign when entering the bank for villains: ""Bank of Evil, Formerly Known as Lehman Brothers."" The minions in the film are amusing. Mr. Gru, the villain, voiced by Steve Carell, is witty and bizarre. The contrast of different characters, such as evil Mr. Gru and hopeful Agnes also add humor to the movie. <br/><br/>Many children's movies are based on the same plot, a good hero and the evil villain. In Despicable Me, there are two evil villains against each other. Albeit, it is similar to other movies because the villain becomes amiable and kind in the end, but there are many factors that are different such as the three orphans, minions, and ""stealing of the moon."" It is certainly not a film that you have seen before and the ending, which was not shocking, was also not extremely predictable.<br/><br/>The film sends a message that even the evilest of people have a heart, a common reoccurring idea. We become sympathetic to Mr. Gru and love the characters even more. It also shows that bad guys finish last, not nice guys. These themes are age appropriate and still relevant to society today. <br/><br/>When entering the theater to watch Despicable Me, I hoped to laugh a lot. This expectation was definitely met. The characters, which each have a distinct personality, are hilarious. Vector's obnoxious attitude and pride, Agnes' innocence and optimism, and the minions' cuteness are comical. The ridiculous scenarios such as using a shrink ray to steal the moon, allow you to be immersed in the film. The animations, such as Mr. Gru's awkward body shape make the characters unique.<br/><br/>Despicable Me left me laughing throughout the whole movie, and still giggling when I think of it.There are so many aspects of it to love. It is worth watching twice because it is an actually funny comedy. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for pure comical entertainment."

Despicable is also the few other computer-animated films out their capable of taking on flagship studios like Dreamworks and Pixar. Don't think of Despicable Me as another lame family film because it's not, it's actually a good one. Kids will no doubt lap this one up as if it was melted chocolate and adults will find themselves entertained by this heart-warming,humorous and clever animation flick which borrows rather smartly from War bros. cartoons and other more higher-ranking studios as opposed to just ripping them off. Kids will obviously fall for the yellow minions in the film with Their cute looks, Irresponsible ways and bizarre native dialect. It also has some great voice talent from numerous A-list actors e.g Steve Carrel, Russel Brand and Jason Segal IF people were to look back at this film in say about 10 years time they will probably consider it the 5th best animated movie ever (Behind A Nightmare before Christmas, Shrek, South Park: Bigger,longer and uncut and of course Toy story umm.. what should I go for here Toy story 1, 2 or 3?

It is so nice not to have to deal with the lowest common denominator. I actually began to care about people who weren't really people. The plot is complex and interesting and there is one of my favorite themes: redemption. Like ""Up,"" we get to see why the character is the way he is. Human history--wonderful.

I mean, really Gru reminds me of an Addams Family (Fester, anyone?) character but he's got such a warm heart and sweet wit about him that makes me question the writers for the odd title.<br/><br/>So, basically Gru is a villain and he is outdone by another villain when the Egyptian pyramid is stolen and replaced with a balloon look-a-like. It brings Gru (Steve Carell) to the conclusion of him needing to steal the moon to give him back is nefarious reputation.<br/><br/>Jason Segel (from How I Met Your Mother fame) co-stars as the true villain of the movie Vector. He assumes control of the shrink-ray that Gru needs early on to shrink the moon in order to steal it. Gru gets the clever idea to use the girls Edith, Margo and Agnes to sell Vector robotic-cookies in order to steal the shrink-ray back.<br/><br/>This movie is full of touching moments as Gru grows as an adoptive father of the girls who eventually grow attached to him.

She is the only person they could have picked to pull of this character. She says all these witty things that only a Margo could say. She takes care of her sisters and is a great character to the story. Best Margo Line: ""What about the air? Can we touch the air?"" <br/><br/>Dana Gaier as Edith-Edith is a ruffian and just awesome. She is the tough one out of the three orphans and she is the one who has many funny moments. I think Dana did an excellent job playing her, she had a perfect voice to fit Edith's rough personality. Best Edith Lines: ""Oops"" ""It poked a hole in my juice box"" ""What? I'm just walking""<br/><br/>Elsie Fisher as Agnes-Elsie was really cute and adorable in this movie. Its hard to believe a girl this little could voice a character just as good as veteran actors such as Steve Carrell and Russell Brand. Most everyone knows her for her funny lines. Elsie Fisher is going to become a BIG star one day, mark my words. Best Agnes Lines: ""Does this count as annoying?"" ""Its so fluffy I'm gonna die!"" ""IT'S SO FLUFFY!"" ""My unicorn! You have to fix it!""<br/><br/>Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario-I was surprised when I heard Russell Brand played a super old guy. He didn't seem like his voice could pull off old. I will admit he did the worst acting in the movie but still a GOOD performance. His character was interesting, I guess. Best Dr. Nefario Lines: ""BOOGIE!"" ""I was wondering under what circumstances would we need this?"" <br/><br/>Kristen Wiig as Miss Hattie-Funny stuff! Every scene with Miss Hattie in it was funny and enjoyable. She had a great accent and such a funny personality. She seemed Despicable and desperate. Kristen Wiig did a great job as Miss Hattie and whoever did casting, I would pick them if I was making a movie. Kristen Wiig was perfect. Best Miss Hattie Lines: ""Look at my face! Do you still think it's a great sale day?!"" ""I purchased a Spanish dictionary. I didn't like what you said about me"" ""We wouldn't want to spend the weekend in the box of shame. Would we? No?"" ""Go clean something of mine""<br/><br/>Julie Andrews as Gru's Mom-Julie Andrews is too sweet to play such a Despicable woman. She crushed her son's dreams and laughed. I will make this one brief, good acting bad voice. Best Gru's Mom Lines: ""You're too late son. NASA isn't sending the monkeys anymore."" ""Eh""<br/><br/>GREAT MOVIE!!!!"

","This is one of the wonders we can do with technology. It is a hilarious movie with an actual storyline to go with the humor. The story, simple as it is, is one that cover all bases with both love and hate and all kinds of jokes. In the end it is also a feel-good movie with some cute scenes filled with adorable minions, kids, and annoying mothers. Steve Carell creates a funny character and with Russell Brand at his side they are unstoppable.<br/><br/>However, this is not a masterpiece that will change your life after watching it. It is just some cute animation with a storyline that makes your laugh. It's fun, not inspiring. But that is to be expected from an animated movie.<br/><br/>All in all, I would definitely recommend it if you want to spend an hour and a half of your life just watching some good old fashioned animated comedy. <br/><br/>I liked it and I have no problem watching it again!"
"jdkraus","8","0","0","24 March 2011"," A funny, entertaining film...and that is not all
","Being honest, I did not see this feature in theaters because it looked dumb. A short while back, a relative received a copy of it from Netflex and we watched it. It has been two months since I lost saw this movie and I cannot help but keep thinking about it. <br/><br/>""Despicable Me"" is almost purely a funny movie. The humor does not just come from the sight gags (particularly from the light bulb shaped minions); it also comes from the ridiculousness of the plot itself. Going even further, the characters have a retro appearance that take me back to days of Pixar's release of The ""Incredibles."" The main character has a bulky figure, but thin legs. The antagonist looks like a nerd from the show ""The Big Bang Theory."" The mad scientist looks like an older Chris Lloyd from ""Back to the Future"". You get where I am going with this—blatant caricatures. The film even incorporates violence to the point that it is classic slapstick.<br/><br/>But what really make this animated feature so good are the story and the emotions it brings to the table. Without giving any of it way, the movie brings up the question: Can a criminal mastermind develop love for orphaned children? There is such strong development and emotions in the characters that they almost brought me to tears. What I am trying to say is, I really care for characters. When I see them happy, I feel happy. When I see them sad, I feel sad. When they are danger, I fear for their lives.<br/><br/>This feature really shows that it doesn't take a famous animation studio like Pixar to make a really good animated film. There are two things that bug me about this feature though. For one, the adoption agency is shown in a negative light. This may offend some people, particularly individuals who have been adopted. Second, some of the humor is a bit inappropriate and crude for an animated feature. The Shrek films incorporate fart jokes, no biggie, but ""Despicable Me"" includes some innuendos and even a scene where characters scan their butts for amusement—this is unnecessary for a family-oriented animated film. This is a good film, but some of the quirks I listed above drag its score down some. It is obvious that Toy Story 3 would win for Best Animated Feature and it did (rightfully so). However, this should have received an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****"

","Despicable Me is one of a few animated movies I really have no excitement to watch at all. Another one for me is ""How to Train your dragon"". This probably may be due to their uninteresting titles to my liking. Anywho, I cannot imagine not to watch them more than once afterwards.<br/><br/>First off, Despicable Me does have a number of dark and crude jokes mixed with sentimental moments among the characters. I feel for those poor little girls: Margo, Edith and Agnes for being orphans and residing at the orphanage owned by ""Miss Hatties"". This reminds me of the movie named ""Meet the Robinsons"" (2007) at which the protagonist is an orphan too.<br/><br/>The pace of this movie is very fast and the heart-melting process is as powerful. For a record, I love how this process slowly creeps into Gru's heart. I am amazed how Supervillain can live in harmony with those 3 girls and even changed his attitude towards life.<br/><br/>To wrap up, I would regret not watching this movie because it is simply phenomenal, eye-opening and wonderfully inspirational. It makes me aware more of those desperate orphans waiting to be adopted. I could see how normal kids with moms and dads can be proud of themselves and live the moment for their future with better chance and faith than those 3 little girls. Lastly, the soundtracks by Pharrell and scores by Hans Zimmer have a strong impact on how one may experience and consume this movie with greater excitement. They are all well-composed and suited to every single scenes appearing in the movie. In particular, I love the unique scores for 3 little girl's and vector's appearances. They are simply thoughtful of the movie producer.<br/><br/>Cheers,"

","Well, I am not the one to write a review on a animation stories. Not because I don't watch them. Just because I haven't seen a really good one for a long time. <br/><br/>I am not a fan of Shrek Forever and other movies that already remind you a television short series, because the producers made not only part 1 & 2 but you already see par 5 in the theaters. But anyway... we are talking not about this...<br/><br/>The last animation movie that i was so impressed was ""UP"" and now I got to see this delicious, funny and warm animation - ""Despicable me"".<br/><br/>This movie is suited for all family members - everyone will find something for his/her taste. It's funny, sometimes absurd (for adults) but very reasonable for children.<br/><br/>Villain, who wants to steal the moon? Sounds absurd? But why? From a child's point of view - everything is possible. So if you are an adult - just relax and enjoy the comedy and try to remember - how it was to be a child.<br/><br/>It's a funny and warm story, that you definitely must see."

","The first trailer of Despicable Me got me interested in this movie about a super-villain who faces a younger competitor. The tussle between the two super-villains reminded me of the Spy Vs. Spy series which I liked reading. Was expecting something on those lines but was pleasantly surprised with the role of the three little girls in the movie! They were really adorable! The movie starts off good and eventually settles down to the main objective of Gru, the protagonist. Three little girls enter into his life who turn his life upside down, changing him in the process. The role of his army of minions is quite amusing. I particularly liked the climax! The screenplay felt a little rugged though.<br/><br/>Simply loved watching Despicable Me.

","Annoying minions. Ugly dad both inside and outside. The girls make this a kids movie more than Megamind. The child abuse is unacceptable. It was predicable and not funny.<br/><br/>A mysterious criminal mastermind has stolen one of the pyramids in Egypt, sparking a fit of jealous envy in evil genius Gru (Steve Carell), who hasn't managed to make headlines since he and his minions swiped the Times Square JumboTron years back. Ever since Gru was a little boy, he dreamed of going to the moon. Now, if Gru can just build a rocket and get his hands on a powerful shrink-ray, he can cement his reputation as the greatest thief who ever lived by stealing the Earth's satellite right out of the sky. But immediately after Gru heists the shrink-ray, the cunning super-nerd Vector (Jason Segel) swoops in and snatches it right out of his hands. Now, in order to claim the moon, Gru must first reacquire the weapon from Vector. Armed with the knowledge that his nemesis has a mean sweet tooth, Gru adopts cookie-selling orphans Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Agnes (Elsie Fisher), and Edith (Dana Gaier) and commissions a new line of cookie robots from the evil Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand), his personal weapons specialist. But as Gru and his diminutive yellow minions prepare to carry out the biggest heist in history, something strange happens. Gru discovers that the three little girls who have come into his life are much more than simple pawns. They actually seem to care about Gru, and it turns out the scheming evildoer makes a pretty good father. When Gru realizes that his upcoming moon mission clashes with a ballet performance by the girls, he must decide what's more important -- being a present parent or cementing his nefarious reputation once and for all.<br/><br/>My recommendation is to skip this and rent Megamind instead. It's more for adults because it has superheroes in it."

","All the trite and worn clichés of pseudo-child comedies were well noted by top professional film reviewers like, A. O. Scott (NYT). While full of hi-tech 3-D whiz and an ensemble of hyperbole to promote a mass-market money maker, this film has grave dangers for both children and adult former victims of child abuse. <br/><br/>A bright 3 year old girl continually asked her mum and aunt ""is this supposed to be funny"". The aunt who had been a child victim of male sexual abuse was thoroughly traumatized by the main character's domination and exploitative treatment of the girls, which expressed a subtext playing on well-known characteristics of child abuse and abuser syndromes. <br/><br/>in both speech and attitude as well as animated representation, the little female characters displayed many behavioral modalities of submission and coquettishness characteristic of the fear and seduction of sexually abused girls. Such characteristics may be commonly embedded during the child's experience with a male abuser, most often a family member, yet held onto during adulthood. Combined with fears generated by the abuser, and feelings of guilt, these traits are deeply embedded and difficult to release even through therapy, hindering may women from experiencing safety and fulfillment in adult relationships.<br/><br/>Have these presentations of stereotypical characteristics commonly related to child sexual abuse and abusers been overlooked, or merely submerged as titillation to mass audiences experiencing emotional responses they cannot dare to express?<br/><br/>Shown before an audience of psychiatric and social work professionals in the fields of child sexual abuse, and mature abuse victims, this film would most probably be labeled as inappropriate for general audiences with warnings attached as to the covert messages embedded within layers of trivial high tech stimulation. Should such verbal innuendo, body language, proxemics and social interactions as portrayed in this film be observed in Roman Catholic priests, they would soon be investigated and perhaps prosecuted."

Hate that evil is being mocked in such a way. I wish movies like this and Megamind would just go away. I guess it's OK for actual kids to see. But for the rest of us, just leave it be. The biggest question for me, is why did I see this movie?<br/><br/>In all seriousness, this is a kiddy movie, and very good for small children if you have them. But that's where it's value ends.

"TheUnknown837-1","5","2","5","25 December 2010"," ""Despicable Me"" has some bursts of brilliance and originality, but it is an overall undernourished film. Kids will like it, though
","The magic of Pixar's movies (the ""Toy Story"" franchise, ""Monsters Inc."", ""Finding Nemo"") is that they care. They really do. They care about film and they care about their audiences. They do not just assume that because their intentions are good that the movie will work. They make sure they work. And if Universal Pictures is to make their next animated film better the the near-wholly unsatisfying ""Despicable Me,"" they are going to have to keep that in mind. This is a family entertainment picture with good intentions, splendid animation, some wit, and some genuine laughs. But when compared with the plethora of recent great animated family features, ""Despicable Me"" is a pretty heavy letdown.<br/><br/>Almost every adult in ""Despicable Me"" has a vague resemblance to an animal. Gru (voice of Steve Carrell) is a hunchbacked would-be villain with a face like a frog - if you'll excuse his elongated, pointy nose. His assistant is an old doctor hard on the hearing (voice of Russell Brand) who resembles an age-worn owl. He also has an army of jelly bean-like minions at his service. Anyway, whatever. Gru is jealous of another villain's feat and wants to commit the ultimate theft: stealing the moon. The plot thickens and Gru ends up adopting three little orphans in order to accomplish his task. But, as you'd expect, when a hardheaded curmudgeon takes little kids into his house, he starts to soften up.<br/><br/>I think the movie's death culminated, for me, with the arrival of the three little girls. Why was that? Because instead of being cute, funny, and lovable - instead of making me want to hug them - they came across as unctuous, irritable, and utterly devoid of depth. They are like the annoying little kids down the street whom I never socialized. I never learned anything about them except that they could drive me up the wall in a heartbeat and that I never wanted to learn anything more about them other than that fact. The girls are separated by a few years and the older they get, the more annoying they get.<br/><br/>But they are not the movie's only problem. Gru has his moments as a funny character (credit Steve Carrell's mastery of humor) and his interludes with the old-as-dirt doctor and his gullible little minions are (most of the time) very funny, they simply are neither frequent enough nor fresh enough. Apart from that, there is simply not an energetic enough story to keep interest. The movie whips along at a fast clocking time, but more like somebody racing to get out of the doctor's office, not racing an exciting marathon. Gru has nemeses which include another hack-villain with a fetish for guns and aquatic creatures and a jowled bank manager with a vague resemblance to Dilbert's pointy-haired boss. These subplots never go into or out of anywhere and potentially great jokes are wasted.<br/><br/>Now there *are* some hilarious individual moments in ""Despicable Me."" There are bursts of gut-busting humor. However, the unfortunate reason why it does not work is because the rest is really quite a bore. It's innocent, harmless, and will not affont anybody. And the kids will more than likely enjoy it. When the movie was released earlier this year, I dropped my sister and her friend off and went and saw Angelina Jolie in ""Salt."" In hindsight, having seen the movie at home, I commend my own decision. It just did not work for me. And I think there's a scene in the movie which parallels my exact reaction throughout most of the picture. The other hack-villain picks up his shotgun which shoots out squids (not kidding). He outlays his plan - a potential moment for humor - and the squid rolls his eyes.<br/><br/>""Puh-lease!"" thought the squid. ""Puh-lease!"" thought me."

","""Despicable Me"" really is an animated family comedy. With such a simple, but clever, storyline of villain vs. villain, it is just a kids movie despite the many stars for attraction of an older audience.<br/><br/>It is full of funny lines, which are not unsuitable or over kids' heads. Adults will be able to appropriately laugh throughout the film along with all the other kids. So many recent animated family comedies have claimed its funny for the adults and kids, but they have different jokes for them. Jokes that are inappropriate for kids that they don't understand and they sit there confused as their parents laugh at mature humour. The great thing about ""Despicable Me"" is that it's one of the first where it's so well written that it's the same jokes that the adults and kids will be laughing at. These jokes are sweet, simple and genuinely funny.<br/><br/>Steve Carell is great as Gru, the struggling villain, who comes up with ludicrous plans to become a super villain. I was particularly impressed with Jason Segel as Vector, the super villain (who commits crimes with direction and magnitude). The original songs written for this movie are also catchy and humorous.<br/><br/>I highly recommend ""Despicable Me"" for its ""pure"" comedy."

It may seem like your average, overrated animated feature, but I assure you, it is not. The story line is unique, the voices (particularly Steve Carrell as Gru, the main character) are top-notch, and the animation is just superb. And those little mignons, who I thought would be just an annoying, pointless addition to the film, were so funny and lovable! I loved all 90-some odd minutes of the film- my eyes were glued to the screen. This film can be loved and appreciated by all ages- young, old, and everything in between.

Can a super villain be a father? What follows is an adventure that is mostly predictable , although it is enjoyable in every way. The three girls are indeed very cute and Steve carell does a fine job in giving life to Gru. The 3D is impressive if not breathtaking. It's only the story that lags slightly in the beginning although funny dialogues and loads of slapstick humor make up for it.<br/><br/>In Conclusion, it is understandable if 'Despicable me' is not appealing to all adults.

","I have been known to anticipate animated movies, and with there being so many new companies getting into the animation game the selection is becoming wider. Despicable Me is an entertaining story about a not-so-evil evil scientist that tries to pull off the crime of the century by stealing the moon. The trailers told you all of that.<br/><br/>This movie has a lot of character to it. The funny scenes that draw you into the movie in the trailers are in the actual movie, and that is a nice surprise. The animation looks like a high-tech animated movie as opposed to trying to make everything look real. That is one of the problems I have always had with the Toy Story franchise. They look too real. There is no shame in making a cartoon look like a cartoon.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie, or at least the voice acting, is done very well. New-comer Russell Brand gives life to a very interesting character in Dr. Nefario. The age jokes at Nefario's expense do not seem over-bearing, and anything that leads to boogie-bots cannot be all bad. Let us not forget the dart gun either.<br/><br/>I like Steve Carell. He is not always given the best material ( Evan Almighty and 40 Year Old Virgin ), but he manages to turn his roles into something memorable. Carell is reaching the point where I will go see a movie just because he is in it. He is kind of the anti-Will Ferrell of the comedy business.<br/><br/>What steals the movie in Despicable Me are the minions. They are the little yellow one-eyed and two-eyed guys you see in the commercials and the trailers. They don't speak English, but that definitely does not lessen their effect. They are fiercely loyal to Gru (Carell's character) and they seem to take his experiments in stride. The minions even dress up and head out to a department store in one of the more memorable scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>The thing about this movie is that they do not always go for the one-time quick joke. There are several jokes that run throughout the movie, and that work very well. This is an entertaining movie for adults and children, it delivers entertainment worth the money you spend, it definitely does not drag itself out as new movies seem to and it is most definitely very, very fluffy. Go check this one out, you will not be disappointed."

","Considering that when I walked into the theater I had absolutely no expectations at all for Despicable Me, I actually found it to be a really enjoyable film. It was in my opinion a similar story to ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"", which in the end was one of my bigger problems with the film. This same story has been told before! Not only that, but many, many times has a similar story to this been told. Now don't get me wrong the story that they are telling is a great one, but it gets a little old sometimes, that being why I thought Despicable Me lacked creativity. Also, I have seen a good bit of people say that this movie is ""heart warming"", which I definitely thought the story was, but in my opinion Steve Carell's performance lacked a lot of feeling. Not to say that his performance was bad, because it was just the opposite. It was a good, and funny performance on his part. I am not trying to say this was a bad movie, because it was not at all. And even most of the things I am complaining about not being in the film were not intended to be in the film, so I cannot really say anything against the makers behind this movie, because they did a very good job with it. So overall Despicable Me was one of the better movies of the summer, it was nothing compared to Toy Story 3, but still a good movie that a lot of people of all ages will enjoy."

","Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) is rather despicable. If the line at the coffee shop is too long, he whips out his ""freeze gun"" and turns everyone into large ice cubes while he rushes to the front position, among other shady deeds. An inventor of devices for criminal pursuits, his underground laboratory houses his partner, Dr. Nefarious (Russell Brand) and a virtual army of darling, intelligent little robots. From there, they work out their strategies, such as stealing a replica of the Statue of Liberty from Vegas. Ho, ho what a feat! Now, however, they have a rival, Vector (Jason Segel). This young whippersnapper made off with one of the actual pyramids of Giza, leaving a blown-up, balloon model in its place. Vec also pilfered the world's first ""shrinking"" machine, which Gru coveted in his quest to steal the moon. Is Gru and his team slipping? Even his own mother (Julie Andrews) makes fun of him! Heading over to Vector's place for a confrontation, Gru can't break into the heavily guarded and inventively fortressed abode. But, when he spies three little orphan girls gain entrance, selling cookies, Gru gets an even more despicable idea. He will ""adopt"" these wee gals and use them to infiltrate Vec's place, nabbing the shrink gun. What he doesn't suspect is that his new daughters, Agnes, Margo and Edith, will actually start pulling on his own heartstrings! Will Gru stay despicable forever? This darling film has a wagonload of assets and will please most every viewer. First, Carell is simply brilliant as Gru, will he be even considered at Oscar time for an animated role? I hope so! The supporting cast is also truly terrific, with Segel, Will Arnett, Andrews, and especially Brand doing great work. Brand is a complete surprise, by the way, with a part that is far removed from his more typical film roles. The voices of the three little girls are also delightful. Next, the animation is sensational, being vibrant, creative, and, artistically, topnotch. In short, its awesome. Then, too, the tiny, robotic helpers of Gru will send even the most hard of hearts into a fit of giggles. Finally, the clever story and the unflagging direction complete the elements for a most successful animated movie. Perhaps, there will be those who object to the abundance of ""cartoon-like"" violence and some of the images, such as the appearance of an impaling box. Therefore, parents do be careful about letting very young kids watch the flick. But, all in all, here is another great leap forward in the realm of animation. Don't be despicable in your own family. Reach into your wallet and pony up for tickets for those you love."

","Chris Melandandri, the executive producer who bought us Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs and Horton hears a Who, brings us a new animated movie in the form of Despicable me. I hadn't heard of this movie until I saw the trailer when I'd gone to watch Toy Story 3. It looked interesting but didn't tickle my curiosity enough to make me want to go to the theater to watch it. Then on one lazy Friday night, me and my siblings decided to go watch a movie and Despicable me was the only one that fit the bill as my 4 year old niece was to accompany us. A late night show, the theater was full of easily tickled idiots which meant it wasn't the best environment to watch an average movie.<br/><br/>Stealing the moon, the greatest heist ever destined to make Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), with the help an aging scientist Dr. Nefario (voiced by Russel Brand), and an army of minions (voiced by directors Peiere Coffin and Chris Reneud, and Jermain Clement), the world's greatest villain. But before all of that, he needs a loan from the 'Bank of Evil' (formerly known as Lehman Brothers) run by Mr. Perkins(voiced by Will Arnett) who happens to be Vector's (voiced by Jason Segel) father, the new villain on the block and Gru's arch nemesis who had stolen the Great Pyramid of Giza to become the world's current greatest villain. In order to achieve his goal, Gru adopts three orphans, Margo (voiced by Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (voiced by Elsie Fisher) who after an initial edgy period falls in love with them. I won't go more in detail and spoil the fun for the readers so that's enough of a spoiler.<br/><br/>The story was humdrum in most places which is generally the case with animated movies but the problem with Despicable me is the lack of any stand out characters. Apart from Gru, the minions and Agnes, the rest of the characters were a little *done to death*. Some of the human gags fell flat while the emotional moments were cute in patches (basically Agnes was the only one who shined). The minions were by far the best element/s of the movie which made it an almost above average movie. Their almost gibberish talk, funny antics and innocence was refreshing. <br/><br/>Possibly a movie I wouldn't have preferred watching in the theater but I wouldn't call it a waste of money either. It was a feel good movie that doesn't leave a bad taste in your mouth later (if that makes any sense)."

His plan to steal the moon is about the cleverest comment on how much we have stolen, innocence among the treasures; the moon is all we have left to lose. But there is also something else to be stolen—Gru's heart—and that's easily filched by Agnes, Margo, and Edith, orphans selling the equivalent of girl scout cookies but sub textually a heart for a villain who doesn't know yet it's a loving parent's.<br/><br/>You'll have to see how he steals the moon and the girls' affection because these improbable actions come straight from a child's sense of how the universe is really run. As in the sequences of Gru reading bad kiddy lit to the girls, the screenplay could have been an insult to child intelligence—it's not.<br/><br/>It's so good that so far two of the best films of the summer and maybe the year have been 3-D animations from Pixar and Universal, its first and I hope not its last."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Can't imagine there ever will be, but if there were to be a court trial against Pixar claiming unfair world animation domination, ""Despicable Me"" would surely be logged as Evidence A. Having the unfortunate luck of being released in the same year as Pixar's masterpiece ""Toy Story 3"", this is a fine children's film, but just no match.<br/><br/>I am happy to report that the kids in the theatre seemed to respond very well to this one ... especially the Minions. If you have been to a movie in the past year, you have probably been exposed to the Minions - a group of cute, yellow tennis ball-looking creatures with either one or two eyes, a unique squeaking language and an infectious giggle/laugh. I found them to be the highlight of the movie as well.<br/><br/>Basic story has Gru (Steve Carell voice) on a mission to be the world's best villain. He has had some success, but has been a financial disaster. We learn this when he visits the Bank of Evil and they reject his loan for his newest project - stealing the moon! Gru is in competition with a new, younger evil mastermind named Vector (Jason Segel voice). Gru and his inventor Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) are a step behind in technology, but manage to come up with a strategy.<br/><br/>The plan involves cookie-selling orphans who Gru adopts. The story is pretty simple in that he initially plans to use them to trap Vector, but of course, Gru is the one who has his heart stolen by the 3 girls.<br/><br/>It's mostly a cute presentation of a very simple story. Younger kids will get a kick out of it ... and don't seem to be as annoyed at Steve Carell's odd accent as I was. It comes across as a cross between Russian and German, but is easily enough understood.<br/><br/>Don't expect the brilliance of Pixar, but it will entertain the youngsters."
"Pumpkin_Man","10","2","6","13 July 2010"," Awesome Family Fun!!!
","I saw this with my friends, and the movie was actually a lot better than I expected. It's very funny, and has a great heart-warming storyline. The minions were hilarious and adorable. Steve Carell stars as Gru. Gru is a supervillian who tries to compete with Vector. Vector stole the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, so Gru tries to beat him. He comes up with a plan to steal the moon. After he attempts to steal a shrink ray from Vector, he adopts Margo, Edith, and Agnes so he can use them to give boxes of robot cookies to Vector. After he succeeds, he tries to get rid of the kids, but he slowly begins to think like a dad and loves them. He soon must decide what is more important; being a supervillian, or being a superdad. I highly recommend DESPICABLE ME!!!"

","This is by far the studio's best film. There are a couple more Illumination films I like (namely The Lorax and kinda Despicable Me 2) but everything else they've produced is painfully average.

It doesn't wow you, doesn't make you laugh more than a moderate number of times, sorta gets repetitive and is tremendously predictive. <br/><br/>Yes, the animation was really good. But sadly that's not gonna cut it anymore cause let's face it, the 3D effects and animations of every single film has been outstanding over the past couple of years. <br/><br/>The movie tried really hard but fell short at pleasing me or hitting the right notes.

","Did not find the villain believable. He is supposed to be a world class criminal, but he lacks funds, has no ongoing projects (at least, none that he can afford), and he quickly warms up to the kids, despite being 'evil'. Similarly, his nemesis sits arounddoing nothing, yet has a fabulous fortune, without showing initiative or any other explanation for how he became powerful. I watched about 40 minutes then turned it off, so I might be wrong, but there is very little story. The minions are okay, but I don't see why they have their own product line. They are simply cute, they contribute little to the criminal enterprise, so don't have much character. Shallow and predictable."

","I understand this is a kids movie and is made for that demographic but if a kids movie is good, it can be enjoyed by all the family. This movie is over hyped and is not as good as many people seem to claim.<br/><br/>------------------ Plot Spoilers Ahead ----------------- Proceed At Your Own Risk ---------------<br/><br/>The story is about a villain called Gru. Carell's performance lacked much emotion. I realise the character is meant to be emotionless but it felt like he stayed emotionless throughout the whole movie when he is supposed to grow to be more loving and caring. Gru takes in 3 children to help with his plan. The smallest of the 3, Agnis, is the funniest due to her childishness and ignorance to what is happening. She is one character the smaller children who watch this movie can relate to.<br/><br/>The standout characters, however, are the minions. Any scene with them in will have you in stitches. If they were not in this film, I would be rating it a 3/10. <br/><br/>The second thing that saves this movie from being below average is the animation. The animation is beautiful and fluid as I expected. They made the characters almost seem toy-like with them being almost shiny and so smooth. This is good as it keeps the movie very child-friendly but can also hinder it as you do not feel as emotionally attached to the characters in some scenes.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I expected better from this film but I am not unhappy I saw it. Some scenes are genuinely hilarious but these scenes are too few and far between for me to readily recommend it. I just think they could have done better. After seeing the sequel I KNOW they could do better."

","I saw this film on On-Demand TV, it was recommended by critics to see. After watching this, it was better than TOY STORY 3. It was called DESPICABLE ME.

If you think this film will touch your heart, it will touch your funny bone! I understood all the pop-culture references in this movie. The villain in this movie is funny with a capital F! Most villains in movies are dark and serious and a little witty, but this one takes the cake for being funny. I am sorry this movie got me laughing all the way like non-stop. I highly recommend it. Put that movie on your DVD collection. Family appropriate? Yes! No wonder it was recently airing on such channels as ABC family and Toon Disney. One more thing, the minions (or Twinkies as someone calls them), steal the picture! Followed by DESPICABLE ME 2. Rated PG for crude humor and peril."
"studioAT","6","1","2","25 July 2013"," Would have worked as a stand alone film
","Like a lot of people I only got to hear about this animated film amid all the hype about it's sequel.<br/><br/>The first twenty minutes are a bit slow and take painstaking detail to set up all the characters that we will spend the next ninety minutes. We laugh amiably at Steve Carell doing vocal gymnastics is the voice over for Gru and adults will get a laugh out of the fact that Julie Andrews is voicing such a horrible person while kids will be besotted with the Minions.<br/><br/>However if you can get through the first twenty minutes what you'll find is a funny, visually stunning film that appeals to all ages. It has warmth and humour running throughout and is certainly the most creative animated film I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>However do I think the idea needed to be stretched to a sequel? No."
"rooee","7","1","2","18 February 2013"," The best film Pixar never made
","This was a huge surprise. As a supposedly mature grown-up, there was no reason for me to watch Despicable Me, let alone enjoy it, and yet I did watch it and found out there was every reason. This French-made and English-spoken animation is funny, sweet, imaginative, surreal, and touching without resorting to sentimentality.<br/><br/>At the centre of it all is a pitch-perfect vocal performance from Steve Carrell as Gru (spot the ""Gru-ray Disc"" visual gag at the end), a wannabe global villain who covets a shrink ray in the possession of his arch-nemesis Vector (Jason Segel). With it he intends to go into space and steal the Moon. That's the plot, but the real story is Gru's relationship with three orphans, whom he intends at first to exploit, but who will ultimately tap into his coal-black heart.<br/><br/>I like the dynamic between Gru and the orphans in that they don't so much inspire a magical change in each other as come to accept each other. The orphans, at a cruel and mischievous age themselves, learn to adore Gru's monstrous behaviour, and in return Gru comes to appreciate and respond to their neediness - a neediness that he himself possesses, locked deep inside. Gru is correcting the mistakes of his own loveless upbringing.<br/><br/>Of course, this is all fairly implicit. The winning Disney-Pixar formula demands tearshed and laughter in equal quantities; Illumination Entertainment's equation seems heavily weighted toward the latter. There are slapstick moments of Marx Brothers-like contrivance and timing, and silliness dominates. The scene where Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) creates an army of ""boogie robots"" (after mishearing ""cookie robots"") is a keeper. And Gru's minions - homogenous yellow babblers seemingly designed with a squeezy toy in mind - are so entertaining that they've spawned their own spin-off movie, to be released later this year.<br/><br/>The film doesn't quite have the narrative or technical sophistication of Pixar's finest (for me, Monsters Inc. and Wall-E), but it is way more than a wannabe, and considerably funnier than the Ice Age or Madagascar sequels, franchises which are offering diminishing returns. Despicable Me has a humour and a warmth capable of melting through our iciest defences. I hope the sequel can match it."
"mike48128","8","1","2","10 December 2012"," Pixar Has Serious Competition: Far from Despicable, It's Incredible!
","I was ready to hate this film, having just viewed ""Brave"" on cable and not liking it that much. It's a rare situation when a film outshines its plot. The dumbest plot ever: A mad scientist-villain wants to steal the moon and has to go to ""The Bank of Evil"" (formerly Lehman Bros.) to borrow the money. He is turned down because he has a ""bad-track record"" performing evil deeds. He then employs 3 innocent orphan girls to enter the liar of his new competitor, the nerdy super-villain ""Vector"", to steal a shrink-ray. Sounds like enough story for 10 minutes, right? It's produced with images as good as anything I have seen from Pixar and far better than the annoying ""Madagascar"" series. It works because it doesn't take itself too seriously. The humor carries the movie as it pokes fun at everything from ""Annie"", to Girl Scouts Cookies, to werewolves. I won't spoil it for you by revealing all the inside jokes. The ""minions"" are not fully explained, but they are little yellow nearsighted ""ompa-lompas"" with goggles and speak like Cousin ""It"". The film's a bit long, but I am sure it plays better on DVD without cable commercials every 10 minutes. Steve Carell's character, ""Gur"", is the ""Despicable Me"" with an intentionally-bad fake accent that is a cross between Bela Lugosi and a Hungarian waiter.<br/><br/>Highly recommended. Cleverly animated with lots of gadgets and contraptions, like a ""Chuck Jones"" cartoon. The roller coaster ride is a great computer-simulation. (It ""feels"" real.) Nothing really bad or objectionable and fine for children old enough to enjoy Pixar movies such as ""Cars"" and ""Toy Story"".(Adults might like it as well.)"

","A delightful surprise which was better than expected and an excellent family film. It's often a fine line to tread when trying to keep both adults & children entertained, and this movie successfully crosses the tight rope.<br/><br/>Plenty of jokes for the adults, ""I said DART gun.... why do you have to be so.... old"" but filled with plenty for the kids: great visual effects, comical yellow henchmen, believable children, an amusement park and more.<br/><br/>Some of the action is a little over-the-top, as is quite common in this genre, but there were frequent breaks from the noise with a nice mix of softer, quiet scenes too. Voice-acting is excellent, with Steve Carell proving his versatility yet again. Another vocal bonus is the non-English bubbly language of Gru's little minions.<br/><br/>Definitely in the upper echelon for family films, although not as deeply resonant or finely tuned as Pixar's best."

","I saw this and Toy Story 3 about a week apart and have to say that while Toy Story had more emotional depth than Despicable Me I enjoyed this film more. The humour in Despicable Me will appeal to adults and children and although the emotional aspect of the story is predictable and has been done before it works very well within the film. The humour for me is what made this film a more enjoyable experience than Toy Story 3, I felt I was nearly always laughing or chuckling or smiling. There were parts of Toy Story 3 that I felt dragged a bit but with this film there was non of that, in fact I felt like the 95 minutes flew by. Given a choice between seeing this or Toy Story 3 again I'd go for Despicable Me every time, I can see me watching this many time in the future, even if you're a fan of Toy Story go and see this, you won't be disappointing."

"koojaho13","7","1","2","27 September 2010"," An enjoyable comedy with an exception of small minor problems
","Despicable Me is an enjoyable comedy flick with minor problems. Some jokes are extremely funny while some are just repeatedly stupid. Most of the really funny jokes are in the trailer and luckily I did not see the trailer before watching this film.<br/><br/>Most of the characters are charming and cute. The main protagonist Gru is not a likable person in the film but as an audience we love him as a character. His accent is great; Steve Carell did a fantastic job. The orphans were a different story. Agnes was adorable of course but the other two weren't the great characters Gru and Agnes were. Edith is obnoxious and adds nothing to the story except some minor trouble that takes up a few seconds of screen time. She's really just there. Margo is actually important because she's the older sibling (the motherly figure). Therefore she conflicts with Gru a lot and it's about them resolving their differences. However I just didn't find her character as good as Agnes because Margo reminds me too much of my own mother. And in addition Agnes is the youngest but she seems like a better person than Margo. So what were they trying to do? Make Margo look mature while making the younger one the role model? I hated Vector, the antagonist. Not in a sense that he's a good character but in a sense I found him disgusting.<br/><br/>I found the minions cute first but they were used way too much. Their squeaky high pitched voice gets redundant. This is the biggest and one of the few flaws of this film.<br/><br/>The 3D is amazing. This isn't one of those movies that is released in 3D just for the sake of it. Despicable Me is a total eye candy. Objects will always pop out and there is a roller coaster scene as seen in the trailers and it is spectacular. This movie redefined the concept of 3D and is a perfect example of what a 3D movie should be like.<br/><br/>This one is definitely worth your time."

I had a really great time going to see this movie. I was really excited that it kept the attention of the kids around me (although there weren't very many, ironically), because usually in kid's movies I'm distracted by their little voices talking through their boredom. I could tell everyone in the theater loved it.<br/><br/>The characters were great. Their personalities were well-established. The settings were brilliant, creative and eccentric as every one should be in a child's movie. I would love to live where they live in this movie. The minions are adorable and hilarious. Pretty much everything they did made me laugh. The actors doing the voices are great! Usually I try to figure out who does what voice in animated movies, but I was so absorbed in this story that I didn't even care. The music was really great. It set a certain tone to the movie that I hadn't experienced before in another animated film. I would buy the soundtrack if I wasn't broke. :P This is an honest review and has nothing to do with the fact that I am incredibly stoked to own a cool new pair of 3D glasses, although it did make me really happy. Do yourself a favor and keep in mind that this is a movie mainly directed toward a child's taste. You will enjoy the movie sooo much more if you don't analyze the possibility of certain things in the film actually being able to exist. Go to this movie and pretend you're a kid again. :) I didn't pay for my ticket but if I had to, I would not have regretted it."
"d_art","8","1","2","5 September 2010"," The outrageously visual 'Despicable Me' delivers much fun and heart
","In the CG animation, Despicable Me, a new villain has stolen the Great Pyramid of Giza. Not to be outdone, Gru (Steve Carell), a longtime villain, hoping to uphold his own villainous reputation, plans an even bigger heist—to steal the Earth's moon (with help of a Shrink Ray). In order to do so, he adopts three orphan girls, Margo Edith, and Agnes, to get them to steal the technology from a rival villain, Vector (Jason Segal). However, Gru and the kids start to develop a bond of sorts, which makes him rethink his plans.<br/><br/>When I saw this film, it was in 2-D, not the 3-D stereoscopic format, so I will not be able to comment on that particular format. The fluid animation in this film is truly something amazing. This film pretty much proves you can recreate in CG anything a 2-D cartoon is capable of creating (except maybe sketchy lines). The various odd, exaggerated characters with stylized pointy noses, bulging eyes, and expressive mouths that inhabit this zany film are something straight out of TV cartoons-- they all flow, stretch, and exaggerate, all so very organically and naturally. Gone are the stiff-feeling 3-D stuff of yesteryear. The physically impossible feels physically possible because it's so solid-looking. I miss traditional 2-D animation already.<br/><br/>I found this film pleasantly charming, cute, diabolically clever, and heartwarming. Admittedly, it is more joke-heavy than plot-heavy. One can easily guess where the story is going and while there are occasional revelations about the characters' past, it doesn't diverge much from the conventional plot. Still, the film's biggest strengths are the outrageous sight gags and the main character, wonderfully voice-acted by Steve Carell. For those who find visually zany gags boring or prefer serious films may find it too goofy for their taste. Still, many adults will find many things to relate to Gru, and kids will relate to the children in the film.<br/><br/>Even with his (Eastern European?) accent, Steve Carell's playful humor shines through in the ""despicable"" character of Gru. The character never feels stiff nor less than engaging (unlike the recent Shrek Forever After). Gru may be mean-spirited, but in a charming way. Jason Segel has a great time as Vector, the young, geeky, diabolic rival villain who likes to don warm-up suits, whose every body movement is expressively animated and exaggerated. Much of the ""cute"" elements come from the three orphan girls (Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, Elsie Fisher) who truly act like how real little girls act with great subtleties in expressions and randomness. The relationship between Gru and the kids never feels cheesy or manufactured, even if you knew it was coming.<br/><br/>I loved the look and design. All the characters, the objects, places, and vehicles in this film feel expressively bold and original. Wacky cartoon physics feel effortlessly and seamlessly applied. I loved the attention to detail in this film. The character expressions are wonderful. It is Pixar-level of detail, which is a huge compliment. The film also doesn't rely too heavily on current pop-culture references, which is a big plus.<br/><br/>For a film about a villain, it was strange not to see any ""heroes."" Still, I suppose that could have made the film too complex (that'd be something Pixar would do) and would have interfered with Gru's eventual change of heart in the story. Perhaps they'll explore the idea in the sequel. We the audience love Gru because we know that deep inside he's not really evil—he's misunderstood and probably can be rehabilitated after some therapy.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the one complaint, if I were to make one, would be the simplicity of the plot, and this is only if I were to compare the film to Pixar's stories (which is an unfair comparison because the film's main focus is different). Despicable Me's story, in its barest form, could possibly fit into a 30 minute episode. However, everything else in this film more than makes up for it. Sure, it's not as thematically deep or complex as Pixar's work, as I tend to walk away from a Pixar film with always something to think about. While Despicable Me may be more joke-driven, have more slapstick, sight gags, and more interested in ""fun,"" with its first rate animation, its crazy humor, its technical achievements, and heartwarming characters, it stands boldly on its own and rivals some of the great CG animations already showcased this year, very closely right up there with Toy Story 3 and How To Train Your Dragon.<br/><br/>You can also follow me on http://twitter.com/d_art for more of my reviews."

"honorhorror","8","1","2","2 August 2010"," Beauty and Beast series: Despicable Me.
","Well, recently I've seen two films that could sum up the basic Beauty and Beast plot. One of them is Universal studio's Despicable me, casting a lot of fancy names among the charming voices. The other one is called Suspect X, which was made in 2008. We can really have some insights into the difference between the Easterners and Westerners comparing these two movies. So here is my Beauty and Beast series.<br/><br/>Despicable Me has, in many ways, reminded me of the early Shirley Temple movies in 1930s. Though, you'd be surprised that even me, an oriental, have seen most of Temple's classics like ""Littlest Rebel""""The little Colonel"". It's always the same formula--adults have been unhappy until they meet the magnificent Temple. Actually, the true magic comes from it was the process of transformation, that beasts can transform back to humans with love and lightheartedness. The Oriental movies, on the contrast, often feature this process in the other direction, that humans essentially become something else. Suspect X is one of the examples, and please feel free to refer to my review for that title.<br/><br/>My criticism for Despicable Me is only of the slightest, that the characters in this movie apparently have a blood tie with Tom and Jerry. Anyone in the movie, heroes or villains, practically cannot die even if they get smashed by moon. Also, stealing the moon is a somewhat romanticized act, a villainous master plan that's actually considered cute and silly. Therefore, it doesn't really sum up real criminals and their behaviors.<br/><br/>But, isn't that where this film shined? Isn't that a perfect way to illustrate to both adults and children that there's no point to be a champion in negative ways? The only other thing as silly as Gru's moon-stealing plan, was the bed book preserved so dearly by the 3 orphans. I can't agree more with Gru that it's story-less. Yet, the most heartfelt scene in the entire movie was exactly when Gru reluctantly reads it to put the trio to sleep. While he was performing the 3 little kittens' roles with his fingers, he actually discovered his own transformation, a transformation from the gritty, twisted Darth-Vader-wanna-be to 3 little orphans' real father. Love happens, even if love can only be expressed in the stupidest way. Isn't that exactly like how the God communicated with us? We are bound in time and space, and it seems our way of stupidity cannot be stopped, like all the killings, wars, etc. Our proud wisdom, utmost, is to make poems of the killings, wars, sex, so on so forth. Yet, our creator found a way to communicate his love to us. Suppose Gru still couldn't help thinking the book's stupid, he can never receive the message from this beautiful relationship. The tricky thing is, it's not the 3 little orphans who needed this message of love and inspiration, it's Gru who needed it the most. It took him some time to struggle, and then he finally accepted it. In the Bible, Jesus told us that if we don't return to children's form, we can't enter his kingdom of heaven. That reminded me not every villain is as lucky as Gru, so how should I know I possess a complete soul to love, or more importantly, how should I know I have love?<br/><br/>On his road to world-class villain, Gru made many mistakes to prevent him from being a real villain. Yet, he has done some wrong deeds if you count in his motivations. He mistreated people all around, attempted to feed the orphans like dogs, etc. Still, there seemed to be some kind of guardian angel on his shoulder who drags him from doing actual harms every time. It's a comedic nod that such a person as Gru is nice inside, just like the Beast in Beauty and Beast, that no matter how hard he tries; the real badness is just too bad for him. Plus for Gru, he practically slipped into the father role quite successfully in all the evil attempts. So, if we find out later that a mistake was actually a necessary one on our way to the right path, does it still count as a mistake? According to the Bible, we as sinners at our best can only be honest enough to admit our mistakes just like Gru's home-made bed book. Yet in God's hands, love can cover sins. Gru was taught to seek forgiveness and redemption, and the orphans were taught to forgive and accept. The salvation, the love is just completed in their relationship. I guess all the mistakes still count as mistakes, yet the girls chose to let go of their father's mistakes. It's beautiful.<br/><br/>Theoretically, we should be more physically capable to love as we grow up, but why do we feel more chills instead of warmth from love? When I was little, I listened to Beauty and Beast and believed. As I have grown up, I became more inclined to accept that ""all people are of social products, and there's no intrinsic goodness in humans"" (Popular idea since Kant and Marx). However, this idea, subtly comes from Gru's ""3 little kittens"" book, tells me that as we grow up our capability to be loved had drastically reduced. Gru needed a stupid bed book to return to child's form to be loved, and I needed another book considered stupid by many to return to child's form to be loved. That's the Bible."

","""Despicable Me"" is not based on Paris Hilton's autobiography, Saddam Hussein's memoirs, or even BP's 2010 annual report. It is an enjoyable computer-animated film about a criminal mastermind named Gru who adopts three little orphan girls in order to use them to seize his shrinking machine from criminal competitor Vector's home. Gru is a stealer at heart and has stolen many renowned monuments, but his astronomical goal is to steal the moon. His plan is to shrink the moon, so he can steal the moon, and he needs his shrink machine to do that. The three little orphan girls named Margo, Edith, and Agnes are oblivious to Gru's mischievous plan. ""Don't Be Gru to a heart that's true"" probably is an applicable anthem to describe how eventually Gru softens his sturdy persona, and takes a liking to the three little orphans. Gru's criminal entourage includes the meticulous scientist Dr. Nefario voiced by Russell Brand, and the scene-stealers of the film- that adorable army of minions. I could give you a minion reasons just to watch this movie for their sidesplitting antics. Steve Carell sure was no vocal schmuck with his inventive vocal performance as Gru. And Jason Segel also deserves a shout out with his vocal work as Vector. There were hardly any despicable parts of the direction and screenplay of the movie, even though there were some scenes that ran just a bit too long for what it was. But I go back to the minions, so comical and charming. How does one get them? In other words, ""tell me, tell me, how to be, how to be, a Minionaire"". If you are stumped with that reference, youtube ABC's ""How To Be A Millionaire"". OK, so I am being a despicable punner!!! Anyways, if you are having a despicable summer, get out of it for a little while and experience some comic relief with a ""Despicable Me"" viewing. **** Good"

"ruink","6","2","8","15 July 2010"," ""Despicable Me"" juxtapose to ""Toy Story 3""
","""Despicable Me"" is centered around main character Gru voiced by a foreign sounding Steve Carell. Gru's main intention or only intention in life shall I say is to become the world's most renowned super-villain. His plan to achieve this status? Pull off the most insane heist known to man of course, steal the moon. But being the slouch Gru is, Gru must defeat his arch enemy Vector voiced by an underwhelming Jason Segal. Seeking help for his heist, Gru decides that adopting three orphan girls will be the missing ingredient to his heist. Will Gru pursue his evil plan, or will he eventually have a change of heart for the three little orphan girls?<br/><br/>Of course being an animated film, characters need a voice to give them soul, right? Of course they do, let's not be silly! Steve Carell voicing the lead character Gru is probably the only thing this film has going for it. His accent is so goofy that you just buy it and roll with it. His delivery as always is spot on, making even the weakest of jokes seem funny. So in summary Steve Carell does exceptional work here. I wish I could compliment the rest of the cast here which is a disappointment considering the film has such an expansive cast of comedians. As I said earlier, Jason Segal as Gru's enemy Vector is extremely underwhelming. His voice is both annoying and conventional almost seeming like a knock off of Mandark on ""Dexter's Laboratory"". Also the fact that majority of the potty jokes were handed to Segal doesn't help either. Danny Mcbride voices Gru's neighbor, a character that has no impact whatsoever to the major story line. Such talent should have not been wasted on such a minor position. ""Get Him to the Greek's"" Russell Brand probably does the most tolerable work next to Steve Carrell as Dr. Nefario, Gru's right hand man. But even this performance isn't a standout.<br/><br/>Perhaps what made the voice acting disappointing to me were the lines the actors had to read. Majority of the dialogue here resorts to toilet humor. It would have been okay if only some 5% of the jokes stooped down to this just to please the kids but when a whole movie's gags are based around this it becomes incomprehensibly annoying. Doing this really creates a barrier for likable character development. Sure the film is a cartoon, thus creating a world and characters larger than life but with clever writing even a rock can become a character in which you connect with.<br/><br/>So maybe I was a bit spoiled with the animated masterpiece ""Toy Story 3"" that came out last month but seeing ""Despicable Me"" helped me realize something. It helped me realize why Pixar's movies work so well and other animated movies fall short of their glory. It's because above all else, story comes first. Not the voice talent, not the jokes, not the slapstick, but the main ingredient that makes any film in general enjoyable: the story. Pixar makes sure that everything is serviced to the story and not by it's minor counterparts. Contrary to ""Despicable Me"", it relies on it's gags and it's star talent. This is something if any film in general relies on it fails. May lessons be learned."
"tappingjeff","5","1","3","2 July 2013"," Despicably Cute
","THE GIST: Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud's DESPICABLE ME is best described as ""cute"", which is a fine thing but not the best thing that this movie could have been. In the film, Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), our evil mastermind for a protagonist, inadvertently adopts three little girls in his quest to steal the moon and better his competing evil nemesis Vector (Jason Segel). The movie is a lot of fun, especially for the G-rated crowd. As for the adults, well...the serious laughs are few and far between and the movie tries too hard to be something its not that it never truly comes into its own. With such a fresh premise that is somewhere between MEGAMIND and MONSTERS INC., it is sad that the conflict is as thin as a Nick Jr. cartoon and the supporting characters overshadow everything else going on in the film. However, the film really owns its cuteness and its heartwarming ending shouldn't be overlooked.<br/><br/>THE BEST PART: The Minions, which are a cross between the Doozers from FRAGGLE ROCK and the aliens from TOY STORY, could carry a movie all their own. <br/><br/>THE VERDICT: Parts of DESPICABLE ME seem awfully familiar and there may not be enough weight in the story to carry a feature-length film, but its goofy enough to smile through and is a sure-fire hit with the under-10 crowd."

","'DESPICABLE ME': Three Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Comedians Steve Carell, Jason Segel, Russell Brand, Will Arnett and Kristen Wiig all lend their voices to this popular animated blockbuster. Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud direct the CGI animated film, a first from Universal Pictures and it's Illumination Entertainment division. The script is written by Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul (the same team behind the 'HORTON HEARS A WHO!' film, also featuring Carell's vocal talents in a leading role) from a story by long time animator and first time writer Sergio Pablos. The film is one of two popular CGI animated features this year revolving around a 'bad guy' who's not so bad at heart and learns to be good through love and appreciation (the other being the DreamWorks Animation blockbuster 'MEGAMIND', which I watched the same day).<br/><br/>The film is set in a fictitious suburban town where evil criminal mastermind Gru (Carell) lives in a black dreary house. Underneath the house is a hidden workshop where dozens of little creatures, his minions, work on new gadgets like freezing and shrinking ray guns. Gru has been a genius since childhood but never been able to impress his overbearing mother (Julie Andrews). So he's turned to a life of crime and all things 'despicable'. When another evil villain known as Vector (unrecognizably voiced by Segel) steals the Egyptian pyramid and therefor tops Gru as the world's number one villain Gru devises a plan to shrink and steal the moon in order to win back his notoriety. After he steals the shrink gun necessary to pull off the heist Vector steals it from him and Gru will stop at nothing to get it back. He devises a plan that involves three orphan children sneaking into the young villains house with robot cookies and adopts the kids from a local orphanage in order to pull it off. While first quickly becoming annoyed and frustrated with the kids he of course learns to love them and this obviously gets in the way of his plans.<br/><br/>The movie has a classic somewhat older style cartoon feel to it and the animation is interesting. While it is extremely silly, cheesy and ridiculous it's also very funny at times. The cast of voices are all excellent and humorous (although Carell obviously borrows a lot from Mike Myers' 'Dr. Evil'). There's definitely nothing new or unique to it and what little emotion there is to it is forced and over done but it's obviously intended for kids, and on that level it succeeds (I watched the movie with two of my nephews and they loved it). A good kids movie should be able to entertain adults as well as kids I always say and this move has enough funny and amusing moments to keep an older crowd interested as well. The film overall is a slightly above average animated comedy.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYbw_OZUFso"

Even Will Arnett, who I find hilarious because of his deep raspy voice, was barely recognizable as voicing the bank manager Mr. Perkins.

","The criticisms I've seen leveled at ""Despicable Me"" seem to be mostly that it isn't original and doesn't measure up to Pixar. My response: True but irrelevant. What this movie lacks in originality it makes up for with bucketloads of charm, personality and neat little jabs of humor for adults as well as kids. The pop culture references include the Bank of Evil's sign reading ""Formerly Lerman Brothers"" and the Vector/Victor naming of Gru's nemesis - shades of ""Airplane!"" <br/><br/>Steve Carell's Gru is a terrific creation, a villain with a moon fixation who has longed for his mother's love all his life. The three orphan girls he adopts as part of his nefarious plan to steal the moon quickly worm their way into his heart as he finds out that he loves being a father figure to them. Watching Gru agonize over a scheduling conflict - steal the moon or attend the girls' dance recital? - is just wonderful. <br/><br/>I freely admit that I'm a sucker for a happy ending, but I hate feeling manipulated; ""Despicable Me"" was a pleasant surprise in that respect. The caliber of the writing and acting in DM ensures that it doesn't sink into sugary goo. The animation of the characters is also fantastic, and to see this big guy surrounded by tiny girls is really something. Gru may be slipping into middle age, but compare the way he is drawn with Vector's teeny shoulders and pot belly. The audience is predisposed to believe him the stronger and more competent of the two villains, as of course he turns out to be.<br/><br/>The minions are fantastic. Though they look almost exactly alike, Gru clearly recognizes each of them as individuals and calls them by name - another endearing trait. Their shining moment comes during the credits, and allow me to say that the film should definitely be seen in 3D for this reason alone. Bottom line: I loved it. Highly recommended."

Despicable Me fails in that department, the yellow miniatures thumbs are really funny & cute but besides that we didn't found anything funny or exciting in the movie.

","Directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud have made the third best animated film of the year thus far after Toy Story 3, and How to Train Your Dragon. I may sound consolatory, but I am putting things into perspective. Despicable Me is a very good animated film, but the quality of Pixar's and DreamWorks' outputs this year remain unsurpassed. But then again, if 2010 serves up another animated feature that is every bit as delicious as Despicable Me, I will have no complains.<br/><br/>Written by Ken Daurio (Horton Hears a Who!, 2008), Despicable Me is a story about a deplorable man called Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) who dreams of stealing the Moon by shrinking it using a shrink ray. A villain at heart, Gru is cold, calculating, and hates children. Together with Dr. Nefario, and an army of cute, yellow, goggle-wearing technicians called Minions, Gru attempts to build a rocket that will fly him to the Moon to commit the ""crime of the century"".<br/><br/>Enter three innocent orphans, Margo, Edith, and Agnes, who are ""adopted"" by Gru to be part of a plan to steal the shrink ray from an arrogant young villain named Vector, whose fortress house is almost impenetrable. Despicable Me is a comedy-adventure that allows us to witness the thawing of Gru's cold heart as the three orphans find their way into his life, which until their arrival has been a perpetual lonely and emotionally unsatisfying existence.<br/><br/>As much as the film is about the transformation of a despicable and aggressive man into one that is gentle and caring, it is also quite a cheeky portrayal of the ""greed and (over)ambitiousness of Man"". This can be seen in the context of the film where villains are able to get funding for their evil projects from the Evil Bank (formerly known as Lehmann Brothers in a clever if-you-blink-you-will-miss-it moment).<br/><br/>Despicable Me is generally engaging and the main reason for this is its high humor quotient, of which it relies quite extensively on farcical visual gags and near-incomprehensible verbal banter by the Minions. Now, the Minions are a real funny lot. They look funny, talk funny, and even laugh funny. Their interactions with each other, Gru, Dr. Nefario, and the three orphans are indisputably the film's scene-stealers. In fact, the animation, which I feel is on par with Pixar's, is unfortunate to be outshined by the Minions.<br/><br/>Despicable Me is ninety minutes well-spent. Even though it is not as emotionally wrenching as Toy Story 3, nor is it adventure in its purest incarnation as presented in How to Train Your Dragon, this Coffin/Renaud effort is still a very well-made film. The Minions are so hyperactively addictive that a sequel will be more welcomed than not. Enjoy.<br/><br/>SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"

","Despicable Me centers on a mediocre super villain named Gru (Voiced by Steve Carrell's best imitation of Bela Lugosi), a man with minions, a mad scientist to invent weapons for him, and a pet dog/fraggle. He plots to use a shrink ray so he can steal the moon, but that plan is thwarted when the shrink ray is stolen by a rival super villain, the film's overly obnoxious antagonist Vector (Voiced by Jason Segel). But hope is not lost for Gru. He adopts three orphan girls (Voiced by the alright Dana Gaier, the simply adorable Elsie Fisher, and the somewhat effective Miranda Cosgrove of iCarly fame), to sell Vector cookies, so that he can steal back the shrink ray, and complete his objective. But soon the girls start to warm Gru's cold heart, and make him realize he's a better good guy than bad.<br/><br/>The film's premise is solid, and it tries its best to do good with the material, and I say ""tries"" because it's only half-successful. It takes a lot of influence from things like Pixar films, and Looney Tunes, and at times quite trivially. Some characters feel too rushed in screen time, and are inconsistently written, changing from sympathetic, to sarcastic in the blink of an eye.<br/><br/>The film has a large cast that, besides Carrell and Segel, include comedic talents like Will Arnett, Russell Brand, and Kristen Wiig. Some of these characters feel annoying, and some feel like they're there just to be there, such as Gru's impossible-to-please mother, voiced by screen and stage legend Julie Andrews, who speaks in an inconsistent Hungarian accent.<br/><br/>The only thing that really keeps the movie on its feet is the humor, with some fine one-liners, and often delightful sight gags, none the least of which are Gru's hilarious yellow followers who steal each and every scene they're in. But not all of the humor is successful, and even if the voice cast had some strong passion for their roles, it didn't translate too well onto screen.<br/><br/>As far as both kids and adults go, I can't quite recommend Despicable Me because it is a good movie, and would be much MUCH quicker to suggest films like How to Train Your Dragon and Toy Story 3. In the end, it's probably best to skip it.<br/><br/>** out of ****"

","Whenever I am unfortunate enough to get a whiff of the stinky media flatulence produced over this sort of flick, I do a silent check and thank the universe for leaving me free of association of children (who run the obvious risk of further predisposing my attention to this sort of heinous dribble) and of having cut my own biological 'childhood' short at the time Pixar and 'minions' began dominating the industry. Watching this sort of thing, you get the feeling that the screenwriters sweatshop is running out of ideas. To think of an entire generation growing up on this sod is to not think of the children! But perhaps it is better to forget about the children all together..as I am still trying to figure out whether the three orphans or the minions annoyed me more!"

","The premise of ""Despicable Me"" seemed simple. The idea was to take a colorful villain and put him at the center of a film. This idea stemmed from the notion that, in many Good v. Evil stories, the villain steals the show from the blander or less compelling protagonist (see ""Austin Powers""). I applaud the creators of ""Despicable Me"" for their attempt, but not so much for their execution. <br/><br/>At the start of ""Despicable Me,"" we see the allegedly dastardly Gru performing small acts of rudeness; he comes off immediately as a bully with a big car. We soon learn that Gru has assembled a horde of so-called ""minions"" to accomplish such wicked ends as stealing the statue of liberty and the Eiffel tower. Embracing the silliness of the archetypal megalomaniac, the film then creates a rivalry between Gru and fellow villain Vector, both of whom try to steal the moon. This overblown rivalry leads to scenes of eye-popping physical comedy. It also allows the film's creators to show off the hijinks of the minions, who manage to be both adorable and riveting to watch. While they don't always serve the plot, they're always a blast to behold, and they save the film from the masses of cookie-cutter animated films. Unfortunately, other aspects of the story cannot be saved from such a wasteland of incompetence.<br/><br/>The primary problem with ""Despicable Me"" is that it becomes a generic ""curmudgeon softens up"" story before too long. In an attempt to force the viewer to sympathize with the supposedly villainous Gru, the creators strip away his villainous qualities. Instead of wreaking havoc, Gru begins to learn what it takes to be a good father. Suddenly strapped with three kids, Gru becomes attached to them. Sadly, when he finally settles into his new lifestyle, a wrench enters the works. We've seen this plot line before, most notably in ""Kramer v. Kramer,"" and it doesn't belong in such an otherwise silly and light-hearted film. As an attempt at emotional resonance, the father-figure story will work just fine for families, but it didn't work for me.<br/><br/>""Despicable Me"" is a lean machine; I only wish it were a little meaner.What begins as a clever spin off of the superhero genre becomes a run-of-the-mill tale of parenting and love, but hey- at least it has minions."

","Despicable Me Review: A villain called Gru attempts to steal the moon with the help of his little minions and also deal with his villain competitor. But then, three little problems come along and they are three kids. The film had some funny moments and I suppose was fun but it was turning into a movie that I did not want to see. He was becoming normal or father-like by the second because of the kids, who actually ruined the entire movie. The lead kid was just such a brat and that made the movie annoying, the other kid was just making me mad by being there, and the little girl just gave me headaches; it wanted to shoot myself, that little squeaky voice was just unbearable.

","This is it.<br/><br/>I think this movie was my last screening with the kid due to the choices of his narcissus mother (and my failures to open the talk about this). But for the last movie, the story was symbolic: how a bad man can turn into a great daddy by realizing that kids are the most precious gifts that life can give? I know that the real father of the kid promised him to watch it together but he failed as always to his words (maybe he read the summary and understood clearly that this movie could be a dangerous experience for him).<br/><br/>Thus, the ""bragging"" friend (this is me) didn't hesitate to offer this opportunity to the kid, all the more than it was his first 3D movie. Remembering him trying to hold the picture between his hands will remain as a fondest memory forever.<br/><br/>To be honest, the kid and I didn't know both that the movie was about fatherhood and that's why I found the beginning of the movie a bit slow and dull. But the click happened at the funfair: it was a great idea to put rides on a 3D movie because you can feel similar feelings as the real ones. Then, it was moving to see Gru torn between his duty and his responsibility as a father. This moral lesson was really the heart of the movie and it's far better told than the scary ""Toy Story 3"".<br/><br/>Visually, the character design is poor, uninspired and it's unfortunate because it diminishes the power of the story! As for the kid, I don't know if watching a cartoon Dad standing up for his kids wake him questions because this is a territory that i have always forbid me to enter. I just hope that he will get a loving Daddy like Gru soon!"

Honestly this film is possibly the most over-rated piece of trash I have ever had the ultimate displeasure of watching. I do not understand the massive hype the films have going for them, the amount of kids I see with their large and annoying minion gear and teddies and the sad looking parents walking around knowing their child is a complete and utter weeb; it brings me sadness, great sadness. Overall I would never recommend anyone to watch this 95 minutes of hell on a screen, not even to my worst enemy, I have seen the war prisoners of Japan, who had bambo grow through their body have a greater time being tortured, than I did watching this god damn annoying movie.

","The story is very creative and simple, the plot is vivid and interesting, but not complicated. The plot development seems logical, but the most decisive factor in the study is how the three children distracted a villain, let him find something more interesting than stealing the moon, and hide it under the appearance of full of evil. The sensitive and fragile heart is exposed a little bit, and a little bit soft and strong, until it is completely transformed. This kind of reasonable change can only be accomplished by a series of seemingly insignificant, absurd but reasonable, wonderful details that touch the character's soul and the conflicts and reversals formed by these details."

","It might be reasonable to approach ""Despicable Me 2"" with a sense of trepidation. The original 2010 film was a sort-of enjoyable animated romp that wasn't exactly screaming for a sequel. That film, about the misadventures of a supervillain named Gru whose attempts to steal the moon were thwarted when he adopted three adorable orphan girls, was a cute but admittedly lackluster animated comedy. It is kind of a relief to report that the sequel is a nice surprise. It's better. It opens with a different story idea and introduces a few new characters who give this (now) series a much-needed boost.<br/><br/>This time Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) has given up his life of evil deeds (thereby negating the title) and opened his own business making jams and jellies. He's also a full-time dad. As the movie opens, he's suffering two hardships that every parent must eventually endure: First, the fairy princess that he hired won't show up for the kid's birthday party. Second, the oldest girl is beginning to take a healthy interest in boys.<br/><br/>Gru's kids, it can be happily reported, are only a sideline in this sequel. The main plot involves Gru being called upon by the Anti-Villain League to help to figure out why an Arctic Research Station was pulled off its foundation and went missing. Gru thinks that the villain might be the nefarious El Macho (voiced by Benjamin Bratt), a Mexican villain who is so tough that he once leapt out of the back of a plane while riding a shark strapped with dynamite. The purpose behind this has to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>The plot is a lot of fun mainly because the writers have decided this time around to stick heavily to the gags and pull back on the emotional stuff. They've also given a lot room in the plot Gru's little yellow minions, whose babbling speech and funny dress-ups have become so popular that they are getting their own origin story called ""Minions"" next Christmas.  The minions are cute, but the most joyous element to ""Despicable Me 2"" is the presence of AVL agent Lucy Wilde, a high-energy, skinny redhead whose bright personality gives this movie its legs. Voiced by Kristen Wiig and looking a little like Carol Burnett, Lucy is so much fun, she could have a movie of her own. Yes, a romance develops between she and Gru, but it there isn't a predictable straight-line to get there.<br/><br/>The movie has individual moments that not just amusing, but very funny and inventive. The best is a date that Gru is force on with a dimwitted neighbor. What comes of the date won't be spoiled here, sufficed to stay it is the stuff of great slapstick.<br/><br/>The sequel works better than the original simply because the energy level has been cranked up. Animated comedies these days lose their comic fortitude by getting too sappy and dreary. This has been the downfall of ""Megamind,"" ""ParaNorman,"" and the Ice Age sequels; all of which got so emotional that they forgot the laughs. ""Despicable Me 2"" never loses its comic zeal. Even the love story has a certain momentum. Let's put it this way: A meet-cute here involves Lucy trying to stuff an unconscious Gru into her trunk. This is funny stuff."

Meanwhile, three girls from an orphanage are adopted by Gru. in the middle of this a villain named Vector (Steve Carrel) who also plans on steeling the moon. Its a race between the 2 to see who gets the moon first.

It feels like a Disney movie because of the emotion but it also has its own style. which I think is cool, you don't see that a lot in animated movies. My only problem is that it does get tiresome after watching it 10 times. If you give it 6 months or so it's fine. It left an impression on everyone. kids and adults.

","""We stole the Statue of Liberty...the small one, from Las Vegas!""<br/><br/>Considering Despicable Me 2 was coming out this weekend I finally decided to watch the first film and I wasn't disappointed. Despicable Me is a lot of fun with some memorable characters and some really funny lines. The story is involving enough for adults and kids to enjoy it alike, and Steve Carell has done some magnificent voice work with his character. I had a great time with this film and was instantly delighted with the animation and the storyline. Despite having some great characters, I think the minions completely stole the show and deliver several laugh out loud moments throughout the film. Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud have directed an entertaining enough film for me to want to go watch the sequel at the movies as soon as possible. This is a great family-friendly film that is better than Pixar's latest three movies so they should begin to worry with this strong competition. The characters in this film were just so much fun to watch on screen that it makes it impossible for anyone to walk out of the movie without a smile on his or her face. I had a blast.<br/><br/>The film stars a super villain named Gru (Steve Carell) who has a very long and pointed nose along with skinny legs. After discovering that a pyramid in Egypt has been stolen by another villain, Vector (Jason Segel), he decides to do something greater out of jealousy. He plans to steal the moon, and in order to do so he first has to shrink it with a special weapon. The only problem is that this weapon is in hands of Vector. So Gru comes up with an idea involving adopting three orphans and using them to get into Vector's fortress in order for him to get the weapon back. Thus he adopts the adorable girls: Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and Agnes (Elsie Kate Fisher). Everything seems to be going according to plan as his workers known as the minions and Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) are preparing everything for the great day, but the only problem is that Gru's heart begins to be softened by these sweet girls. He realizes he still has to face his greatest challenge yet. <br/><br/>Despicable Me is without a doubt a family pleaser. If you have kids you will want to go see this movie with them because the entire family will be entertained. It is funny and smart, a combination that is difficult to find these days. The premise also felt original and despite a few moments it never felt formulaic or cliché. This is what I would call a very cute film, and these days cute sells to audiences. I'm kind of upset I didn't get to see this film in 3D because the animation was excellent and it really did feel like a Pixar film. I may not have been as emotionally engaged as I was with Up, The Lion King, or How to Train Your Dragon, but this was still a lot of fun and I felt like I was being tickled like a 5 year old. Now it's time to go watch the sequel!"

","Despicable me is, of course, a children's film so the bad guy (who's the good guy) isn't actually that bad at all. The bad guy, who is the bad guy isn't really that bad either, so that's good (for children). There's little in this that children would find really scary and compared to the horribly sad portions of The Rescuers - for example - where Penny and her teddy were completely alone, the orphans (all three) in this were feisty, self reliant and rather well adjusted. It still had tender moments but didn't have the darkness of Disney.<br/><br/>Gru voiced by Steve Carell was very well drawn, and performed. He had a whimsy about him, which made me think of Austin Powers, and his minions - the little yellow creatures that were the stand out stars of the film - are just so cute, each with his (or her) own personality. Jason Segal as the nemesis villain Vector was very funny and I thought he was voiced by Chris D'Elia such was the vocal range, so was impressed with Segal. Very funny. Like Disney and Pixar, the film is for children but there is plenty for adults and I didn't once think ""oh this is a naff children's film"" but rather was immersed and entertained for the duration, captivated in fact.<br/><br/>With the combination of the minions' antics and the little orphan girl Agnes and how adorable she was, and the silly plot to steal the moon, the crazy gadgets and immediate one-liners I loved every minute. It's not meant to be taken seriously and those critics who are saying how it defies the laws of physics and point out the ""goofs"" are just far too sad. It's a cartoon, and a very good one at that and I think Illumination have Pixar in their sights in terms of quality and skill. Its a fun film for all the family, with a lot of heart."

","It checks off a lot of animated film must-haves. Putting a villain as the lead would be more interesting if he was more villainous. Sure he steals things, pops balloons etc. but he is never totally evil. The closest he gets is simply not caring when he believes a child has died. This is also one of the funniest moments. He's more of an Ebeneezer Scrooge type character, than a fully blown villain. It has enough cute/funny characters to propel it along for an entertaining time, but extract these characters and you wouldn't have much to go on. The animation is nothing new, and is simplified in a lot of cases. The voice work is mostly spot-on, but what's with cinema's hate of orphanages?"

","When I saw the adverts for this I was, as one often is, relatively excited. ""Wow! An Evil Genius' point of view! What interesting ways will they exploit this brilliant idea?"" <br/><br/>Turns out, they didn't. This was a film that had great potential, but was scarred by the fact that it had to be happy, with a classic plot of ""Scrooge-slowly-turning-into-lovable/loving-fiend."" What I wanted and expected to see was the the little children turning into the evil Scroogelets, but that was too much to ask. <br/><br/>If you're a person who likes the expected, happy, family plot with those horrible ""Feel good,"" feelings, this is for you. I know many people who have enjoyed this film. If your looking for something that takes an interesting idea, plays around with it a bit and creates some unusual scenes, exploiting fun opportunities, this ISN'T for you; it's just another run-of-the-mill film in the guise of an elaborate idea."
"aysx87","7","0","1","20 October 2011"," Not very clever, a bit cliché, but great visuals
","I enjoyed this but I felt like it was definitely more for kids. The jokes weren't particularly witty or funny and were a bit overplayed; I didn't really feel any empathy for the main character, who was really. bizarre. Some critics say there were some jokes that adults only got, like the 'Lehman' reference as 'bank of evil' (um... not even funny). One thing they do get right is how annoying kids can be (pucker-face, not brushing teeth before bedtime, toilet pictures, sarcastic remarks... ha). <br/><br/>Very cliché, so much so I had to cover my eyes at the lines these guys make. <br/><br/>I felt like the visuals were very good; the kids' faces were very cute, the giant shark was hilarious, and the roller-coaster ride made me wonder how great this would be in 3D--I watched it in 2D and thought it was great already."
"caiged","Null","0","1","21 July 2011"," An average animation that was low on humour
","I didn't expect much from Despicable Me and I was left slightly disappointed as I was hoping to be proved wrong. I'm not a Steve Carell fan and this movie hasn't improved my opinion of him.<br/><br/>I found that the plot in some ways was similar to Megamind- a villain wants to be the most hated super villain in the world and concocts a wicked plan to achieve his target. But along the way circumstances change and he finds himself becoming more of a hero than a villain.<br/><br/>Megamind was better because Will Ferrel was funnier and the humour in that movie was far better. Here I didn't find myself laughing too much nor did I think too much of Gru. Steve Carell didn't do a good job with the voice acting- his accent kept slipping and his American twang was becoming more evident. Even the supporting cast was less than average.<br/><br/>where the movie did jump up a notch was due to the Minions who were cute and hilarious. It was great that they couldn't speak English or that would probably have spoiled the fun.<br/><br/>Is it worth watching? It's not a definite recommend. Megamind is much better. But it's worth watching just for the Minions alone. Hopefully if the next one comes out Gru's voice is recast with someone better."

","Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules is a fantastic sequel in the Wimpy series. This film is a super fun adaptation from the popular book series Diary of a Wimpy Kid. I really enjoy that it shows the relationship between Greg and Rodrick, because it shows the ups and downs of being siblings. I especially like the fact that I related to this movie so much. I have a brother, like Greg, and I'm also a middle-schooler. I feel that this film truly captures a lot of the real struggles of middle school life. My favorite character is Greg Heffley, played by Zachary Gordon, because he gets into so many funny embarrassing situations. I had the privilege to talk with him in a recent interview. His favorite scene is when he and Rodrick run from their coach over the dumpster, because it was so fun to do. This is also my favorite scene because when Rodrick and Greg are pranking all the people and running from their coach at the gas station, they really bond. This wonderful movie is for everyone because it is funny for an audience of many different age groups. Overall I give Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules two thumbs up.

","So I watched 2010's CGI cartoon Despicable Me, starring, the not so great since 40 year old virgin, Steve Carell. This movie is not good plain and simple. The animation is solid, but that is all I can say that is positive about this film. This is not of the caliber of the toy story franchise or ratatouille. O.k so that being said am I this movies target audience, well no this is for little kids. And I would not doubt little kids will love this film.

"daventurefilm","8","0","2","4 May 2011"," Sets a mark amongst the 'Animated Greats'
","Likable super villain Gru (Carell) aims to achieve the greatest crime of all time with the help of his elder associate Dr Nefario (Brand) and his yellow mini minions. Only trouble is that he has to deal with the movie's antagonist Vector (Segal) who is also the son of the obese bank manager, whom Gru needs to borrow money from in order to commit this crime. To do this he pretends to adopt three cookie selling orphan girls to get access into Vectors weapon coated house and steal the ultimate shrink ray weapon. But when the children are fooled into thinking that he has adopted them out of love, Gru has to choose between world conquer and parenthood.<br/><br/>After a year of Pixar and DreamWorks going head to head and giving the audience two memorable films involving Toys and Dragon slaying, both with immense budgets, Directors Coffin and Renaud invite the audience, kids and adults alike, into an hour and a half of fun with every character taking their own persona's and fitting into real life situations alongside fictitious creatures (notably the minions). Working on a fraction of the budget, Despicable Me focuses on offering a robust script (thank you Ken Dario) to entice the kids to its well-constructed jokes and adults to its well- assembled character establishing.<br/><br/>When we first see Gru causing destruction as ""Despicable Me"" is bellowed in the background, his villainous ways, although characteristic, are made to be funny and Carell perfects the voice-over to create what I think is the most likable animated character of the year.<br/><br/>The film distinctively fills itself with all kinds of gadgets, as Gru pollutes the air in his futuristic juggernaut tank with an attached rocket ship exhaust. His minions are always hard at work creating ultimate gadgets (something for the male audience to admire). His workaholic lifestyle explains his unloving persona and he has no friends other than his yellow aliens and Nafario, voiced unrecognisably by Brand.<br/><br/>Everything changes once Gru adopts three orphans – the doubtful Margo, pink clothed tomboy Edith and baby Agnes with her mad love for unicorns and determination to be adorable. Aside from selling cookies, the orphans practise for their performance of Swan Lake (more Barbie and less Black Swan). As the countdown begins for Gru to undertake the ultimate crime, his days start to merge when the orphans begin to take over his life, including tea parties and kittens. During all these happenings, Vector plans world domination whilst stuffing popcorn and playing on a ""very futuristic"" Wii.<br/><br/>The yellow minions (don't worry I haven't forgotten about them) constantly remind me of the green aliens in Toy Story and sound like Bevis and Butt-Head stuffed with helium. Their language, although with very little English, is made easy to understand through their actions. Though the creatures were used primarily to promote the film, I couldn't help but think they were put in the background of the main storyline when so much work and fun had been put into creating their unique looks (one eye, fat, tall etc). The idea of a minion being snapped and turned into a glow stick was ingenious. As was the shopping scene where three minions unconvincingly disguised themselves as humans. From what I did see of them they were cute and funny throughout, especially the way they bobbed around as if they were taken from LittleBigPlanet.<br/><br/>Though it lacks in being a first class CGI film, it makes up for it in the character development. The three girls offer a kind hearted aspect to the movie as a whole, especially the younger Agnes who got me laughing out loud with her childish jokes. As animations are renowned for the greatest 3D effects, I expected nothing different from this. However Despicable Me knew how to use them wisely, not in the sense of having something poke at you in your seat, but making you feel like the film surrounds you. It really felt as though the minions were floating around the cinema. The highlight moment of the film had to be riding on the roller coaster as it really felt as if the cinema was riding it too. I had to withdraw myself from saying anything rude as I was surrounded by little kids. Word of warning don't start sipping any drinks or snacking on some popcorn the moment Gru enters the carriage.<br/><br/>I thought Vector could have been less 'cheesy couch potato' and more of a 'gadget building Emperor Zurg'. The good guys had plenty of laughs but Vector made the laughs fade. Like Carell, Segel is hilarious in his films but if you are going to make him a villain then you have to make him serious and not try to be funny. I also thought more could have been made out of Vector's dad (possibility for a sequel plot?)<br/><br/>As a directorial debut for both Directors', this film gave both Toy Story 3 and How to Train Your Dragon some powerful punches and earned its Bafta nomination, though unfortunately just losing out to Toy Story. This is a movie that will really get both kids and adults in stitches and some sobs. It ticks all the boxes that a top animation film needs (likable characters – check, jokes that make you laugh – check, suitable for all the family – double check). Like other animations this one too has a powerful message undermining the cruel behaviour of Gru. <br/><br/>Watch this film with open thoughts. I have picked out some negatives of the film, but don't get me wrong as I really enjoyed it. I may have given it 7/10 if I was a bit younger and did not seem out of place in the cinema. But a boosted smile was on everyone's face by the end, even if the credits dance is slightly cheesy."
"jstienst","9","0","1","26 April 2011"," ""Despicable Me"" is a must see!
","""Despicable Me"" was a very charming and cute movie that had me captivated from start to finish. Although the story moves a little bit slow in the very beginning, it picks up and does not lose momentum. <br/><br/>The storyline revolves around a villain, Gru, and three young orphan girls who turn his life upside down. The actors chosen to voice each character couldn't have been more perfect. Steve Carell did a fantastic job as Gru and he really captured the essence of the character well. <br/><br/>In this movie, there are moments that had me laughing out loud and moments that touched my heart. In addition to the storyline, the character animation and detail was very well done. The movie was full of color so I catches the audiences attention and will keep young ones entertain throughout the entire movie. All in all, ""Despicable Me"" is a great film for the whole family and promises an enjoyable time for all."
"dfranzen70","7","0","1","16 April 2011"," Great voice showcase for Carell's comedic improv
","Despicable Me, from its initial previews, looked kind of, well, lame. Like it wasn't sure what it wanted to be. Was it about good versus evil? The little tots who wind up in almost every scene were barely seen in the initial trailers. So I had sort of dismissed the movie. But that was a wrong decision, as the movie has a lot of heart, terrific voice performances, and a simple, plausible plot that can please both youngsters and cranky old people. And the rest of you.<br/><br/>Groo (Steve Carell) is the world's number-one supervillain. He lives in a lair that's beset on all sides by suburbia, and deep within that lair are house his thousands of minions, tiny little alien-looking creatures who serve to live and live to serve. (They sort of remind me of the alien toys from Toy Story.)<br/><br/>Groo is a mastermind who has big, big plans – he wants to go to the moon, shrink it, bring it back to earth, and ransom it for untold riches. To do this, he needs a loan from an evil banker (Will Arnett), who won't even talk to him until Groo can produce the needed shrink ray. Meanwhile, Groo isn't the only evil bastard out there, as a new kid on the block named Vector (Jason Segal) is already outdoing him in sheer villainy, having swiped the Great Pyramid of Giza.<br/><br/>Vector has the shrink ray, and Groo has a problem. He hits upon a most cynical solution – he'll use orphans! He adopts a trio of little girls (led by Miranda Cosgrove) who have been tasked with selling cookies door to door, and it turns out Vector's ordered a huge batch. Groo sees this as a way into Vector's own lair, thus allowing him to grab the gun and get the loan and shrink the moon and get all the riches in the world! But he doesn't quite count on the girls' charms. It's said that Groo's heart grew (ha, unintended pun) three sizes that day.<br/><br/>Carell gives Groo a Slavic/Russian accent that's reminiscent of, among others, Bela Lugosi and Blofeld. The voice and the character are a perfect match, and Carell is terrific as he always seems to be in his voice work. Groo looks like The Penguin, come to think of it, adding another layer of villainy.<br/><br/>Anyway, one thing that makes this work is that the shift from Groo as terrifying bad guy to cuddly father figure is slight, slow, and completely believable. Imagine if you hated kids, or at least had no real use for them. Then you do find a use and figure you can discard them later on, only you find it ain't that easy. Never is with kids, is it? The movie could have taken the easier way of having Groo recruit the kidlets to help him in his nefarious scenes, but instead they have him blindly pretend nothing is amiss, that the minions are his cousins, and so on. Subtlety is key.<br/><br/>The animation is pretty good, about what you'd expect. It was probably a real hoot to see in 3D, but alas I saw it on my home screen, which is still in 2D and will remain so until the industry has its act together. But even in 2D, it's an exciting, entertaining movie, and it has some 3D-oriented surprises during the end credits."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","0","1","23 March 2011"," Indespicable Gru and The Three Orphans
","Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud's 'Despicable Me' is a charming, colourful and funny little film that centers around a scientist and three little orphan girls (whom he adopts...with a hidden agenda of course). Now the animation and voice casting is first rate. It seems to be a trend to cast a host of big actors to voice the characters and here it seems to have worked. The animation too is very detailed and colourful.<br/><br/>The jokes are quite funny and they provide some great laugh out loud moments. I only found the story to be too familiar. In other words, it's been done to death. Thus, pretty much every forthcoming moment of it is predictable. The vivacious characters make up somewhat for the lack of novelty in the story. Gru, his minions and the three girls (though the littlest one was annoying at times) are very likable.<br/><br/>If only the story wasn't too obvious, this could have been right up there with the Pixar movies. Yet, it's the animation, humour and the characters that stand out in 'Despicable Me' and make it worth watching. One ought to watch it through the rolling credit in order to not miss out on some more funny moments."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","0","2","27 January 2011"," Classic cartoon slapstick updated for today's young audiences
","It's always nice when a movie surpasses expectations. It's even nicer when that better-than- expected film negates the potential title-related puns that critics could have used to lambaste it. In other words, there's nothing despicable to say about ""Despicable Me"" other than the title's overall irrelevance and potential roadblock to making more money.<br/><br/>In a time where the age demographic for animated features isn't confined to under 10 thanks to our friends at DreamWorks and Pixar, one never knows what to expect. ""Despicable Me"" is explicitly for the kiddies, however, with a few under-the-radar adult jokes. Adults will appreciate its cuteness and be generally amused, but Illumination Entertainment's debut film stays mostly slap-happy and goofy, very much so in the tradition of ""Looney Tunes."" In fact, you might even miss ""Looney Tunes"" a bit after this hour and a half of predominantly physical gags where characters walk away from explosions with nothing but soot on their face.<br/><br/>Following the trend of superheroes and supervillains pervading family entertainment the last 5-10 years, ""Despicable Me"" focuses on devious Russian-accented supervillain Gru (Steve Carell), who's best known for stealing the Times Square Jumbotron and the statue of liberty - - well, the miniature from Las Vegas. Needless to say, Gru is losing his mojo and to make up for it, he plans to steal the moon. Only problem is, a new rival villain named Vector (Jason Segel) has stolen the shrink ray -- that he stole. Without it, he cannot steal the moon, nor secure the loan he needs from the Bank of Evil to build his rocket ship to get there.<br/><br/>That's where the ""Adventures in Babysitting"" part comes in, another all-to-common trend in family entertainment of late. Fortunately, here's another area where ""Despicable Me"" has gone and made it work anyway. Three orphan girls with the unfortunate names of Margo, Edith and Agnes manage to get into Vector's super-secure high-tech hideout right in front of Gru's eyes. He concocts what he thinks to be a brilliant plan: adopt the girls and have them bring Vector robot cookies that will infiltrate and steal back the shrink ray. As you'd expect, the girls become more than he bargained for, and ultimately test his cold, stubborn heart.<br/><br/>""Despicable Me"" doesn't necessarily rise above these clichés with a fresh or innovative approach. It merely executes them well and not to excess, never seeming like too much of a kids movie. The yellow pill-shaped minions, for example, while not all that funny or lovable, work well and add a somewhat different dimension to the movie to keep it balanced.<br/><br/>The film's plot is irrelevant and stays that way, which is a sign of a film that understands its role as entertainment and executes as such. By selecting simple and predictable narrative patterns, directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud's creativity with the sequences and characters becomes the focus. Arguably, however their ability to not take any moment of the film too seriously makes ""Despicable Me"" work. Considering the tried-and-true physical comedy spread throughout, it definitely takes a certain silliness to make decades-old cartoon tactics work for a modern audience. <br/><br/>""Despicable Me"" figures it out and does so without pandering to kids and families, a movie that's age appropriate but not exclusively so.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

"Floated2","7","0","1","14 January 2011"," Despicable Me delivers with harmless fun, and a few laughs
","I wasn't expected to see this film but decided to watch it anyway since seeing many positive reviews and feedback. The plot seemed a little weird and far-fetched for me, but while watching it, it seemed a little better and rather original. The basic plot outline is: An evil man (Gru) who adopts three small girls just to use them in his evil plot to steal something and then return them to the orphanage after they no longer serve his purpose. A few more details but that's about it.<br/><br/>What steals the movie in Despicable Me are the minions. They are the little yellow one-eyed and two-eyed guys you see in the commercials and the trailers. They don't speak English, but that definitely does not lessen their effect. They are fiercely loyal to Gru and they seem to take his experiments in stride. The minions even dress up and head out to a department store in one of the more memorable scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>The thing about this movie is that they do not always go for the one-time quick joke. There are several jokes that run throughout the movie, and that work very well. Unlike, Megamid, this comedy doesn't have cheesy and clichéd humour- Despicable Me doesn't try too hard to get laughs. This is an entertaining movie for adults and children, it definitely does not drag itself out as new movies seem to and it is most definitely very, very fluffy. Seeing as they're planning a sequel, I could see it being pretty good and Im interested about what it will be about."

","Despicable me - Review My Rating - 4/5<br/><br/>I don't know from where Hollywood gets their ideas from but they sure is awesome some times. One of the good example is 'Despicable Me'. Imagine a world where thieves are so sophisticated and think of stealing pyramids and ultimately the moon. And guess what? There is a bank who give loans to the thieves with big stealing projects. How convenient!!! The crazy as it may sounds that was few interesting pieces from 'Despicable Me' .<br/><br/>Gru (Steve Carell) is a thief with big dreams and want to steal the moon. And he got a rival as well. That's Vector (Jason Segal) the guy who just stole the pyramids from Egypt. While Gru trying to steal one important piece of his plan to steal the moon from Vector, he plot to use 3 sweet orphan girls(And some cookie robots) to do it for him. But that's where he finds to liking them more than he should be and the moon stealing plan gets a twist.<br/><br/>Filled with unique and surprisingly funny and interesting characters to watch, 'Despicable Me' does a good job. The plot is unique, Animation is fantastic, voice acting is hilarious so what else can you actually expect to be right. (Specially the yellow little helper 'things' called Minions in the Gru's lab are bizarrely hilarious)<br/><br/>I have seeing the best of 2010 animation so far and glad to wrap up with 'Despicable Me'. With big names like 'Toy Story 3' & 'How to train your dragon' echoes in the award nomination lists, 'Despicable Me' has its own wonderfulness in it. Watch it!"
"TxMike","Null","0","1","6 January 2011"," Nicely original story with a fine script and great voice acting from Carell.
","Sometimes in the past while watching animated movies of all sorts, I've lulled myself into thinking most characters are interchangeable, in that it didn't matter who voiced the character, as long as they did it competently. <br/><br/>Now, after seeing and enjoying ""Despicable Me"" I'll never have those thoughts again. With absolute certainty I will say, Steve Carell voicing the main character Gru is what makes this movie rise above ordinary. He is just made for this kind of stuff and could make the rest of his career on it, never appearing on screen himself.<br/><br/>Steve Carell's character, Gru, views himself as the most despicable person ever, anywhere. But suddenly he is upstaged by a young man, Vector, who steals the shrinking machine. We see this early on when tourists find out the great pyramid is an inflatable prop, because Vector shrunk the real one and stole it.<br/><br/>So Gru decides to steal the shrinking machine from Vector, and to pull the most audacious theft in history, will build a rocket to take him to the moon, shrink the moon, and bring it back with him. <br/><br/>Pretty ambitious stuff! But he needs help to get into Vector's fortress and, when he notices three orphan girls get in easily, decides to adopt the girls and use them in his scheme. <br/><br/>Somewhere along the path to his crimes Gru, the most despicable person on Earth, begins to care about the three girls, and that is the humanity of the story. <br/><br/>But all in all it is just a silly cartoon story, fun to watch, but Steve Carell with his superb vocal acting makes it worth seeing.<br/><br/>I was fascinated by the extras on the DVD. This movie was made by a large number of people scattered all over the world, never all at the same place. They used modern communications and linking technology to operate as one big team, rather than being physically together."

With an unexpected intrusion of three organ girls, his scheme is off the track, but don't worry, there will be a happy ending. <br/><br/>The design of the character is well-crafted, Since the opening scene of the stolen Egyptian pyramid, the comic atmosphere has hung over all over the film.

","Despicable Me<br/><br/>When you steal the moon, you run the risk of pissing off surfers, werewolves, and flag- planting Americans – which makes it the perfect plan to propel the villainous Gru (Steve Carell) into the bad guy stratosphere.<br/><br/>After being bested by a new heavy, Vector (Jason Segel), Gru is compelled to up the ante by purloining the planetoid known as the moon. Unfortunately, he cannot obtain a bank loan for his scheme until he secures a shrink ray, which his younger and richer rival has just stolen.<br/><br/>In order to retrieve said device, Gru employs three orphans (Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, Elsie Fisher), who turn the tables and end up challenging him to be a better man.<br/><br/>Teeming with toddler, teen and tall people tomfoolery, Despicable Me is a rib tickler, especially the primrose yellow pellets called Minions.<br/><br/>And if the moon is ever stolen, owls will have to get day jobs.

","This film is about a villain who adopts three girl orphans in order to complete his evil plan to steal the moon. His plan is in jeopardy when he develops a bond with the girls.<br/><br/>""Despicable Me"" is such a good animation! It is so much fun. The jokes are really funny, and what's even more amazing is that they achieve this humour with sparkly clean jokes. The characters are so cute, those potato-like minions look so adorable. Even if they have got only one eye, they look so cute! I really like the story too. Adults will enjoy the warm feelings of parent-child interactions, while children will enjoy, well, just about everything. ""Despicable Me"" is one of the best animations I have seen recently, and it deserves all the good word of mouth it has been generating."
"TonyHurtado","8","0","1","5 December 2010"," Despicable Me, cutest movie of 2010
","Possibly the cutest movie I ever seen. I always just thought this was just going to be another animated comedy but, it was a terrific movie. With Steve Carell leading a team of other great actors like Will Arnet, Miranda Cosgrove, Jason Segal, and Russel Brand really put the movie in a great spot to become a close to perfect movie. The character that I think that will capture every one's heart is Agnes played by Elsie Fisher. Another thing that was a key factor in the film was the little yellow minions, they are also pretty cool. Steve Carell is also the main factor because without him this movie wouldn't have come about. So just to give a rating out of 10 I would give it a 8."

","Despicable Me is an animated movie that delights in its sweetness and humour.<br/><br/>Gru (Steve Carell) is a super villain who meets his rival Vector (Jason Segal) when he steals a shrink ray. Determined to get it back so that he can pull off the true crime, Gru meets three orphaned girls (Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier and Elsie Fisher) selling cookies to Vector. Suddenly, Gru has an idea: use the three girls as pawns so that he can retrieve the shrink ray. But soon, he discovers that the girls see something in him that no one has ever seen in him: a dad.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, we see some great humour from the girls' innocent curiosity and the minions' outrageous antics. The film does get sweet as it goes along, and this isn't a bad thing. When it does get sweet and cute, it pays off, as Gru becomes more attached to the girls, especially during the climax.<br/><br/>Overall, while it's not as brilliant as Toy Story 3, Despicable Me is still a great animated film to take the kids to. It's funny, cute and sweet."
"Digory","8","0","1","12 September 2010"," A Must-Watch-...
","A cute lighthearted movie with a lot of laughs. I have to admit this film had more comedy compared to Toy Story 3. The voice actors do a very good job with their characters. With the exception of Steve Carrell (of course) and Miranda Cosgrove, I had a hard time pointing out which cast member voiced who throughout the film because they altered their voices so well. The movie has its touching moments that tickles the tear glands. One thing I liked about this movie is that it sways away from predictability, somewhat.<br/><br/>It's a cute movie and I would definitely watch everything if I catch it on cable TV."
"smithhn","9","0","1","29 August 2010"," Despicable Me: A must see family film
","The movie ""Despicable Me"" is an incredible movie. There were several different reasons I loved the movie. I really loved the underlying theme and message of the movie; which was certain situations can come along that can really change a person's demeanor. In this movie it was the girls that came along helped changed Gru's bad guy persona. I also loved that Steve Carell did all of the animations for the movie. This movie was a hilarious family movie that every family should see.<br/><br/>There were also a few things in the movie that were not very good. I did not like that the minions spoke in a weird language that you could not understand. I also didn't like the character Vector. I didn't like how he kept trying to beat Gru to shrink the moon. I thought they could have played that out differently.<br/><br/>The movie ""Despicable Me"" could compare to the movie ""UP"". They are very similar because they both have characters who adopt children, and they turn the bad guys into good guys. I thought that ""Despicable Me"" was a better movie. They really portrayed the change from bad guy to good guy a lot better in ""Despicable Me"". You were able to see the change more clearly. However I loved the ending to ""UP"" a lot better than ""Despicable Me"". I thought that the ending to ""UP"" gave a great closure to the movie, but in ""Despicable Me"" it gave you the room to make your own assumptions."

","DESPICABLE ME (2010) *** (Voices of : Steve Carell, Jason Segel, Russell Brand, Julie Andrews, Will Arnett, Kristen Wiig, Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, Elsie Fisher, Pierre Coffin, Chris Renaud, Jemaine Clement, Jack McBrayer, Danny McBride, Mindy Kaling, Rob Huebel, Ken Jeong) Amusing and inventive animated fare with Carell voicing Gru, a villain with a lot of ambition but not always delivering on the execution who finds himself the unlikely foster parent to a trio of orphans who eventually melt his heart despite his ongoing feud with fellow villain Vector (Segel) who makes Dr. Evil look like a piker. Reminiscent in its design echoing the hey day of Rass-Bankin the overall look is fresh and very Charles Addams-ey (hell Gru looks like a dead-ringer for Uncle Fester) and the blend of humor and heart-tugging is pulled off nicely by its directors Coffin & Renaud (who also voice the circus peanut shaped 'minions' in Gru's arsenal of nefarity. **Spring for the extra surcharge in 3-D; the roller-coaster sequence is fairly queasy)"
"tommypezmaster","7","0","4","3 August 2010"," A Fair Film for all
","Despicable Me is base on a story according to the credits. By all the advertising, one might think that this would a disaster. Well Their wrong.<br/><br/>The story centers on a international villain who plans to capture the moon with the help of 3 orphans. The movie has definitely introduced a line of lovable memorable characters that might be inspired of such as Garfield: The Movie and Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs to name a few (and even an episode of Pompeii Pete from The Wacky World of Tex Avery). The marketing contain yellow characters known to be Minions.<br/><br/>The animation is in CGI/3-D, what we've come to see so much of these days. Not only do some of the backgrounds a what matches the movie, but the characters all look so mild and were made with the right people. The show makes use of exaggerated anatomy with various-shaped heads, but by taking a good look at the show, one would realize that exaggerated anatomy doesn't work in 3-D. The animation is very smooth and work as well in 3-D.<br/><br/>Despite the issues Gru is having, there are still some good times to be had with Agnes and her Unicorn. then you've likely seen it in the commercials. This is a rather touchy subject and varies between the viewers."

And three girls help him develop that.<br/><br/>A villain named Gru(Steve Carell voicing him) is wanting to be the top villain. And is threatened by newcomer Vector aka Victor(voice by Jason Segal). As Gru wants to stop Vector from getting the moon. But he sees the three girls from the orphanage as a way to take the moon. Seeing them donating cookies to help their orphanage. Which is run by a very mean woman, who is much more worse than the two villains combined.<br/><br/>At first, the girls and Gru don't hit it off as he comes to ""adopt"" them thanks, to the help of the scene-stealing minions. But they all four learn to get along. To the point where he falls in love with them.<br/><br/>But his scientist friend(voiced by Russell Brand) sees them as a distraction to take over the moon. And has them sent back to the orphanage where they came from, which breaks Gru's heart. On top of that, he feels he has never gotten the respect from his mom(voiced by Julie Andrews).<br/><br/>Now Gru has a lot on his place, trying to ""steal"" the moon, while hoping to get the girls back. Will he do both and plus, gain the respect of his mom as he has tried over and over again! The girls and the cuddly, friendly yellow-shaped minions steal the movie. As Carell is funny but plays the straight man in the movie. But in a good kind of way. Really cute film that does have a heart. Shows you that you don't have to do anything big in order to win approval! Go take the kids and see it.<br/><br/>BTW for the record, didn't see it in 3-D as the theater that I saw it in, didn't have that!"
"Argemaluco","7","0","4","31 July 2010"," It is not highly memorable, but it is entertaining
","Even though the general quality of animation cinema in Hollywood is quite poor, I had some interest in watching Despicable Me, because its voice cast included some solid comedians (Steve Carell, Jason Segel, Will Arnett, Russell Brand and Kristen Wiig), so I thought they would bring their personality and humorous instincts to what seemed to be another bland family story.And they made a good work, but to my surprise, the film also ended up being entertaining and nice.<br/><br/>I guess I am not the only member of my generation who is tired of the modern childish entertainment, designed by marketers, psychologists, lawyers and pedagogues in order not to ""trauma"" or impress the children too much, or inevitably damaging their frail minds (at the same time they are prepared for the delights of the consumerism).So, I always appreciate the slight efforts of films which dare themselves to introduce a little bit of ""edge"" in the shape of black humor, funny misanthropy or a simple subtext which will not be understood by little children.And even though Despicable Me does not posses a high level of subversion or audacity, it at least adds a healthy dose of those elements to its predictable story, and those brief moments of twisted laughs are what I most enjoyed from it, along with the voice acting.On the other hand, the screenplay feels a bit weak and inflated with the accustomed filler of slapstick humor.There are scenes which work well, but other ones lack of imagination, and their only purpose is introducing noise and action in order to liven the slowest moments from the story.<br/><br/>For the rest, co-directors Pierre Renaud and Chris Coffin drive the film at a good rhythm, and I also appreciated some deep details from the screenplay, like the relationship between the main character and his mother, Dr. Nefarius' seriousness and the satire of a bank which finances arch-villains to their own benefit.I think that I liked Despicable Me for those interesting details, and not so much for its cloying main story, with adorable (translation: a bit irritating) who soften the heart of someone who is not really bad...only misunderstood.However, I think this movie deserves a recommendation because, even though the final experience is not very memorable, I cannot deny it kept me entertained the whole time."
"www-jats","9","0","2","18 July 2010"," Clever 3D Funny movie
","Despicable Me's teasers and trailers seemed to represent a few different movies, and that's reflected by the general segregation of comedy styles that the film begins with. At the film's start, Gru (Steve Carrell) handles the dark comedy, the trio of orphans get the cutesy comedy, and the minions handle the slapstick. As the film progresses, though, these lines begin to blur, building to a strong emotional finale and a satisfyingly complete tale. (This is one of those rare non-Pixar animated films that doesn't seem destined for sequel-Dom.) The tale of rival villains isn't terribly original. Nor is the idea of a villain having his heart melted by adorable children. But the way Despicable Me blends these two ideas is just fantastic. There's humor, action, and heart -- what more could you want from an animated film? Also notable is the way the star-studded voice cast handles their characters. While there are a ton of big names filling out the roster, most of them use accents which render them familiar but not too much so. It's a different route than many animated films take, and it's refreshing. Julie Andrews and Steve Carrell especially do well at straddling the line between their trademark voices and their characters' accents. The voice that steals the movie, however, is the adorable Elsie Fisher as Agnes. Almost every line gets either a laugh or an ""Aw..."" (On a related note, I love that the orphan girls are named Edith, Margo, and Agnes. I love old names for young people.) The plot has enough twists and turns to keep things interesting, and the antics of the minions provide a nice side of fun to the proceedings. Also, their reaching contest during the credits is a fun use of 3-D that had the kids in the theater reaching for the screen.<br/><br/>Last year was a banner year for animation, and this year seems to be following suit. How to Train Your Dragon amazed, Toy Story 3 is one of the best animated films of all time, and Despicable Me impresses. A very pleasant surprise.Evren Buyruk"

She loved the glasses, she loved the 3D and she even jumped in her seat a few times! My mother of 49 fell in love with the movie (she even wanted to go and see it again!), so as I am also a fan of the movie and fell in love with the movie, I gotta say it's the one movie to watch in 3D- Despicable Me- I give you a rate of 20 (10 from me and 10 for making my mother love a 3D movie)"
