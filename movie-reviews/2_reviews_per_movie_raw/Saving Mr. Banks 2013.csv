"gailalong-1","9","127","152","28 December 2013"," Saving Mr. Banks is a terrific, adult movie that will change the way you view Mary Poppins forever.
","This movie is much more than and definitely deeper than one would suspect from the 'syrupy' trailers most people have seen. The understory, gradually revealing the early life of P.L. Travers, the author of Mary Poppins, and depicting how the people in her dysfunctional family led her to write Mary Poppins, is the true core of this movie. I will never see Mary Poppins in quite the same way. All of the acting is superior, and the score is excellent. This is not the shallow, childlike movie that many will expect. I would not recommend it for children 11 and under, depending on the child. Otherwise, I highly recommend this movie, even if you are not a big fan of the original Mary Poppins film."
"diac228","8","134","166","19 December 2013"," Truth, not all the truth, yet nothing but the truth, Walt Disney's Saving Mr. Banks is a Best Picture Hopeful with all the good credentials
","Walt Disney Pictures rarely aims for the Best Picture crown, being more a company focused on profits and sustaining its wildly popular brand. To make you haters hate more: they've earned $4 billion this year already and this includes the $200 million loss of Lone Ranger). They usually only distribute the movies that have a shot at Academy Awards immortality, with The Help (A Dreamworks film) being the latest example of a nominee and No Country For Old Men being their latest example of a winner.<br/><br/>But with Saving Mr. Banks, Disney is going the whole nine yards. With a stellar cast, seemingly endless budget (Giving John Lee Hancock a much-less stressful job in directing), high production value, and heavy dosage of drama that hides beneath the happier movie trailers, this film stands as one of the better dramas of the year and a sure-fire Oscar-contender. Touching upon the tissue-happy themes of forgiveness, family, and seeking happiness in a miserable world, prepare for waterworks throughout the two hours.<br/><br/>What makes this movie work more than anything else is the screenplay that didn't start in the studios of Disney, allowing for a more accurate portrayal of the true story behind the making of the masterpiece Mary Poppins----even if the entire world knows that with the backing of Disney some details will be left out. Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith weaved out an engaging story full of crisp dialogue and skillfully avoids becoming too overblown or too overdramatic. And whenever the movie gets close to being all-out depressing, we get treated to humorous moments here and there to keep the audience in check.<br/><br/>In a movie about artists that are addicted to their craft, you need actors that work with the same type of fervor. Emma Thompson despite not getting top billing gets the most screen time, gets the toughest job, and delivers the ultimate performance. She becomes very dislikable and yet sympathetic at the same time, and it is impossible to see anyone other than Thompson deliver this type of impact. Tom Hanks in an Oscar-baiting year does a superb job portraying the icon planet Earth knows and loves as he gives Walt Disney a humanized performance that separates the flawed man from the myth the Disney Company has feverishly worked to this day to protect. The rest of the cast does not disappoint, and we even see Colin Farrell potentially impress some Academy voters as the loving yet extremely defective father figure.<br/><br/>Disney's protection of its brand is the sole reason why Saving Mr. Banks could never ever ever ever ever ever be produced or made by anybody else. But luckily for all viewers, Disney doesn't pull back many punches in delivering the story behind the complex and conflicted making of Mary Poppins. It will be deep in the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards but ultimately indeed deserves the praise—even if you won't see all the details behind the true story on screen."
"baz-b","9","142","180","20 November 2013"," Great tribute to Walt
","Saving Mr Banks tells the story of Walt Disney's battle to get the rights to make Mary Poppins into a movie. I wasn't expecting to like this but was completely blown away. <br/><br/>It is beautifully put together, is hilarious in parts and very touching and emotional at other stages, but is not overly sappy or cheesy. <br/><br/>There are some outstanding performances here. Emma Thompson plays Mrs Travers beautifully - a cantankerous and stubborn lady, yet you can't dislike her. Tom Hanks does a good job of playing Walt Disney - a tough role for anyone but he seems to suit it, so long as you can get past the terrible fake southern accent which is worse than Dick Van Dyke's attempts at an English accent in Mary Poppins. <br/><br/>However the stand-out performance is, surprisingly, delivered by Colin Farrell as Mrs Travers' father. He brings amazing range and emotion to a character that is simultaneously a loving, sweet father and a man caged in by life and personal demons. <br/><br/>Go see it for yourself when it comes out at the end of November. I'm looking forward to watching it again."
"jordathan","8","77","97","22 November 2013"," Surprising in the Most Delightful Way
","i attended a pre-screening of ""Saving Mr. Banks"" last night in Dallas. while i had been looking forward to the film, i had my reservations. after all, Johnny Hancock (director) was behind ""The Blind Side,"" which i found much too schmaltzy and watered-down for my taste. also, this was a movie about Walt Disney being produced by his company - so how honest would it be about the story behind the making of the masterpiece ""Mary Poppins""? would it settle for predictable mellow-drama (yes, i meant to spell it that way) and glorify dear Uncle Walt as perfect and demonize Mrs. Travers as a cold, soulless spoilsport? thankfully, the answer to that is a resounding ""no.""<br/><br/>while it surely takes artistic license with history, the film as a whole is surprisingly great. there's not a weak moment throughout, not a second where i wasn't entertained and wanting to find out what would come next. this film (rated PG-13) surprises with many of the thematic issues it tackles, including alcoholism, loss - and we even get a brief glimpse of a smoking Mr. Disney (hey, it was the 60s).<br/><br/>Emma Thompson has always been a strong performer though her screen time has waned over the last decade and a half, but here she gives a performance that is worthy of awards attention. As Mrs. P.L. Travers, she is an author as protective as her life's work as a mother is for a child and is dealing with demons nearly forgotten. Mr. Hanks too carries his own playing the iconic and visionary Disney at the top of his game, trying to honor a promise to his daughters while also add to his impressive repertoire of cinematic achievements.<br/><br/>this is not really a film to take your Poppins-loving tykes to. this is the Disney film for mom and dad to enjoy. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" will probably be remembered as one of the best films of 2013, and for good reason."
"aglowery","Null","135","177","20 October 2013"," No need for sugar - this goes down just fine
","Once upon a time (seeing as though that's how all fairy tales seem to  start), there lived a boy from Missouri, called Walt Disney. This boy  had a piece of paper with a mere sketch of a mouse upon it. Who ever  would have thought that this was to be the start of such a great  legacy?  In 1961, Walt Disney invited P.L Travers, the author of ""Mary Poppins"",  to his California studios to discuss the possibility of acquiring the  rights to her book - a discussion that Mr. Disney had initially sparked  twenty years prior. For those two decades, the proud author refused to  depart with her precious work in fear of Hollywood's mutilation of it  and repeatedly told Mr. Persistent to go 'fly a kite up to the highest  heights'. However, when sales of her book begin to dwindle and with a  rough economic climate ahead, Travers reluctantly agreed to travel  across the Atlantic to hear what the impresario had to say. This untold  backstory of how Travers' classic work of literature made it to the big  screen provides the substance for John Lee Hancock's Saving Mr. Banks.   Here, we have an American icon that plays an American icon. Two-time  Academy Award winner Tom Hanks delivers extraordinary sense of  character as he renders Mr. Walt Disney with expert attention to  detail. ""There's a lot of voice work, the way he walks, the body  positions, the way he holds his hands, the way he touches his  moustache. How he phrases things and lets sentences roll off the end"",  Hancock remarks - and so Tom Hanks becomes the public face for Walt  Disney and we learn of the man behind the mask (with two fluffy ears).  Our central protagonist is Mrs. P. L Travers, played by Emma Thompson  (who similarly boasts two Academy Awards). ""She was a wonderful case  study, requiring so many different shades. She was just so complex.  She's one of the most complicated people I've ever encountered"", says  the British actress. Her rendition of a tetchy and cantankerous author  who's plagued by the memories of her past is brilliantly executed.   As narrative flashbacks delve into Mrs. Travers' childhood, we soon  realise the true depth of her literary creation, Mary Poppins. Mr.  Banks explores the bond between a young Travers (then Helen) and her  drunkard father, Travers Goff (exceptionally played by Colin Farrell).  Like a puzzle, the story is pieced together, bit by bit and we learn  that her deep-seated adoration for her father is what lies at the heart  of her magical masterpiece.   Demonstrating that her novel holds such personal significance, Travers  continues to exercises a stubborn reluctance to hand the rights to her  book over to what she considers to be a dollar-printing machine. The  straight-talking novelist is repulsed by Disney's empire and this is  only intensified when the entertainment wizard showers her in all kinds  of ridiculous merchandise. As Walt Disney haplessly pursues Travers,  unsettling the adamant writer with his vision of the film, it seems  that he will never obtain the rights to make the movie of Mary Poppins.  We are, of course, watching this in hindsight and the knowledge that  the book was made into a successful film adds a magical quality to the  experience and permits laughter as it plays on dramatic irony; and  there are some real gems for the Disney die-hards.  Walt Disney made a promise to his daughter to make the movie of Mary  Poppins. As the likelihood of fulfilling this promise fades into the  distance, the entertainment-guru reaches into his own childhood and  discovers a new, more personal connection to the emotionally troubled  Travers. In order to break away from a life dictated by her past,  Travers agrees to sign the waiver so that one the most lovable films in  cinematic history can be made.  This biographical dramedy stands as a poetic tale of hope, which  ultimately gives testament to the might of the mouse house and conveys  the magical idea that everybody has a story to tell. Making memories is  what Disney is all about and for its 125-minute runtime, we re-visit  old memories and we also create new ones. With all the conventions of a  family film (after all, this is Disney), Saving Mr. Banks is  supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! (Couldn't resist)."
"freemantle_uk","8","47","59","21 December 2013"," A comedy-drama with a spoonful of sugar
","From the studio that brought you Mary Poppins, Disney has released a biopic about the author of the original novels, P.L Travers. Saving Mr. Banks is the story of her battles with Walt Disney, who wants the rights to the film adaptation, in a dramatic comedy that is both witty and sentimental.<br/><br/>Mrs. Pamela P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) has been hounded by Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) and the Disney Corporation for 20 years for the film rights to her book and she has refused constantly. But by 1961, she has run out of money and agrees to go to Los Angeles for two weeks to work with the writing team to see if a deal can be struck. Her conditions are that the film cannot be animated, there are no songs and she has final script approval. Travers quickly clashes with creative team and Walt himself, a man who promised his daughters he would adapt the book.<br/><br/>As this is going on Travers reflects on her childhood in rural Australia, with her father (Colin Farrell), a loving man who feeds his daughter's imagination, but an alcoholic with probable depression and how these events influenced her writing.<br/><br/>Saving Mr. Banks is a film armed with excellent screenplay and a top notch cast. As well as the likes of Thompson, Hanks and Farrell, Saving Mr. Banks also features Bradley Whittaker, Jason Schwartzman, Paul Giamatti, B.J. Novak and Ruth Wilson. They all offer strong performances and have given us very well defined characters. Thompson dominates as Travers, a no nonsense woman with poor social skills and a British Bulldog stubbornness/determination and injects a deadpan humour with the witty lines she was given. Thompson also brings out the emotion, the serious aspects of the character, as the shadows of her past still linger over her.<br/><br/>One of the big themes of the film is the writing process, both the individual, personal aspect and the collaborative effect of a film adaptation. Saving Mr. Banks shows that many writers use they personal experience and life and become a part of the author. It is hard for writers to let go and particularly for Travers, as she has so much invested in Mary Poppins, so much of herself in it. Her books allowed her to have some wish fulfilment.<br/><br/>The screenwriters Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith, director John Lee Hancock and editor Mark Livoisi worked brilliant to blending the story of Travers butting heads with Disney's creative team and her backstory about her childhood influencing her writing. There are plenty of transitions, allowing Hancock to have some fancy pans. One particular noticeable sequence is when the creative team performs one of the songs and Travers has a flashback. The film slowly reveals how Travers childhood and her father became a part of her writing, used in the books and become a part of the themes of her books and philosophies. This is particularly the case with her parents and their inabilities to cope, both Travers' father's alcoholism and mother's inability to cope with the stress, leading to her theme of responsibility. For a film that is about the writing process, Saving Mr. Banks never really shows about the writing process that Travers goes through, but explores the writing process of adapting a work, from one medium to another.<br/><br/>The final theme and a big part of the comedy comes from the clashes of cultures and personalities. Travers is a brash personality with formal, conservative approach and lives a modest lifestyle in London and a rustic life in Australia. This in comparison to the overtly friendly American and their glamour and excess, from the fashion to the food, particularly sweet treats and the hard sell from Disney in Travers' hotel room.<br/><br/>Saving Mr. Banks has a excellent screenplay, solid direction and balances the comedy dramatic portions extremely well. The film makes sure there is plenty of sentiment, particularly with the score by Thomas Newman. It is a safe film, but still a pleasing experience. It is perfect if you are a fan of Mary Poppins and you will have the songs stuck in your head.<br/><br/>Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com"
"griffolyon12","10","80","108","19 December 2013"," Perhaps a Perfect Film
","I think the wrong way to view the new film, Saving Mr. Banks, is as the making of Disney's classic, Mary Poppins. Saving Mr. Banks is really about storytelling as both truth and escape, as well as a film about fathers. <br/><br/>The film tells the true story of how Mary Poppins author, P.L. Travers, came to Disney Studios for two weeks in 1961, as Walt Disney and his ace crew of creatives tried to convince the ill- tempered Travers to allow them the rights to make Mary Poppins. <br/><br/>I think it's safe to say that we all know how the film ultimately ends, but how we get there is such an emotional journey that it is worth embarking upon. Emma Thompson portrays P.L. Travers with enough emotion buried within the subtext of her words that we care about this woman who is not all that immediately likable on the page, and in lesser hands the role would have been just that. Meanwhile, Tom Hanks plays the part of Walt Disney himself, with a twinkle in his eye, and yet he also manages to bring his trademark everyman quality to old Walt himself and make Walt not seem as if he's some myth, but rather a real man. However, the big mistake that many seem to be making with this film is that it's a movie about Walt Disney, and while Disney is a very important character in the film, this is P.L. Travers' story.<br/><br/>Through flashbacks we witness Travers' childhood in Australia and her relationship with her alcoholic banker father, Travers Goff, who was the inspiration for Mr. Banks in Mary Poppins, and is portrayed in this film by Colin Farrell with a charming, yet tragic likability. We witness how much of Travers' childhood went on to inspire Mary Poppins, and it's through these flashbacks that Saving Mr. Banks finds its heart. Without us seeing what P.L. Travers went through, it's hard for us to understand why she is so against Disney transforming, what is essentially, her own past into a film. This allows us to relate to this hard to relate to woman, which is the brilliant stroke of director John Lee Hancock and screenwriters Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith. As a matter of fact, if there is one word to describe Saving Mr. Banks for me, it is brilliant.<br/><br/>It is rare to see a film made by a major studio with this kind of thematic density, and that is why this is such a brilliant motion picture. There is an honesty to the way the film deals with the idea of fathers and that while they may not be infallible, they can still be saved. Then there are the thematic ideas of storytelling that ring so true to me as a storyteller myself. Whether we realize it or not, the stories we tell are reflections of ourselves and our own lives. Walt says it best late in the film when he points out that the true power of imagination and story is to lend hope, and I think that is why anyone deep down tells a story, and I think that idea sums up Disney's entire career.<br/><br/>There just aren't that many kind of films like Saving Mr. Banks in these cynical days, but if you allow yourself to feel, you will be swept away. This is a Disney movie, through and through. There are laughs and moments of soaring emotion throughout, and I wouldn't want anything different from a film made by Disney. Every time you hear, ""Let's Go Fly a Kite,"" your spirit soars and as you watch the film, the song begins to take on a whole new meaning that makes it an even more life affirming song than you perhaps ever thought of it as before. It's not merely a great toe-tapper that closes a film, it's a song of hope.<br/><br/>I just can't say enough about Saving Mr. Banks, I loved it and I think everyone should see this film. The funny thing about all this is, is that without the film Mary Poppins, Saving Mr. Banks would not exist, and yet Saving Mr. Banks is a film that manages to improve upon what is already a near perfect classic and perhaps even best it. From now on, every single time you watch Mary Poppins, the many events and ideas of that film will take on a whole new meaning. In fact, I can't wait till the next time I see Mary Poppins again to see how it may affect me more strongly on an emotional level now knowing more of the story. Saving Mr. Banks is just a miraculous kind of movie that we need more of. It's classic Hollywood drama, so if you want my advice, bring a hankie and just enjoy yourself.<br/><br/>I give Saving Mr. Banks a 10 out of 10!"
"TheSquiss","8","84","116","9 December 2013"," Beautiful, funny & eye-moisteningly wonderful.
","Despite watching the trailer and knowing the broad story, Saving Mr.  Banks still managed to surprise me. It's a beautiful, tender film that  manages to be sad without being mawkish, funny without detracting from  the emotion and with far greater depth than expected.  Unfolding the story of Walt Disney's attempt to persuade P.L. Travers  to sell him the rights to her beloved Mary Poppins, Saving Mr. Banks is  a delightful film that is deceptively emotional and flows smoothly  enough to be entirely engaging.  Travers (Emma Thompson) thwarts Disney's (Tom Hanks) attempts to secure  the rights for twenty years until a flatlining bank balance and a  mildly panicking agent persuade her to at least consider Disney's  proposition or lose her home with certainty. Whisking her to Hollywood  and bombarding her with all things Disney, the master of the House of  Mouse spares no expense or effort to woo Mrs Travers and persuade her  to allow him to keep his promise to his daughters to film the books  they loved so much. But nothing prepares him for the stubborn, exacting  curmudgeon who challenges him at every twist and turn and demands and  demeans in equal measures.  After the recent Captain Phillips, in which Hanks was astounding, there  is a very good chance that he may join an exclusive group (of twelve so  far, including co-star Emma Thompson) of actors to be nominated for two  Oscars in the same year. Even more rarely, he'll deserve both  nominations! Quite simply, it is impossible to imagine another actor in  the role of Uncle Walt. He oozes charisma and his smile is used for so  much more than merely expressing happiness. There is a genuine warmth  to Hanks' performance and this is one of those rare occasions where I  temporarily forgot I was watching him. He's been a very good actor for  many, many years, but this year I've had to reassess my opinion of him  and state that he has transcended his deserved 'movie stardom' to  become a very fine actor indeed.  Unsurprisingly (and most welcome), Hanks is matched every single step  of the way by Thompson. There is a magical thawing in her Travers in  the course of Saving Mr. Banks where she pokes her head out of her  hard, crispy chrysalis and threatens to become a warm(ish), witty  woman. Early on in the film, it is difficult to like Travers as her  demands become more extreme, her retorts more cutting and her demeanour  downright unpleasant, but Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith's screenplay  weaves the story of the film rights with the tale of Travers' troubled  childhood to give reason for her crustiness and context to her literary  creation. It is this aspect of Saving Mr. Banks that surprises most and  completes the film.  Director John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side) approaches each side of his  female protagonist's life very differently and her buried history is  shot in muted, dusty colours with a jagged Western romanticism that  tempers the bleak happenings that shaped the girl into the woman. Colin  Farrell is on his best form for years as Travers Goff, the drunk father  who lives in his own fantastic world of imagination and adventure to  escape the harsh reality of the real world. He is a man who fails  consistently and knows it, but loves his daughter unequivocally. As  with Hanks and Thompson, the chemistry between Farrell and Annie Rose  Buckley (playing Ginty, the young Travers) is effortlessly beautiful.  The casting is just one of the joys of Saving Mr. Banks, with Paul  Giamatti chief amongst the supporting actors as Travers' driver, Ralph,  a doleful puppy in human form that responds to every brush-off and  verbal slap with another smile and encouraging word. In the studio  Bradley Whitford as screenwriter Don DaGradi and B.J. Novak and Jason  Schwartzman as the Sherman brothers bring more gentle humour as  Travers' desperate, unwilling adversaries. There's no lazy leaning  towards slapstick or cheap shots, rather Hancock steers their scenes  gently allowing both the frostiness and the occasional sprinkles of  sunlight to sparkle with sincerity.  There are hints of Travers' adult life beyond her books but, though  comments remain, it feels as though the backstory was excised for the  final cut and so I came away from the film feeling that something was  missing. The final act is perhaps a little too tidy; it glides towards  a resolution too smoothly and nothing is made of the rumoured aftermath  of the deal, but these are minor niggles in a beautiful film that  carries one along and moistens the eyes occasionally.  Saving Mr. Banks is an unqualified success. It is a joy to watch and  leaves one hoping that Mary Poppins earns yet another screening in this  year's Christmas TV schedule."
"TheConnoisseurReviews","10","56","76","25 December 2013"," One of my favorites of the year
","""Saving Mr. Banks"" is easily one of the best movies to come out this year. It tells the tale behind the making of Disney's beloved classic ""Mary Poppins,"" but it is so much more than just a typical 'making of a movie' movie. While many of these types of films aren't as good as the movie they are about, this one is different. It feels like a companion piece to the beloved classic. It allows us to appreciate the trials and tribulations Disney had to go through to make his magnum opus. However, it is also more about P.L. Traverse and why she loves her character so much and why Mary Poppins holds such a special place in her heart.<br/><br/>Director John Lee Hancock does a great job of making this film something truly special. He balances witty humor with emotional depth, but does so without being too sappy or melodramatic. The film is also well written by being more personal than just being a movie about making a movie. The themes of letting and moving on are handled well and really becomes relatable to anyone watching.<br/><br/>The performances are top-notch. Tom Hanks makes a pretty good Disney and he isn't sugar coated either. The real standouts are Emma Thompson and Colin Farrell. They give strong dimensional performances that makes us truly care and sympathies with the characters.<br/><br/>Overall ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a truly great and beautifully told film. Its individual parts may not be the years best, but as a complete film it is the whole package. It's a movie that exemplifies why we go to the movies and what Disney stands for as an entertainment corporation. It is a movie that is equal parts heartfelt, witty, charming, entertaining, and emotionally satisfying. I give it 5/5"
"asoapboxopera","8","46","64","25 December 2013"," Delightful
","""Saving Mr. Banks"" is an exquisite film. It draws you in with the delightful reality of Disney as well as the triumphantly stark reality (inasmuch as it is reality; I do lack her background) of Mrs. Travers. I purposely leave out parts of the film for the sake of the movie-goer, but let me say how delightful the songs are, the people are, the displays of emotion-- my part as well, as I nearly cried and fully laughed at certain points throughout. The film speaks to me and it feels complete in its currency-- tuppence, if you will-- in taking Mrs. Travers' story and embellishing it with the truth of the creators' (both Travers and Disney, for the part he has in the creation of the film) lives. The lives of the characters-- and I do mean most people seen on screen, in particular the driver and Mrs. Travers' mother-- are well-told and well-lived, and spark a certain comfort and warmth, even in the cold of their realities and harsher backstories. I believe the film has done its job beautifully, and I wouldn't change it for the world. Even the animated penguins, although for me there is still my deep and abiding love for their real counterparts."
"ChristianLeFeuvre","9","5","5","27 October 2015"," How the worlds favourite nanny came to the screen
","Well, there are not many people I know who don't like the film 'Mary Poppins'. So why not see how and where it all began by watching one of the most incredible films of last year, 'Saving Mr Banks'. Starring Tom Hanks as movie maker Walt Disney and Emma Thompson as writer P.L.Travers, author of the Mary Poppins books, this stunning movie tells of the meetings between Walt Disney and P.L.Travers and his determination to obtain the screen rights to her books to make the film we all know and love today. Tom Hanks is, of course, superb as Walt Disney but Emma Thompson gives, in my opinion, one of the best performances of her career as the stubborn author. The film is made by the Disney company so, although it is based on reality, it has been given the Disney sentimentality and sweetness that wasn't actually there in truth. The movie ends following the premier of Mary Poppins and sees P.L.Travers crying, the viewer is given the impression that it is because of her recalling her relationship with her father, but in truth the real P.L.Travers was seen crying at the premier but it was due to her actual hatred of the film, the musical numbers and mostly of the animation, of which she was steadfast should never be used. Keep watching the credits as the director has very cleverly included clips of the original tape recordings of the meetings and you can hear the real P.L.Travers making her feelings known. Given the differences between reality and the various fictionalised scenes this film is a definite 'must see' and I join the many critics who feel that it should have been given more accolades at the Oscars."
"claudiaeilcinema","7","27","39","2 December 2013"," No, Mr Disney
","Emma Thompson is great fun to watch, always. Here, she plays Mrs Travers the one who dared to say no to Walt Disney. The movie, made by the Disney studios, would have us believe that Walt Disney was, well...Tom Hanks. No. Impossible, incredible, almost laughable but thanks to the power of the stars one can sit through it, thoroughly entertained by this work of fiction. The imperious character played by Emma Thompson as a theatrical rather than a cinematic experience is nonetheless engaging and moving. The flashbacks were, if you permit the impudence, a total miscalculation. They come back with annoying regularity and instead of adding, they detract from the central story. My favorite parts were the meeting between Mrs Travers and Saint Walt Disney in London and Mrs Travers inviting herself and sitting at the premiere of Mary Poppins."

","Being a big Tom Hanks fan, I wanted to like this movie...I really did. I just found his portrayal of Walt Disney to be one dimensional. I can't for the life of me, figure where, or why, he came up with his sort-of-southern-gentleman kind of vocal inflection. Being old enough to have watched ""The Wonderful World of Disney"", his mannerisms seemed forced. Add to that, the jarring reversal of character by P.L. Travers and I found the movie to be rather bland, unfulfilling and overly long. Also, knowing how the REAL story actually turned out, I was interested in seeing how they would cobble a happy ending onto this version. As it turns out...not too well."
"duefiori","7","27","40","3 January 2014"," Good movie, too bad it's a fib.
","The truth, a little of the truth, so far from the truth. I read the original novels, and they are indeed pretty far from the Disney Treatment (capitals are in order) they got; yet, I really love the movie (Mary Poppins, that is), but I can also see why Mrs. Travers loathed it. And I read about the real encounter between Walt Disney (a way more unpleasant person than pictured here) and Mrs. Travers, and once again, this is its Disney Treatment. Once again, I liked the movie, a lot; yet once again I see where someone could loathe it. The Disney Treatment is responsible of the popularization of many famous or obscure tales (as an Italian, I'm thinking of Pinocchio); and, at the very same time, it is responsible for their massacre in an orgy of sugary coating. That Pamela Travers had to suffer this twice, is way too cruel. Summing it up: 9 to the movie per se, 5 to the Disney Treatment of reality."
"vinceb-3","2","109","198","8 January 2014"," Not the real story
","Walt Disney was nothing like the man Tom Hanks portrays in this movie.<br/><br/>Disney was an American icon, whose studio and theme parks have played significant roles in American pop culture. However, Disney was an enigmatic man unlike anything shown in this movie. Disney was far from the beloved, grandfatherly executive Hanks plays on screen. In fact, Disney was known to be a difficult and sometimes unpleasant man who paid low wages and worked his animators to exhaustion. In short, life in the Disney creative offices was not the great big party depicted in Saving Mr. Banks.<br/><br/>I understand it's a family movie, and clearly most people have enjoyed the show. But I have trouble getting on board something that plays very loose with how things really went down."

","If anyone wants to know the TRUE story of P.L. Travers' and Walt Disney's negotiations regarding MARY POPPINS, read Caitlin Flanagan's article ""Becoming Mary Poppins"" published in The New Yorker in 2005. Walt Disney was an S.O.B., and treated Travers abominably. Obviously the company is trying to soften his image with this insipid film. I've lost all respect for anyone involved with the project.<br/><br/>This paragraph from Flanagan's piece says it all: ""The première was the first Travers had seen of the movie—-she did not initially receive an invitation, but had embarrassed a Disney executive into extending one—-and it was a shock. Afterward, as Richard Sherman recalled, she tracked down Disney at the after-party, which was held in a giant white tent in the parking lot adjoining the Chinese Theatre. ""Well,"" she said loudly. ""The first thing that has to go is the animation sequence."" Disney looked at her coolly. ""Pamela,"" he replied, ""the ship has sailed.""

","Beautifully ambitious and eagerly constructed, the success of Walt Disney Studios' homage to its heritage is anchored magnificently by the crowning work of Emma Thompson's career. John Lee Hancock's Saving Mr. Banks is a tenderly affectionate tale featuring one of the year's finest ensembles. Following a classic three act structure, when the film begins, it undoubtedly lifts off and hooks you almost immediately. Held back by a few poor choices in the editing room, there's no denying the glamour, chemistry, and witchery that the film sets on you. Saving Mr. Banks is feverishly delightful.<br/><br/>Written by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith, the film tells the story of P.L. Travers, the author of ""Mary Poppins,"" who in the early 1960's met with Walt Disney and his creative team to decide whether to sign the rights of her beloved book to the magic studio. During the production, Travers reflects on her childhood and her relationship with her loving father, played by Colin Farrell, intertwining the magic of her beloved novel and the guilt of a troubled past.<br/><br/>As an unbridled, even at times downright vicious P.L. Travers, Thompson hasn't pursued and thrived in a character of such complexities since James Ivory directed her to an Oscar in Howard's End over twenty years ago. Travers' mannerisms and moral guidelines are captured charmingly by the creative team. Thompson and director Hancock clearly worked closely together to nail the nuance of the central character's focus. She buries herself in the time, and that of designer Daniel Orlandi's stunning costume work, to be the perfect entity of a fruitful tale. Playing the young Travers, Annie Rose Buckley is cute as a button and has some real juicy moments to sink her teeth into. Unfortunately, some directorial choices hinder any substantial connection between her and the audience to muster any real attention.<br/><br/>Marcel and Smith's script is pure gold. There is such a dynamic and balance of charming and witty comedy tied in with heart wrenching and polarizing drama. Their assembling of the movie era, capturing subtle inequities of the business, and painting a magical story, will likely stand as one of the screenplays of the year. There is a heavy yet almost invisible component of layered despondency that the two writers choose to include that make the film truly sing.<br/><br/>Upon hearing the casting of Tom Hanks as the iconic Walt Disney, I have to admit my reservations were at an all-time high. Hanks, who has excelled in his career playing the everyday man, and floored the bulk of America with his performance in Captain Phillips this year, absolutely nails his role as the film executive tycoon. His choices of character beats, that don't put down the material nor distract the audience from the story being told, is spot on nearly every moment. He maneuvers his way with his charisma but allows the animosity to fester in the viewer. I was thoroughly impressed.<br/><br/>Where the film missteps greatly is in the direction and options that John Lee Hancock chooses to execute throughout. ""Banks"" essentially tells two stories. One of the present time during the production of ""Mary Poppins"" and the other of P.L. Travers' childhood. Hancock chooses to tell these two stories simultaneously, awkwardly transitioning from one time period to the other, and ripping us away from the story we're desperately invested in. In many ways, his direction will be seen in the same reactionary split of Tom Hooper's Les Miserables. There will be some, likely many, that will have no problem with his bumbling alterations in certain scenes and there will be some, like myself, that sees that he's still has a long way to go. Not gunning him down as a complete disaster, he has about three instances where the potential and vision are clearly realized. Hancock knows how to tug at the heartstrings. When a scene works, he accomplishes it with the utmost confidence and brilliant demeanor. A tightly paced and pivotal scene involving the song ""A British Bank"" showcases Hancock's best varieties, and also that of co-star Colin Farrell.<br/><br/>For my dollar, everything connects and rises during the creation of ""Let's Go and Fly a Kite."" The cast comes together and unifies in such a harmonious fashion and Hancock chooses to utilize all the supporting players including that of the wonderful Bradley Whitford, the witty BJ Novak, and in his best turn yet, Jason Schwartzman. Hancock operates these three men in an ingenious method. Paul Giamatti is a compassionate force, especially in his exchanges with Thompson while Ruth Wilson makes me absolutely adore the ground in which she walks.<br/><br/>Besides the dynamite work of Thompson, I lived for the miraculous music of Academy Award nominated composer Thomas Newman. Brilliantly hinting at some of his other composed works, everything about the music in Saving Mr. Banks purely resonates because of Newman's continued abilities to insert his own personality into his work. You can't find another film musician this aware of his talents and continued drive to elevate his own material. It's the Oscar slam dunk we've been waiting for in Original Score.<br/><br/>http://www.awardscircuit.com"

","If you thought Nurse Ratched was bad, by the end of dealing with P.L. Travers, author of the MARY POPPINS books, Walt Disney would have probably preferred a frontal lobotomy. <br/><br/>Although we know the beloved Julie Andrews musical will be made, there's enough suspense of whether Travers, played with an uncompromising, neurotic nitpicking by Emma Thompson, will sign over the rights, thus allowing... in her opinion... Walt Disney to make a cartoonish mockery of her literary work.<br/><br/>Flashbacks into her past show us the author's family in Australia, and eventually the influence of the Mary Poppins character<br/><br/>Scenes with her banker dad play out like dreamy (and often nightmarish) vignettes... And while providing a nice break from the linear story, these segments distract from the pivotal Travers verses Disney relationship... Ironically, during Tom Hanks' heartfelt soliloquies into Disney's own past, you'll forget there's anyone else in the room. <br/><br/>Emma Thompson does a pretty good job but lacks the snappy charm to make an antagonistic character fun and/or completely interesting Then, when she does come around, it seems a bit too easy and contrived and yet, like Disney and his staff, you'll be glad the inevitable change occurred: her stubborn determination grows exaggeratedly one-dimensional and downright tiresome after awhile... <br/><br/>Perhaps this was needed to make the contented Walt Disney struggle like a hungry artist instead of grinning like a jovial tycoon At first Tom Hanks seems like he's doing an imitation, but as stress piles on a much more genuine and resilient persona shines through. <br/><br/>And don't leave the theater till after the first wave of credits: you'll hear tape of the real Travers laying down the law to the studio Which must have been a grueling adaptation process, yet for fans of the cinematic MARY POPPINS it was, like all things of the artworld, well worth someone else's struggle."
"p-stepien","5","23","37","6 January 2014"," A spoonful of sugar too much
","Another 'inspired by a true story' movie surefiring its way to this years Academy Awards, tells the story of the odd cat-fight between P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson), author of the famed Mary Poppins books, and Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) en route to the production of the live action feature. After 20 years of constantly pressuring the author on selling her book to Disney, Travers finally reluctantly agrees given her financial plight. However, she stipulates the need for her to have control over the end product with script authority and veto power. This creates tension with the scriptwriter and the musicians (especially given Travers is reluctant to agree to any music at all). With this uneasy relationship slowly boiling over it seems like the picture is destined for failure. However, the experiences of the writer bring back painful memories of her youth, which give insight as to the origins of her beloved flying nanny.<br/><br/>The movie juxtaposes the prickly P.L. Travers with the overbearing optimism of Disney and the Californian sunshine. Watching Disney especially, presented as a jovial and considerate person, as opposed to the troubled Travers, managed to arouse my inner grumpiness, cheering on the Australian-born children author in her endeavour of being an full-fledged pain in the buttocks to the animation studio and her employees. Ultimately somewhat let down that Travers lets herself be corrupted by the twinkle toes of Hollywood, especially with the externally honest, internally two-faced Disney in mind. Thus, I must admit I failed to catch on to the rampaging mirthfulness of the movie, instead finding myself irritated by the positive light being shone on the American way of being, as contrasted to the straight-faced jabbing sardonicism of the foreigner.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson remains a shining light throughout, in thick or thin, in drama or comedy, delivering arguably the best and most complete performance of the year (regardless of sex). Beautifully layered thanks to her starkly English attitude as well as some very well intertwined flashbacks, much can be forgiven and forgotten. Nonetheless, when Disney slowly seems to be winning the fight for the heart, I found myself pulling back emotionally at the insincere American entirety of the movie. Especially given the presentation of Walt Disney in this movie is a far cry from reality, sugar-coating a man who deserves no such accolades. The internal conflict that drives the movie slowly irritates, with the only emotional impact owing to the sidelined back-story of P. L. Travers and exceptional acting by Thompson."
"WholeNote68","1","16","25","7 May 2016"," Fairy-tale ending a complete lie
","The end of the movie shows Travers watching Mary Poppins with what appears to be acceptance and even enjoyment.<br/><br/>That's not at all what happened. The truth is, she watched Mary Poppins and hated it. She never forgave herself for trusting Disney with her creation, and despite Disney's repeated efforts to gain her permission to film a sequel, she denied him at every turn and never forgave him. She went to her grave regretting having ever met the man.<br/><br/>That's the real ending, but of course Disney Studios would never release a movie like that. One star and nothing more, for trying to change history."

Obtaining the screen rights for the making of Mary Poppins and the childhood of P.T. Travers are intricately woven. The entire point of the movie could not have been made without this aspect.

"zkonedog","10","3","3","4 March 2017"," Maybe The Best Movie I've Seen All Year
","As a child, one of my favorite movies was always ""Mary Poppins"". Being young, I obviously couldn't articulate exactly WHY I liked it so much (I'm sure the catchy music had a lot to do with it), but I wore a tract in the VCR with it, that is for sure. After seeing ""Saving Mr. Banks"", however, I was astounding to realize perhaps part of the reason why ""Mary Poppins"" stands the test of time: because the message behind it is one born out of real-life issues.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" focuses on P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson), writer of the ""Mary Poppins"" children's novel. For 20 years, Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) has been pursuing the rights to make the book into a movie, finally culminating in him flying Travers to Los Angeles to begin work on the project. When Travers wants full creative control and clashes monumentally with Disney's version of the film, it is revealed (via flashbacks) how personal the Poppins story truly is to Travers.<br/><br/>The reason why this movie is so touching and genuine is because it works on two different levels:<br/><br/>On one hand, it brings back incredible nostalgia for fans of Disney's ""Mary Poppins"". Just hearing the iconic music again and seeing how key plot/character points came together is exciting.<br/><br/>On the other hand, those (though probably few and far between) who haven't seen the movie will still be intrigued by the fascinating backstory of P.L. Travers. More specifically, the role her father (played by Colin Farrell) played in her life and how that relationship shaped her persona even into adulthood. Some fascinating human dynamics that prove out the old ""truth is stranger than fiction"" maxim.<br/><br/>The hallmark of ""Saving Mr. Banks"", though, is its ability to have audiences laughing, crying, singing, and feeling all in the span of two hours. The complex characters, catchy tunes, and use of flashbacks prove a potent mixture of drama and fun. This is truly a film for the entire family.<br/><br/>Until recently, ""Prisoners"" had been cemented atop my ""Best Movie of 2013"" list. ""Saving Mr. Banks"", however, is just as good, if only in a completely different way. I'm sure I'll enjoy some more genre Hollywood fare this holiday season (""Hobbit 2"", ""Anchorman 2"", ""Grudge Match"", etc.), but I have a feeling that when all is said and done, this one will still be at the top of the heap."
"Irishchatter","8","3","3","3 December 2016"," A very good film of the background of developing Mary Poppins
","I use to watch Mary Poppins when i was quite young and it was such a darling movie. Although it does have a meaning that poor PL Travers died of alcohol and when her family were in trouble, they got a nanny. It was so sad to think PL Travers childhood was unstable but of course, it was understandable that she didn't want Walt Disney to take Mary Poppins away from her. I was astonished that it took 20 years for Mary Poppins to be developed, I mean, PL Travers probably needed time to go through it but it made things difficult for her when Disney pushed her to make Mary Poppins a film. Although she did state clearly that she didn't want animation in the film but since Disney is the lovable businessman we know, he did it anyway. It was unfair really like, she had the rights as the writer to not have animation on her adaption. Maybe it would've been better off if she went to Universal Studios rather than Disney, she could get away with not having animation or songs in her film.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks were absolutely brilliant as Walt Disney and PL Travers. Honestly, the pair of them looked so similar to the real Walt Disney and PL Travers. Great job John Lee Hancock and the rest of the film crew to remember an inspiring icon who was behind in creating the flying nanny we all know today!"
"wildwesth","9","9","13","24 May 2014"," An excellent film on many levels
","Saving Mr. Banks, about the dynamics behind the making of the film Mary Poppins, is Hollywood at its best: people with hardships in their past overcome them through their collaborative art; something creative, sweet, perhaps syrupy, but always honest, and with integrity. <br/><br/>It was a wonderful choice to pick the co-author and consummate actress of Nanny McPhee, Emma Thompson, for the role of Travers. <br/><br/>We see the hardships in Walt's own past, that of Mrs. Travers, and a couple of other key characters: one of the song writers injured in the war, and the limo chauffeur who loves his handicapped daughter (this film's unseen Tiny Tim). And all of these Snow White Dwarf characters, innocent and childlike, except Mrs. Travers, carry this syrupy hope and optimism. The same that her father carried...which may have led to his death. Or was it the one thing carrying him as long as it could? In grief over losing him, she has written a beautiful book, but herself become a living Ebenezer Scrooge.<br/><br/>In this American version of Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"", Walt Disney is the living Ghost of Christmas Present. <br/><br/>Walt reveals that he knows the perfunctory and scrooge practicality of Mrs. Travers belies such dreamy hopes she herself carries, and always has since childhood, writing about a magical savior nanny who flies in on the wind and an umbrella. Walt later discovers Mary Poppins is all about her lost relationship with her deeply beloved father, and Walt works subtly to reconnect her to the very childlike nature of her father whose death she has still not come to terms with. He tells her that this film, Mary Poppins, will be a way for her to come to terms with honor.<br/><br/>Mrs. Travers discovers that Disney is indeed integrating these truths seamlessly, and has done so all along. We are all children, after all, and our happiness depends upon remembering and honoring that. <br/><br/>He is far from fluff. There is more gravitas in that ride on the merry go round than Mrs. Travers understands at the time. <br/><br/>And then she realizes that everyone on this project, even the secretary bringing a feast of syrupy and colorful sweets every day into the office, everyone who works for Disney is in the same boat she is, finding meaning and expression by turning personal difficulty into a positive creation. And that self-knowledge, that personal wisdom makes the folks at Disney able to accomplish miracles while showing remarkable tolerance and encouragement to each other. <br/><br/>Disney was not all slapstick cartoons, talking animals and smiles. A year before releasing Mary Poppins, in 1963, Disney released The Three Lives of Tomasina, a film that touches on death, mysticism, spirituality, re- birth and the love between father and daughter that in grief can become a neurosis. Disney always had deeper intent and content. Same with Darby o'Gill released by Disney in 1959. Even Bambi and Dumbo, dealing with abandonment, death, and the difficulties of grief and separation, the emotional wounds of being orphaned. And 20,000 leagues Under the Sea in 1954. The portrayal of a genius captain's murderous rampage; self- destructive insanity and his obsession with his lost wife honored Edgar Allen Poe as much or more than Jules Verne. These films are nothing close to Mrs. Travers' prejudice about Mr. Disney's work. It was Mrs. Travers' superficial view that was mistaken. And that was the product of her own self- denial.<br/><br/>Mrs. Travers, while watching Mary Poppins, cries at points, but she also still cringes at others. She is still Mrs. Travers. We see the genius of Disney: his work reflects the best of very different professionals, and a deeper spirituality. <br/><br/>Hanks does a nice, layered job. He portrays Disney the savvy business leader and manager. But there is still much more to tell. <br/><br/>An entire film could be made of Walt's role leading the way to the Monorail, an engineering feat unprecedented in America and only faintly recognized, for it remains too far ahead of its time. Walt had his own engineers at the Burbank studios design most of it, successfully, working with a basic concept from Sweden, fighting the clock to meet deadlines. He turned a concept into an actual reality through brilliant engineering and leadership. The first monorail in America. <br/><br/>Walt was far more than a film maker. City planners today use Disneyland and Walt Disney World as a model for the ideal urban community. Walt didn't plan these places as theme parks. His entire vision was to use them as living models of ideal communities. Visiting either park was to be a subtle education, and has proved to be so.<br/><br/>One day that film will contrast Walt walking as an eight year old boy through the snow at his father's command with the adult Walt obsessed with innovations in public transportation, the ergonomics of technology, and the design of Utopian communities. <br/><br/>Steve Jobs, George Lucas, and Steven Spielberg all from California, are childhood students of and adult contributors to Disney's vision.<br/><br/>And of coarse, the better known struggles to get Snow White to screen, and Fantasia, both requiring incredible personal risks, technical genius, leadership, sentiment and teamwork. An entire motion picture could be made of either of these remarkable personal and professional journeys of achievement.<br/><br/>I will never forget, as a seven year old boy visiting the Monsanto Home of the Future at Disneyland in 1964, designed largely by Disney and his own crew of engineers. Sitting on the coffee table, without being mentioned by the tour guide, was a wireless picture phone in a small flat rectangular shape, probably three inches by five inches, looking just like today's smart phone. Spooky.<br/><br/>We are all still trying to live up to Walt's vision, each in our own way."
"Ambak","3","33","67","3 December 2013"," Overlong fantasy
","This is a lengthy sanitised version of what actually happened when Walt Disney finally managed to get P.L.Travers to allow him to film Mary Poppins. Tom Hanks' avuncular ""Walt Disney"" is a long way from the reality of the chain smoking mogul (unsurprisingly). Emma Thompson, as usual, plays Emma Thompson (in the same way that Colin Firth always plays Colin Firth). Nothing wrong with that if your name is John Wayne, but this is supposed to be a character piece. Thompson neither looks or sounds like P.L.Travers and is far too young for the role (Travers was in her early sixties at the time and looked it). As the taped conversations featuring the real Travers over the end credits show, she was far less irascible than the Thompson portrayal. The boring and badly acted ""Australian"" segments (which look like the wild west complete with American train) are largely irrelevant. The period setting is realised without too many goofs, although the same '57 Ford is seen at least three times and why is Travers shown aboard a BOAC aircraft (correctly) but all reference at LAX (and on her ticket) is to a fictional ""British Transatlantic Airways""? This might have made a good ninety minute TV movie, but as it is, unless you are a massive Mary Poppins fan, is not really worth two hours of your time."
"p-seed-889-188469","3","14","26","8 June 2014"," As true to life as Mickey Mouse
","I normally avoid ""based on a true story"" or ""historical"" movies like the plaque. It is one of life's great enigmas that a movie ""based on a true story"" is generally more fictional than a movie based on a fictional work. In the later, by definition, everything about the fictional work is documented, in writing, 100%, and there can be absolutely no debate as to whether a movie is accurate or not to its source. On the other hand, a movie based on a true story may well be 98% fictional and no-one can prove if it's right or wrong. Basically, with a historical movie, the world is the screen-writer's oyster.<br/><br/>In the case of Saving Mr Banks we have a small number of historical facts. Walt Disney existed. PL Travers existed. PL Travers wrote a book. Walt Disney filmed it. The rest is pretty much pure conjecture. We might speculate that PL Travers was a difficult woman, and that maybe her childhood was the basis of her books, but frankly that is anyone's guess.<br/><br/>Anyway, onto the movie itself. There are a few good things about it. I was pleasantly surprised by Tom Hanks, who normally plays Tom Hanks and in all of his movies I have seen has not been called upon to do anything else. I liked the very subtle nuance of his accent, and his understated performance. Emma Thompson is annoying in most things she does, so it's a lucky break she gets to play an annoying character here. Paul Giamatti is a delight playing the only character with any warmth, depth and humanity - the irony here is that his character, the only one that seems ""real"" and sincere, is entirely fictional.<br/><br/>Really it's not much of a story, much ado about nothing. The back story about PL Travers childhood in Australia is a load of cobblers, a truckload of clichés and flights of fantasy piled on with a Caterpillar bulldozer. Take the mother's attempted ""suicide"" for instance. For reasons which are difficult to fathom, PL Traver's character, who one minute is 10 feet behind her mother, finds it necessary to go back and get her horse to follow her mother to the river. And what mother drags her child into the river. I mean, give us a break. And as for PL Travers magically coming out singing and dancing during ""Let's go fly a kite"", Heaven spare us.<br/><br/>To its credit I watched this movie to the end despite its many flaws, not so much because of the nominal ""story"" but in spite of it. In hindsight the reason I persisted is that it recreates a time in American history when things were simpler and when Disney created fantasies, for better or for worse, a time I am old enough to recognise. It is really only in this respect that the movie is historically accurate and kudos to the makers for at least getting that right. I also enjoyed relearning about the Sherman brothers, who, let's face it, contributed more to mankind than PL Travers ever did, and are surely candidates for the basis of a far more interesting movie than this one."
"tom-ballard12","8","7","11","29 April 2014"," Critics Miss the Point
","There have been complaints about this film on the basis of historically inaccuracies ranging from the dialogue between Disney and Mrs. Travers, the relationship between Mrs. Travers and the studio to the simple motif of Mrs. Travers dancing with the writers. This film is not an historical document, rather a story about an author, her book and a studio. The film portrays the Mary Poppins books as an attempt by Mrs. Travers to rescue a version of her father and give him a better story than life provided him, a point made touchingly by her bursting into tears in- front of the writing staff due to her perception that they had made Mr.Banks 'unspeakably awful'. The writers return the following day with a changed ending, one where father went kite flying with the kids and they were together as a family. Abstracted from the history of events, this film is a charming depiction of two people with difficult childhoods forming an uneasy friendship through a tortuous collaboration. In reality, Mrs. Travers never did let go of her father or her books and had a poor relationship with the family that survived her; what sense of hope or satisfaction would an audience derive from such an ending? I would like to think that this isn't weakness or evasion, but Disney's way of trying to give the relationship between itself and Mrs. Travers the parity and respect in film that it deserved to have in life."

","People at my showing of SAVING MR. BANKS clapped two different times during the credits. This was unprecedented--it was like being in a theater at the end of a play. First, they clapped for the movie when the credits began; later, they applauded again for Mary Poppins creator P.L. Travers, a.k.a. ""Pam,"" a.k.a. Helen Goff, when an extended tape recording from 1961 of her actual voice during the first MARY POPPINS movie planning session\impromptu childhood regression therapy hour concluded. The message of SAVING MR. BANKS is that people who suffer through unhappy childhoods--such as Helen and Walt Disney himself-- produce the best entertainment. Though this film includes extended selections from six hit songs on the MARY POPPINS soundtrack, and portrays Disney with the patience of Job in bringing this character to the big screen, the back-story starring Colin Farrell as Helen's ill-fated alcoholic dad back in Australia all but overshadows the delicate dance between Tom Hanks as Disney and Emma Thompson as Travers more than 50 years later. A spoonful of sugar may make the medicine go down, but making lemonade from lemons is at least as important."
"eddie_baggins","4","12","22","20 May 2014"," With a grating lead and some bland direction, nothing can save this one
","Saving Mr. Banks is one of those films that commits the fateful cinema sin of producing exactly what you expect from it and is therefore entirely and utterly predictable from the film's start until it's signposted ending. What makes Hancock's film a true misfire however is that this predictable journey is centred around one of the most horrendous and unlikeable leading ladies (we are talking Nurse Ratchet like unlikeable here) I've been unlucky enough to witness and no matter where her life resolution takes us it's mighty hard to care.<br/><br/>There were quite a few pundits within the movie industry that bemoaned the fact British actress Emma Thompson missed out on being nominated for an Oscar for her work here, but all I can say is thank goodness for common sense prevailing. Thompson's role as cantankerous and razor tongued author P.L Travers may be close to the real life thing but it doesn't enhance the fact all Thompson had to do was look sour, be ungrateful and generally be rude to everyone and anything, an acting feat that can't be overly hard to pull off. Surrounded by solid support everywhere you look, Travers overshadows all other players thanks to her cancerous hatred towards most things in her life and it is supposed to be OK because she has daddy issues? That is also where Saving Mr. Banks fails.<br/><br/>Giving audiences an inside look into the authors troubled childhood in Australia is a nice touch but the way in which it is structured, through flashbacks featuring a questionably acting Colin Farrell and later on Australia's very own (cantankerous and rude in real life) actor Rachel Griffiths, is a play by the filmmakers that feels gimmicky and misused. It's clear that Traver's childhood wasn't a fairy tale but it's also clear that it doesn't give her an excuse to be the lady she was and doesn't justify a life of frequent rudeness. The film does succeed in showing us again why Mary Poppins is such a fine cinematic classic with raucous rendition of songs a highlight, and it's nice to see Hanks enjoying himself as Mr. Disney but you wouldn't say it's one of his crowning achievements.<br/><br/>Filmed with an overall air of TV movie quality and with a script that often fails to justify a reason for us to be spending such a large portion of our time with a sour old lady, Saving Mr. Banks greatest achievement is making the audience wish they were watching Mary Poppins instead; a film filled with wonder, joy, characters we care for and a sense of originality which is virtually all the things Saving Mr. Banks doesn't have.<br/><br/>2 cups of tea out of 5 <br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check out -<br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

","As a dedicated fan of Mary Poppins, I was immediately overjoyed when finding out about Saving Mr. Banks. I found myself teary-eyed from the trailer alone. The movie itself was not what I was expecting from the trailer. It was not as happy and go-lucky as I thought it would be. However, that was okay. It was fascinating to watch as the story behind Mary Poppins rolled out before my eyes. I was impressed with the acting and really felt like I could understand how the actors were feeling. Tom Hanks is a great Walt Disney, looking and sounding the part. Emma Thompson played a fantastic P.L. Travers and should be applauded for bringing Travers' spirit and doggedness to life. Overall a great movie. The only downfall would be the dragging on of certain scenes. As others point out, the ages are not quite correct and other small details, but for a movie based on the truth, it is true to its purpose. A heartwarming film for all Disney fans."

","""Savings Mr. Banks"" is worth seeing for Emma Thompson's peerless performance as ""Mary Poppins"" author PL Travers. That Thompson was not nominated for a best actor Academy Award is a crime. Thompson's performance is one of the most compelling and convincing performances I've ever seen. <br/><br/>Thompson plays PL Travers as a witch, and I'm using the nice version of the word. You know what word I really mean. Thompson's Travers is thoroughly believable. This isn't a cartoon villainess. This isn't Cruella DaVille or Maleficent. This is a woman you could imagine having as a boss or a neighbor. You'd do everything you could to avoid her. She doesn't learn any lesson. She doesn't reveal that we are all warm and fuzzy if you just get close enough.<br/><br/>Some have criticized ""Saving Mr. Banks"" for this reason. They say that it's sexist to depict a successful woman author as being a witch. Baloney. It would be sexist to depict her as warm and cuddly. Women can be unpleasant. I know plenty of women like Travers. It isn't liberated to insist that all women are nice. Plenty of women are not nice at all. <br/><br/>I found Thompson's depiction of Travers to be so powerful that the rest of the film didn't measure up, for me. Part of the film takes place in 1961. Travers is in Hollywood, working with Disney studios on their film adaptation of her book ""Mary Poppins."" Part of the film is a series of flashbacks to Travers' childhood in Australia. In the flashbacks, Colin Farrell plays Travers' alcoholic father. The flashbacks didn't work for me. They had the feel of an afterschool special. Everyone was so good looking, especially Colin Farrell, even while suffering the health effects of alcoholism. Annie Rose Buckley, who plays the author as a child, is cherubically beautiful. The scenes depicting the alcoholic father disappointing and humiliating his daughter, and breaking her heart, did not affect me at all. They felt paint-by-numbers – oh, this is the predictable scene where the little girl realizes her father is a loser. <br/><br/>The 1961 scenes in Hollywood worked much better. Paul Giamatti is amazing in the small part of Travers' limo driver. He brings a wallop of humanity and poignancy to his role that really swept me off my feet. The two develop a real rapport, and they could have taken up much more of the film. Jason Schwartzman and BJ Novak are also brilliant as Robert and Richard Sherman, who wrote the songs for Mary Poppins. In one scene, Travers objects to Robert Sherman's walking with a cane. The film doesn't mention this; I wish it had. Sherman was only 19 or 20 years old when he participated in the liberation of Dachau. He was shot during the war. That's why he walked with a cane. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks as Walt Disney didn't really work for me. Walt Disney was a totemic figure from my childhood. I remember him, in his TV appearances, as rather godlike – avuncular and yet distant, impenetrable. While watching Emma Thompson as PL Travers, I got the sense that I was watching something like the real PL Travers – a real, complex, human being. While watching Tom Hanks as Walt Disney, I got the sense that I was watching Tom Hanks play a sanitized version of Walt Disney. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" was very brave in its depiction of Travers, but very vanilla in its depiction of Walt. Giamatti as the fictional limo driver had more depth and complexity. <br/><br/>The movie is most valuable as a character piece. It tries to say some big things about how people live through sorrow, like Travers' childhood, and survive that sorrow by creating art about it, like ""Mary Poppins."" That big idea really didn't wash for me. I know it's possibly true, but that message just didn't grab me, so the movie was not a ten, but it's certainly worth viewing for Thompson's performance, for her interplay with Giamatti and the Sherman brothers as played by Schwartzman and Novak."

","Once again BIG American STUDIO CRANKS UP THE MONEY MACHINE TO GENERATE REVENUE RATHER THAN TELL A TRUTHFUL STORY! This is crap. Nothing redeeming about it. Sad to see a huge talent like Emma Thompson wound up in this project. I hope she saw this coming after signing the contract, she portrays an immensely shallow and hateful character, beyond realistic acceptability and her performance seems to be pushed in to just going through the motions to collect the cheque. Tom Hanks on the other hand has a track record of being involved with movies that are more interested in generating revenue than delivering a truthful story based on the drama of real life.<br/><br/>The script takes the objections way too far. In pure business, movie making or not, it is implausible to believe that if this story was anything close to true as portrayed a true business person would put up with the garbage that went on. They would have cut their losses and moved on to the next project.<br/><br/>Skip this movie, it's so unbelievable it's beyond junk. I adore Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke in their rolls in the original movie so seeing a glimpse of them again towards the end in the final production was a treasure.

","My family and I had high hopes for this movie. It is, after all, based upon the incredibly family friendly Mary Poppins Author's (PL Travers) life. Our hopes were dashed in a very disturbing manner.<br/><br/>**************************SPOILER ALERT******************************** It is almost impossible to write a review on just how awful this movie was without telling the TRUTH (i.e. a spoiler). The advertising and the trailers for this film were very deceptive. They painted a picture of a movie that was based upon hope, adventure and redemption. THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT. The story is told, in numerous flashbacks to PL Travers' childhood, which is as dark, distorted and depressing as it gets.<br/><br/>At one point, Traver's dazed mother (stunned and shocked by her complete inability to pull her husband back from the brink of severe alcoholism, the flu and impending death), attempts suicide by almost drowning herself. PL Travers gets on the family horse and rides to the rescue, but the rescue is only a fleeting and pitiful flicker of hope for her tragic family. Travers' dad, who she apparently loved, dies a slow, painful, agonizing and incredibly undignified death.<br/><br/>I kept waiting for a miracle, or SOME SEMBLANCE of redemptive hope to enter the movie. It never happened. At the end of the movie, PL Travers has relented to Walt Disney's persuasion and sold the Mary Poppins movie rights. Travers goes to the premier in Hollywood with all the stars and she cries during the touching scenes, but when Walt tries to comfort her she denies the true reason for her profuse tears.<br/><br/>So Mary Poppins is finally turned into a movie after much hand wringing, manipulation and haughty, bitchy behavior from PL Travers. Everybody wins except PL Travers whose tragic childhood is never redeemed. She is the classic portrait of hopelessness. She is the poster child for a child who was hurt severely in her youth, internalized the pain, became a bitter person, and never recovered.<br/><br/>The movie is disturbing and hopeless. Again, I kept waiting for some Disney or Mary Poppins magic. Isn't that what Disney and Mary Poppins are all about??? The magic never came. The real people in this movie, Travers and Disney, made a profit and the masses were blessed with the character of Mary Poppins on the silver screen. But the heart of Mary Poppins, PL Travers herself, lived on in isolation because no one could stand the bitter old lady.<br/><br/>The movie does not depict it, but she died at 96 in London, after having lived a basically awful, lonely life. According to her grandchildren, ""Travers died loving no one and with no one loving her."" SAVE YOURSELF FROM THIS MOVIE! This is not a family friendly movie. The interactions with Travers and her dad are incredibly disturbing and I kept waiting for him to molest her. Thank God it never got that far. This is a dark tale and I find the fact that so many people apparently loved it equally disturbing. This is a story of NON REDEMPTION. I would have rather watched ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" than to have spent my family's time on this garbage. I rate this as one star, one of the most hopeless movies I've seen, ever."

","Because each and every character in this motion picture reflects creativity towards the audience, through their dialogs and actions. Not to mention, with one of the best cast ensemble this year (only second to American Hustle), Saving Mr. Banks is one of the best movies of 2013.<br/><br/>I actually could relate to P L Travers' anxiety over Walt Disney's idea of animating her novels into a musical. Her past, connected to the mystical stories she wrote is bound together seamlessly with the present proceedings. Her childhood and her admiration for her father is one part, Disney's coaxing for the movie rights is another. In the end, they speak hell of a story which samples life, disorders, emotions and desolation. Coming out as a conclusion is that you always have to let go, no matter what.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson is the star of the film. I won't speculate about the Oscars, but the way she carries her air as Mrs. Travers is mind-blowing. How she insists upon her co-characters about almost everything are the best conversations you'll hear this year-end, mostly when she makes us wanna hate and love her at the same time. Tom Hanks looks like he had 467 tans before his scenes and I think her very well attributed to the role. Special mention for Colin Farell (amazing), Bradley Whitford (charismatic), Jason Schwartzman (genuine) & Paul Giamatti (a different role well done) with B J Novak (slender).<br/><br/>The best sequences of the lot are the musical ones where Whitford, Schwartzman and Novak sing, dance and thus try to cajole Thompson. Terrific!<br/><br/>I appreciate Hancock's imagination and bringing in the details and paying careful attention to them; including the disorders of Walt Disney is one thing. I cannot go fact-checking, but intrinsically, the long list of messages this film conveys is sufficient for consideration (both awards and viewing). And it is incredibly pleasing; never bores.<br/><br/>Fantastic music and score, supportive supp. cast, brilliant art setup and a clever cinematography makes this 2013's best comedy drama.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended! The performances, the music & the narration will keep you delightfully engrossed. 8.7 out of 10!<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

"FriedFlyingFox","9","3","4","18 June 2014"," As the film stands: Heartwarming and realistic, if a bit slow
","Let's start off with the fact that, like most based-on-real-life films, there is an emphasis on ""based"". That being said, the movie stands on its own two legs, as will this review. Let it be said as well, that Disney was a clever businessman, and Travers was a clever writer, and both were incredibly stubborn and absolutely human. They both had their moments good and bad. So, as far as that goes, I'm leaving the truth vs fiction/ Disney vs Travers arguments out of this review.<br/><br/>Starting off with the more aesthetic values, it is a beautiful film, and the music, both the score and original songs from Mary Poppins are equally wonderful and memorable. I was told by a friend that I would leave the theatre singing ""Let's go fly a kite"" and she was not wrong. The characters are what drives the film, and while they did have excellent source material, they had their work cut out for them. Balancing between making Disney and Travers sympathetic but still who they are was no easy task, and while some may be quick to judge Travers, they succeed in balancing her character out as the film progresses. The plot is the movie's only flaw perhaps, as the movie is very character driven. Personally, I was not bored, but I could understand how one may find themselves so in the middle section of the movie, specifically during certain parts of the flashbacks or during the back-and-forth fighting over the rights. <br/><br/>Overall, the film is incredibly heartwarming, while still maintaining a realistic ending. There's no happily ever after per say, but a compromise and an understanding that leaves the characters all the better for it, and the audience hopefully a little less quick to judge."
"tomsview","9","3","4","14 June 2014"," Up to the highest height
","I knew Walt Disney's name from the time I was imprinted with ""Peter Pan"" in 1954 at the age of six – I've never quite gotten over it.<br/><br/>Each generation in turn experienced the same thing as Walt and his studio produced those amazing movies. It was ""Snow White"" and ""Bambi"" before me, and then it was ""Lady and the Tramp"", ""101 Dalmatians"", ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Toy Story"" – dozens of them, right up to the present day – long after Walt was gone. At time of writing, ""Frozen"" is the highest grossing film of all time.<br/><br/>One who didn't share the passion of millions was P.L. Travers, the author of ""Mary Poppins"".<br/><br/>What an emotional roller-coaster ride of a movie this is as the audience waits for P.L. Travers to finally love Walt like most of us do. The film is set around her time in Hollywood during the preparation of ""Mary Poppins"", one of Walt Disney's greatest successes. She proves beyond difficult and hates what Walt and his crew are doing to her beloved character. She doesn't want songs, she doesn't want animation, she doesn't even want the colour red.<br/><br/>As she battles Walt, her early life as a little girl in Australia is revealed piece by piece, especially her relationship with her alcoholic father who died when she was seven years old. By the end of ""Saving Mr Banks"" we understand some of the forces that have shaped her life and made her so protective of Mary Poppins.<br/><br/>Apparently it didn't quite happen as depicted here, and P.L. Travers and Walt never really had that rapport, but over time she appeared to appreciate aspects of the movie. What the story does is telescope everything into the period around the making of the film. There appears to be much truth in the movie, but it also takes plenty of artistic licence.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks are just about perfect; these couldn't have been easy roles. P.L. Travers was such a complex character whose prissy and intimidating exterior hid a kinder, more sensitive side. Tom Hanks must have also felt the pressure of bringing Walt Disney to life for the first time on the screen.<br/><br/>The film is full of beautiful performances: Paul Giamatti, Rachel Griffith, Colin Farrell as the father, and Annie Rose Buckley as Ginty, the young P.L.Travers. The film also pays homage to the brilliance of the Sherman brothers and the songs they created for the film – so many of them instantly recognisable.<br/><br/>It would be carping to say that the scenes set in Australia don't really look like the actual locations. They serve the purpose of the story and represent the emotionally heightened memories of childhood.<br/><br/>Funny and heart wrenching, it's hard to resist this film. It has a deeply felt human dimension, and explores the forces that drive creativity. Aided by Thomas Newman's beautiful score, it is almost impossible to remain unmoved as the film nears its end and ""Mary Poppins"" reaches the screen."

","This has to be one of the most enchanting, enlivening and endearing movie I have ever seen, not to mention the most magical, Walter Elias Disney portrayed by the famous legend Tom Hanks who also stars as Disney's favourite toy Woody tells the true tale behind the wonderful woman herself P. L Travers portrayed by one of Hollywood's most beloved and blessed actress' Emma Thompson. The movie itself tells the story of the woman behind children's favourite tale, Marry Popping's which is a brilliant and well written book based in London. Walt, keeping his daughter a promise encourages Travers to give him the rights to her personal story Mary Popping's however Travers unable to give her conscious away begins to give him grief about how a perfect story should be shown and saw as a perfect movie. Walt struggles with her demands and realises that she is not all that she makes out to be and on the outside of that harsh and independent body there is a lonely woman who is waiting to let it out.<br/><br/>The story switches between Traver's life as a child and her current life. The past gives away so much detail about the character herself and how she managed to cope with the situations that she faced and to do that she simply wrote one of the best selling books of all time. Her true colours show through her talented skills with a pen and lead her to stardom. Walt, being one of the most successful men in America and with keeping a smile on children's face's including adults, see's that she just needs to let her emotions out and smile. After all a smile can't harm anyone.<br/><br/>This movie isn't like every Disney movie where there are always happy, jolly sing songs or a beautiful woman falling in love with a Prince. The most fascinating thing that I appreciate most about this movie is that a woman who had a close and reliable relationship with her father manages to express her feelings in one book, simply like the colour red or the moustache on George Banks. A serious story of alcoholism is shown in a strong manner, but contrasts to a semantic of Disney which is happiness.<br/><br/>The movie is beautifully made and beautifully acted, giving me the true opinion on the two stars and I feel like each actor suited these characters incredibly and shown the true story of trust, family and magic. I would definitely recommend this movie to you especially if you like one to make you laugh, smile and cry."

","Trying to keep his promise to his daughters to make a movie from their favorite book, Mary Poppins, Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) finds it most difficult dealing with the author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) who is extremely set in her ways regarding how the movie should be made. <br/><br/>I never saw MARY POPPINS so I was at a disadvantage knowing what Mary Poppins was all about (how un-American of you not seeing the movie). We see that her novel has everything to do with her childhood and alcoholic father played by Colin Farrell. It takes Walt Disney quite a while to put all that together and his little talk with Ms. Travers near the end of the movie is nothing but pure gold. For a while - mostly in the beginning - I felt that Tom Hanks was miscast, but he won me over and I was convinced he was the perfect choice to portray Walt Disney (big of you).<br/><br/>I do believe that Emma Thompson overplayed her part for most of the movie. I couldn't help thinking that before each scene she squirted down a few juicy lemons to make sure she came off as a priggish know-it-all uncompromising ultra-phony pseudo-intellectual. Or to put it another way she came off as a Real Bitch. And, that lemon juice did the job. But, to be fair, after that talk with Walt Disney she saved herself and I was okay with her. Yes, I knew she would turn, (hey, we all did) in time, to becoming a normal human being, but it did take a while. <br/><br/>Anne Rose Buckley who played Ginty when Mrs Travers was a child should have gotten an Oscar Nomination for something. She was perfect. <br/><br/>An excellent supporting cast of Ruth Wilson as Mrs. Goff (Travers' mother), Colin Farrell as Ginty's father (Travers Goff), Paul Giamatti as Ralph who was Ms. Travers' driver in LA, Bradley Whitford as Don DaGradi and B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman as the Sherman brothers who along with DaGradi performed all the musical rehearsals (really good too) for the movie. <br/><br/>The technica-color aspect of the movie for most of the first half seemed to be a colorized version seen when movies were only made in black and white back in the day. Or maybe there was an over-abundance of make-up on the characters. Take your pick. <br/><br/>Though I never saw the MARY POPPINS movie, this movie provided the connections between Mrs Travers' childhood and the Mary Poppins story. And, now the title SAVING MR BANKS makes sense. <br/><br/>The little talk near the end, that Walt Disney made to P.L. Travers should go onto Youtube (there are some things there , but not that talk) so we can hear it over and over again. If you watch this movie on DVD, play back that talk a few times. It won't get old and it was the whole essence of the movie as far as I am concerned. I don't know if the real Walt Disney actually spoke those words but he should have but having known many nice things about Walt Disney he may very well have spoken those words. They were pure gold. (9/10)<br/><br/>Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Should kids watch: That's up to the parents. We do see some uncomfortable scenes when <br/><br/>Ginty sees her father in an alcoholic state. Also Ginty saves her mother from<br/><br/>committing suicide in the lake. Language: No."

Mostly, the attempt to connect Travers' childhood with her later writing and such. There is no doubt that she took her name from her father, but I am not at all convinced that he inspired her as much as the film suggests. As near as I can tell, she was only 5 years old when he died and probably had few or no memories of the man.<br/><br/>That being said, I thought the performances were good and really brought be back to what it may have been like to work with Walt Disney in the 1960s.

","I visited America last year and among visiting several cities and historical sites I also managed to fit in a visit to Disneyworld (Florida) and Universal Studios. During my time there it struck me just how much stories played a role in the innovative and determined spirit of the American people and how much present day heroes took inspiration from the stories of heroes from the past. One such a hero is Walt Disney.<br/><br/>This movie inspires one to keep dreaming, to keep innovating, never to accept no for an answer and to build a better future with your vision. It is the feeling that Disney establishes in its parks and it is the feeling that you experience after listening to the stories of great heroes.<br/><br/>This movie is about the true power of stories: the love of stories and the ownership we feel about those stories, the good stories of our life and the bad stories of our life and which stories we choose to accept as the one defining ourselves.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson is delightful as the uptight P.L. Travers. She manages to play the uncooperative and disagreeable role superbly without sacrificing any likability. Tom Hanks is an equal treat as the imaginative Walt Disney and really makes the giant come to life. Several songs from Mary Poppins brings back a touch of nostalgia and gets new meaning within the context of the story. A quirky script dispersed with several comedic gems ensure many laughs. We aren't dealing simply with a comedy here, however, and underneath P.L. Travers' tetchy behaviour lies a more complex story that is also beautifully explored. It successfully brings about laughs and tears.<br/><br/>This movie is what movies are all about.<br/><br/>As for me, the movie reminded me that no matter how much one might love stories, the purpose of a story is not just an object onto itself to be admired as a created piece of art. A story only truly finds meaning when it serves to augment, flavour and shape our own stories."

He is just a really likable guy who wants to give people what they want and whether this film is truly accurate but I don't really care because he does a great job and the leads chemistry is great. Paul giamatti plays travers driver and even though it's not the biggest role he is crucial because he adds humanity to travers character and he brings great brightness to this film. Colin Farrell in this film is absolutely fantastic in this film, he delivers a performance of Oscar calibre because of the layers he has and the great performance he gives. Everybody else does a great job with there being no bad performance in the whole film. The story has great intrigue to it, even though from the description you would think its a bit dull it just really isn't. It has depth to it's narrative and fleshes out the characters so you care about them. The script has great dialogue with some well placed humour in it but so much great drama that really put this film above good. The style has perfect tone for the subject matter.

"ironhorse_iv","8","4","6","6 January 2014"," Chim Chim Cher-ee, this movie is a supercalifragilisticexpialidocious movie!
","Saving Mr. Banks is the first Walt Disney's company film that takes itself very serious as a dramatic sophisticated comedy historical piece. It's better than any subsidiaries films that Touchstone or Hollywood Pictures put out in a long time. I can't believe how mature this movie is. There is no other film like this from Walt Disney Company besides their documentary films that tackle such adult-theme driven subject matter about their history in the movie business. I wouldn't say, this movie is a family friendly film, due to its dark subject and adult-theme driven matter, but WOW, I have to say this movie knows how to give the audience, a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down in the most delighted way. At first, I thought this movie was going to be paint Walt Disney like saint, when the company produced it, but it's so unlike that. The studios didn't sanitize Walt Disney at anyway. You see Disney curse, drink, smoke, and most of all, backstabbed. In this film, there are scenes that fans of Walt Disney and anti-Disney would love. The movie directed by John Lee Hancock centered on the development of the 1964 Walt Disney Studios film Mary Poppins, and the conflicts between the book author P.L Travers (Emma Thompson) and filmmaker Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) on where the film should go. I would greatly advice to see that movie, before seeing this, so you don't get confused. Both are equally in love with Mary Poppins, the source book material. Walt Disney wants to make the film to show love to his daughter, while P.L Travers wants to keep it all for herself as a memorial of her own father play by Colin Farrell in flashbacks. Walt Disney wanted Mary Poppins, a musical animation film, while P.L Travers wanted a dark Ronald Dahl's type live action movie. It's easy to say, Saving Mr. Banks is a movie about making a movie, but it has deeper themes than that. In a sense, the movie is mostly more rooted in the conflict between interpretations of what people view as naïve optimism escapists versus nihilism realism beliefs. Both Walt Disney & P.L Travers react to past pains different and it shows in their actions and their works. Tom Hanks, while not too much looking like the real life Disney, pulls it off. In real life, Tom Hanks is a distant cousin to the Disney family. You can't help, being happy every time, he is on screen even if you know it is Tom Hanks playing Walt Disney. After a while, you forget that, and see Disney there. While, I would had love to see more about Disney's personal life and maybe more hints of his well-known controversial nature. I think the movie does a fair adaptation of what Walt Disney might had been during that time. I think those who think he was anti-Semitic, racist or fascist might want to take a closer look at his life by researching rather than criticizing this film with faults accusations. This film isn't about Disney, at all. It's not his bio-pic. Indeed, this movie is mostly about P.L Travers's story. Emma Thompson is great as the always unhappy, strict, negative P.L Travers. Some people might not like the movie due to her unlikeable nature, but with a great positive supporting casting roles from Paul Giamatti, Jason Schwartzman, B.J Novak, Bradley Whitford, and Colin Farrell surrounded her, you can feel the love that they all had for the project. I can see any of these supporting actors or main actors getting Oscars for their roles. Never once did I thought, her character went too far out, that make me not care for her tragedy life story. She indeed had some of the best mean-spirited one liners in the film and some lovely heart-felt moments with the crew making the film. In real life, P.L Travers never lightened up, and went so far to say, she hate the final copy of 1964's Mary Poppins. We don't see that in the film, but the movie doesn't hide the fact, she might had hate it with all her scorning. Like, Walt Disney, I think the movie gives a fair adaptation of the real P.L Travers. She was a lot worst in real life. At less, the movie doesn't show the harsh relationship between her and her son like in some versions of the script has. It would make her look too evil. In my opinion, the movie, Mary Poppins is a lot better than the book version. While the great satire and subtle humor of the book is great. I have to say, Travers was truly wrong about the picture. The anti-feminist ending as she call it, wasn't anti-feminist at all. The animation was ground breaking and the songs were charming. Without Mary Poppins great success, we wouldn't had the great Pirate of the Caribbean ride that was pay by Mary Poppins success in the box office. Without that ride, we wouldn't get the great film series. So it was a win-win. Now for this movie, pacing. It is pretty good, but it seems that the series of flashbacks depicted Travers' turn of the century youth in Australia seem like a different movie than that of the 1960's California settling. Both the locations of Australia and Southern California were beautiful to watch. I love the wardrobe in this film. The soundtrack is amazing. It's nice to hear the Sherman Brother's music for Mary Poppins, again. I adore Thomas Newman's score. Overall: a great cheery, upbeat movie with a very dark undertow."

","I found this as distasteful as You've Got Mail, and for much the same reasons. A powerful man with a veneer of amiability (played in both cases by Tom Hanks) attains the object of his desire by overcoming and taking possession of a female adversary through a questionably sincere appeal to her emotions.<br/><br/>A medieval French nobleman is supposed to have said, ""Tell them anything, just get them in bed."" That's the story of this movie. Disney desperately wants the rights to Mary Poppins. Travers doesn't want to give up control and risk having her creation vulgarized. Disney tries the whole arsenal of Hollywood charm. The unbendingly British Travers is immune and impervious. Disney finally cracks her after his people find out the back story of her traumatized childhood in Australia. The scene in which he appeals to her sympathy and finally wins her trust by recounting his own childhood misery is a masterwork of fake sincerity. Once her signature is on the Disney contract, she is no longer an object of desire but a problem who must be managed lest she interfere with the marketing of the movie. She is not pleased with the result, but her objections don't matter. <br/><br/>In sum, this is a microcosm account of the contempt with which Hollywood treats the writers of literary property that it wants to adapt to its own purposes, told not from the perspective of the embittered writer but with the smug satisfaction of the victorious studio. It is, in short, the locker room account of a conquest, and all the more distasteful for being well told."

","If you aren't 50 yet, this film won't mean all that much to you. This is a film about the making of a film so beloved to children from a certain age. Certainly this isn't a new premise. What is new is the characters, fictional and living, who get our attention. We adored Walt Disney and loved the character of Mary Poppins.<br/><br/>A good rule of thumb when it comes to movies. If you want to see a movie, please don't read the book or other source material ahead of time. This movie is a dramatized version of the making of the psyche of P. Travers. License is taken. It is entertainment and not a documentary. Even so, it is well worth it.<br/><br/>Early on, I hated this film. It was unsettling. I had expected some sort of nostalgic, stuffed-animal hugging film about a curmudgeonly old lady who meets up against the greatly-admired and soft-hearted Walt Disney. I wasn't getting that.<br/><br/>What I saw was a dysfunctional family, alcoholism, strife, and a father who can't set fantasy aside long enough to keep himself employed and his family safe. On the other side was an entertainment giant who would not be denied in his quest to meet a promise to his children.<br/><br/>After a while, I noticed that I didn't hate this movie. And before it was over, long before, I began to love this film.<br/><br/>It is complicated. Walt Disney is neither saint nor sinner. He has a vision for entertainment that he is unwilling to compromise. But when he wants something, he will doggedly chase after it. Travers is more than just a prickly old lady. She is a loner who doesn't like children, is superstitious, and uncaring of anyone other than Mary Poppins.<br/><br/>Mary Poppins is a character created from her painful past to deal with her deep hurts. She is based on a real person. The books about Mary Poppins are fantasy. The movie made from the books is significantly different from Travers view of her past. She hates the movie not because it is untrue to her books (and it isn't). She hates the movie because it is not true to the character. Julie Andrew's Mary Poppins is light and airy. Travers' Mary Poppins is solid and protecting.<br/><br/>Certain other themes are touched upon briefly. Disney's smoking is referenced. Like Travers' father's drinking, it is a habit that helped kill him. Travers' sexual preferences are hinted at but not a word is spoken.<br/><br/>I suspect that part of the gulf that divides Travers from Disney is that Disney is the sort of father that Travers wanted. But while Disney was successful, long-lived, and faithful to his promises to his children, Travers' father over promised, over drank, and died early. The more Disney talks about his promise to his daughters, the deeper Travers' resentment seems to build. Disney wants to deliver a happy ending to his daughters and nothing will stop him. Travers' father didn't deliver and from this love-hate-disappointment seed grows the fictional Mary Poppins who comes and rights the world giving Travers the happy ending in literature that she did not get in real life.<br/><br/>In the end we see Travers in a sympathetic light. In reality, she was a mean old lady who hated the final product.<br/><br/>Walt Disney is the only person who gets what he goes after...a happy ending. Travers doesn't get the Mary Poppins she wanted either in real life or in film.<br/><br/>Acting is superb, by the way."

","With IMDb so strict about spoilers, I'm surprised they display the title of this movie. Turns out Mary Poppins is there for Mr. Banks and not his kids. At least, the filmmakers treat this as a revelation when it is dramatically stated close to the end of the movie. If they wanted that to be a moment, they should have called the film something other than ""Saving Mr. Banks.""<br/><br/>And that's the problem. There just aren't any big, really interesting dramatic moments. There are moments treated as big and dramatic. And, because there are big-name actors, delightful Sherman brothers music, and really good lighting and makeup, at first it all seems bigger than it is.<br/><br/>Truth is, there's just not much to ""Saving Mr. Banks."" Few surprises and tepid when they arrive.<br/><br/>The film is pleasant enough, but the back-stories revealed to us about Poppins novelist P. L. Travers and Disney emperor Walt Disney just aren't that interesting. Or surprising. Or revealing to their characters.<br/><br/>Of course, Walt is portrayed just about as wonderful as one could imagine. Travers is a difficult, no-nonsense Brit who has a sudden change of heart for no particularly good reason. Even Paul Giamatti never gets angry nor snarls even once, which is rare not to see.<br/><br/>Hanks does a great job as Disney. Everyone else is adequate, none seeming to stray too far from whom they are anyway, or, at least, the types of people they usually play.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the only thing that makes anyone interesting in this movie is who they are playing and a very few mildly curious moments in those people's lives. The actors and writers bring very little to the table.<br/><br/>It's not boring. It's not that interesting. If you like Disney and Mary Poppins, you'll still like them after seeing this. In fact, you'll change very little before, during, and after watching this movie other than a few well-structured weepy moments. Kind of like a really good Hallmark TV movie."

"sheltoncomm-522-894813","4","7","16","5 January 2014"," View Saving Mr. Banks. Enjoy it for what it is—another Walt Disney fairytale.
","Saving Mr. Banks is a nice film: nothing outstanding and nothing inefficacious. It's not much fun either. The anchor that keeps this film from soaring is the inherent conflict in the story. To get permission from Mrs. Travers, Disney has to grant her total creative control over the film. Unfortunately, Mrs. Travers is a prig. Her demons thwart Disney in all phases of preproduction: scripting scenes, musical selections, and art-direction suggestions. She nit picks every detail to a faretheewell. For three examples: no red color in any scene, change the leading man, and no animation—a deal breaker in her contract. What we do not know is how much of this narrative is fiction or how much is factual.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, what's maddingly confusing is: why would Walt Disney grant such total creative control to this neurotic person who does not know the difference between ""a sprocket hole and an f-stop"" in motion-picture scripting and production, as it were. Why would he risk millions of dollars and his studio's reputation on such a prodigious gamble with a rank psychotic novice to whom he has to kowtow? It does not make sense, no matter the actual or fictional facts. Accordingly, such a crucial and addlebrained decision by Hollywood's consummate producer cast a pall of doubt over the entire narrative. However, in truth, he'd promised his two daughters that he would produce a film based on Mary Poppins. Accordingly, he was driven by his promise. Notwithstanding, logic and business sense demands that at some point he should have cancelled the project. (Fortunately he did not and Mary Poppins was a great film.) <br/><br/>Mrs. Travers' psychotic mien does not engender empathy. We cannot like or identify with her, and without audience empathy, the character is flawed. Perhaps this is a real-life portrayal. Nonetheless, the script could have eased her irrational obstinacy to make her character more empathetic. Occasionally, we see a scene that hints at PL's empathetic humanity: she dances a few steps with Richard Sherman, sits on the grass and chats with her chauffeur, and finally decides to enter the bar at the Beverly Hills hotel—perhaps to order an adult beverage, or to talk with a patron. Alas! She fails on both accounts. She orders tea. And with true cinema-magic, the bartender just happens to have a silver service under the bar and complies with her request.<br/><br/>Another key player that drags parts of the film in to a morass of negativism is the alcoholic Travers Goff—PL's father. He loves PL and dotes over her, but in the end embarrasses her. Seemingly, he ignores his wife (who attempts suicide), new-born child, and PL's younger sister. He dies of some unknown reason related to alcoholism. It's here that PL's neurosis is conceived. Clearly, Goff is a flawed character on whom we look askance. No empathy here. Good riddance, we might suggest. For reasons not clear, the fatherless family seems to prosper enough to hire a nanny, Aunt Ellie: PL's Mary Poppins character no doubt. <br/><br/>For the record: I checked my atlas and found that the Goff's home in Allora, the ""End of the railroad line,"" is about 120 miles southwest of Brisbane, Queensland. Having spent some time Down Under, I cringed at the scenes of PL and her father frolicking in the bush. This area has a surfeit of highly-venomous reptiles: the Brown, the Tiger, and the Tiapan, for examples. <br/><br/>I would suggest that the scenes in Australia are surplus. The film would have more coherence without the frequent crosscutting between ""now"" and ""Australia."" PL's neurosis could have been readily established with other techniques early in the scenario.<br/><br/>Other points that puzzle us are:  Answering P L's question, we're told that Robert Sherman was shot. Really? By whom? Why? When? There are no answers. Seems to me this is a key script point. If not, why include it?  PL is an Aussie. Why does she keep it a secret? Most Aussie's I've met are damn proud of their heritage—even those who are the prodigy of the inmates from the former penal colony.  Why does PL use a nom de plume? Her birth name is Helen Goff.<br/><br/> Towards the end, Disney, frustrated with PJ's shenanigans, confronts her in her London flat with a cogent analysis of her psychosis, and he concludes with the dictate that she ought to forgive her father. Voila! Pamela Lyndon Travers' demons are excised, Mary Poppins is completed, and is a phenomenal success. This scene stretches credulity: by what chicanery did Walt Disney phantom the details of PJ's childhood? How did Disney garner his psychological skills? Why should Travers accept the analysis from the armature psychologist, Disney?"
"JamesHitchcock","6","7","16","13 December 2013"," No! No! No! Mr Disney!
","The ""Mr Banks"" of the title is not a comrade-in-arms of Private Ryan but the stern paterfamilias from ""Mary Poppins"". The film's subject-matter is the negotiations between Walt Disney and Pamela Travers, the author of ""Mary Poppins"", about the film rights to her book. It is sometimes assumed that all writers hate film adaptations of their works, and only sell the rights because they need the money, but this is by no means always the case. Dodie Smith, for example, loved the Disney cartoon of ""101 Dalmatians"", even though it is by no means 100% faithful to her novel. In the case of Travers, however, this assumption appears to be quite correct. According to this film she disliked the idea of ""Mary Poppins"" being filmed, only entered into negotiations because she was in dire financial straits, and drove Disney and his studio executives to distraction with her cavilling and nit-picking demands. <br/><br/>Alternating with the scenes set in sixties California are those depicting Travers' childhood in Edwardian Queensland. (Everyone assumed Travers was British, but she was actually Australian by birth. Her real name was Helen Goff, ""Pamela Travers"" being a stage name adopted during her career as an actress). The film's thesis seems to be firstly that the fictitious Mr. Banks was inspired by Travers' memories of her own father and secondly that the theme of the novel is how Mary Poppins ""saves"" Banks by revealing his better nature and preventing him from being a strict, bad-tempered, authoritarian old patriarch. Only when Disney shows that he appreciates what the novel is all about does Travers drop her opposition to a film version. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the story told here does not always seem to bear out that thesis. In the first place, I don't recall from my own memories of the books that George Banks was such a domestic tyrant; that seems to have been Disney's conception rather than Travers's. Secondly, Mr Goff, as played by Colin Farrell, is far from stern or authoritarian. Although he is, like Banks, an employee of a bank, he is a kindly and loving father. His faults are very different ones; he is perhaps too indulgent with his children, and he is an alcoholic who has damaged both his health and his career by heavy drinking. He is a sensitive, imaginative man, but it is implied that he is not really suited to a career in banking and that the incompatibility between his personality and his profession may be at the root of his personal troubles. <br/><br/>Both Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks have been praised for their performances, even talked of as possible Oscar candidates, but I was less impressed. Thompson has described Travers as ""a woman of quite eye- watering complexity and contradiction,"" and there seems to have been a lot of truth in this characterisation. That was not, however, the impression I was left with from this film. Her Travers seemed to me to be far from complex, simply an upper-middle-class English spinster with the personality of a pedantic, pernickety schoolmarm. (""No, no, no, Mr Disney!"") Thompson's performance is technically a good one- if you wanted a one-dimensional portrayal of an upper-middle-class English spinster with the personality of a pedantic, pernickety schoolmarm it could hardly be bettered- but there was no way in which I could imagine this woman as a creative artist of any kind. This came as a disappointment, as I have greatly admired Thompson in some of her earlier films, such as ""Much Ado about Nothing"", ""Sense and Sensibility"", ""Howard's End"" and ""An Education"". <br/><br/>As for Hanks, Hollywood's resident Mr Nice Guy achieves a convincing visual likeness to Walt Disney, but struck me as far too avuncular. By all accounts Disney was a shrewd, not to say ruthless, businessman and difficult to work for, but these aspects of his character do not come across here. (To say nothing of all those rumours of racism, anti- Semitism and Fascist sympathies). Disney's determination to film ""Mary Poppins"" is explained by a promise he once made to his two daughters, not by the money he stands to make if the film is a success. (By the time the film appeared in 1964 Disney's daughters were aged 31 and 28 and probably no longer worried about a promise their father had made to them as children). ""Saving Mr Banks"" also tactfully omits the fact that Travers hated the film of ""Mary Poppins"" and refused permission for any more of her books to be filmed, which explains why such a massively successful film was not followed by any sequels. <br/><br/>There are some good supporting performances, notably from Paul Giamatti as Travers's chauffeur Ralph from Farrell and from Annie Buckley who plays Travers as a young girl. I felt that the Australian scenes were the best part of film, and wondered if it might have been more interesting had it been made as a straightforward biography of Travers without concentrating on the Disney angle. But of course, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" was made by none other than Walt Disney Pictures, who were not going to miss the opportunity to generate some good PR for their company. If some other studio had produced it we might have ended up with a more honest film. 6/10"

It's Disney patting itself on the back (again) for working so sympathetically with the owner of an IP they're interested in and providing her with the emotionally healing she's always needed.<br/><br/>It's really upsetting what the reality behind this story is.

"DarthVoorhees","5","4","8","27 March 2014"," A spoonful of diabetic sugar
","'Saving Mr. Banks' is just another dose of Disney goofiness meant to spread the Disney feel again as their entire film catalog has done. I don't know if I expected something different walking into this film. I was hoping that 'Saving Mr. Banks' would be a drama that dealt with real characters. Instead though I find a cartoon starring a Walt Disney and a PL Travers who are more akin to Mickey than they were to their real life counterparts.<br/><br/>I am drawn to the character of PL Travers in a lot of ways here because I feel for her. Not in the sense the movie probably intended me to do. There are a great many flashbacks(which really hurt the pace and dramatic timing of the film) to Travers' childhood in Australia. Colin Farrell plays Travers' father who has a happy face hiding alcoholism. Every easy dramatic choice is made in dealing with Travers' past and the effect it had on her. Alcoholism and the effect it has on families is so much more than the ""I did something wrong"" guilt trip that is portrayed in the film. And so this piece of the film is pretty predictable and melodramatic.<br/><br/>Travers however is not a wasted character despite the laziness in developing the portrayal of her emotional scars. I love her as an artist, Emma Thompson makes some safe choices with the defense mechanism Travers shows but they definitely come from an inspired place. Mary Poppins is her creation and she wants to fight for it. It's a really simple motivation but it's powerful. We want to see her stand up to Disney because we know that great works of literature lose their meaning through the commercialism film medium. The central conflict over Mary Poppins is inspired. The problem of course is that Disney not only wins it. He wins it in an ethically unsound way. Disney gets everything he wants and Mary Poppins becomes his own.<br/><br/>Of course the big draw to the film for me and so many other film goers was that Disney himself was being recreated for the screen. Walt Disney was a fascinating man. He had an almost split personality. Walt presented himself as a happy surrogate father to children everywhere who tuned in to see him. That was certainly a vital part in dissecting the whole but so are the other aspects. Walt Disney was in many ways an unsavory character. I didn't expect Disney to allow their namesake to be portrayed in an overly negative light because some stories are nothing more than extremities. 'Saving Mr. Banks' however canonizes Disney. It canonizes Disney to the point where we can almost see past the Hollywood magic and see what really happened here. Disney is a con man to Pl Travers. He promises her artistic credibility but in the end he turns Mary Poppins into something of his own. Which is fine. It's been done plenty of times before but in the dramatization of this we are supposed to root for Disney. There is a moment in the film where Disney accuses Travers of thinking he is nothing more than a 'Midas' looking for gold bricks to his kingdom. That is of course exactly what Disney was. Mary Poppins was a notch on his belt. <br/><br/>My biggest problem with the film and why I think it is ultimately a failed exercise is the ending. PL Travers hated the decisions Disney made throughout the entire thing. At the end while not explicitly said we are lead to believe that Travers loved the film. This goes against the actual history of what happened and is nothing more than revisionism to polish Disney's halo. The Disney myth is a powerful one but intelligent viewers can see past it. This is just the same goofy Disney sentimentality we've been subjected to and it's even more offensive in that we are telling the story of real people. Disney may smoke and swear in this but he's still the bright eyed Uncle Walt who can do no wrong. Walt gets his Mary Poppins, why do we have to love him for messing with someone's integrity too?<br/><br/>Uncle Walt adds another brick to his castle"

","Disney's live-action wing takes a look at the difficult, complicated working conditions that led to the creation of the studio's 1964 classic, Mary Poppins. Emma Thompson succeeds memorably as P.L. Travers, the complex, seemingly-joyless British authoritarian behind the source novel, while Tom Hanks is, surprisingly, only okay as Walt Disney himself. The tough, contested relationship between these two, opposite sides of the same coin, forms the core of the story; Disney pushes to make the film uplifting and creative, while Travers fights to maintain her characters' dignity. On the surface, it's a good example of how the powers of dedication and creativity can overcome difficult circumstances to make a brilliant piece of work - perhaps one that's even better than they'd have made amidst calmer waters. I felt that the scenes inside Disney's idea factory, superficial as they proved to be, were the film's best. Writers, songsters and artists giving it their all, only to be shot down by a stubborn client on a technicality and come back for more - that's the intriguing stuff. The frequent dalliances into flashback and character moments, though effective in a classical sense, felt too formulaic and artificially sweetened for my taste. A fine enough ride, though I was hoping for something slightly more off-the-beaten-path."

It was good to see Tom Hanks playing Walt Disney as a character with noticeable flaws too... still a nice man who loves his studio but one who cares more about business than anything and GASP he smokes! Considering this movie is being distributed by his self-named studio, they could've quite easily whitewashed his character to be 'perfect', but they don't, so props there I guess.<br/><br/>While the movie embellishes some parts of P.L Travers life and even invents some scenes, it still feels true to who she was as a person until the end. You can see why she protected the rights to her book so closely, and what made her write it in the first place. Thompson and Hanks play off each other very well, and the feeling that you're actually there in the early 60's is as good as anything you'd see in Mad Men. It's just a great movie which will make you laugh and may even make you cry, and I thoroughly recommend it.<br/><br/>...And now I kind of wish P.L Travers had been alive to see the mess they made of Mary Poppins Returns.

","On its surface there's little more to see here than a success-spoiled entrepreneur battling against the will of a difficult creator but, to those who can see it, the film offers so much more in the way of delving into the heart and reason behind Travers' passionate defence of a story; into which she poured so much of herself and those from her life whom she loved and adored. What's remarkable is how powerful even the opening keys of songs so invested in the hearts of millions can be, even out of the context of the classic film itself, and it plays to the credit of this finely executed and deeply emotional piece."

","If you missed this, it is now on Netflix. Delightful movie. Well worth seeing. It is about Walt Disney convincing the author of the Mary Poppins books, P.L. Travers, to allow him to make Mary Poppins into a movie. She did not want Disney to make a Disney movie out of Mary Poppins, but that's the only kind of movie Walt Disney made. She needed the money. She was even more difficult to deal with in real life. Terrific cast, Tom Hanks as Walt and Emma Thompson as P.L. Travers. Something left out of the movie - Travers had script approval rights but not film editing rights. Clever man that Walt Disney."

","A Disney movie with Tom Hanks, Emma Thompson, Colin Farrell, and Paul Giamatti; how can you go wrong? This is a film about Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) getting the rights to Mary Poppins from author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson). Ms. Travers has daddy issues which manifest itself in the character of Mr. Banks. While she is giving the Disney production team a hard time, she relives moments from her childhood which makes it difficult for her to let go of Mary, the only family she has left.<br/><br/>While we know how the movie ends, the magic was getting to that point.

"ElMaruecan82","8","1","1","22 December 2017"," In the Company of Disney (and the Shadow of Mary Poppins)...
","Walt Disney has become a brand-name invoking a world of perpetual enchantment and demonstrations of friendliness so over the top they can confine to a tyranny of smiles. That's a very cynical way to look at it but not too far-fetched. Still, as a father of a little girl and given how enamored she was with ""Frozen"" and how she seems to enjoy the old cartoons I show her on Youtube, I can't deny that Disney (the man or the company) always had a way with children and pardon the cliché, the inner child in all of us.<br/><br/>So it's quite fun to see the Walt Disney company producing a movie where all the archetypes of Disney would be disdained by a stuck-up British lady who's no one else but the writer of ""Mary Poppins"", P.L. Travers played by a delightful Emma Thompson. It's also fun to see the one receiving these critics being good old Disney himself, played by Tom Hanks. He doesn't try to imitate Disney but ""Saving Mr. Banks"" isn't intended to be a formal biopic about how the tycoon got the rights for what would become one of his most successful and iconic works.<br/><br/>The film plays on a more emotional level, it is about two visions, two convictions that should have made Mickey Mouse and Mary Poppins walk hand-in-hand to contribute to a masterpiece (the poster is a perfect summary of the film on that level)... only it took twenty years. It was a promise made to his daughters that Walt Disney couldn't allow himself to break, make a film out Travers' classic ""Mary Poppins"", but the woman, a stubborn Aussie, wouldn't have the glitter and the schmaltzy bliss of Disney tarnish the legacy of her book. She had a misconception, taking Disney for some modern-day Santa Claus but so did Disney by misunderstanding the woman and ignoring the sources of her inspiration, some tragic ones.<br/><br/>The film offers many flashbacks of Travers' childhood during which we witness the fallout of her family, from the descent into sickness and alcoholism of her father, to the attempted suicide of her mother and a nurse that took care of her family when she was seven. Just like John Lee Hancock's previous film ""The Blind Side"", the film seems very simple and straightforward until, you start to grasp a specific subtext. In ""The Blind Side"", there's a moment where we clearly question the motivations of the Tuohy Family, if it wasn't just about football, and then this question is answered. In ""Mr Banks"", we know Travers doesn't want any animation, any red color, but we quickly realize there's something else eating her.<br/><br/>She wants Mr. Banks shaven, to be a good man, she has an obsession with Mr. Banks even more than the children or maybe Mary Poppins, the flashbacks centering on her well-meaning but unlucky father played by Colin Farrell allows us to reassemble the pieces of the puzzle and understand what the purpose of Mary Poppins was. There's a pattern in the film consisting on all the friendliest moments (and Travers is quite devoid of immediate warmth) involves a father or one invoking father's memories. Nothing Oedipal about it, it's just speaks about people who accomplished major works by translating the burden of their childhood into something positive.<br/><br/>Of course, Disney's body of work is superior but there's no denial that Travers contributed to his most iconic creation, his first Best Picture nomination and a classic for all ages. We know ""Mary Poppins"" will be made anyway, and the efforts of the Sherman brothers or Disney executive will pay off, but the film is enjoyable on the simple level of these interactions and the so conflicting mentalities of Disney, a cheerful man but astute businessman and a woman who's taking her book very personally. It's only after she realizes how personal it is to Disney that she finally trusts him... and the rest is history."
"philipposathina","9","1","1","15 January 2017"," Saving Mrs P.S Travers
","...or ""uncovering Mary Poppins"" would perhaps be a more appropriate title for this great film. If nothing else, this would certainly be much better than the stupid and totally irrelevant one the film had in my country ( ""The magic umbrella"") associating in a most naive and superficial way this touching psychological drama with W. Disney's ""Mary Poppins"". Perhaps that's why i did not care to watch it till yesterday, thinking that i have had enough of magic umbrellas in my childhood. I never thought that the film had nothing to do with ""Mary Poppins"" as a fairy tale and her magic umbrella itself, but it was instead focusing on uncovering the real drama that inspired the good witch's story. In this movie we actually watch two,at first glance irrelevant to each other, stories. One that took place in the beginning of last century in Australia and one that takes place in the beginning of the -60's when Mrs Travers, the author of ""Mary Poppins"" tries to come in terms with W. Disney about how the book would be transformed into a movie. Though it's difficult to understand at the very beginning why she is so unbearably stubborn and insisting on how the characters of the book would be shown and illustrated in the film and overall about the film itself, soon, as her own life's story unfolds making clear what her fairy-tale's characters really represent, her attitude and her almost repulsive behavior become more understandable and she herself more likable and compassionable. After all for many of us our childhood's demons are still a part of our life, consciously or subconsciously controlling and influencing our personalities and we all have a Mr Banks or an Elias Disney (Walt's ""demon"") to save/make up with, don't we? The film is really good and exciting to watch. Perhaps the excellent revival of the sixties and its characters contribute a lot to this. And of course the revival of these characters through the great performances of -my beloved- Emma Tomson in a ""contra role""-that is to say a role we are not used to seeing her in- as a typical aging English shrew, as well as that of Tom Hanks (great as Walt Disney) and the rest of the cast, make this revival absolutely convincing. In Brief, ""saving Mr. Banks"" is a really good, truthfully tender and touching film which does deserve your attention!"

","Disney and Poppins were part of my childhood, to be sure. Doesn't mean I want to go back there, but this was a pleasant excursion. Thompson and Hanks are perfect as the leads. Interesting that two characters who, these days, garner mixed reviews are so sympathetically rendered, but in a real way. At the centre of this, Mary Poppins is retold from the perspectives of its creator, the scriptwriters and musicians who had to work with her (tough work) and Disney himself. Real life, real and imagined pasts and the world of Poppins are successfully intertwined. Ultimately, this is a film which knows what film-making is about, communicating a real story in a creative, entertaining and ultimately moving way."

","Following three years since its release, I can't help but express how thought-provoking Saving Mr. Banks turned out since the day I first watched it on opening night. The 1960s became one of the last prominent moments in Uncle Walt's lifetime that he witnessed before he passed away, but it's really about how one movie almost never came to be. About how the Mouse met the Magical Nanny.<br/><br/>The story follows P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson), the renowned author of the Mary Poppins books. In 1961, when Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) asks for her to fly to America to meet her personally about his film adaptation of her book, she reluctantly accepts to meeting him. Despite her tragic and bitter past life that greatly dictated her present self, Travers learns from Walt's experience that it doesn't have to be that way and what really matters is letting go and keep moving forward.<br/><br/>Director John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side) definitely showed the tribulations and conflicts Travers had when overseeing the production of Walt Disney's Mary Poppins adaptation. It may have gotten off to a troubling start with her not being open to how each character in her book should be portrayed as well as showing disdain on a few songs, even the animation that Walt wanted to include, but upon seeing the progress of where the direction was going, there were signs that she was beginning to warm up to it. I loved how a few scenes began to jump ahead back and forth on a recurring basis between glimpses of her childhood and then into how that reflected onto her books.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks' take on Walt was pretty uncanny in how he segued into sounding like him and Emma Thompson's portrayal as P.L. Travers showed angst and bittersweetness, yet is misunderstood as a troubled individual that had a rough childhood. I was also left in awe on how in one scene Disneyland was shown as it once looked in the 60s. Looked pretty nifty as though you've traveled back in time. Overall, it's a dramatic and tense element deep beneath the inner workings of light-hearted Disney."

It's about letting go of the past and leading a life not dictated by what haunts you. It's about the magic of storytelling, and to me, what Disney is all about.<br/><br/>""That's what we storytellers do, we instill hope again and again."" <br/><br/>As someone who has idolized Walt Disney and been a huge fan of the history of Walt since seventh grade, I know that there are some fibs here and there, trust me.

What made Hanks' portrayal even more interesting to me was, only a couple of months ago, I watched an excellent four-part documentary on the life and career of Walt Disney. The documentary was a wonderful insight into the man...Walt Disney. Tom Hanks, in my opinion, captured Disney's essence.<br/><br/>However, I did notice on the sign at the Maryborough railway station as the family were about aboard the train that would take them to to Allora the spelling of the little township of Yandina was incorrect. On the sign the town was spelled ""Vandina""; a ""V"" was used instead of ""Y"". Just a small observation.<br/><br/>It didn't detract from my enjoyment of the movie. I'd recommend this film."

But I digress. This title is now on Netflix. It is not for children, as the flashbacks are a bit too dark for children. As a matter of fact, the flashbacks are what holds it back completely. A brief scene wherein Mrs Travers discusses her childhood (briefly) with someone would have been enough. As it was, these scenes dragged the film down both in time and emotion.

But of course the point of the film is that really they are very alike - they both want to make the world a better place.<br/><br/>It's an entertaining journey. Walt Disney is supported by a crew of three men who are the main creative force behind the Mary Poppins film. They provide some fascinating insights into how the songs were created. And yes I found myself singing along.<br/><br/>Finally, there's the subplot. Travers has repeated flashbacks to her childhood and memories of her drunkard (but well-meaning) father. I found this sat oddly with the rest of the movie (and even bored me) although I understand the point they were trying to make about how Travers became the way she is."

Tom hanks proves once again that he can put his hand to any type of character and bring out the best in them.

","Saving Mr. Banks (2013): Dir: John Lee Hancock / Cast: Tom Hanks, Emma Thompson, Colin Ferrell, Paul Giamatti, Ruth Wilson: Wonderfully insightful film about bringing the enchanting Mary Poppins to life. Emma Thompson plays P. L. Travers, author of Mary Poppins. Her royalties are running out in 1961 as she reflects on the harsh realities of 1906 when her free spirited and good natured father struggled with work and sought out alcohol. Tom Hanks plays Walt Disney who made a promise to his daughters that he would bring Mary Poppins to life but to do so he needs Travers to sign over the rights. This becomes problematic as he has her flown out and shacked up in a fancy hotel filled with stuffed Disney characters. Director John Lee Hancock previously made The Blind Side, another film about one factor reaching out to another for the rightful benefit. Emma Thompson is a power house as a woman whose reluctance to relieve her writings conceals deeper pain. Tom Hanks reflects the charming and influential Walt Disney who goes to great lengths to gain her trust while hoping she overlooks certain story elements. This becomes humorous yet revealing as facts from both parties surface. Colin Ferrell is great playing Travers's alcoholic father whose legacy she feels compelled to protect. Ruth Wilson plays her mother who isn't dealt the fairest hand in life. Paul Giamatti has a nice supporting role as her assigned driver. In the end this is a beautiful and insightful portrait saving not just Mr. Banks, but also Travers, Disney, and ultimately Poppins herself. Score: 10 / 10"

Although they took a lot of historical liberties, I can understand quite a few of them. Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks did a very good job portraying P. L. Travers and Walt Disney respectively. One of the better parts of this movie was Colin Farrell's heartbreaking as the loving, yet alcoholic father of P.L, Travers Goff. This movie also had quite a few moments that made me cry, one of them being the death of Travers. I thought that, considering Annie Rose Buckley is a very young actor, Buckley did a very good job conveying the grief and anger that came with the early death of her father.<br/><br/>In short, despite the historical liberties and the, at times, slow pacing, this movie is a must-see."
"Gideon24","8","1","1","29 November 2015"," Emma Thompson really shines here...
","2013's Saving Mr. Banks is, for the most part, a deliciously entertaining fact-based story that blends a show business backstage story with a biography that works for the most part, even though the thread connecting the two stories might have been revealed a little sooner into the story. <br/><br/>This film is a look at the mounting of the 1964 classic Mary Poppins and the battle of wills Walt Disney went through with the author of the books from which the character was taken, P L Travers, in order to secure the rights to the character in order to make the film, something he promised his daughters he would do. The film beautifully chronicles Disney's tireless efforts to make the film that he wants to make and how it is in complete and direct conflict with Travers' vision of the character.<br/><br/>For those who are fans of Mary Poppins, this film will alternately fascinate and aggravate as we watch Mrs. Travers fight every single thing that Disney and his production team want to do to bring the character to the screen while simultaneously delivering flashbacks to Travers' childhood, which slowly reveal why Travers has so many issues with Disney's vision for the film.<br/><br/>This film works very hard at connecting these two interesting stories which could have both made separate movies and frankly, I found the portion of the movie that focuses on Disney and Travers and their battles over the movie more interesting than the flashbacks to Travers' childhood, but the flashbacks do provide insight into why Travers was so unhappy with what Disney wanted to do with the film.<br/><br/>Mary Poppins is my favorite movie of all time so I knew I was going to be on board with whatever I learned here, but I did find it odd that everything Travers is seen initially objecting to did end up on the screen. I do love the scene where she is introduced to the song ""Let's Go Fly a Kite"", which was the beginning of Travers acceptance of the film because it spoke to the root of her problem with the screenplay.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks brings a lovely warmth to the role of Walt Disney that reveals his complete understanding of the man, but it is the crisp and articulate performance by Emma Thompson as the tightly wound P L Travers that really makes this film work...we don't understand why Travers is so inflexible regarding the story, despite the fact that it is revealed in the opening scene that she is broke and really needs the money selling the rights would provide for her. Thompson is brilliant as we watch Travers bristle over ""Supercalifragilisticexpialadocious"" or her complete inflexibility regarding the penguins being animated in the ""Jolly Holiday"" scene, but Thompson really shines in the scene where Travers is watching the completed film at the premiere and how she completely nails the conflicted emotions Travers feels as she really wants to hate what she's watching but really can't deny that the audience around her is loving what they are seeing. And from what I have read, Travers did not like the film as much as she is depicted liking it here, but for this movie, I can forgive that.<br/><br/>Mention should also be made of a lovely performance by Colin Farrell as Travers' father in the flashback scenes, as well as solid work from Bradley Whitford as Poppins screenwriter Don DiGradi, BJ Novak and Jason Schwartzman as the Sherman brothers, who wrote the music for the film, and Paul Giamatti as Travers' driver, ""the only American she likes.""<br/><br/>John Lee Hancock's detailed direction and the carefully structured screenplay are the finishing touches to this very special movie and if you're a Mary Poppins fan like me, this movie is appointment viewing."

","It really depends on how much you like Mary Poppins as to how much you'll like Saving Mr. Banks. If you think it's the greatest film ever, then this is perfect for you. If you think anything less, it's difficult to see the point. Since I think Poppins is average at best, it was something that bothered me throughout Banks. What is it about this story that means it deserves a high budget film? As the film is built on the dramatic ironies that Pamela Travers' requests were eventually rejected, is this just the story of how she was yet again disappointed? Ostensibly, it was made because it gives the chance to portray Walt Disney on the big screen. I had already read the script and it felt designed to offer Oscar clips. The character is even introduced into the film with his cabinet of awards behind him. The script was okay, but the flashbacks bogged it down.<br/><br/>The film is quite like last year's Hitchcock. A very basic celebratory perspective for the mainstream audience who don't know much about filmmaking. It's quite disappointing to see filmmakers create such banal representations of themselves rather than revealing some interesting secrets of the business. However, Emma Thompson is the shining beacon and saviour. She puts her heart and soul into Pamela and delivers one of her finest performances in a long time. It is the cast that makes this film, I get giddy thinking about seeing Jason Schwartzman, Bradley Whitford, Paul Giamatti and Tom Hanks sharing a frame together. There's only a few weak links, most notably B.J. Novak who doesn't appear to suit his role and Colin Farrell's ever-scowling wife in the flashbacks.<br/><br/>Fortunately the flashbacks aren't as bad as expected, but they don't benefit the film, especially as it introduces the inspiration for the Mary Poppins character and doesn't develop upon it at all. Hanks is good as Disney, projecting that essential warmth with ease, but he doesn't capture your heart until the humanising speech about his childhood near the end. He's a delight to watch, but not exactly Oscar worthy. Unfortunately the film does feel too often like a made-for- TV production with unimaginative cinematography and sets. Clearly John Lee Hancock is a director-for-hire. I didn't see The Blind Side but I assume it's dealt with similar bad habits of PG cinema with its far too basic representations of English and Americans with alcoholism as the worst sin. It feels like the intellect in the language used is the only thing pushing it towards anything resembling high-calibre filmmaking but sometimes it doesn't fit. <br/><br/>It has interesting points about the power of fiction, storytellers and childhood, but it's too sugarcoated to take with sincerity. But then, nostalgia is a powerful thing and it will work for many people. It certainly justifies the need for the film to dive down the road of the character's childhoods, either in 30% of the film for Travers or a simple speech from Walt Disney. The image of Disneyland in the 1960s resonates even if you haven't been down that road. While the first hour is vanilla and dry, it gets to a point in the second half where it hits poignant moments such as Pamela hugging a Mickey Mouse doll and it ends up quite moving and gently satisfying. I guess if Saving Mr. Banks does anything, it hands the Mary Poppins mainstream legacy back from Disney to Travers, but is it really worth an expensive star-studded film and a £10 ticket for that? It'll be on Sunday morning TV forever now at the very least, double-billed with Poppins no doubt.<br/><br/>6/10"
"Turfseer","6","5","12","24 December 2013"," It will successfully tug at your heart strings only if you ignore the one dimensional portraits of its principal protagonists
","Walt Disney had been trying to obtain the rights to make 'Mary Poppins' into a film for years, but P.L. Travers, its highly critical author, wouldn't budge. Finally in 1961, faced with diminishing financial assets, Travers agreed to Disney's proposal with the proviso that she have the last say in regards to creative control of the script. <br/><br/>In 'Saving Mr. Banks', Travers is depicted as the film's 'heavy' and Disney as the understanding 'good guy'. In reality, Travers was a much more complicated person than the stereotyped martinet who puts the Disney creative team through a living hell. The film's scenarists posit a simplistic scenario in which Travers' difficult childhood is the reason she grows up to be such a sourpuss. A good part of the film features flashbacks to Travers' early childhood in Queensland, Australia, where her highly imaginative father (well-played by Colin Farrell) encourages the young Travers' creativity but cannot control his own, very sad addiction to alcohol.<br/><br/>The childhood flashbacks prove to be a ponderous affair and could have been easily done in one or two short but compact, all-encompassing scenes. Perhaps it would have been better to show Travers' life as she progressed into adulthood. Hardly someone who was narrow-minded (as some might get the impression here), Travers had a career as an actress and poet in her younger days, had a number of bisexual lovers, adopted a child when she was 40, spent two summers on different Native American reservations and was an astute student of the mystic, George Gurdjieff. <br/><br/>Disney, on the other hand, is depicted as an eccentric uncle type that everyone loved. Tom Hanks ably conveys the 'good' side of Disney but visually fails to convey his true craggy look—a visage worn down by years of smoking cigarettes (Disney would never allow himself to be shown smoking in public and this fact is actually alluded to in 'Saving Mr. Banks'). Perhaps we needed a few flashbacks also for Mr. Disney, whose dark side included flirtations during the 40s with the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, an anti- semitic, anti-communist organization (he distanced himself from the organization in the 50s) as well as testifying before the House of Un- American Activities Committee (HUAC), also in the 40s, against a number of liberal Hollywood writers, some of whom ended up being blacklisted (something that Mr. Hanks probably would have been appalled by me, had he been living as an adult, back then).<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it is true that while working on the film version of Mary Poppins, Travers was devoted to playing the part of a curmudgeon. Travers stipulated that the creative sessions between her and the writing team be recorded on tape; thus a good deal of the hilarious interchanges, are utilized by the films' scenarists to illustrate just how far Ms. Travers would go in preserving the integrity of her intellectual property. Sometimes her demands were off the wall like not allowing the color 'red' to be used anywhere in the film. But not everything she objected to was unreasonable. Take for example, her violent distaste for the use of animation in the film. That, actually, constitutes the 'dark moment' at the end of Act II, when Travers bolts Disney headquarters (with unsigned contract in tow) and returns to England, vowing never to see Mary Poppins completed as a movie, precisely because of Walt Disney's desire to insert a small sequence involving dancing Penguins (Having seen clips of those dancing penguins, I can completely understand why Ms. Travers was upset!).<br/><br/>The rest of the plot involves how Disney and company (along with the help of Travers' chauffeur, played by the always interesting Paul Giamatti) managed to soften Travers up and convince her to give up her rights, so that 'Mary Poppins' could finally get made.. Here, 'good' Disney shines; I don't know whether this actually happened, but Disney expresses empathy for Travers, when he recalls how he was very protective of his own invention, Mickey Mouse, when others were out to change his concept. I do know Disney did not fly all the way to England to convince Travers to change her mind, but Hanks gives his most impassioned speech of the movie when he links the history of his own creative career to that of Travers, during their face off in the UK.<br/><br/>The Disney creative team also becomes more 'sensitive' to Travers' desire to ensure that her father's legacy is not tarnished. Hence, they 'save' Mr. Banks by not making him a 'pathetic' character (a drunkard in real life) but one who loves children and always wants to help them (he fixes the kite and the Sherman Brothers, end up penning the enormously catchy, 'Let's Go Fly a Kite."")<br/><br/>The scenarists revert to comedy when Travers invites herself to the Mary Poppins Hollywood premiere after Disney declines to issue an invitation (Disney's fear is that she'll muck things up at the premiere, acting as a loose cannon). While Travers is watching the animated penguin sequence, you can see tears streaming down her cheeks. Disney leans over, and says something to her, to the effect that the animation didn't turn out to be so bad after all; but Travers explains she's crying because she still finds the animation repulsive.<br/><br/>'Saving Mr. Banks' is an affectionate look at a small piece of entertainment history. It pulls at the heart strings but one still must look at it with a jaded eye. It's a film that was vetted beforehand by the Disney Corporation, who were bent on protecting their founder's reputation at any cost. The result is a slight loss of prestige to P.L. Travers. Nonetheless, she was the one who got the last laugh, by barring any future film sequels and insisting on only British writers working on a Mary Poppins musical."
"cordenw","5","4","9","13 January 2014"," It's certainly no classic
","It's not a piece of schlock either but it's a fair to middling story about culture clash and more importantly about the magical abilities of Walt Disney. Let's face it, writers are a dime a dozen in Hollywood, or anywhere else for that matter.... just visit your local library if you need confirmation. Disney knew that, but he also knew that once in a while one of them comes along with a special talent or idea that only exists in that particular person. You could try to plagiarize it but the end product would be missing the spark. The story is not really about the making of Mary Poppins, it is a story about the exceptional interpersonal skills, patience and persistence of Walt Disney. This film shows that the man didn't build one of the most celebrated companies in the world because he was lucky or because he was a ruthless businessman, he got there because he also had a gift of looking inside people and finding out what made them happy.<br/><br/>And so we see how he used these qualities to handle even the most difficult individual and get what he wanted too.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is really very good as Walt himself, Emma is pretty good in her role even though she doesn't have to step too much out of what we see in her real life persona (To be fair I'm sure she's a wonderful person outside of the glitz). Paul G is excellent as the driver, but then again he is excellent in any part he plays.<br/><br/>The nebulous scenes from Australia were a little too shallow for my liking, although I did enjoy the part where they move to the new town. I enjoyed it for totally selfish reasons,as my own parents emigrated to Australia with me as a babe-in-arms in 1948, so it was nice to see a reconstructed scene similar to what they would have seen back then.(No wonder we turned right around and went back to England!) The characters in these flashbacks didn't add a lot to the plot and really could have been played by anybody.<br/><br/>All in all it's a movie that you would have rented from the video store (if they still existed) when the one you really wanted had been snapped up."

","Saving Mr. Banks is the story about the making of the Disney classic, Mary Poppins. And just as that film sentimentalized P. L. Travers' children's novel, so does this film sugarcoat the true behind-the-scenes scenario. By the tablespoonful!<br/><br/>No, this film treatment doesn't make it go down any easier. There is no genuine dramatic tension as Saving Mr. Banks simplifies its tale by constantly cleansing the facts for more wholesome family enjoyment. The script by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith melds two stories unsuccessfully. It presents Mrs. Travers' troubled childhood memories set in Australia, 1901 with her displeasure at having her novel become a major Walt Disney musical extravaganza in Los Angeles, 1964. Neither story quite gels. Mrs. T. may have had daddy issues, but director John Lee Hancock never has a real grasp of the facts or the fiction. The direction is stilted and heavy-headed as facts are treated with melodramatic flourish and never fully presented or realized.*<br/><br/>Generally speaking, the acting is good. Emma Thompson plays the uptight author with a determined haughtiness and ongoing petulance that gives her character some nuance. Tom Hanks' Uncle Walt is less of the clever manipulative businessman and too much of the sweet Grandpa type. Their relationship, which was and should have been more volatile, is downplayed and lacking the needed ""gravitas""' as P. L. Travers would have said. Providing that gravitas is Colin Farrell as the author's alcoholic father. The actor gives especially fine support along with the always dependable Paul Giamatti, Bradley Whitford, and B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman as the songwriting team known as the Sherman Brothers.<br/><br/>Saving Mr. Banks does hold one's interest, especially when it stays within the problems involved with the making of the Disney classic film.  The film is always entertaining and interesting fodder, but a classic for the Disney vault it ain't!  GRADE: B-<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com<br/><br/>* NOTE: Just one example of playing loose with the facts: Mrs. Travers disliked the finished Disney version of her novel, although her reaction to the film at its premiere is precisely the opposite effect than Saving Mr. Banks indicates."

","At times this film will overwhelm you with its simple power and leave you sobbing uncontrollably as you grieve for a lost childhood and magical memories of an early film viewing experience. This is cinema for the soul of our past and it touches us deeply with its truth. Hanks and Thompson are nothing less than superb in their respective roles and undeniably do some of their finest work in this film. In every scene they play together, we are reminded of just what great actors they truly are. As we watch them bring the profound depth of their characters to life, we experience a journey into the past and a hope filled time that promised such a beautiful future. Marry Poppins was imperfect masterpiece and this film is as well. But the way both films touch our souls and as adults rekindle that faint glow of hope, well, it is quite sublime indeed. The question is asked somewhere on the IMDb, ""Is it necessary to view Marry Poppins prior to seeing this film?"" The answer is that no life is complete if the magic of Marry Poppins hasn't been part of it. If one's heart is touched by that film, then Saving Mr. Banks is a lovely treasure. If Marry Poppins is nothing more than a cinematic requirement that offers little more than catchy tunes, then simply don't bother. Unless you can open your heart and break through the calcified cynicism that prevents you from seeing the profound beauty in these two films, both can be easily dismissed as sentimental fluff. I feel blessed to have seen Mary Poppins as a young lad and realized what a gift it was at the time and what a golden memory it would be for the rest of my life."

Despite his best efforts, Disney cannot get her to warm up to him, and after a period of time, she still hasn't signed over the rights.<br/><br/>In a way, Disney understands because ""the mouse"" (that would be Mickey) is very personal for him, and when he had the chance, he wouldn't sell the character. But in another way, he is mystified. Travers herself doesn't understand what drives her stubbornness, yet she keeps having flashbacks to her own childhood in Australia with her sweet albeit drunken father (Colin Farrell), her unhappy mother (Ruth Wilson), and the woman who came to make everything all right (Rachel Griffiths).<br/><br/>The film should really be called ""Solving P.L.

","This is one of those movies you slightly despise yourself for enjoying. There's not much to it. After a 20-year battle to secure the movie rights to MARY POPPINS, Walt Disney then has another battle to make the movie his way and not the way the author P.L. Travers thinks it should be made. <br/><br/>Walt is played by Tom Hanks, looking as always like Tom Hanks. Pamela (there's a wearisome joke about her insistence on being addressed as 'Mrs Travers') is played by Emma Thompson as an elegant curmudgeon pitched somewhere between NANNY McPHEE and THE REMAINS OF THE DAY. There are frequent flashbacks to her childhood in Australia, a rural idyll wrecked by her father's battle with the booze. Colin Farrell looks a bit uncomfortable in the underwritten role of Dad, handsome and playful, a drunk but never a mean one. Rachel Griffiths is terribly wasted as the stern well-meaning Ozzie Auntie who we are meant infer is the inspiration for la Poppins. Paul Giamatti makes a meal out of the role of Mrs Travers's studio chauffeur, and Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak get some fun out of playing the Sherman brothers, who write the songs which Mrs Travers does not wish to hear or see in the film of her book.<br/><br/>A spoonful of saccharine helps the movie go down. The story's fatal flaw is its predictability, not helped by the fact that most of us have a faint idea of how MARY POPPINS is going to turn out, cartoon sequence and blissfully daft songs and everything. But the tone of this movie is almost as charming as the tone of that movie, and Thompson and Hanks play their roles exactly right, however predictably. So - I'm going to have a go at emulating grinchy Craig from STRICTLY COME DANCING and give SAVING MR. BANKS a grudging 7 out of 10 (Bruno will probably give it a 9)!"

","With the Oscar-studded cast, Saving Mr. Banks hits the screen with high expectations. Emma Thompson plays author P. L. Travers who negotiates throughout the film with Walt Disney, played by Tom Hanks, for the rights to a Mary Poppins adaptation. <br/><br/>Disney has made a promise to his daughters to bring Travers' book to the screen, and he has been hectoring her for 20 years. Travers' fortunes are waning as the story begins, and faced with the prospect for losing her home in England, she has reluctantly agreed to go to Hollywood to monitor efforts to bring her book to the screen. She does not respect or trust Hollywood or Walt Disney, and she has managed to retain the final say on every detail of the story. Therein lies the conflict in this story. The Disney team of writers and music composers must dance to her every whim. She makes impossible demands of them, and she dismisses ideas for seemingly irrational, but deeply personal, reasons.<br/><br/>Throughout the creative process in Hollywood, she experiences flashbacks to her youth in Australia. Her childhood was not ideal, but she has created a fantasy of her past in her writing. She fears that her fantastical view of her life will not translate well to the screen. In the process of rejecting the ideas of the creative team, she drives everyone crazy. Emma Thompson is one of the world's finest actresses, but this story puts her in the position of being a one trick pony. She has but one look for the camera for most of the film - bemused skepticism. She wears out her collaborators, but she begins to wear out the audience as well. The theme of ""sticking it to Hollywood"" wears a little thin. Furthermore, since the audience knows that Mary Poppins became a reality, there isn't a lot of suspense about how this story will end. <br/><br/>Hanks does a good job as Disney, but, Disney must have been a more complex man than he is portrayed in this film. <br/><br/>This story is about how the author reconciles her past with her written fantasies. There are many pleasant and entertaining scenes which make the film enjoyable enough, but this isn't a great movie."

","If people do not realize the darkness at the core of every Disney movie, they do not understand Disney...<br/><br/>Pamela Travers--pen name for Emily Goff whose alcoholic father was Travers Goff--created the children's storyline of Mary Poppins. Walt Disney attempted for something like 16 years to get Pamela Travers to allow him to turn her stories into a movie. Finally, she relents because royalties have diminished. But working with a recalcitrant Pamela Travers, taxes both the Disney patience and the patience of the creative talent. She walks out on the project with the notion of animated penguins.<br/><br/>It is only when Disney visits her London home, and shares with her the pain they both have in common as part of the creative process does she relent and allow the movie to be completed.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the book ""Mary Poppins, She Wrote: The Life of P.L. Travers"" by Valerie Lawson and ""Moose"" by Robert Sherman.<br/><br/>Apparently, P.L. Travers did not like the movie ""Mary Poppins"" one single bit. The movie, however, suggests displeasure as she watches the premiere, but also hints at ultimate approval of the final production.<br/><br/>The movie flashbacks to Pamala Travers childhood in 1901 Australia coping with a destructive alcoholic father, and a mother at her wit's end with his alcoholism. What might now be considered a home-health worker comes to help the family in the father's dying days--and this woman becomes morphed into Mary Poppins. So the flashbacks explain all.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks channels Disney excellently--he captures Walt Disney vocal intonation--close your eyes and you would think it was Walt Disney himself speaking; Emma Thompson channels the asperity of Pamalea Travers with equal accuracy--she approves of nothing and finds fault with everything.<br/><br/>The movie is not really 'about' Disney, Travers, or the making of Mary Poppins; the movie is 'about' the source of creativity. Where does that spark come from? When we look at creative people, it is surprising how much lose of early sibling death seems to play a role. James Barrie--""Peter Pan""--had an older brother die; Mark Twain lost a brother to death. Disney recounts to Pamale Travers his own tortured childhood to show that he too understands Pamala Travers' tortured childhood--alcoholics are dead spiritually--and this the child knows intuitively--as the drunk's eyes glaze over, the speech becomes volubly manic, the body disconnects from the cerebellum only to fall down drunk--The child intuits whats going on and understands in that way that only children can express. (Robert Sherman needs a cane because he was shot... No explanation in the movie why or how or where...) Pamala Travers took her pen name from her father's first name Travers.<br/><br/>In the end of ""Mary Poppins"", the Banks family sings that joyful tune ""Let's go fly a kite"" with a tattered kite repaired, and the sister suffragette sash as a tail for kite ballast... And of course, Mary Poppins flies off...<br/><br/>For those who saw the movie when it came out in 1964, repeating the songs brings back the tinge of memory, of remembrance of time past..."

","""Winds in the east, mist coming in. Like something is brewing, about to begin. Can't put my finger on what lies in store. But I fear what's to happen, all happened before."" We hear the these iconic words over the first notes of the first song from Mary Poppins, and as the camera panned through the clouds (just like in ""Mary Poppins""), I began to grin. And, between a few tears, that grin stayed on my face until the very end. I have never in my life fallen in love with a movie so quickly. For those of you unfamiliar with the plot, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is about the ""Mary Poppins"" author P.L. Travers, played here by Emma Thompson in a brilliant performance. It is about her childhood, her inspiration, and her difficulties as an adult with her haunting memories of an alcoholic father. She published her famous children's' novel in the 1934 and 30 years later was released as a movie. What audiences of that time did not know, was the struggles it took for that to happen. Walt Disney was adamant that he wanted the rights, but Mrs. Travers simply refused to give them to him. For 20 years, he pushed and for 20 years, she denied. There are a select few movies that cannot be described in words. My favorite movie, the 2012 musical adaptation of ""Les Miserables"" is one. ""The Mosquito Coast"" is another. The power of these films is something that needs to be experienced, not told, but I am giving my best effort here. Every single performance is a gem. Emma Thompson is incredible. I honestly can say I have never seen a a more convincing portrayal of a real human being than hers. Tom Hanks does not look or sound like Walt Disney, but he captures his charisma and spirit perfectly. Very similar to Anthony Hopkins as Alfred Hitchcock last year. Jason Schwartzman and BJ Novak are delightful as the Sherman Brothers and it gives me real comfort in knowing that Robert Sherman himself (Jason Schwartzman's character) was on set ensuring that the story be told right and the performances be accurate. Ralph Giamatti is a subtle wonder as the very American chauffeur. But I have perhaps saved the best for last. Colin Farrell portrays his character so accurately that it is almost painful to watch. Disney Studios has done a horrible job marketing this movie because, contrary to what the commercials imply, it is NOT a family movie. If you want a family movie, watch ""Mary Poppins"". The themes are so mature and powerful here, a child would not enjoy or understand this movie at all. However, for those of us who have grown up with ""Mary Poppins"", this movie is beyond anything I could possibly say. The transitions between Travers' childhood in Australia, and the present in Los Angeles were so smooth you never felt you were taken out of either story, as is sometimes the fault with that idea. The script is excellent. So many beautiful monologues and quotes, I couldn't even count. The music is excellent. Thomas Newman's score very much captures the style and essence of the 60's while slipping in bits of the ""Mary Poppins"" repertoire, all in all making it practically perfect in every way. Also, what I found particularly effective, was their use of a few ""Mary Poppins"" scenes. I am so thankful Disney Studios made this film because they have the rights to the original material and used it well and sparingly. One of the best films of the year and of all time. Every expectation and hope I had was completely blown out of the water and topped, a feat which I thought impossible, because I set the bar very very high. I could go on, but it seems to be time for my evening tea. Milk in first."

Novak and Jason Schwartzman as the Sherman brothers. Their facial expressions and interaction with Thompson were hilarious, really the highlight of the movie for me.<br/><br/>The film's main issue is not the way it improves P.L. Travers' opinion of the finished film (in real life, she loathed the 1964 adaptation until her last breath), but the way the pacing is shot down every time we fade into the flashbacks of Travers' traumatic childhood. While they do help give us a clearer image of the woman and why she turned out to be so joyless and cold, they stop the film dead every time they appear. I feel her back story could have been incorporated into the film in a much more natural manner, perhaps through some dialogue or just less flashbacks.<br/><br/>Overall, not a bad film.

","This highly fictionalized, sentimentalized version of P.L. Travers experience contending with Disney over the adaptation of her Mary Poppins book is quite entertaining. Much of this is due to some excellent performances. The always-excellent Emma Thompson is terrific as the prickly Travers, and Tom Hanks, who I don't always care for, gives a nicely understated performance as Disney. I loved his reaction to Travers trash talking of his movies, in which he looked, just for a moment, like he'd been sucker punched.<br/><br/>There are also excellent performances by Colin Farrell, in flashback, as Travers charming father and Paul Giamatti as a genial driver. I was particularly impressed by how much Giamatti caught the style of a 1960s character.<br/><br/>The script has sharp dialogue and shows the actors off to good advantage, but even before reading the wikipedia article on the movie I knew it had to be pretty far from the truth. Many scenes are just way too pat; it's clearly a work of fiction inspired by a true life story.<br/><br/>You can see some indication of that during the credits, when the movie plays an actual recording of Travers talking to the Disney writers. She's not nearly as hostile as Thompson portrays her, and sounds more like someone collaborating on a project than someone trying to shoot it down.<br/><br/>Travers real-life reaction to the Disney movie of her book would, I suspect, be echoed in her real-life reaction to Saving Mr. Banks. But it is entertaining. It also makes me curious about the original Poppins books; I never even knew the movie was based on a book series!"

I really like the idea behind how Disney filmed the tale of Merry Poppins and it definitely is interesting enough for its stand alone movie. Which is why I could not understand, why the writers decided to make it a story about the author of the book - P.L. Travers.

What really stuck with me was that Helen seemed scared of losing her father saying ""don't leave me"" and I think we all have that fear of losing someone dear to us. <br/><br/>As far as the story goes, seeing as its based on a true story I can't really say much on that other than it was truly inspiring and moving. I loved the way you saw snippets of her childhood and how it affected her in the modern scenes. <br/><br/>Cast were absolutely top class. Emma Thompson was simply exquisite as Mrs Travis/Helen. She just blew me away in that role. Her cinema scene was so touching. And when she reverted to childish way such as building a band stand out of leaves it was so endearing. She captured her prudeness and how stubborn she was and then slowly developed her heart into a much more open and warm one. Tom Hanks was just how I would imagine Walt Disney. He was pleasant, wise and charming. I liked how Tom Hanks drew in Walt's last years with the coughing. Disney was a chain smoker all his adult life and died in '66. Colin Farrel as her father was brilliant, one of the best roles I have seen him in. He was brilliant. Her and her father riding on the horse was such a beautiful scene. Paul Giamatti as her driver was great, I think he was the key to Helen changing her ways. He was great. All the actors and actresses were wonderful.<br/><br/>I think, for me, the acting was the thing that made the film. Wonderful acting from everyone. It just made the film the emotional roller coaster it was. It was an incredible film and I implore anyone to see it."

","So the story is compelling, the character development is well done for a 2 hr movie, and you can rarely go wrong with any movie Tom Hanks commits himself to. And while the viewer is naturally drawn into the drama between the team and P.L. it is the music, specifically the behind the scene views of the creative processes, the birth of and realizing the almost death of multiple songs that will pull a lot of viewers in by their heart strings. So it is not far into the movie before you start humming and maybe even singing a long with songs you forgot you forgot about from your childhood.<br/><br/>But the reason I give this movie a 5 out of 10 is that by telling the story itself it under minds the entire struggle portrayed in the movie itself. Confusing as it may come across at first this story is not about Mary Poppins but about P.L. and her struggle to come to terms with the two sides of her father, the drinking and the dreamer. P.L. refused to have her father portrayed as a weak minded drunk and in some ways even failed to fully admit that part of the truth to herself. So through out this story P.L. fights to have his image go untarnished as the character of Mr. Banks. But through writing and putting this story on film Disney has managed to ultimately go back on every promise Walt made to P.L. during this movie. <br/><br/>While going back on the promise to not make her novel a musical or to use Dick Van Dyke are hard to argue with. Even P.L. is portrayed to ultimately be accepting of these changes. I just find it very hard to believe Walt or P.L. would be happy to see the Goff family struggles and the negative portrayal P.L. fought so hard to keep out of the story of Mary Poppins made into a motion picture.<br/><br/>Is the hardship of the Goff family a great story? No, it is sad and even very common in most lights. Is exploiting the troubles of the Goff family or fundamentally going back on the promise to ""Save Mr. Banks"" something we look to enjoy? No, but when you tug on those heart strings with the songs of our childhoods' and add a new spin to a story we all know and love its easy to see how this story captivates audiences and continues to sell.<br/><br/>Sorry if this spin on a new Disney ""Classic"" ruins your perspective of Saving Mr. Banks the way Saving Mr. Banks ultimately ruins the perspective of Mr. Banks for millions."
"bbewnylorac","7","2","4","11 January 2014"," Not a bad film
","Not an easy film to make and overall, I felt it was done well. The scenes of Pamela as a child were my favourite. As an Australian they felt authentic to me. The acting was beautiful and the cinematography was gorgeous. Pamela's father isn't made out to be a terrible person just because he's an alcoholic. He's a real charmer and a loving father, someone with an artistic soul who is obviously very unsuited to being a bank manager. Making the adult Pamela out to be such a vicious old hag is confronting: was she really that bad? Emma Thompson is perfect for the role and she is very funny, but it's an unforgiving, sometimes one dimensional portrait, much like Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada. Admittedly, the Americans are also mocked mercilessly through Pamela's eyes - not being able to make tea properly; the flashiness of Disneyland; LA people preferring to drive and not walk; the terrible food Disney's assistant keeps serving. Tom Hanks does Walt Disney quite well. Several scenes are really interesting, such as when Disney talks about his childhood, and reveals he was, early in his career, in a similar position to Pamela in not wanting to hand over creative control of his characters. The film can be enjoyed on quite a superficial level, but it did also have a few things to say, such as how things that happen in childhood can stay with us the rest of our lives; and how Mary Poppins derived from Pamela trying to deal with her sad childhood - to reinvent it and resolve it. The film also depicts the tensions surrounding how films are made -- the Mary Poppins composers the Sherman brothers saw the project as a way to express themselves, by building their own creation, based on Pamela's story but not following it slavishly. Whereas Pamela expects her work won't be changed, and both parties cannot understand the other side's point of view."
"eschetic-2","7","2","4","2 January 2014"," Serious thanks to Hanks' Banks film
","Whatever SAVING MR. BANKS' ultimate financial fate - which most sources seem to indicate will probably be comfortable - it was doing something close to ""land office business"" when I saw it New Year's Day afternoon on 42nd Street with a very youngish mixed crowd who almost all stayed well into the credit crawl. The very clever gimmick of having the original tape of the actual Mrs. Travers at the reading of the script with the other authors - which was dramatized in the film itself - played over the crawl made them almost impossible to walk out on.<br/><br/>The film itself was not, IMHO, a major work of art: they pretty much give away the main element the audience should be figuring out in the film's title and and I have read that a number of the strict historical details are seriously distorted (the cynical will always insist that there was never any real chance of P.J. Travers' withholding the film rights that Disney wanted to her most famous work since she needed the money) but the broad strokes - including that one - are made most believably credible and three perfectly lovely performances from Emma Thompson, Collin Farrell and Tom Hanks (not to mention Paul Giamatti's utterly charming driver, two women in Disney's office and the boys playing the Sherman Brothers - especially B. J. Novak) make it a very enjoyable outing.<br/><br/>For me however, and I suspect many of my age, the greatest reason for seeing the film is the rehabilitation (humanization) of Walt Disney's personal image and reputation after all that came out after we grew up about how right wing the man was in his personal/political life. The film speaks to his artistic legacy and it is as charming as the legacy is important. I'd much rather remember the founder of the Mouse House this way than the way I had come to think of him - and I rather doubt that Mrs. Travers would have serious objections either.<br/><br/>No-one will deny that the lady reserved the right to formally/officially dislike the Disney MARY POPPINS the way GBS rejected THE CHOCOLATE SOLDIER operetta based on his ARMS AND THE MAN, but you will want to see the publicity photos of Travers with Disney and the Sherman Brothers at the end of the film which somewhat soften the image."

","Great watch, could watch again, and can recommend, but having recently watched ""Mary Poppins"" may alter the experience.<br/><br/>I have just watched ""Mary Poppins"", a wonderful movie, before this so the magic that Disney pumped into Travers' story is still fresh in my mind. I'm not saying that Disney didn't create something fantastic, but I'm struggling with my affinity for this story.<br/><br/>I think this is a great movie that documents an important event in both Disney and film history, and certainly that of intellectual property. I'm just not sure anyone else sees the same movie that I see in ""Saving Mr. Banks"", a title that I don't agree with at all, other than the victors of wars write history: I would have titled this the pursuit of ""Mary Poppins"".<br/><br/>If you just change some of the music around, then you would have quite the psychological thriller on hand. The movie is filled with Disney hunting Travers, sorting out how to manipulate her in different ways, what to hide from her. He even has idiot minions that nearly ruin it for him. There's elements at play all over, she's brought out of her native environment, EVERYONE she interacts with is paid by Disney: they have a vested interest in keeping him happy, especially since he's not used to being refuted.<br/><br/>20 years, a man pursued a woman that said no. 20 years, and she finally hit a wall and was low on funds enough that she could be convinced to deal with a kingdom of frivolity, and she had to sell a part of herself to him, even though she didn't want to, assured one thing, lied to, and having to make concessions the entire way. The audacity of going to someone, asking to buy their invention, and then belittling it so much that you reinvent it to the point it isn't recognizable as the thing you bought: it would have been so much easier to simply create something from scratch.<br/><br/>This movie actually embodies everything I hate about the MCU, even in the early 1960s, it was enough to take a name that people recognized (and nothing else) and exploit it to make money off of it with no regards to the original work or author. And it is the fault of the authors, the owners of the intellectual property to sign away the rights without securing right of refusal or final approval. And it is the fault of the studio to exploit those in dire need as if they would buy a product that couldn't be sold as is.<br/><br/>PL Travers was the hero of this story, and she lost to Disney, to need, to greedy capitalism, and I wish more people would take her advise of ""Never again!"".<br/><br/>I think, in the end, this movie creeps me out, and makes me sad about the world. As good as it is, I can't say I enjoy it in retrospect."

","I must hand it to Disney Studios! They managed to fool me for a while with this film! To begin with, it felt like a sincere and sensitive story concerning the making of a Mary Poppins based film by Walt Disney. The author P.L.Travers was portrayed as a stiff lipped Brit. Her main fictional character was a magical nanny and yet somehow, she seemed to be set against the movie being made as an animation or a musical film. It seemed that Walt Disney and his people had to manage the difficult and unyielding attitude of 'Mrs. Travers'. Thankfully, she wasn't portrayed as a totally boring person and had some absolutely hilarious insults up her sleeves; the kind which are funny provided you are not at the receiving end. So, all in all, this felt like a movie with some heart.<br/><br/>However, this is not a perfect film. My first problem with the movie is of course the lies and misrepresentation of a lot of facts & events. I always find that off-putting in a movie, especially when even without reading up any history about it, I can figure out the lies all by myself during the watching of the film. This is lazy lying! If you want to lie to the viewers, at least work harder so that unless they do a background check, they can still believe it! My other gripe is that the characterization of Mrs. Travers was a bit too heavy handed and that of Disney a bit too generous. The latter was to expected since it's a Disney film. What I found more disturbing was that after a certain point, the meanness and sarcasm of Travers felt a bit too forced even though the creators tried to justify it by telling the story of a very sad childhood. A difficult childhood does not justify rudeness with honest and hardworking people who are simply doing their job.<br/><br/>The film does raise an important point though. Which is better; truth or fantasy and well-intentioned lies? I'm not much for the fantasy genre, where everything gets taken care of through magic. I believe that even if life is harsh, children deserve to know the truth as much as the adults because that's the only thing that would prepare them for any future misfortunes. However, I also believe that children must be taught not to let themselves become too cynical. They must have a bit of fun now and then. This might enable them to deal with the vicissitudes of life better. So truth and detachment are both necessary tools for our survival kit; tools that adults need as much as children.<br/><br/>So, despite its shortcomings, the movie did give me food for thought since once again I watched life from two entirely different points-of-view. For this reason and because it reminded me not to be too cynical, I'm glad I watched it."

"josephrygaard","7","0","0","4 February 2020"," Before Watching: Saving Mr. Banks (2013)
","""Saving Mr. Banks"" (2013) is a charming movie about the people and relations behind the famous Mary Poppins. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>It's easy to dismiss Saving Mr. Banks at first glance as rather slow-paced and uninteresting for anyone that wasn't caught by the initial Mary Poppins-wave. That judgement could to an extent be justified, since this is after all a typical drama feature, and as such, rarely bothers itself with intense action sequences or an over-emphasized conflict of epic proportions. However, that does not mean that Saving Mr. Banks is not intriguing nor captivating - its intensity is just experienced in a different, but still present way. The aim lies on the aim protagonist, Pamela Travers, and her background as well as psychological connection to her work of fiction. Although she might come off as cold and one-dimensional, she grows into a very satisfying and cathartic arch towards the end.<br/><br/>The side characters do a great job with providing the additional and much needed warmth, which elevates the movie in a curious and quite cheerful way. The opposites of personalities make for amusing as well as deep felt interactions, all interwoven with relevant flashbacks for Mrs. Travers. The music is almost too catchy, the scenery lush, and all things considered makes for a cozy and relaxing experience - save the ending which can come off as a bit abrupt and sudden, but still relevant and understandable.<br/><br/>My personal grade: a pleasant 7/10.

","I have two opposing reactions to this film - my rating is the average of these:
This is a well-crafted movie about the back story of the negotiations between Travers and Disney in making the movie Mary Poppins. Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks act their butts off, and the supporting cast are fun to watch. As always, Paul Giamatti adds ten points to every scene he's in. It provides a connection between what was the main emotional theme of the movie and Travers's life - the relationship with her father and need for forgiveness - and shows her near-cathartic realization of this relationship as she works on and eventually sees the film. 8 out of 10
That's the first reaction - the second reaction is that this is a Disneyfied, sanitized, and highly fictionalized telling of Disney bullying the author into accepting his sugar-coated version of the book. She doesn't want cartoons! but ends up with cartoons! She doesn't want songs! but is so charmed by them that she actually smiles! Oh, the irony!!
So we have near-stereotypical depictions people that were very different and much more interesting in real life - the shrewish and odd author (how amusing that she just doesn't ""get"" Hollywood? Ha ha) - the patient, put-upon mogul who, bless his heart, just wants to keep a promise he made to his daughter, the back story about the alcoholic father, cue the tears as he sinks unto death, the mother so in despair she tries to commit suicide, only to be saved!! by PL Travers!, complete with supporting hijinks by the writers and songwriters. One comes away with a kind of feeling of having been anesthetized and given propaganda that, gosh, makes ya feel good about that Disney guy and his paper delivery story. The culmination of Disney telling the author ""what's important about life and the way we tell it"" is superb scripting; eyes fill with tears, but, it's nothing but scripting. 4 out of 10
It's not surprising that Disney would make a film depicting this episode in such a sympathetic way, and it is, as noted above, a well-made and entertaining film. There's nothing wrong with films depicting real-life situations in a fictionalized manner (Immortal Beloved, anybody?). But the spoonful of sugar that this is meant to be leaves a little of a bad taste - it's more of a packet of Sweet'n Lo to help the movie go down."

","Based on a true story, this film takes place in two different time periods. One is in the early 1960s when Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) is trying to convince P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson) to give his company the right to make a film based on her ""Mary Poppins"" books. (We all know the outcome of that.) The other time period is in the early 1900s in Australia and tells the story of Travers' very difficult childhood.<br/><br/>This movie was more charming and moving than I expected. It begins with a comical clash of British vs. American values. It's quite funny at times though Travers occasionally goes too far with her put-downs.<br/><br/>She is so obstinate that, if this were a fictional film, the final outcome might not be believable. Indeed, some of the truth is stretched but not enough to harm the overall effect.<br/><br/>Some of the most moving scenes are those in the early time period. As the family patriarch, Colin Farrell is very gripping as a man who wants to do well for his beloved family but has the hardest times with his demons of despair. The flashbacks of these scenes make it easier to understand the difficult personality of the adult Travers.<br/><br/>Her character is also made more human due to the dependable brilliance of Emma Thompson. When snarky, Thompson does what those great Brits do best: deliver sharp-tongued wit quickly but comprehensively within perfectly structured sentences. She is most moving, however, after recalling childhood moments (shown in flashbacks) while struggling to maintain her demands that the film stay true to her stories. Her face could tell a full story without saying a word.<br/><br/>It's not a surprise that Thompson is so great. Her work in the 1990s (""Howards End"", ""The Remains of the Day"", ""In the Name of the Father"", ""Sense and Sensibility"" plus a hilarious appearance on the ""Ellen"" show) would be enough to place her in any hall of fame. I also recall she was one of the few saving graces in the rather mediocre ""Love, Actually"" in 2003. It's great to see her in a part that showcases her best once again.<br/><br/>Hanks has a very fine monologue near the film's end. It summarizes what could be the film's main theme: sympathy to families whose sole breadwinners suffered in soul-destroying jobs. This even came through in ""Mary Poppins"".<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10* * *<br/><br/>Outstanding Achievement: Performance of Emma Thompson"

","Many of us consider Marry Poppins a classic, one that has endured and still entertains audiences today. Saving Mr Banks takes an interesting look at the author behind Mary Poppins and the film adaption. Not many would be familiar with the background and difficult personality of the author. We also learn the inspiration behind the timeless classic. <br/><br/>The film excels in getting you to dislike and maybe even hate Emma Thompson's character, P. L. Travers. She is disagreeable, stubborn and peculiar. Even though she is in need of income to save her home she is not willing to make a deal until all her demands are met. One important demand is the absence of animation which is central to many Disney films. Over the course of the film she warms up to the writers and Walt Disney who write the songs that we all know and love. When she cancels the deal and flies back to the U.K. she is visited again by none other than Walt Disney. <br/><br/>We learn that her hopes for the film as in the books were not to save the children but their father which fictitiously based on her father. Mary Poppins was the nanny who saved everything that her real nanny or aunt could not do in her life. She lost her father as shown in her flashbacks. The real reason behind this classic creation endears her to the audience as we are told Mr Banks will be not just be saved he will be honored. While Mary Poppins brought joy to many to many children's lives the author also sought to bring joy and solace to her inner child and fathers memory.

","I know this movie came up a while ago, but tell you the truth I did not manage to watch it on the big screen - shame on me! One fine night this week I was in a mood for a musical or a fun movie and I remember how I wanted to watch Saving Mr. Banks. It was not quite a musical, but it was about a musical, and it was not quite a comedy, although it was somewhat fun 50% of the time and 50% serious. P.L. Travers Saving Mr. Banks tells the story of how the magical musical Mary Poppins came to life. It is a biographic movie about the writer that created Mary Poppins and her fight/struggle with Walt Disney in order to do the right thing by the story. P.L.Travers was a stubborn and serious writer and she wanted Mary Poppins to be ""never, ever just Mary"". For children worldwide Mary Poppins was just a fairytale, a lovely story, for her it was a real person, from real life, flesh and bones, transcripted to page so she would remember her and not only... Mary Poppins was a story about her, her sister, her parents... and to be more precise, about her father. For her the story she created was not only about the nanny, but about the hardships of life, of the adult life that one day each child will have to face!<br/><br/>Mary Poppins did not came to save the children, but rather her father... Mary Poppins is actually her very own aunt, put on paper. The movie switches between scenes of here and now and the scenes of P.L.Travers when she was just a little girl. Her father is played brilliantly by Colin Farrell and her mother by the very delicate and lady-like Ruth Wilson ( that I just adore in Jane Eyre ). We can see her growing up in Australia and being forced to move from the beautiful house in the city to a small house in the middle of nowhere. Somehow her father manages to keep her dreaming for a better world, but her mother sees and faces the real troubles of the family - raising 3 kids and taking care of the house and a husband who is drinking and not able to maintain his job at the bank... Great attention on details like the outfits, to fit the characters and the period of time P.L.Travers loved her father that much that she wanted to preserve his memory somehow... and what better way to do that than writing a book about it? She wanted Mary Poppins as a serious movie, yet a children movie. She wanted no animations, no musical made out of it. Somehow it went half-way: neither what Walt wanted nor her. It took them 20 years of beating around the bush to get her on a plane to USA in order to get the movie going - by that time, unlike in this movie, Walt had already purchased the rights to do Mary Poppins. Unlike the movie, she never danced on the music they created for the movie, but she did particularly liked the song ""Feed the birds""."

","Saving Mr. Banks is based on the story of how Walt Disney bought the rights to make Mary Poppins. Starring Tom Hanks as Disney, Emma Thompson as P.L. Travers, the author of Mary Poppins, and Colin Farrell, as Travers' father -- as seen in flashback. The crux of the story centres around Travers' time spent at Disney studios, working with Disney, Don DaGradi and the brilliant Sherman brothers, as a screenplay is eeked out and some sort of agreement reached between the film-makers and the defensive Travers. Here, both Hanks and Thompson shine, playing opposite types butting heads over a common interest. Thompson is outstanding as Travers, walking a fine line between being risible and empathetic, as scathing barbs and a difficult temperament block the ebullient Walt at every turn. Hanks, equally good, is completely genial and very convincing in his role. We know and see Disney's motivations, become aware of a pointed drive to succeed and create a world in which he is master of his domain. But this is a likable character, as is Travers, whose backstory is told in extensive flashbacks. Her childhood, in the Australian outback, especially her relationship with an alcoholic father, comes to define her life as she wrestles with memories of tragedy and the ideal. Thus, her determination not to allow her beloved creation to be tampered with by Disney. Her resolve loosens, of course. We all know the film was ultimately made and became a tremendous success. But this is the story (albeit a romanticised one) of how the film came to be. Films about the movie business are often favourites of mine, and this is no exception. Saving Mr. Banks is a really wonderful film. The story is well written and directed, but comes with an enormous cache for anyone fond of Mary Poppins. The flashbacks occasionally fracture the narrative and spell out Travers' arc a bit too freely, but ultimately, the back- story is vital to her catharsis. Especially when this aspect of the story is so well handled -- despite feeling a bit like a different film entirely."

","With her book revenues drying up and in danger of losing her home, author P.L. Travers is forced to entertain the idea of selling the movie rights to her beloved novel Mary Poppins to Walt Disney, who has been pursuing them for 20 years, in order to keep a promise he made to his daughters. So eager to make the film, Disney makes Travers an unprecedented offer: final script approval. Essentially, nothing goes in the film without her say-so. The rest of the movie is based around Travers butting heads with director Don DaGradi and the film's composers, the Sherman brothers, to make the film. Travers, the purist who based the characters on people from her own childhood, wants to make the film exactly like the book and the creative team wants to (for lack of a better term) ""disneyify"" it.<br/><br/>And that's basically it. The premise of the film is very, very simple but a plot doesn't need to be complicated in order to be good. What makes the movie so incredibly good are the performances. Emma Thompson is the go-to British actress for ""hard but with a touch of heart"". Tom Hanks is brilliant as Disney, effortlessly transitioning from the light hearted, child loving, ""everyone call me by my first name"" type boss you wish you had to the shrewd, successful business man. He'll negotiate but in the end, he's going to get the deal he wants. Not to be overlooked are Colin Farrell, who delivers the finest performance of his recent career as Travers' father in flashback sequences, and Paul Giamatti, who is just lovable as Travers' chauffeur who tries to break through Travers' stony exterior of simply not wanting, in the slightest way, to be there. Bradley Whitford, B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman all knock it out of the park as well, as DaGradi and the Sherman brothers, respectively.<br/><br/>If I have to nit-pick to find a flaw with the film, it would be that the ending is a work of pure fiction. If you've read anything about the real story (and there is plenty of evidence because, as it's truly depicted in the movie, Travers insisted that all creative sessions be taped), Travers hated the final product, which she insisted upon calling ""Walt Disney's Mary Poppins"" to distinguish it from her own work and refused to work with the studio ever again. But, if you can get past that, it's an enjoyable film with strong performances that definitely makes for a worthwhile rental."

","The original ""Mary Poppins"" was steeped in warm-n-fuzzy, so it makes sense they'd go with the same approach for the making-of story.

","If you enjoy stories about self serving, lunatic, writers, thoroughly engrossed in their own idea of self inflated importance, see this movie. Mrs Travers is so irritating that, not only could I not sit though the entire annoying movie, I couldn't recommend this movie to anyone who isn't a lunatic, self serving writer, who thinks the whole world revolves around their stupid, fictional, characters and or someone who enjoys, A- hole, diva-ish behavior.<br/><br/>The only enjoyable part of this movie is the port rail of Walt Disney. He comes across as the pioneer and honestly, heartfelt man that he was. Now, Disney is slighted because they are successful, a virtue eschewed by today's lame stream media, , but never forget, in the beginning, future success is never guaranteed. The only good part of this movie, he came across as the great man he was.<br/><br/>I haven't seen Mary Poppins since the 60's and after watching this, I will avoid it like the plague that the author of the story was. Why is Hollywood always enthralled with insane A-holes? Oh wait, I know why. Likes attract."
"Letras196","10","3","8","3 December 2013"," Would ""Saving Mr Banks"" be saved if Mrs Travers was still around?
","First of all I have to mention how amazing it was (for me) to watch Tom Hanks play such an iconic figure as Uncle Walt. I would also like to mention that this is my own personal intake on the film, the rest of you are welcome to disagree as you please. Now that that is out of the way, the review can begin. The two main actors gave a magnificent performance, with Tom Hanks's head strong Disney (or should I say Walt) and Emma Thompson's emotional, albeit equally strong willed Pame- pardon me, Mrs Travers. It was easy to enter the world of the movie and follow the turbulent journey of the Travers and, later, Disney. The movie's emotional ups and downs took me with them, as I found myself crying and laughing, or sometimes a mix of both. Although I was not expecting the film to have quite such a serious tone to it that is not to say that this is a negative factor. In fact, I thought Colin Farrell's performance as Mr Travers was moving, in more ways than one. Between feeling sorry for his wife and angry with him for not thinking more of his family I would say there is quite an emotional turmoil throughout the film. The ending, although not what you would call a fairy-tale ending, is still satisfactory, after all the writer gets what she wants when ""Mr Banks"" is redeemed. I could not help but think, however, that as a child you do not really focus on Mr Banks' redemption so much as you do as an adult. In adulthood is when you realise that this father of two has decided to centre his life on his children more than his work (or in Mr Travers' case,based on the film, his drinking), and thus he is saved. My favourite scene is when the Sherman brothers are performing the first musical scene, where Bert sings comical poems. Now since Mrs Travers showed aversion to the word ""responstable"" they show themselves reluctant to reveal another, now famous, little musical piece: Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. I also enjoyed recognising lines from Mary Poppins, such as Mr Banks' ""I always know what to say,"" said by Mrs Travers. The question is which came first? I feel it is my duty to take this opportunity to say how disappointed I am that Mrs Travers was able to meet Uncle Walt and visit Disneyland with him, while a tremendous fan of his such as myself was not even born in his lifetime. Needless to say I shall be having a rather long and serious conversation with my parents (in fact, they are just lucky I am not suing them). After watching this marvellous telling of Mrs Travers dealings with Disney, I can say two things with certainty: 1. ""Mr Banks"" was certainly saved and 2. The Disney Company is certainly lucky Mrs Travers has passed on, or Saving Mr Banks would certainly not be out yet."
"richieandsam","7","3","9","19 November 2013"," A very touching film... but how true is it?
","SAVING MR. BANKS<br/><br/>As soon as I saw the trailer for this movie, I knew I wanted to see it. I am a big Disney fan and love all the classic Disney animated movies. I also love some of the live action movies too, especially Bedknobs and Broomsticks and Mary Poppins.<br/><br/>This film is about a famous author named Pamela Travers. Pamela's biggest seller was the Mary Poppins novels. The film is centered around the period in her life when she stopped writing and Walt Disney kept contacting her about giving him the film rights to the book. Pamela was not interested and hated the idea of Walt bringing Mary to life as she hated his movies. She is not a fan of his animation. Finally her accountant talked her into flying to America to meet with Walt and maybe sign the rights over to him. She agrees on the condition that she has final say in ever decision that is made about the movie and characters and one of the stipulations was ""No animation"". Pam makes it very hard work for Walt and his team.<br/><br/>This is a drama about her American trip, but even more it is a drama about her childhood. The film makes it look like she was haunted by her past. Her relationship with her father who she adored and his troubles. The movie is very well made. It is very sad. Saving Mr. Banks is not a feel good movie. I left the cinema just feeling sorry for her even though her character is not very likable. You grow to really like her as the film goes on, but she really is a mean old woman. But I am thinking she was only mean because he is so attached to the character in her book that she does not want to let go or even give anyone else the chance to portray her. There are some very funny moments in the movie though. Some of the things she says and the way she acts towards Walt's' film makers was brilliant. Pam was a woman that took no mess. She knew what she wanted and had no problem saying what she thought. She has some fantastic comedy moments.<br/><br/>The film stars Tom Hanks as Walt Disney and Emma Thompson as Pamela Travers. The whole cast was brilliant. I thought Tom did a great job as Walt. He played with passion and conviction. The star of the movie for me though was Emma. I thought she should get top billing for this as her performance was by far the best. Her character was very believable and she played it to perfection. Colin Farrell played Pam's father. I am not a massive Colin Farrell fan, but I understand he is a good actor. He did a very good job in this too and for an Irish man he really can pull off an English accent well.<br/><br/>The film does drag on a little bit. There is far too many flashbacks for my liking. I know that we are learning about her childhood and the troubles her family had but it just felt that the first half of the film was stretched out a bit because of it. But it did help with the connection of the characters. I suppose the main problem I had with the movie was the ending. I have read up about Pamela Travers and from everything I have read, it turns out the ending of this film is not 100% accurate. I don't want to put spoilers in my reviews so I won't mention anything that happens, but I am just disappointed that they did not stick to the truth fully but then no bio pic ever does. I suppose that being made by Disney was also the reason for it they will not make themselves look bad. But anyone that knows anything about Disney knows that they have had a very controversial past but this does not take away my memories of watching their cartoons as a kid and adult and loving every second of them. They know how to make a decent family movie and I love them all the same.<br/><br/>My favourite part of the movie was the credits. As you watch the film you see the Pam told Walt that she will only help them with the film as long as every meeting was taped. During the credits, you can hear one of the recordings from the meeting. It was awesome watching a movie about this woman and seeing the hell she puts these guys through, and then to hear the real recording at the end of the film. It was a brilliant touch by Disney and really nice to hear it it was also topped off by the photos that they showed of the real Pam Travers with the real Walt Disney too.<br/><br/>I will give this film 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>""Stop! Mary Poppins is not for sale! I won't have her turned into one of your silly cartoons."""
"SnoopyStyle","7","2","5","21 October 2014"," Emma Thompson does a good job
","Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) is turning his favorite book ""Mary Poppins"" into a movie. The problem is that the stubborn author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) is unwilling to comprise on anything. Script writer Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford), musical writers Robert Sherman (B.J. Novak) and Richard Sherman (Jason Schwartzman) must suffer under her unbending will. Her driver Ralph (Paul Giamatti) tries to befriend her. Travers is not actually upper class British as everybody assumed but a little girl from Australia. Her parents Travers (Colin Farrell) and Margaret Goff (Ruth Wilson) had many problems. Then one day, aunt Ellie (Rachel Griffiths) comes to help the family.<br/><br/>It's a movie that has trouble early on when Travers is annoyingly stubborn. Scenes where a bit of comedy could be injected is inevitably deaden by her meanness. It would help if an early scene could show her suffering and therefore justify her harshness towards others. It's not simply that she is stiff and proper. That could actually be funny. There is an anger in her that needs justification. Once it digs properly into her past, she becomes more human and her character becomes more compelling. Emma Thompson does a good job especially since her character does have changes. Tom Hanks should add a bit more sour to the sweetness of his Walt Disney. The rest of the cast all do a solid job. This movie tries to straddle a more serious story with its Disneyfied version and it does it as well as expected."

Thank you Disney for destroying the faith that I have had over the last 54 years that you could make a sad time a bit more bearable. We had to leave the movie and my daughter cried all the way home.

","This was, no question about it, a beautifully made film. Two hours and ten minutes of great acting from all involved. Emma Thompson was brilliant in the role of the obnoxious stuck up old Brit who is really a very sad old Aussie. But then again, it was to be expected; maybe they should make a prize above the Oscars for people that we know are Oscar material and need to go further still. Tom Hanks, an old version of him, is perfect for the role of the gallant Walt Disney, while Colin Farrell plays the role of the drunken dad. Perhaps the Irish actor he should steer away from drunken roles; we all know how Hollywood casting holes are.<br/><br/>There is a however, however. The story felt too much like Driving Miss Daisy - you know, old grumpy woman that has a good heart and a story, resilient driver, people that make the effort to ""get her"", etc - and I don't know Mr. Disney, but could he have been so nice? It is a story about the weird interaction of interesting and famous people, one that explains, it's true, the creation of a real movie: the Mary Poppins musical movie starring Julie Andrews. But it felt quite a bit fake, I have to tell you.<br/><br/>It is noteworthy to say that the film was based on a biography of Travers that also prompted two documentaries that I have not seen. Perhaps more of the truth would lie there, but even from the Wikipedia page for the film I can see that things were not quite like in Saving Mr. Banks.<br/><br/>Bottom line: well played, well created, but ultimately a good actor extravaganza on a ""making of"" story of an acclaimed American movie. Beautiful, but a bit... surreal?"
"mr_bickle_the_pickle","7","2","5","1 January 2014"," Emma Thompson delightful
","I had read so many lackluster reviews about this film that I went in not expecting much. So I'm glad that I was pleasantly surprised. I ended up enjoying this flick quite a bit.<br/><br/>I think what really made this film work was Emma Thompson. I laughed quite a bit during the film and 95% of the time it was because of her. And when she was watching Mary Poppins for the first time and getting emotional, it made me tear up as well. So I thought she was quite effective in the role. She was quite superb. However, I thought that perhaps she was a bit young for the role. Tom Hanks too. They both looked about 10 years younger than they should have. At least when you compare them to the real life people from that time. Speaking of Tom Hanks, he was good but not spectacular. He also kind of played him as cold, and who knows maybe Walt Disney was really that way, but it just kind of rubbed me the wrong way.<br/><br/>And I enjoyed the flashbacks and understand why it was important to the story, however there was too many of them. It would get a bit annoying just constantly jumping back and forth. I don't know if there would have been a way to make that more seamless. But the flashbacks kept me guessing. I knew going into the film that the ""real Mary Poppins"" saved them. Presumably the father (since Mary Poppins is there to save the father). I had my theories that the mother would die in an accident, and then later on that she would kill herself. I knew something horrible would happen, but I just didn't know what. I'm glad that the film doesn't make it too obvious. That you'll keep guessing.<br/><br/>So overall I enjoyed it, but it wasn't perfect. My favourite part was when P.L Travers danced to ""Let's Go Fly a Kite""."
"Laakbaar","9","2","5","30 December 2013"," Who could have expected a movie like this from Disney?
","A Disney film about the making of Mary Poppins.I really wasn't sure whether I wanted to see this. However, I'm so glad I did. Director John Lee Hancock and his writers have unexpectedly given us a superb heart-warming drama about Helen Goff's coming to terms with the Disneyfication of Mary Poppins, a story (as we all now know) that reflected her youth on a farm near Allora, Queensland.<br/><br/>For Goff (a.k.a. ""Pamela Travers""), the Mary Poppins story is inextricable from her memories and feelings about her beloved father. She needs the money, but she feels that only she understands the true meaning of Mary Poppins. She is terrified of how Disney will transform her storyand fail to do justice to her father's legacy. Departures from her original story, but especially the addition of music and animation, seem outrageous to her.<br/><br/>The theme is ""letting go"". This movie is actually a sophisticated, intelligent psychological drama. Because she is the adult child of an alcoholic, Goff carries much of the complicated emotional baggage that goes with that. Her feelings about her father are complex, deeply rooted and only half understood. The process of creating the movie, and dealing with Disney, draws her back to her childhood, connecting her to her inner child. The question is whether she can learn to live in the present.<br/><br/>I have to admit that, at both views four years apart, this movie moved me to tears -– but without being sappy or melodramatic. I hope this doesn't make the movie sound too heavy; the film is actually quite light in its feel, funny at times, and easy to digest. Surely though this is a film for adults.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson is the Oscar-worthy epicentre of this film, although the rest of the cast (especially Colin Farrell as her father and Tom Hanks as Walt Disney) certainly pull their weight. Emma Thompson's mastery of her profession shines through here.<br/><br/>I am not at all a Disney freak who walks around the theme parks with Micky Mouse ears. However, this movie has me -– four decades after I sat transfixed in the theatre watching Mary Poppins for the first time –- appreciating this company on a new, different level. This movie spoke directly to me. Yes, it is a Disney movie about a Disney movie, but it is also much more than that."

","Comes just in advance of the film's fiftieth anniversary is the story behind one of Walt Disney's most beloved pictures, Mary Poppins (1964), and negotiations between Disney and the author of the original books, P. L. Travers.<br/><br/>If history is written by the victors, then there's bound to be bias when the Disney Company tells a tale surrounding their beloved Uncle Walt, but the film portrays the powerful personalities of Travers and Disney as equal in strength and single mindedness. Ultimately, both are flawed.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks has had a good year, appearing recently in the critically acclaimed Captain Phillips. As Walt Disney, he appeals to Travers with a promise he made to his daughters: that he would adapt their favourite book for the silver screen. He claims Travers' creations are as much his family as hers, but at heart, he is a shrewd businessman, and a man who is absolutely used to getting what he wants.<br/><br/>Travers (Emma Thompson, who has experience starring as her own magical governess in Nanny McPhee) views the art of film and the fantasies of Disney with utter contempt, and has spent twenty years vehemently denying him the rights to her work. But financial constraints force her hand and she agrees to fly to California, where pre-production is already well underway, to finally hammer out a compromise.<br/><br/>While the clash of two big characters is enough for a solid story, Saving Mr. Banks is an ensemble piece. The cast rounded out with Travers' good natured chauffeur Ralph (Paul Giamatti) providing her introduction to American culture, and Disney's team: scriptwriter Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford), and songwriters Richard (Jason Schwartzman) and Robert Sherman (B. J. Novak).<br/><br/>Much of the humour in the film comes from Travers' altercations with DaGradi and the Sherman Brothers as they edit the script and score. Travers' is infinitely insufferable, rejecting their suggestions outright, frowning in disapproval at their songs, and chiding them for lack of manners when they attempt an informal atmosphere.<br/><br/>One stipulation she makes is to record all of their meetings. These were used extensively as source material by the film makers and an authentic excerpt from one of these tapes which plays over the end credits reveals just how accurate Thompsons's portrayal is – Travers really was that overbearing.<br/><br/>As a period piece, the film indulges in the meticulously portrayed eras of early '60s Hollywood, and turn of the century Australia. Here, flashbacks to Travers' youth and her father (Colin Farell), a struggling alcoholic bank manager, reveal the reasons behind her haughty demeanour, and the inspirations for her novels. With Mary Poppins, she gave the Banks' family a redemption that her own life never had.<br/><br/>The film is unashamedly saccharine at times. Travers is not alone: every character, from Ralph to Robert Sherman to Disney himself, has a tale of hardship to tug at the heartstrings. The audience is played like a fiddle by director John Lee Hancock, who knows a little about strung out sentimentality from his previous film, The Blind Side (2009). The film is long, clocking in at just over two hours, but is well paced, and does not feel especially bloated.<br/><br/>Naturally, a certain amount of knowledge and appreciation for Mary Poppins is required for this film to mean anything. While I am no Travers biographer, I'm aware that some elements of her personal life have been streamlined, or indeed omitted, to make them more cinematic.<br/><br/>The bare bones are the truth, and are indeed a powerful story. The biggest difference is that although she allowed it to be filmed, Travers never came around, and hated the Disney film for the rest of her life."
"Lmacnab24","9","2","5","22 December 2013"," Saving Mr Banks: The inspiring truth behind our beloved global nanny
","Mary Poppins is indisputably a cinematic icon which has captivated the imagination, the childhood and hearts of millions of children worldwide. Saving Mr Banks now gives you a front row seat in an emotively gripping insight of the true story behind the genesis of such a global treasure.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is the strenuous attempt of Disney to acquire legal rights from P. L. Travers (the original author of the 1934 book) in order to produce the cinematic adaptation of her book. Travis, however, is resilient against such an acquisition due to her impression of what the book will become in the hands of the movie giant.<br/><br/>The emotive core of the film revolves around the hostile resistance of the unashamedly stubborn, British, attitude of Mrs Travers (Emma Thompson), juxtaposed to the unequivocal persistence and creative energy of the Disney team headed by Walt Disney himself (Tom Hanks). This relationship in turn relates to the childhood of Mrs Travers, specifically the relationship with her father.<br/><br/>The scripting was elegant throughout and short of a few stereotypically clichéd 'Disney moments' I felt the interplay created through the collision of characters lead to a compellingly complex, dynamic and in parts intentionally distressing dialogue progression. Indeed through this dialogue the audience find themselves unravelling the profound genius and cutting realities which dictated the life and writing of Mrs Travers, and the poetic decorum of Walt Disney.<br/><br/>Quality casting of the major characters helped construct the solid bedrock for the success of the film with both Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks portraying their characters masterfully with their effortless charm and charisma. The leading pair were unquestionably aided with strong performances from Colin Farrell, Ruth Wilson (the father and mother of the young Mrs Travers respectfully), B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman (the Sherman Brothers), to name but a few.<br/><br/>John Lee Hancock's directing skills were apparent with consistently well shot, beautiful scenes, authentic to the societal and architectural language of the times. I would have been intrigued to see more of the film studios and methods of film production, as Disney's work was revolutionary. However I accept this may have diverted from the main drive of the film which was emotional rather than educational.<br/><br/>In summary Saving Mr Banks is an all age appealing example of emotive expression through cinematic performance which carries an intrinsic energy created through the humble truth of the plot, blended with a consistent, subtle comedic edge interspersed throughout. It is Disney doing what Disney does best, instilling imagination into the minds of the audience, an art they seem to have perfected."

","Every story has some truth behind it. No matter how fictional the situation, there is always a bit of truth in each and every story told. The same goes for Mary Poppins, the 1964 Disney movie that became an instant classic. Based on the character created by P.L. Travers, Mary Poppins focused on a magic nanny who had arrived at the house of a banker, Mr. Banks, to fix his unhappy family. Saving Mr. Banks focuses on P.L. Travers, as she reflects on her troubled childhood while attempting to work with Walt Disney to bring her character to life.<br/><br/>Set in 1961, Saving Mr. Banks chronicles P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) and her reluctant trip to Los Angeles to meet with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks), who has tried to buy the right to Mary Poppins for almost 20 years. Convinced to go by her agent, Travers hates just about everything about California, as well as Disney's plans for the movie. Disney quickly finds himself banging his head against a brick wall (metaphorically), due to Travers' stubbornness and brief arrogance.<br/><br/>During the days spent shooting down just about every single idea the screenwriters had for Mary Poppins, Travers often thinks back to her childhood, specifically moments with her very, very loving, but also very drunk, father, Travers Goff (Colin Farrell). Goff seems to be a fantastic father, always cheery and ready to put a smile on his children's face, and always encourages his daughter to dream, and tells her that she can be anything she wants to be. Her happy family begins to burst at the seems however, as Goff's drinking problem spills over into his family life, and eventually made Travers the stone cold person she had become. With P.L. Travers' ever-growing stubbornness, Walt Disney's attempt to bring the beloved character to life seems like an insurmountable challenge.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, Saving Mr. Banks is absolutely fantastic. It's perfection from beginning, to middle, to end. Each scene was filled with emotion, feeling, and heart, and that really shined through. Many movies that dabble with flashbacks usually struggle with the integration into the movie, however SMB does this brilliantly and seamlessly, using the many flashbacks to explain key points in the story.<br/><br/>Saving Mr. Banks' acting is incredible. Emma Thompson nailed this roll. Towards the beginning, her character is maddeningly arrogant and stubborn. As the movie progresses, you can really feel her emotions change, and you can feel along with her. Annie Rose Buckley, who played P.L. Travers as a young girl in the flashbacks, perfectly compliments Thompson's character. She is about as flawless as Thompson is. Colin Farrell's performance as Travers Goff is amazing, and Tom Hanks's role as Walt Disney is played to perfection.<br/><br/>There are not enough adjectives to describe how great Saving Mr. Banks and the cast are. First off, SMB is definitely one of Disney's best movies, live-action or animation. It's probably the best Disney movie since The Lion King, or maybe even since Mary Poppins itself. This movie is definitely worthy of an Oscar nomination. Emma Thompson deserves the award for Best Actress, and Tom Hanks is as good, if not better, than his performance earlier this year in Captain Phillips, and should definitely take home Best Supporting Actor. Saving Mr. Banks is a fantastic, feel-good, family friendly movie that exceeds Disney standards and stands out as, to this date, one of, if not the best, movie of 2013.<br/><br/>Rating: 10 of 10<br/><br/>BrickMovieReviews.wordpress.com<br/><br/>@BrickFilmReview"

Travers' original work was enhanced through those songs and the ineffable magic of Walt Disney (Tom Hanks). Saving Mr. Banks chronicles Walt's 20 year courtship of the stodgy Brit author (Emma Thompson) for rights to the film.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is partly a promotion of ""the happiest place on earth,"" (Disneyland) and partly a syrupy paean to the Disney goodness concept; however it is also a seemingly honest depiction of the difficulty Walt had convincing the conservative Travers to sign over the film rights. Half the fun is watching the songwriting brothers Sherman, playfully played by B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman, try to convince Travers (who had final say) that a spoonful of catchy tunes could translate her beloved Mary Poppins to the screen.<br/><br/>As director, John Lee Hancock assuredly navigates between Travers' hard life in Australia and the travails of creating a film, Saving Mr. Banks is as much about the challenges of creating popular art as it is about the challenges of bringing an author to deal with her work on film. Or more to the point, to deal with the memory of her charismatic, poetic, alcoholic father, whom Disney astutely, albeit late, sees as the center of Travers' ambivalence about giving her creation over to Disney. <br/><br/>No matter the accuracy of this version, when the author has the power to sign over rights or not, the producers' role is challenging and frustrating. Walt does not give up even if he has been at it for 20 years, and the film successfully shows why Disney is arguably the most powerful name in cinema. <br/><br/>To the film's credit, Travers remains a crusty Brit to the end, no Hollywoodized version of a convert to Disney Studio's sweetness, and Walt is as I remembered him: avuncular and determined to bring happiness and goodness to the world, especially children, through art.

","I have to start off by saying that I haven't seen Mary Poppins. And really, it's not needed. I thought on a purely emotional level, the film works quite well. The problem is that so many of the childhood/past scenes come off overly sentimental and are not that interesting. It's all so obvious in their execution. The scenes with an older Travis fare much, much better, and much of it is due to Thompson. She's the living heart of this, she's a little hard to take at first (the character as intended, of course) but Thompson plays this character so incredibly well. It's truly an amazing performance through and through, I just wish the film was more consistent. And I'm not a huge fan of Newman's score here, or rather, how it was used."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","2","6","9 December 2013"," The dream-maker meets the battleaxe
","It is reasonable to assume that since ""Saving Mr. Banks"" comes from Walt Disney Pictures and features a story involving Uncle Walt himself that the film would come off as an act of self-congratulations. In a way, it does, but the story told here is much better and far more meaningful than it's bouncy (and misleading) trailer would indicate. Here is a deep and very moving story about the power that art has on its creator, and how it becomes a means of exorcising demons of the past.<br/><br/>Yes, this is the movie about how Walt Disney coaxed a very iron-willed Pamela ""P.L."" Travers to sell him the rights to film her first ""Mary Poppins"" book, but it turns out to be about much more than just the irresistible force meeting the immovable object, it also it also tells a parallel story that tries to explain Travers reluctance. ""Mary Poppins"" was a story so close to her heart that it seemed to exist in her DNA.<br/><br/>""Saving Mr. Banks"" begins in 1961 as we meet the curmudgeonly Travers (Emma Thompson) in her London flat, having been contacted for the umpteenth time by Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) who has spent 20 years trying to get her permission to bring her beloved ""Mary Poppins"" to life. Travers, we come to understand, readies the word 'no' like a loaded gun. She's a cranky, foul-tempered old bat with little tolerance for anyone, especially her long-suffering agent (Ronan Vibert) who urges her to go and see Disney because she is nearly broke.<br/><br/>In Los Angeles, Travers is a stranger in a strange land. Here the post-war British stiff-upper lip enters the bizarre pop-art world of Kennedy's 1960s America. Flustered and irritated, she can't wait to tell Walt to go jump in a lake so she can beat it back home. But, as we all know, Walt didn't take no for an answer (he made a promise to his daughters to turn 'Poppins' into a film). He persuades Travers to at least sit down with the creative team and see how things go. ""These characters are like family to me,"" she tells him passionately. This is not lost on Walt, who understood the value of keeping one's creation close to the chest. He is, after all, a man who spent his life with a mouse close to his heart.<br/><br/>Travers clashes not only with Walt but also with co-screenwriter Don DeGradi (Bradley Whitford) and with the songwriting Sherman Brothers, Dick (Jason Schwartzman) and Bob (B.J. Novak), making specific and very cutting demands: No penguins, no animation and certainly no Dick Van Dyke. Her demands seem unreasonable, but the reasons for her reluctance are laid out in a series of flashback scenes that examine her childhood growing up with a father who was a failed banker who died too young. The story, Disney comes to understand, is really his story, and it bears Pamela a wounded heart.<br/><br/>There is a lot more weight here than we might expect. Emma Thompson, in one of her best performances, plays Travers as an unyielding old bag who gradually – under the twinkling magic of Walt Disney – begins to come around to the idea of giving him her most precious creation. Her face is a mask of bitterness and frustration, but as we understand her background we understand that it is born out of heartbreak and regret. We see a little girl who was transplanted as a child from England to Australia by an irresponsible, but not un-loving father. He was a dreamer who let his personal demons ruin the family and himself. As the flashbacks progress, we see the machinations that inspired the events in ""Mary Poppins."" Her father, Travers Goff, is played achingly well by Collin Farrell who, more than any other actor, knows how to project a measure of wounded pride.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is an odd choice to play Walt Disney, he doesn't much look like him – Gene Hackman could have easily filled the role. But Hanks does a fine job, even when chewing on Disney's trademark Missouri accent. He plays Walt with a twinkle in his eye and ever-present reminder that he is always – at heart – a bit of a huckster. He charms and eventually wins over Travers, but under his friendly smile we are never made to forget that he is, at heart, a salesman.<br/><br/>""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a movie that will either draw your affection or your skepticism. It has already drawn sneers from critics who eagerly point out the film's historic inaccuracies (and there are plenty), and your enjoyment of the film may hinge on how real you want it to be. The fact is, this is a wonderful movie about a haunted artist who found some measure of relief from possibly the only man who could have melted her icy heart. It's a good and true movie about the power of art and the magic of movies.<br/><br/>**** (of four)"
"neil-476","9","2","6","6 December 2013"," Sentimental, but fair enough
","Walt Disney pursued author Pamela Travers for over 20 years for the screen rights of Mary Poppins, finally luring her to Hollywood to work with his creative people on the screenplay. Truth be told, she didn't want to let go of her characters because they had been her way of dealing with the pain of her troubled childhood in rural Australia.<br/><br/>This interesting and, perhaps, unusual, adaptation of real-life events alternates between showing the difficulties Disney and his people had with the awkward, stubborn, stand-offish and cantankerous Travers, and the events of 40 years earlier in Australia. I have encountered a number of comments where people say that the Australia sequences took them out of the film, and I can understand this: the Disney Studios sequences are played for comedy, whereas the Australian sequences are straightforward drama: sentimental at times, surely, but often quite harshly emotional in showing the way the young Travers idolised her flawed father (and he her) but was powerless - as was everybody else- to rescue him from the alcoholism which destroyed him. However, I felt that these sequences, none of which was overlong and all of which were interspersed throughout the film's running length - were the heart of the story, without which it would not have worked so well.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks' everymannish-ness is ideally suited to the avuncular public personality Walt Disney affected, albeit we also get a look at the hard-nosed businessman who created the Disney empire. Emma Thompson's Travers strains (sometimes successfully) to escape a one-note personality, but this is perhaps a reflection of Travers herself. Colin Farrell has come in for some criticism, but I thought he did well as Travers' father. And Paul Giamatti's chauffeur Ralph is perhaps the most likable (and least realistic) character in the film, but we love him anyway.<br/><br/>This film manipulates our emotions (but hasn't Disney done that right from the start anyway?), but does so in the cause of an unusual but very rewarding story. I enjoyed this rather more than I expected to."

","23 January 2014. The biggest question about Saving Mr. Banks is even how to describe it. There doesn't seem to be any single word or even several words that captures this movie. It doesn't easily fit a movie genre or category. The fascinating weaving of past and present unfolds a movie that is a mystery, a comedy, a drama, a psychological thriller, a historical biographical, a period piece, that incorporates music numbers, relational themes, family, and even alcoholism.<br/><br/>The movie offered a well edited, weaving of past and present that seamlessly enhanced the movie. This multi-layered, substantively faceted movie was rich with subtexts and deeper emotional and cognitive insight. In some ways, Saving Mr. Banks is unique in its rich delivery and depiction of the human condition, using historical facts, imagination, and popular myth to create an apparently serious magical experience.<br/><br/>While no movie might be directly compared to Saving Mr. Banks, this movie retains or captures the tone or some of the qualities of such movies as Finding Neverland (2004), a Johnny Depp vehicle where fantasy and reality collide in a bittersweet love story about the man who wrote Pan Peter; The Weatherman (2005), a strong drama about a television weather man played by Nicolas who is going through the disruptive experience of divorce, his attempts a reconciliation, coping with challenging children, and a father played by Michael Caine who himself undergoes a life-altering experience; Moliere (2007), a French produced period comedy drama that provides laugh at in a layered movie about the comedy actor who must disguise himself at a rich man's estate and deal with a love interest at the same time; Punch-Drunk Love (2002), a new type of love story starring Adam Sandler and Emily Watson; and Hitchcock (2012),a movie that provokes visceral, intense human emotions of sorrow, fear, passion, and redemption packaged in a movie premised around a horror film.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson's performance is of particular note for her portrayal of Mrs. Traver's who wrote Mary Poppins. Her character performance under the direction of John Lee Hancock was memorable for the delicate balance between the nastiness and unpersonable personality such depicts and the more appealing nature of the overall tone and theme of the movie. Meryl Streep accomplished as much in The Devil Wears Prada (2006)."
"SimonJack","8","1","2","24 September 2017"," Disney won over author to make memorable musical
","""Saving Mr. Banks"" is all about saving the film, ""Mary Poppins."" That is saving, as in being able to make the film in the first place. It tells the story of the culmination of a 20-year pursuit by Walt Disney of English author, Australia-born P.L. Travers for the film rights to her books. She neglected all appeals until, according to the film, her finances dwindled to the point that her London agent urged to meet with Walt Disney at his California studios and to consider again the Disney offer. <br/><br/>One can understand that many authors are concerned about Hollywood substantially changing their stores when making them into movies. In this case, Travers was more resolute than most, and obstinate. She didn't want ""Mary Poppins"" to be a musical. There could be no animation (as in the short scene with penguins dancing). Mary Poppins was not to be a happy spirited woman, but a stern, serious teacher. Her conditions for granting film rights reached to the level of insisting that no red color be used at all in the film. <br/><br/>This movie is the story about Ms. Travers (nee, Helen Lyndon Goff), and how Walt Disney warmed her some and otherwise wore down her resistance. She had encounters with most of the Disney studio people she met, especially the song-writing team of the Sherman Brothers – Dick and Bob. Walt Disney's tenacity paid off and the happy ending of this story is in the wonderful musical that generations to come will enjoy. Without ""Mary Poppins,"" we wouldn't have the wonderful songs of the Sherman Brothers, ""A Spoonful of Sugar,"" and ""Super‐cali‐fragil‐istic- expi‐ali‐docious.""<br/><br/>All of the cast in this film are very good. Tom Hanks conveys the conviviality, decency and hopeful spirit of Walt Disney. And, Emma Thompson is superb as P.L. Travers – or, ""Pamela,"" as Walt kept calling her. This movie is a good accompaniment for viewing ""Mary Poppins,"" especially for those interested in the source and history of the movie. <br/><br/>Here are a few of my favorite lines from this film. <br/><br/>P.L. ""Pamela"" Travers, ""Poppins. Mary Poppins. Never ever just Mary.""<br/><br/>Travers, ""I fear we shan't be acquainted for very long."" Richard Sherman, ""Why is that?"" Travers, ""Because these books simply do not lend themselves to chirping and prancing. No, it's certainly not a musical.""<br/><br/>Walt Disney, ""Cancel my morning tomorrow. I'm going to take a ride with my favorite author."" Travers, ""No, no, no! Please, Mr. Disney. I cannot begin to tell you how uninterested – no, positively sickened I am at the thought of visiting your dollar-printing machine."" Walt Disney, ""Well, for crying out loud. When does anybody get to go to Disneyland with Walt Disney himself?"" Travers, ""Disappointments are to the soul what thunderstorms are to the air."" <br/><br/>Don DaGradi, ""A word of advice, Mrs. Travers, if I may."" P.L. Travers, ""You may. Whether I mind it or not will be another matter entirely. Don DaGradi ""Well, it's just that he can't stand being called Mr. Disney. We're all on a first name basis here. <br/><br/>Walt Disney, ""Let's make something wonderful."" P.L. Travers, ""Well, let's see if that's at all possible."" Walt Disney, after she walks away, ""Whoa! Damn!""<br/><br/>P.L. Travers, ""Mary Poppins and the Banks – they are family to me."" Walt Disney, ""I understand that – I do."""
"arzucevikalp-73560","8","1","2","23 August 2017"," Mary Poppins, the governess that came from heavens
","I think there's not one soul among us that doesn't know that arrogant and well-disciplined governess Mary Poppins, who flies using her enormous black umbrella. We get to know Mary Poppins, who has a wardrobe reminiscent of a regular 19th century English woman, as a super hero coming from heavens with dark colored clothes and a gigantic hat. In fact, what identifies Mary Poppins is the coal black umbrella of hers. Chosen as a ""metaphorical"" symbol of the gloomy rainy weathers of England, black umbrella is an important element that we identify Mary Poppins with. In reality, Mary Poppins is a very special person, because she has her own unique feature. She can tidy up a messy room just with a finger snap, she can fly and she can take out enormous household goods just from her small handbag. Having children under her spell with her magical powers, there's no impossible for Mary Poppins. If you could manage to do this, we can continue to how Mary Poppins have been realized. Based on a true story, Mr. Banks shows us the behind the scenes of this Disney classic and tells us the story of the unstable relationship between legendary Walt Disney and author P. L. Travers. When his daughters persistently asked him to shot the film of their favorite book Mary Poppins, Walt Disney promised them that he would, but he didn't realize at that time that keeping his promise would take 20 years. Consist of the merged main and side stories, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" shows the inner world of the author Travers perfectly. While we're already talking about main and side stories, we should give details on these subjects. Within the side story, we watch ""behind the scenes"" moments of Mary Poppins and within the main story we watch the relationship between the author and Walt Disney. For example, when a 'flashback' cuts in, we see the ""behind the scene"" enactments of Mary Poppins. Besides, these enactments consist of phantasms and reality intertwined. Well then, how does phantasm and reality intertwine? Within the scenes, where phantasm dominates, Travers imagines the scenes that will be shot. Telling us the events happened between 1906 and 1965 from his own point of view, the author reminds us that we're watching a ""film within a film"". He already is the eyes and ears of the film! In fact, having us identify ourselves with Mary Poppins, Travers reminds us Poppins' umbrella by using the ""rain provides life"" cue. Another detail is that the relation between object and character is as right as rain. For example, there are Walt Disney toys in Travers' hotel room. Eh, at the end, the movie was being produced by Walt Disney! But what impressed me most is that director John Lee Hancock, who uses vivid colors, turned the scenes, shot in 2:35:1 CinemaScope format, into a visual feast. This visual feast reflects the beginnings and the middle of the 1900s so good that you want the time machine has already been invented, so that you can travel back. The movie, really, embraces us and due to its strong aura, all the scenes become engraved on your mind. Let's cut to the Travers' experiences, which is the main theme of the movie. Sometimes, Travers' anger and dissatisfaction raise difficulties for the production. Because the author always worries about that the film won't be able to reflect the essence of the book. For me, the most important thing is Walt Disney's 20 years long perseverance to keep his promise to his children. But it looks like, the life Travers led let her down so much that she can't shake off all her bitterness and bad temper. The most obvious evidence of the bad temper of rebellious and delirious Travers is the lonely life she led. In fact, she was so lonely that Mary Poppins was her only friend. Actually, was not this the only reason for Walt Disney to pursue Travers? Actually, the most interesting part of this story is the ""Mr. Banks"" character which was inspired from the deceased father of the writer. May be this is the reason of her bitterness. Who knows? In general, Travers' conversation with Walt Disney's toy may be the sign of the loneliness and dissatisfaction of the writer who has chosen solitude after all she has been through. Because, used as a metaphor, the Disney toy makes all the problems, buried deep inside Travers' personality, burst out. According to our analysis, Travers either postponed these problems or enshrined her own loneliness into her heart. When examined superficially, the perfect story-line and the marvelous acts of Emma Thompson, who plays Travers, and Tom Hanks, who plays Walt Disney, make a cold fact appear before us. According to that cold fact, what we watched on the screen was multi-layered; and we get aware of this fact only at the end of the movie. The message is so deep that it's hard to forget all along our life; because, maybe we will never watch another movie that teaches a powerful humanity lesson. However, it wouldn't be right to finish the article without making this small critic: I think it was a bit irrational to show Colin Firth, who plays Mr. Banks, whose also gives his name to the title of the movie, within so few scenes. Hence it looks like something outweighed. And also, even, incorrect portrayal of Mary Poppins' character within the scenes that show the behind the scenes moments of the original film tops it all. I wonder why they didn't put any scene that shows Mary Poppins flying with her umbrella, which is a token of her identity? It's hard to find a logical answer. It seems like, the behind the scenes was a bit mediocre. There could be more details. In a nut shell: Even there were some faults, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a movie that can convey the feeling to the audience and become a friend with them successfully."
"ianlouisiana","10","1","2","17 May 2017"," Write what you know.
","Well,Mrs Travers certainly did that,basing her best known book ""Mary Poppins"" on her own somewhat fraught childhood. Having achieved that catharsis she had no wish to see her characters ""Disneyfied"" by a man whose only achievement as far as she could reckon was to have drawn a cartoon mouse and gotten very rich on it. Thus the contest began between this strong determinedly unimpressed Englishwoman and one of Hollywood's richest movie moguls for the ""soul"" if you like,of the world's favourite nanny. Well,we know of course that Mr Disney won her over eventually and ended up making possibly his best - ever film,and probably his most - loved. The ""Mr Banks"" in the title refers not only to Mr D.Tomlinson's character but that of her father,a gently alcoholic businessman in Australia on whom it was based. Miss E.Thompson is blindingly good as Miss Travers,charming yet steely right up to the end. Mr T.Hanks plays his usual good - humoured and slightly exasperated character,a turn he has made his own over the last 30 years. It's a sad and funny quite uplifting film - rather like ""Mary Poppins"" itself. Even if you haven't been to the pictures since 1964 when you sat down to watch Julie and Dick armed with a ""Kia - Ora"" and some popcorn I urge you to give it a go."

","This is a movie that really pulls on the heartstrings of the viewers. It's a film that can really impact the emotions of the viewers. It can be a very engaging and emotional experience if you are someone that has empathy and heart. This film does have Walt Disney in it played by Tom Hanks who did a phenomenal job bringing out the charisma and magnetic presence of Walt Disney. Now this might not be the most truthful representation of Walt Disney but for a movie such as this, it really does work. Every scene Tom Hanks was in just brought me to get a bit more attached to his character and have more respect for the guy. However the main protagonist of this movie is Pamela ""P. L."" Travers who is played by Emma Thompson, who also did a really good job playing this really jaded, cynical and stubborn character. Sometimes, actually most of the time, the environment builds people into who they become. And Pamela ""P. L."" Travers had a sad and poor childhood with a highly imaginative father who she looked up to. Anyways Pamela ""P. L."" Travers is well known for her Mary Poppins series. It's like the golden egg to her, maybe because it has bits and pieces of her in the story. And the imaginative and yet business driven guy like Walt Disney wants the rights to her story and make a live action movie out of it. Disney tries to be accommodating as much as possible but Travers wanted everything her way down to every last detail. And thus a slight bit of conflict starts with Walt Disney employees and Travers. During this process it delves into the childhood of Travers and her relationship with her father. This is a very tearjerking movie and it's actually quite heartfelt. Especially the scene near the end, when Disney tries to bring out his final card by showing empathy. It really does show how empathy can change the world. Great acting and heartfelt moments with a script that is based on a true story that works makes this a film that is most definitely worth a watch.<br/><br/>9/10"

"moonspinner55","5","1","2","6 September 2014"," Disappointing flashbacks, a mildewy Hanks performance, yet Thompson is practically perfect...
","Middle-aged Brit and ""Mary Poppins"" author P.L. Travers, a frustrated, frustrating female conundrum of likes and dislikes (and with both surname and ancestry highly suspect) is being persuaded to sign over the creative rights to her book to Walt Disney in the early 1960s; she wants no cartoons or songs in the film, nor is the color red to be present, which leads to an ulcer-making relationship between she and the powers-that-be at Disney Studios. Historians are likely to pick this movie apart--from factual content to the Hollywood milieu to Tom Hanks' performance as Walt Disney--which, if the inaccuracies exist, is warranted...but how is the film as an entertainment? It is richly produced, directed (at moments) with a modicum of flair by John Lee Hancock and cast with extremely talented actors--and yet, it rarely lifts off. The flashbacks to Travers' emotionally-upsetting childhood in Australia (with Colin Farrell overacting as her alcoholic father) keep butting into the framework, although this doesn't deter Emma Thompson from giving a smashing performance as Travers. Stubborn, exasperating, tight with her principles, Thompson alone is nearly everything this picture needs to succeed. Unfortunately, her scenes with Paul Giamatti as an excruciatingly sympathetic driver are pure hokum, and her moments with Hanks are leaden. Hanks, who undoubtedly put some thought into his Disney impersonation, is all wrong for the role; what with bad hair and make-up, boxy suits and a continuous look of consternation on his face, this Walt Disney seems more like a dismayed studio lackey. There's some heart in the proceedings, but not enough: when Travers finally gets into the movie music--the song ""Let's Go Fly a Kite"" by the Sherman brothers--and begins to merrily dance, we barely get a glimpse of this happy moment before Hancock cuts away to the assistant running down the hallway trying to find Mr. Disney; when Disney first hears ""Feed the Birds"" being worked out on the piano, he appears to be wandering the studio grounds in the middle of the night. ""Mr. Banks"" isn't a shambles, but the self-congratulatory air and heavy-handed sentiment and pathos mark the film as a disappointment. ** from ****"

","I didn't see Saving Mr. Banks until it came out on Cable TV. I thought it might be a children's movie but it was not. It's the tale of a woman dealing with her past ghosts and how Walt Disney through his determination and perseverance made Mary Poppins come alive in film. The story is touching, seen through the flashbacks of the author life as a child, as she works with Disney's Hollywood team to create a version of the movie she would approve of. We see her first as a cantankerous woman, living a solitary lonely life in need of money to save her house. Through the movie we see her mellow through the process of reconciling her relationship with her loving father by learning to forgive his weaknesses and herself for not being able to save him. We also get a glimpse of the erasable Walt Disney who through his own deficits in his childhood made a world full of fantasy to brighten the lives of children and adults. Through his team and his process he breaks down Mrs. Travers's objections to his creating a musical fantasy out of her book and thus the wonderful movie of Mary Poppins came to life for us all. <br/><br/>The team of scriptwriters that put together this tale did a wonderful job. I was truly touched by the story. I also want to give credit to the wonderful acting. I especially loved the little girl who played Ginty (Annie Rose Buckley) she had a wonderful dramatic range, and really took you into her heart. Emma Thompson's skills really get you to like and understand the woman inside PL Travers. Tom Hanks brought a life of wonder to his portrayal of Walt Disney. The twinkle inside of Travers Goff and the tragedy of his inability to deal with the reality of living was played excellently by Colin Farrell. I really liked Paul Giamatti portrayal of Ralph; I only wish they had included his daughter in the day Walt Disney took Pamela to Disney Land as she was the link that allowed Pamela to open up to Ralph. All the acting was great and I know I've left out many of the others actors and actresses that contributed to making this a fine movie just for the sake of space here, they all did a great job. If you didn't catch Saving Mr. Banks in the theater like me, definitely worth seeing it on Cable or Netflix."

","I was not prepared for this film although I had little idea what it was about, but I am such a Disney fan that I thought it would be at least interesting. I am also a big fan of Emma Thompson and have liked her in everything she has done and she does not disappoint here. I looked up the real Pamela Travers and was shocked to discover she absolutely hated the Disney version of her book, Mary Poppins. How this film deals with that issue is interesting. Tom Hanks is wonderful as Walt Disney and after a while you really begin to think he is Walt Disney. He is that convincing. The supporting cast which includes some familiar faces is also wonderful and showing the process of pre-production is really fascinating and very educational. I really learned a lot about how movies are made from this film. Everything about this film was classy including the music, photography, settings - everything. I really enjoyed watching the film and I got completely caught up in the story which I will not ruin by discussing any further. A big surprise was Colin Farrell who I did not know was in the film. When he appeared I did not recognize him at first and had to look at the cast list I printed out from this site to see who he was - something I do with every film I watch. Can't beat IMDb for film info that's for sure."

"shawneofthedead","8","1","2","26 February 2014"," Thompson and Hanks lend magic to a slightly pedestrian script - the result is (mostly) supercalifragilistic... you know where this is going!
","Nominally, Saving Mr. Banks tells the behind-the-scenes story of how Walt Disney's silver-screen incarnation of Mary Poppins came to be, swooping as it did into the imaginations of children across the world in the guise of magical songbird Andrews. Actually, John Lee Hancock's film is a finely-crafted, if rather heavy-handed, character study that doubles as a meditation on family, fatherhood and the healing power of fiction.<br/><br/>For years, Pamela 'P.L.' Travers (Emma Thompson) has jealously guarded the rights to her Mary Poppins novels, refusing to bow to the considerable charms and exhortations of media mogul Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) - a man who always get what he wants. When she hits a rocky financial patch in 1961, she's finally persuaded by her accountant to spend a fortnight in L.A. discussing the project. Once there, she terrorises Disney's entire creative team - including screenwriter Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) and composer brothers Richard (Jason Schwartzman) and Robert Sherman (B.J. Novak) - with her demands.<br/><br/>The story, it would seem, naturally lacks narrative tension - of course Travers gives in at some point, in some fashion. The existence of Mary Poppins in its everlastingly sublime cinematic form - despite Travers' strident and ruthlessly documented (via audio-tape) objections to script, score, animation and character design - is proof of that final surrender.<br/><br/>But Saving Mr. Banks makes up for the inevitability of its outcome with some outstanding character work, allowing the darker and lighter sides of both Travers and Disney to peek through the conflicting personas - one prickly, the other genial - that they present to the world.<br/><br/>In this regard, Saving Mr. Banks benefits enormously from the skill and talent of its two lead actors. As good ol' Uncle Walt, Hanks radiates a genuine charm that comes intriguingly laced with a hint of Machiavellian menace. In his business-minded courtship of Travers, Disney seems to reveal something deeper and sadder about himself and his soul - only for that glimmer of heartfelt intimacy to vanish as quickly as it appears. Hanks is masterful in playing the sweetness and steel of this complicated, media-savvy man, a warts-and-all portrait that's all the more surprising for the fact that this film was shot under the aegis of Disney's own studio.<br/><br/>Thompson, meanwhile, is nothing short of spectacular. On screen (and, by all accounts, in real life), Travers is abrasive and utterly unsentimental, merrily insulting everyone who crosses her path with little care for their feelings or stature. Thompson breathes life into this difficult character, disappearing into the stern lines of Travers' face and the strict cuts of her dresses (not to mention that unflatteringly tight perm). Most impressive of all is the way in which Thompson plays the chinks in Travers' armour. She skilfully unveils years of guilt and regret in moments of quiet, unexpected vulnerability, all of which hint at the depths of soul and imagination that helped her dream up Mary Poppins in the first place.<br/><br/>It should go without saying that the scenes Hanks and Thompson share are the best in the film. When they meet, Saving Mr. Banks acts as a master- class in physics - irresistible force meets immovable object - and acting; together, they create fireworks both explosive and emotional. There are few scenes more delightful than the ones in which Travers flatly defies Disney's flights of fancy (no red in the film!), or when Disney takes Travers for a ride (quite literally) in a personal tour of Disneyland.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a substantial chunk of Saving Mr. Banks - necessitated by the script as its main narrative device - is preoccupied with unravelling Travers' backstory and daddy issues. Far too frequently, the film cuts back to her yellow-washed childhood in Australia, where she - nicknamed 'Ginty' and played by the saucer-eyed Annie Rose Buckley - begins to realise that her sensitive dreamer of a dad (Colin Farrell) isn't quite the hero she has always believed him to be. It's not that this section of the film is bad, per se. In fact, it features a fine, heartbreaking performance from Farrell as a man who wildly loves his family but can't resist the siren call of alcohol.<br/><br/>But the themes and ideas of these flashbacks are almost profoundly sentimental and hammered home in so blatant a fashion that one imagines Travers - whether the real or fictitious incarnation - would regard it with a furious disdain. As Travers herself grumbles in the film, when welcomed to L.A. by a roomful of Disney merchandise, the script could afford to ""learn the art of subtlety"". For all that Thompson is excellent in the part, it's sometimes tough to reconcile the open-hearted Ginty with the closed-up Travers. Hancock would have done better to trust Thompson to tell that story in the shifts and shadows of her enormously expressive eyes.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Saving Mr. Banks powers through on the strength of its marvellous cast. Whitford, Schwartzman and Novak have great fun playing their reactions to Thompson's Travers, ranging from exasperation to annoyance and, in one case, pure, unfettered anger. The unsung hero of the piece is Ralph (Paul Giamatti), Travers' eternally upbeat chauffeur. For all that Disney tries to find his way to Travers' heart, it's Ralph who brings the audience there with him.<br/><br/>When it comes down to it, Saving Mr. Banks isn't about who won in the battle between Disney and Travers. To keep her house and home, Travers pretty much knew from the start that she would have to sign the rights to her beloved magical nanny away. She went to L.A. to fight for the spirit of her story - for her Mr. Banks - and this is precisely what allows the film, buoyed by the undeniable magic of Disney's final product, to take flight."
"valadas","7","1","2","10 February 2014"," Nice amusing film
","This story of the discords between Pamela L. Travers the author of novel ""Mary Poppins"" and Walt Disney about the adaptation of it to the cinema is shown in a vivid succession of sequences going to and fro between Austrália in 1906 and London / Los Angeles in 1961 in constant flashbacks to show us how Mrs. Travers (like she always demands to be called against any familiarities) had a traumatic childhood mainly because of her father alcoholic behaviour despite the fact that they loved each other deeply. This explains her disagreeable and sometimes rude behaviour and way of treating other people. We don't know if this movie respects the truthfulness of what happened in fact concerning her relationship with Walt Disney and his collaborators while preparing the movie and that was full of disagreements. Anyway a work of art even when biographic doesn't need to respect truth in every detail and can use fancy to enhance it aesthetically providing it does not wrest the central meaning of the reality that happened in fact. Although some scenes are a bit caricatural the movie in its whole is totally acceptable and Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks do a wonderful job as the two main characters."

Travers, and her journey/s. In spite of John Lee Hancock's ham-fisted handling of 'The Blind side', one of the reasons for which I was not primed for this one, he knocks this one out of the park. Pitch-perfect in tone, execution and characterization, never mind the so-called liberties that may/not have been taken, this is a work of a supremely confident team (its always a team, no matter who helms it), and evoked, in me, some of the best movie-watching memories I've had, esp. watching something similarly layered a few years previously, also on the big screen with a like-minded audience, 'Finding Neverland'. Everyone's in top form here (In addn to Hanks/Thompson/Farrell, we have Giamatti/Baker/Schwartzman/Novak/Whitford), and this is a welcome return to the mainstream limelight for Colin Farrell as well, and Emma Thompson, the eponymous Nanny McPhee, IS Mrs., sorry, Mrs. Travers. I've never enjoyed her performance more (except perhaps in 'Last chance Harvey', another under-seen jewel). The soundtrack is some of the best composed for film, as is the lush cinematography. All in all, perfect, and it helps that the distributors for this one have their heads out of their glory holes, and have released this absolutely wide. Its playing in approximately 12 shows/day across multiplexes, and the audience I watched it with, was respectful, and enjoyed everything unfold with absolute reverence and delight, the way this is meant to be savored. Once more, the middle finger moves around those impatient ^&%$$$s who do not savor the large-screen experience, and 'tis a pity they'll never know what they missed. Better for the rest of us though. Watch it before it leaves cinemas - this one's one of those magical, life-affirming works of art. Take your family, take your better/worse half - savor it. Maybe twice/more. I know I will."

","I grew up in Soviet Ukraine and my first encounter with Mary Poppins was through 1983 Russian movie. Still I liked book - the original - much better. When I moved to the US I was really anxious to see the Disney Mary Poppins movie. When I did I was disappointed, almost let down. To start with, this minuscule character Bert - why is he given such huge part in the movie? Then, where are Neleus, Miss Andrews, talking dogs and babies? SO much had been left out. The movie 'Saving Mr. Banks' is very good and Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson are very good in it, But between you and I, the 1963 movie is not even 10% as good as the book. P.L.Travers is indignant the whole film, and sometimes I began hating her for that, but she is so right and every bit justified in her indignation. BTW, she continued hating the film, despite the release of the rights to charming and very persistent Mr. Disney. In my opinion, the book is better fitted to be turned into a mini-series, each episode showcasing another aspect of MP's awesomeness and magic. Hopefully some day they will make those mini-series and do the great magical book justice."

"maurice_yacowar","8","1","2","26 December 2013"," Disney discovers the truth behind Mary Poppins' creator.
","Because Saving Mr Banks is a Disney production, Walt is played by Tom Hanks instead of Joe Pesci. And very well too, continuing from Captain Phillips Hanks's personification of decency under duress.<br/><br/>Peel back the layers. <br/><br/>(i) The film is about how the Mary Poppins film came to be made, how Disney had to overcome the arch prejudices of the source novelist Pamela Travers (marvelous Emma Thompson). We also get a glimpse into the creation process, as a team concocts a musical one tune at a time, bar by bar, yet the team still purveys a very personal vision.<br/><br/>(ii) The film is about how the novel came to be composed, how the story — much bleaker both in plot and heroine than the original film — grew out of the author's life and needs. Flashbacks to Travers' childhood and her bittersweet relationship with her drunken irresponsible and doomed dreamer father discover the sources of the adult woman's aversions to red and to pears. More importantly, it reveals her unconscious need to redeem her father and to forgive her own childhood failure to save him. As we've often been told, art is how the artist works out personal neuroses. As Disney teaches Travers, art enables us too change our story, to see our past influences whole rather than in a limited, specific part, and to learn to forgive, ourselves as well as others. Disney's clue into Travers' fictionalizing of herself lies in discovering her pen-name. She is a story as much as she tells one. Thus this plot broadens from saving the children to saving Mr Banks — to saving Pamela Travers.<br/><br/>(iii) That represents Disney too, as he reveals his own harsh and traumatic childhood and a cruel father he has learned to respect and love. So this film is a justification of the Disney canon, saving it from charges of unreal cheer. From the beginning the Disney classics were far from the escapist romances we dismiss them as. Rather like the profound fairy tales on which they often drew, they took on the eternal realities of death, loss, helplessness, even the first stirrings of sexuality and adult experience. That's the spoonful of medicine that makes the sugar go up. The best primer on classic Disney remains Bruno Bettelheim The Uses of Enchantment. For more go to www.yacowar.blogspot.com."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Surely it's a coincidence that Disney Studios has released this movie just a few months ahead of the 50th anniversary of the classic Mary Poppins film. Regardless of the promotional angle, the story of Walt Disney (played by Tom Hanks) going all out to woo stuffy Brit writer PL Travers (Emma Thompson)actually turns out to be a well made and pretty interesting story of two stubborn people butting heads. Even better is a behind the scenes glimpse of the creative process of bringing the Travers book(s) to the big screen.<br/><br/>Director John Lee Hancock is the perfect fit with his track record of glossy, feel-good, inspired by true life stories with The Blind Side and The Rookie. We never lose sight that this is a Disney production of a Disney story. The only Disney blemish shown is a quick shot of him stubbing a cigarette in an ashtray. Mr. Disney was an expert at hiding his smoking habit from the public ... well at least until he died from lung cancer in 1966, a mere two years after the premiere of Mary Poppins. Mostly Walt is depicted as working diligently to provide the trust and security that Travers sought in protecting her most precious flying nanny.<br/><br/>The real star here is Emma Thompson's portrayal of Travers. Her desperate need for money is mentioned once, but the story is more concerned with her innate need to protect the legacy of her story ... no animation, no mean Mr Banks, no Dick Van Dyke, and no silly songs. Watching her interact with the songwriting Sherman brothers (Jason Schwartzman, BJ Novak) and the Disney screenwriter played by Bradley Whitford is the most fun this movie has to offer. Her ""no, no, no"" mindset is quite frustrating for the quite successful Disney creative team. The armchair psychology is really where the movie falters a bit. Watching Walt struggle to mesmerize Travers with his Disney magic feels a bit forced, and when combined with numerous flashbacks to her childhood leave the audience way ahead of figuring out the key to her heart and mind.<br/><br/>Once the daddy issues come to light, we get Hanks' best scene in the film. As he finally connects with Travers by laying bare his childhood (and fatherly) challenges, he eloquently explains the importance of imagination and storytelling for both children and adults. A desire to re-write or re-imagine our childhood seems to be at the core of many adults. It seems many dwell on the negative aspects of childhood, and even here, Travers' dad (Colin Farrell) may be the nicest alcoholic who ever inspired their kid to be a writer.<br/><br/>PL Travers (born Helen Lyndon Goff) wrote 8 Mary Poppins books between 1934 and 1988, but was so unhappy with the film version that she never agreed to a sequel and it wasn't until the 1990's when she agreed to a stage version (no Americans allowed!). She passed away in 1996 at the age of 96, and the actual recordings played over the closing credits show just how well Ms. Thompson captured the strong will of the author."

Around 1938 is when Tom first tried to get the rights to it because of his daughters loving the book so much. Every year, for twenty years, he kept trying but Emma did not want her beloved piece of fiction to be turned into a cartoon, like Mickey Mouse-she hated animation, and at that time, Disney had only made animated movies. After twenty years, in 1961, she finally agreed to meet with Tom and hear him out, as long as she had final approval-no animation. The movie tells two stories simultaneously; one is the negotiations between Tom and Emma in 1961 and the other takes place in 1907, in Australia. At first, you may wonder what is going on but you soon find out how they are connected. Colin is in the 1907 story in Australia and Bradley is in the newer one in 1961. Emma is very unlikable; she hates just about everything they show her, but there is a reason for it. There is a lot of humor in the movie but be ready for some tearful moments, too. FYI: If you are familiar with 'Mary Poppins', you probably know about the animated penguins sequence and you probably know who Mr. Banks is. Also, in real life, Tom Hanks is a distant cousin of Walt Disney and next year, 2014, is the fiftieth anniversary of the release of 'Mary Poppins'. It's rated ""PG-13"" for some unsettling images-some smoking and drinking- and has a running time of 2 hours & 5 minutes. It was an interesting and entertaining movie and I enjoyed it, as well as my wife. I'm not too sure if little kids would enjoy it but I would buy this on DVD."

Tom Hanks has you seeing and hearing Walt no problem. There is also some great scenes with the song writers suffering through their work but not because it was hard but being interfered with. One thing puzzles me however. Trying to get Disneyland to support any movie is already a challenge and this one had carte balance to go into Disneyland and just showcase the place and make it part of the healing process for the people involved. I got excited just seeing a glimpse of the happiest place on earth or the Magic Kingdom as it is called. Let me add I used to work there too and they let a good opportunity go unclaimed. It would have made this movie a must watch just to visit with Disneyland let alone the subject matter of Mary Poppins etc. Yes to seeing this movie and it is worth a ticket.

And there were many unexpected comedic moments to lighten the tension of the unfolding drama. You think that the screenwriters are exaggerating Travers' peculiarities and extreme demands (slight spoiler--at one point she says the picture must be made without the color red, or the whole thing is off!), but no, the writing sessions between Travers and Disney's team were recorded on tape, and one such tape is rolled during the credits.

","SAVING MR. BANKS tells the story of when author P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson) went to Hollywood to negotiate with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) about negotiating the film rights to MARY POPPINS. As she negotiates - often fruitlessly - with Disney's creative team, her mind flashes back to her childhood in Australia. Through such flashbacks we learn the extent to which MARY POPPINS is based on her autobiographical experiences. Thompson's performance is a memorable one; her reactions to Disney's idealized world are classic, especially when she repeats the words ""No! No! No!"" in tones that recall Margaret Rutherford. She is also vulnerable in an alien world, which pushes her towards a friendship with her driver Ralph (Paul Giametti). Hanks' Disney comes across as an avuncular personality with a penchant for getting what he wants, but not without a considerable degree of understanding. The portrait is an idealized one (apparently Disney was much more ruthless, and did not really get on with Travers at all), but works well within the overall film. There are sentimental moments, but the ending is particularly affecting, when the film juxtaposes clips from the 1964 version of MARY POPPINS with Travers' and Disney's reaction, as they watch the premiere in Hollywood."

Disney had to get rights from the novels' author, an unpleasant woman named Helen Goff who went by the pen name of PL Travers. Thompson plays Travers as an über-British, frosty, frigid spinster who hated everything about the movie and spread misery around her.<br/><br/>The secondary plot explains why Travers was such a b—tch. She had a traumatic childhood and her alcoholic, banker father died when she was 7. Therefore, the big revelation is that Mary Poppins is not actually about Mary, but about Mr. Banks who stands for Travers's father and get a happy ending instead of dying young. What it is not explained is why a childhood movie is about bankers and why it is titled Mary Poppins, since Mary is actually a secondary character.<br/><br/>Moreover, the revelation about Travers's past does not excuse her. Travers' miserable childhood does not make her more sympathetic. More misery is added by a scene during which Disney trades stories of his own miserable childhood, trying to get Travers on board - or maybe to prove that even an unhappy child can grow into a happy adult...<br/><br/>Disney did not invite her to the premiere of Mary Poppins and I can fully understand his uneasiness about having this controlling and ungrateful woman around, to spread more misery.<br/><br/>The whole story was not worth a movie, especially not a very long one as this.

She is brought in from Engliand and does everything she can to keep from releasing her baby to the movie mogul Disney. But where this turns into a nice film is the back story. There are intermittent flashbacks to her childhood where she doted on her father, an alcoholic and dreamer. He has trouble with the real world and yet must live in it. He caused great pain to his wife and family but can't kick the disease. Mrs. Travers has become cynical and short and unkind over the years because she seems to have some self-loathing. The movie contains one scene after another where the producers and the writers must walk on eggshells around her. She is explosive and angry all the time.

But Honestly, it isn't just about that. Yes, maybe the backdrop is, but Saving Mr. Banks in a subtle way is largely talking about the price an author or for that matter any creative person has to pay in order to bring a masterpiece to life that touches millions. Saving Mr. Banks is very simple in narrative deals. It efficiently depicts the insecurities of the author for whom Mary Popins was not just a book that she created but family. It all justifies her reasons for keeping Disney on hook for 20 years from producing it.<br/><br/>Saving Mr. Banks is largely about a lot of phases from Traver's life condensed into a 2 hr package, gelling up perfectly into a smooth screenplay with a hint of old Hollywood. Backed by a very strong performer Emma Thomson, Saving Mr. Banks has given a vivid picture of PL Travers, reaching the end of Middle age but who is still a hurt little girl by heart. Tom Hanks looks clean in his act, if not memorable. I am surprised the Oscars did not save a nomination seat for Emma Thomson, that is one resentment. Saving Mr. Banks has great comic timing, it is funny and dramatic in the same sequence that makes it realistic enough for the audience. In the end, it is first a movie for creative minds who understand the pain and challenges that inspire their work. It is a movie for people who love biopics, who are ready for unconventional story telling material. It is a great family movie and above all, it is a flick that brings a smile and tear at the same time. GO for it. 3.5/5"

","The cinematic version of story of PL Travers' book-into-film that was to become Walt Disney's Mary Poppins, written by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith and directed by John lee Hancock, is light and fluffy and fun – and a bit too long. It boasts a fine cast and for the most part is credible.<br/><br/>The plot has been described as follows: 'When Walt Disney's daughters begged him to make a movie of their favorite book, P.L. Travers' Mary Poppins (1964), he made them a promise - one that he didn't realize would take 20 years to keep. In his quest to obtain the rights, Walt comes up against a curmudgeonly, uncompromising writer who has absolutely no intention of letting her beloved magical nanny get mauled by the Hollywood machine. But, as the books stop selling and money grows short, Travers reluctantly agrees to go to Los Angeles to hear Disney's plans for the adaptation. For those two short weeks in 1961, Walt Disney pulls out all the stops. Armed with imaginative storyboards and chirpy songs from the talented Sherman brothers, Walt launches an all-out onslaught on P.L. Travers, but the prickly author doesn't budge. He soon begins to watch helplessly as Travers becomes increasingly immovable and the rights begin to move further away from his grasp. It is only when he reaches into his own childhood that Walt discovers the truth about the ghosts that haunt her, and together they set Mary Poppins free to ultimately make one of the most endearing films in cinematic history.'<br/><br/>Emma Thompson offers a fine caricature of PJ Travers, Tom Hanks is Tom Hanks as Walt Disney, but the credits for stunning performances go to Colin Farrell and Ruth Wilson as the parents of Travers as young child. If the rest of the film feels a bit 'pushed' then remember it is about Walt Disney."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","3","14 September 2014"," You can watch this without having watched Mary Poppins
","Just like I did. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" offers an interesting insight into the background story of P.L. Travers, the writer of Mary Poppins and even without having seen the movie or read the books that this is based on, I had a good time watching. Most of it is due to the quality performances of Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks. The supporting cast deserves a mention too, they all did a good job, especially those acting in the years where Travers is grown up. Bradley Whitford really won me over here.<br/><br/>The parts with Travers' years as a child (including Ruth Wilson and Colin Farrell) admittedly did not blow me away that much. The alcoholism part in the center was displayed with precision and it became obvious that young Travers had a very strong connection with her father, but something was missing to greatness. I am not sure if I'd say they could have done completely without it, but on certain parts they could have elaborated more. Still it was already over 2 hours this way. They could have shortened the flashback parts quite considerably and not used them as a major element to her background. As suck, it simply was not elaborated enough.<br/><br/>The storyline including the making of the classic movie ""Mary Poppins"" was very good though. ""Lets go fly a kite"" is stuck in my ears months after having watched this film and I'd have to dig really deep to find something about it that I did not like. Maybe I found it a bit weird that Disney flies to her to England and then not even invites her to the premiere. Quite the contradiction. I am not sure how accurate this is with the real events though. If it was that way, ignore my criticism. The whole Disney in England sequence felt rather dry and I could have done without it. Actually, that part could have been much more emotional. What was very emotional and totally succeeded for me, was the part where she watches the movie and starts crying as the memories from her father all come back to her that very moment.<br/><br/>Even if Emma Thompson missed the Oscar nomination after being nominated for all the precursors, this movie is pretty much her. It is at least as interesting as a making of to ""Mary Poppins"" if there is one. It seems director John Lee Hancock always gets the best of his female protagonists. Not only was ""Saving Mr. Banks"" written by two women with not too much experience at least for wide theater releases, but after all, he managed to turn Sandra Bullock into an Academy Award winner. Thompson's Travers isn't inferior at all to Sandy's portrayal as Leigh Anne Tuohy."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","3","9 August 2014"," Fun little biography, though not without its faults
","The worst and the best parts about Saving Mr. Banks intertwine a great deal. On the other hand, it's a delightful little tale about a woman learning to cope with her past and about the making of one of the best family films of all time. And yet, on the other hand, it looks at the past through rose-tinted glasses, ignores some of the uglier truths about what actually happened and is generally extremely cheesy and sugarcoated.<br/><br/>I'd still claim I liked this film. Emma Thompson makes for such a delightful P.L. Travers that it's hard not to sympathize with her, no matter how despicably awful she acts towards anyone else or no matter how difficult she's being over the smallest of things. Fantastic role performance all around.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is likewise up to the task and wonderful, with perhaps the sole exception of Tom Hanks as Walt Disney. I'm not really sure what doesn't work here, but he seems to be perhaps a touch forced and overly jovial. This is pretty much the first time Walt Disney has ever been depicted on screen by the actual Disney Studios and you can definitely see they're trying to put their best foot forward with Hank's performance. Not that I'm saying the actual Walt Disney wasn't a kind and wonderful man with mountains of imagination and vision to share, but this character doesn't feel rounded enough to be a real person.<br/><br/>And yeah, it's kind of hard to see this movie when you know that the actual P.L. Travers hated the sole film based on her books and wanted nothing to do with Disney ever since. Of course there are some who say she actually grew to like it, and I can't really blame Disney of all studios trying to go with the optimistic version, but there's optimism and then there's naivety. It's really up to each to decide for himself or herself whether they find this twisting of circumstances and facts acceptable.<br/><br/>As a film Saving Mr. Banks is a lot of fun and filled with great role performances, good scenes and excellent storytelling. As a biography it leaves a lot to be desired, but you kind of knew that even without me telling you, didn't you."
"RforFilm","10","1","3","9 June 2014"," A spoonful of sugar indeed! Saving Mr. Banks is a great movie about two creative geniuses.
","I can understand why authors are very protective of their works and characters. To write a good story, one must fully understand who their characters are. Why does Jay Gatsby hold his parties? Why does little Matilda love going to school? Why is Charlotte committed to saving Wilber the pig? All of these characters have long backstories that explain their motivation and how their relationship works with others. A lot of authors will have built up their characters so well that they've become close friends. So if someone calls to say that they want to put their own interpretation on the subject, it can become quite frightening to imagine someone else working on it.<br/><br/>This probably makes it a convenience that most of the writers of the fairy tales that Walt Disney Pictures has produced have long passed on. The company doesn't have to worry about people from estates trying to but in into areas where they have no experience. For the most part, they wouldn't have needed the authors anyway; the movies comes out fantastic. Not all of them are a home run, but Disney has built up it's reputation enough to make anyone trusting enough to let the studio produce their work. Wellalmost everyone; Walt Disney does everything he can to please P.L. Travers in Saving Mr. Banks.<br/><br/>Did you know that Mary Poppins had a really troubling production? Let's take it back before this. Pamela Travers (played by Emma Thompson) was the author of the successful Mary Poppins books. Though they have made her a wealthy woman, her funds are starting to run low, due to her stubborn decision to not write more. She had declined many opportunities to make to the movies with Walt Disney who had wanted the rights since the thirties. In 1961, she finally takes up on the offer to go to Los Angeles to discuss the possibility.<br/><br/>Though she's greeted with a nice driver Ralph (played by Paul Giamatti), sent numerous Disney related gifts, and a promise from Walt (played by Tom Hanks) that the story will be handled well, she's still reluctant to proceed. She finally gives in on the condition that she has final say. Her meetings with the other script writer and musicians Sherman brothers (played by Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak) don't go too well as she seems to say no to everything. As Walt tries everything he can to make her happy, Miss. Travers constantly remembers her days growing up in Australia, and how her relationship with her father (played by Colin Farrell) became the inspiration for the stories.<br/><br/>This is not a movie about Walt Disney. This is a story on P.L. Travers. And just because the Disney Company produced the movie doesn't mean that they will be sugar coating it. This is an honest story on how her unruly attitude had not only made the production on Mary Poppins tough, but had also cost her a chance at having a close family. Emma Thompson nails the part in every direction, making it harder on everyone else to live up to her.<br/><br/>Luckily, the rest of the cast does just as well. Tom Hanks again pulls another great performance as Walt Disney, making him gentle, but a hard worker. Both Schwartzman and Novak are great as musicians who are probably the best in the industry. Even Colin Farrell shows a lot of emotion as P.L. Travers father. The story is edited in a brilliant fashion as Saving Mr. Banks uses the songs from Mary Poppins to cut to the authors past life. This is a true experience that will make you laugh, tear, and ultimately smile.<br/><br/>I'll give this ten spoonful's of sugar out of ten. Saving Mr. Banks is a perfect movie about a relationship between two artistic geniuses. If you have any interest in the Disney Company, Mary Poppins, or simply how literature becomes adapted into film, this is something that you need to see."
"treeline1","Null","1","3","24 April 2014"," Excellent acting but forgettable story
","When the author of ""Mary Poppins"" comes to see Walt Disney about making her books into a movie, we learn a lot about her childhood and the inspirations for her characters. She's a rigid sourpuss, immune to the warmth and charms of Mr. Disney, however, and won't even consider the changes he wants.<br/><br/>The constant flashbacks to P.L. Travers' idyllic-then-tragic childhood are quite interesting (although I still don't understand the title). Tom Hanks is utterly lovable as Disney and plays well against Emma Thompson's brittle, control-freak old maid, Travers. It's fun to see the two pros act together.<br/><br/>There is a lot of trivia for fans of the Mary Poppins movie, but this is actually a very lightweight and inconsequential story, more suited as a ""extra"" on the Mary Poppins DVD, rather than a full-length film. I enjoyed it but have forgotten most of it already."
"Christmas-Reviewer","8","1","3","28 March 2014"," Good but could of been great
","Warning spoilers ahead. This film is good but if they would of rearranged the scenes the film could of been better and had a bigger emotional impact. <br/><br/>When PL goes to the premiere of ""Mary Poppins"" we already know her dad died many years ago. What they should of done was inter cut his ""death scene"" with ""Let's GO Fly a Kite"" sequence when in ""Mary Poppins"". Where in the film ""Mr Banks"" is saved but in real life PL could not save her ""Mr Banks"" <br/><br/>This would of worked much better however it is a still well worth watching. Its not for children. The adult themes are very heavy in this and ""death & suicide attempts"" is something you might not want the under 6 set to see. People with short attention spans will be bored."
"galwaychase","5","1","3","17 March 2014"," Fine example of Hollywood marketing
","I get the sense that some reviewers here can't separate this movie from their nostalgia over Mary Poppins. While it's sensitive look at P.L. Travers somewhat tragic childhood I missed the part where this is a family movie as she segways back and forth between the flashbacks of an alcoholic father who then apparently dies tragically from TB/influenza and dancing penguins ... someone tell me where the wholesome family fun is in that. Disney is portrayed fairly inaccurately as well. In my usual quest of watching Oscar nominated movies I saw this movie and Nebraska within 48 hours of one another. The latter is easily twice the film of the much celebrated fictional glorification of Tom Disney or Walt Hanks (take your pick). Don't get me wrong the film was well done but doesn't live up to the hype and poetic waxing about the 1960's Wonderful World of the Magic Kingdom."
"MartinHafer","8","1","3","9 January 2014"," While not exactly true, it is a smashingly good film.
","Before I go any further in my review, I must point out that the film is NOT a 100% accurate portrait of P.L. Travers or the work they needed to bring Mary Poppins to the screen. It is NOT historically accurate in several instances* but overall it is still a very, very good film. Had the film been a bit closer to the truth, I would have scored it higher, as the retired history teacher within me bristles with the notion of changing a few facts in order to tell a better story.<br/><br/>The film is about the rather difficult time the Disney people had in getting the film ""Mary Poppins"" made. This is because the author was VERY protective of her character and insisted on having full control over just about everything. In some instances this was good but often it seemed that P.L. Travers just wanted to 'win'--such her insistence that the color red not appear in the film! Unreasonable, abrasive and fussy--the film shows the process from start to finish as Walt and his team worked with a very difficult woman to get a classic film made. And, ultimately, it appeared as if the Disney folks just did what they wanted despite her many, many objections (though this is downplayed a bit in the film).<br/><br/>The movie is a wonderful character study and seeing Emma Thompson playing such a strange and emotionally damaged person was fascinating. As for Tom Hanks playing Walt, while his part might seem a lot easier to play (since he was by most accounts human unlike Travers), I appreciated how Disney did NOT make him 100% perfect and sanitized (like many of the books they've produced about the man). In this, he is a bit of a schemer and smokes---making him much more approachable to the average viewer.<br/><br/>In addition, while the film isn't 100% true, it's mostly true and really, really manipulates the viewer (in a positive way). The film, as a result, is quite draining and often sad. My recommendation is that you indeed watch it but have a few Kleenex on hand just in case.<br/><br/>*A few of the 'creative changes' done to the story that differed from reality would include Travers' trip to Disneyland with Walt (which never occurred), Walt's trip to England to persuade her to agree to terms (which never occurred) and Travers loving the film in the end (she STILL hated it and did cry when she saw it at the premier because she hated it so much!!). I know of a few other instances of creative changes but you kind of get the idea. However, overall, the spirit of the film is still pretty close to the true story."
"MovieMatt1","9","1","3","8 January 2014"," Don't Judge By The Trailers
","What a great movie. I was only mildly interested in seeing it when my brother encouraged me to go. The trailers gave it the appearance of a sappy comedy/drama made for kids. I didn't even know it was rated PG-13 until I arrived at the theater. Boy that's not it at all! If this movie failed at anything, it was its advertising. Kids would not relate well to it; it's definitely made for adults. I don't know why the trailers don't reveal more of the true depth of this film, but please don't judge the film based on them alone.<br/><br/>The humor won't have you rolling on the floor, but that's not the point. It provides just the right tone to offset the very sad and dark material of P.L. Travers' childhood. As a child of an alcoholic father myself, I can really relate to P.L. Travers and the scenes involving her father brought back a flood of memories of my own. I haven't cried this much during a movie in years. This movie should evoke emotion from just about anyone, but for those who have experienced an abusive childhood, I think it will be particularly touching. Not many movies express the pains the alcoholism as well as this. I can only hope more will follow.<br/><br/>But what I really loved about this film is that despite the sadness, it has a resounding message of forgiveness and hope. Though we go through incredible pain, we must forgive those who hurt us and move forward towards a better future. Great advice, not only for people who have experienced abuse, but for all people in general.<br/><br/>I hope this movie wins Best Picture at the Academy Awards this year. It is definitely worth your time!"
"Bunuel1976","7","1","3","5 January 2014"," SAVING MR. BANKS (John Lee Hancock, 2013) ***
","Five-time Oscar winner MARY POPPINS (1964) remains Walt Disney's most popular and critically-acclaimed of all his live action films and this latest such entry from the same stable should serve as an eye-opener to its legion of fans on how films were made back in the day and a delightful nostalgia trip for seasoned film buffs. Emma Thompson is perfectly cast as the beloved character's stubborn literary creator P.L. Travers who is ever so reluctant (a 20-year struggle, in fact!) to sell the film rights to animation mogul Disney (Tom Hanks – who despite being 10 years too young for the role – acquits himself well). <br/><br/>The vivid recreation of the Walt Disney Studios and Disneyland and the entertaining tit-for-tat discussions between Travers, co-screenwriter Don DaGradi, songwriters Richard and Robert Sherman and Disney himself are countered (and, ultimately, bogged down) by dismal flashbacks set in the Australian outback in which we see Travers' childhood completely under the influence of her boozing dreamer of a banker father (Colin Farrell) – which is what the odd choice of title for the film itself is all about. The over-reliance on the Musical's admittedly catchy songs does get repetitive after a while and, as expected, a certain amount of whitewashing of the reportedly unsavory main characters was involved. <br/><br/>Having said that, the film's two best sequences for me were when Travers' beleaguered chauffeur (Paul Giamatti) reveals to her that his daily weather reporting to his passenger – which bugged her no end – stemmed from the fact that it affected his ""handicapped"" daughter's mobility; and towards the very end when Disney unexpectedly flies to London (in an 11th hour attempt to get a still defiant Travers to sign) and confesses to her that his own relationship with his newspaper editor father was no less fraught. I also liked the idea that the end credits not only display photographs of the protagonists from the era depicted (which only serves to highlight the fact that none of the actors employed really resemble them!) but the voice of Travers is also heard via recordings she herself insisted upon of the entire consultation process!"
"universaltruth","10","1","3","4 January 2014"," Bravo!
","Wow. Masterfully storytelling of the highest order. I am not a huge Hanks fan, nor a Disney buff but this movie surpassed ALL my expectations. So, the geniuses at Disney not only do Walt proud (as does Hanks...simply outstanding)but they essentially dredge up a movie and story about the process of adapting another story to the screen, and the multi-faceted back stories beneath the surface. They tie it all together so nicely. There is essentially no action, but you are riveted to the screen. Simply outstanding. Acting performances all top notch with special kudos to Paul Giamatti as Ralph the limo driver. IF you like history, film history, Disney, great acting, or just plain good story telling go see this. No bad words, no sex, no real violence...just plain good craftsmanship. Bravo!"
"zurnd","9","1","3","3 January 2014"," An Umbrella Wielding Nanny Goes Up Against A Mouse
","This is a story of a curmudgeon Australian born author bound to keep her story of a magical nanny out of the hands of Hollywood. It's also the story of a man named Walt who was determined to keep a promise to his daughters to turn the curmudgeon author's story into a movie. As Walt tries to persuade the author to hand over the rights to her books, the author keeps telling him that the story of Mary Poppins is not meant to be turned into a motion picture, for it is a story of her life, a story of her childhood and a story about her beloved father, the inspiration for George Banks in her tale. <br/><br/>That's exactly why this film is called Saving Mr. Banks. It's not just about P.L. Travers trying to save her stories from the gloved hands of Mickey Mouse, it's about letting go of the past, learning from it and using it to become the person that you are. This film makes you think of Mary Poppins in an entirely different light. I always liked that the meaning of the 1964 film was about Poppins helping Mr. Banks realize that he didn't need a nanny after all and that he should be the one to guide his children in the right direction, but to see the development, the struggles, the conflicts and the overall madness that occurred to get Mary Poppins made just makes you think to yourself.......We are so lucky that this film exists.<br/><br/>We can see why Travers didn't want her story mauled by the mouse house but at the same time, we can see why Walt Disney wants to turn Travers' beloved tale into a movie. There's no good guy or bad guy, it's just two entirely opposite individuals at entirely opposite ends of the fence. And I just love how Travers and Disney go at each other's throats, I mean they really play off of each other and you can really feel the tension between the two as they try to get their own ways. Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson were spectacular choices to play both Travers and Disney respectively and I think they'd be perfect contenders to receive Oscars.<br/><br/>There's also Dick and Bob Sherman, the songwriting team behind the 1964 classic as well as Paul Giamatti as Ms. Travers' car driver. The relationship between Thompson and Giamatti's characters is another highlight of the film and very heartwarming at times. Colin Farrell is also grand as Travers' father, an alcoholic banker who stills has a heart of gold. I also liked the woman who played the Travers' nanny, the obvious inspiration for Mary Poppins in Pamela's books. <br/><br/>You can also expect to hear a lot of songs from the beloved Disney film such as Feed The Birds and Let's Go Fly A Kite. And I have to admit that at the very end of this film, I got a bit choked up. Not that the ending was necessarily sad and depressing, but because it was bittersweet and changes the very way you look at things. From this day forward, I won't look at Mary Poppins the same way again. Seeing the making of one of my all time favorites has altered my entire view and I can honestly say that I like the film a heck of a lot more now than I did when I was 6 years old. <br/><br/>Saving Mr. Banks is a great film to close out 2013 and a great way to celebrate Mary Poppins' 80th anniversary. It has a tad for everybody, plenty of laughs, cries, and a timeless story about a timeless story. It's simply.....Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.<br/><br/>I don't know if I spelled that right."

","I just saw ""Saving Mr. Banks"" in the theater, and I was quite impressed with this film. The plot is simple: Walt Disney wants to turn the book, 'Mary Poppins', into a movie, but author P.L. Travers is too conditional and reluctant.<br/><br/>The cast was excellent: Tom Hanks was impressive as Walt Disney; Emma Thompson was believable as the annoyingly difficult Mrs. Travers; Colin Farrell did a great job portraying Travers' father during the flashback scenes to P.L. Travers' childhood in Australia.<br/><br/>This movie contained scenes that were amusing, such as when Mr. Disney's staff were creating and practicing the now-familiar songs for the film ""Mary Poppins""; touching, such as when Walt Disney took Mrs. Travers for a tour of the Magic Kingdom in California; and even bittersweet, such as the tender moments between father and daughter during the flashback scenes to P.L. Travers' childhood in Australia.<br/><br/>I remember seeing ""Mary Poppins"" in the theater during my childhood in 1974, and it's always been my favorite live-action Disney movie.

"BrentHankins","8","1","3","20 December 2013"," An interesting backstage story offering a rare glimpse of the man behind the magic.
","Mary Poppins is fondly remembered today as one of Walt Disney's greatest achievements, a timeless classic whose charm and wonder has endured for generations. But long before Julie Andrews and her magic umbrella flew across the silver screen, another tale unfolded behind the scenes, and it's this tale that serves as the basis for Saving Mr. Banks.<br/><br/>Helen Goff grew up in rural Australia, the oldest of three daughters born to a father (Colin Farrell) who frequently eschews the responsibilities of adulthood in favor of imbibing whiskey and conjuring up fantastical stories to entertain his little ones. He instills in Helen a sense of whimsy, insisting that she never allow herself to grow up and become an adult - a sentiment that another classic Disney character might agree with.<br/><br/>Some sixty years later, the imaginative little girl has become celebrated author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson), with nearly all traces of warmth and humor evaporating along the way. Financial ruin looms on the horizon, and Travers is forced to consider an offer from Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) to purchase the film rights to Mary Poppins - a notion Travers has avoided for two decades, horrified by the idea of her creation ""cavorting and twinkling"" in front of audiences.<br/><br/>As Travers spends two weeks in the Disney production studios with screenwriter Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) and composers Richard and Robert Sherman (Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak), her ridiculous list of demands (including her insistence that every conversation and production meeting be recorded) and her complete unwillingness to compromise provide plenty of humorous moments. Indeed, even Disney himself teeters at the edge of exasperation, forced time and again to give up ground in effort to keep the film moving forward.<br/><br/>But as we juxtapose between these scenes and events from the author's childhood, we begin to understand that Travers isn't being difficult just for the sake of being difficult - there's a very personal connection here, and director John Lee Hancock expertly correlates the emotional impact of Travers' experiences with her attachment to the characters she created. There are more than a few moments that will leave audience members misty-eyed, but these moments reveal themselves organically, never coming across as forced or disingenuous.<br/><br/>Thompson is superb as the prim and proper British dame, firing off snappy dialogue laced with sardonic wit, but it's Hanks that truly shines here, capturing Disney's charisma and creativity and reminding us why the studio magnate has remained a beloved, iconic figure in pop culture for so many years. Saving Mr. Banks isn't quite the biopic fans have been clamoring for, but it's a rare glimpse at the man behind the magic - and the woman responsible for one of his most memorable accomplishments.<br/><br/>-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com"
"Robert_duder","9","1","3","17 December 2013"," A sweet story that is truly ""delightful.""
","I read another review that called this movie delightful and I had to repeat it because that is exactly what this is. Its a unique look at one of the most iconic films in history. We all know Mary Poppins but how many of us know anything about where it came from. I'm not even sure I knew it was a book series. The film is fun, touching, sweet, and even moving at times. The dual stories of Walt Disney and ""Mrs. Travers"" and then the story of her growing up in Australia works very well and adds a whole other layer to this film. You wouldn't think a movie like this would have stunning cinematography but it has exactly that when showing the dusty outback. Mary Poppins is one of the most magical, timeless films ever made and this movie captures some of that making it very magical in its own way. It is perfect set in the 60's and literally transports you onto the lot of Walt Disney Studios during that time. It doesn't shove the time period on you but rather subtly immerses you into that era. The story is definitely character driven and the chemistry between our main actors is so important and I think it truly soars. I mean both of them are icons in their own right and together they are perfect for the film.<br/><br/>I am of course referring to Mr. Tom Hanks and the lovely Ms. Emma Thompson in a Golden Globe nominated performance. Hanks is perfect as Walt Disney and I think shares a lot in common with the man. We were blessed this year to have TWO Tom Hanks films from someone I think is probably one of the most talented and gifted actors in Hollywood history. His Walt Disney is electric and charismatic and you love him instantly and I think Hanks is the same way so it was easy for him to do it. Emma Thompson was simply outstanding as the curmudgeonly writer who wants her precious Mary Poppins protected. It is amazing even if this only a small portion of what she was like that the film got made at all. Thompson and Hanks are so good together, their chemistry is near perfect and their banter back and forth just incredibly entertaining. Thompson's off-beat chemistry with everyone in the film is amazing and makes this film a winner. The supporting cast were superb especially the likes of Paul Giamatti (amazingly touching role as a quiet meek limo driver who wins Thompson's friendship), Bradley Whitford, BJ Novak and Jason Schwartzman as the exhausted and often annoyed writers and musicians trying to get the film made. You would be hard pressed to find a more uplifting scene than when Bradley Whitford gets Thompson to dance with him to ""Let's Go Fly a Kite."" Lily Bigham and Kathy Baker were also quite good in very small roles as Disney's secretaries. In the Australian story you have Colin Farrell as the alcoholic, depressed but adoring father of the young Ginty. Farrell's role is heartbreaking and he does a great job with only a few important scenes. Ginty is played by a newcomer by the name of Annie Rose Buckley and this role should firmly have future offers rolling in because she is perfect and does such a great job! Ruth Wilson is decent as Ginty's emotionally distraught mother. She doesn't get a lot of depth to her character but she serves her purpose.<br/><br/>In many ways John Lee Hancock is the perfect director for this. Saving Mr. Banks has a similar emotional depth to his previous hit The Blind Side. He has a knack for bringing true to life stories to the big screen. There is just something you connect to with these people and Tom Hanks makes you feel like you're experiencing being in the presence of Walt Disney. Its the little things like his personality, the quirk of him hiding his smoking in his office and the sheer look of joy on his face when he is waiting at Disneyworld with his arms open wide. Everything about this film is feel good even the dark scenes you know there is a light behind it all. An absolute must see and a Disney classic in its own right. Bravo. 9/10"

","A+! Wish I could give it more than a 10! Let's start with Emma Thompson's tour-de-force comedy performance as Mrs. Travers. I think this is the best work she has done since ""Howard's End"", and she has been wonderful in so many movies and television projects since then; she hits every right note! I hope the Academy has the good sense to nominate her for Best Actress (Cate Blanchett, Judi Dench, Meryl Streep, Emma Thompson and one other actress TBD, as far as I'm concerned).<br/><br/>Colin Farrell is brilliant as Travers Goff, Helen's (Pamela's) alcoholic father, who works at a bank in the Australian outback. The Australian scenes were strange to me at first, but grew on me, and made sense by the end of the picture just fine. The camera work is absolutely astounding! The little girl is terrific, and so is everyone else in the flashback scenes. The costumes, sets, writing...everything is brilliant! Tom Hanks is terrific in a supporting performance as Walt Disney. He doesn't sound or look all that much like the real Walt but he is still quite good. His long speech at the end works effectively.<br/><br/>Paul Giammatti plays Ralph, Mrs. Travers Hollywood driver during her stay there working on the screenplay with the Disney team. He was quite touching. He's an actor I don't usually like but I like his work here.<br/><br/>The use of the music from Mary Poppins, the actual scenes from the movie, the film editing...everything works! (: John Lee Hancock deserves an Oscar nomination as Best Director - doubt he will get one, since he isn't well known, but he deserves one for the fluidity of the scenes, the meshing of the different components, and the fact that the film is a drama and yet has a comedic masterpiece of acting at it's center.<br/><br/>I loved everything about this movie! A+!!!!"
"Amari-Sali","8","1","3","14 December 2013"," Saving Mr. Banks is a tear jerker dealing with one man's promise to his daughters and one woman's grief over her father.
","Being someone who has liked Emma Thompson since seeing Wit and Love Actually, I found it hard to not look forward to the film. And then when you add Tom Hanks and the story of the making of Mary Poppins, it is hard not to get excited. But, the best part though is, unlike last year's Hitchcock, as much as you get a story about the creator, there is a proper focus on the making of the film. Well, rather the writing part of it.<br/><br/>Characters & Story <br/><br/>The story focuses on Pamela Travers (played by Emma Thompson), the writer of Mary Poppins, the book. She has the personality of an English school teacher whose students would call her a spinster and fellow teachers a hard ass. But, while presented as a highly sarcastic woman, we also see in her younger self (played by Annie Rose Buckley) a child who saw the downfall of her family, including her father. <br/><br/>But, from that terrible time in Pamela's life came the inspiration for Mary Poppins, a tale about a woman who may not have saved her from what was going on, but did so much for her life that now she is almost like what a stuffed animal would be for a child. However, with the book published to the world, now one Walt Disney (played by Tom Hanks) wishes to take that story, put it to film, add music and even a touch of animation, most of which is loathsome to Pamela. <br/><br/>However, with money low and Travers growing tired of Disney's 20 year pursuit, she does everything she can to convince him to break his promise to his girls, and as she goes through the motions she reflects on what inspired Mary Poppins. Be it her father (played by Colin Farrell) or her aunt Ellie (played by Rachel Griffiths), we see what trauma and difficulties that led to the iconic character.<br/><br/>Praise <br/><br/>When it comes to praise, the first thing I must note is that the story mixes the pre-production part of making the movie Mary Poppins well with establishing what inspired the book. This is thanks to a combination of Buckley and Farrell setting up the type of foundation which allows you to eventually emotionally connect to Thompson as the adult version of Pamela Travers. You see, the flashbacks to Pamela's childhood often are used to explain different parts of the movie, so when it comes to certain aspects, like Mr. Banks being a banker like her dad, this triggers something in her which leads her to reminisce to scenes which often begin to make you feel empathy for the often polarizing Pamela.<br/><br/>Also, I feel there is a need to praise the fact almost every main character is written with their own life, even if they aren't a recognizable name. For example, we know who Walt Disney is, as well as Pamela Travers because they are the two title characters, but even someone like Paul Giamatti's character Ralph is given a back-story by being the father to a girl in a wheelchair. And with that, you feel that you are getting a somewhat true slice of what was going on during the times. Which, by the way, during the credits they show pictures of Walt and Pamela, as well as feature a recording session when Pamela was meeting with the writers about the script.<br/><br/>Criticism <br/><br/>Now, when it comes to critiquing the film, perhaps the only thing worth critiquing is that sometimes I did feel like I wanted to learn more about Walt Disney than Pamela Travers. The reason I say this is mostly because Tom Hanks does seem to, at times, steal a scene or two to the point it does make you imagine what a Walt Disney biopic would look like. Then, to add onto that, though probably fitting for the times, you do get the slightest hint of sexism every now and then. Not strong enough to cause an uproar, but enough, even from Walt Disney, to make you raise an eyebrow.<br/><br/>Overall: Worth Seeing <br/><br/>It is rare for me to see a film and want to read the source material after. However, after seeing Saving Mr. Banks I do feel the desire to read the original book, and watch the Julie Andrews movie in order to fully understand how many of her complaints made sense. Outside of that, I do feel this is a movie worth seeing because every bit of the movie plays up the actors strengths, and backs it up with good writing. Thompson plays Pamela Travers, as a misunderstood woman who hasn't much but her literary classic, so well that, with Annie Rose Buckley's help, she pulls off a wonderful performance; Tom Hanks, as always, is a likable fellow who plays a good supporting role in the film; and it is hard to say that one character wasn't treated like they were a human being, even if we didn't get a full story on their life. Hence why I am saying it is worth watching. There is nothing really bad about it, and if anything it develops hope to see more about those who took in Disney films, as well as seeing, eventually, a Walt Disney biopic."
"Marc_Israel_365","8","2","10","24 November 2013"," An adorable film about unadorable characters
","When a movie tells a behind the scenes story, there is inherent excitement about finding out ""the truth"". Saving Mr. Banks is all about this and yet there is a definite journey and process to vet this out both in the story and in story telling. The journey here is both thematic and touching and will stay with you after you see the movie. There is a lots of humor (love the behind the creative screen writing/pitching schmaltz) and drama (mostly in our writers childhood flashbacks), but it is the quiet mix that blends the P.L Travers character (Emma Thompson) and Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) that is at the heart of the movie experience. Both are a bit over-honed in on one each of their characters' element: Thompson with the nervous nit-picking and Hanks with his Father Flanagan appeal. In reality, showing the Marry Poppins author as more secretive and Disney as more self absorbed before their resolution could have certainly added more drama but lessened any child appeal... and a movie about Disney, even if not a Disney film, has to appeal to our littles, so I'll cede to the masses."
"mrtank74","8","1","4","8 March 2014"," Tom and Emma get good marks
","This was not my kind of movie, but as a married man of many years you have to let your wife pick a movie to watch before you choose yours. My Wife chose Saving Mr. Banks, I got 2 hours of silence from her, and nearly a teardrop every now and then. I watched Mary Poppins when I was a youngster and thought it was crap. That has nothing to do with Dick Van Dyke and his accent, I was a teenager before film critics lamented on how bad it was that I realized, he was an American doing a cockney accent. As a child you do not understand dialects, only language. you either understand what someone says or you do not. Saving Mr Banks, kept my wife amused for the whole movie as she really enjoyed it, as for myself I too was quiet all through the movie, I kept my mouth shut and just watched a good movie with some very good performances, by the cast.

","This movie is fantastic. One of the best dramas I've seen this year. Tom Hanks portrays a wonderful Walt Disney along with an award winning performance by Emma Thompson. They are both superb in this and deliver very memorable performances. The film itself just oozes classic in every way and should simply be listed as a must see film for every person that watches mary poppins or wants to. The film very powerfully creeps its way into your emotions making tears an inevitability as well as childhood flashbacks. I honestly missed my mother watching this because I grew up on mary poppins.

","Spoiler Alert: Enjoy the movie first fig you don't want to be sullied by another's opinion. <br/><br/>Supposedly there are some scenes in this movie that are not factual but it makes no difference. Emma Thompson as Mrs. Travers, author of Mary Poppins, is a once in a lifetime role. She's believable, mercurial and develops the character in such a professional way that her performance is seamless. The last time an actress did so well with a character was Meryl Streep's portrayal of Julia Child. Work like Thompson's make sitting though ""Percy Jackson"" and ""Gravity"" worth the wait. <br/><br/>This movie is simply great. The script is enlightening with just enough inside baseball to satisfy the cognizant without offending those who miss the jokes. John Lee Hancock's direction of all the principals was masterful. The movie felt like 1960's LA and both costuming and production design were excellent. <br/><br/>Hanks is Hanks. It hard for him to clam a role. But compared to Thompson, he's a little wooden. Even in scenes where he was trying to convince Travers to come back to LA after she had bolted back to England over script conflicts and trust him with the movie there was a lack of sincerity. Hanks missed the boat. Also, Disney, for all his flaws, had a spark and childlike enthusiasm. Hanks missed both or possibly just didn't deliver them in a way that would communicate. <br/><br/>The Sherman brothers were cartoonish dull but that's to be expected. They played well and were believable. Bradly Whitford as DaGradi was a standout. His frustrations and his overcoming of the same was a real high point. It was fun to watch him work through a bunch of conflicting emotions to ""sell"" musical concepts to Travers. <br/><br/>This is more than a story about the making of a movie. It is the story of a woman dealing with real-life demons and overcoming the same. Bullock tried this in ""Gravity"" with no success. Here Thompson delivers in a way that brings a tear to all but the most cynical and unfeeling. Her scene during the premiere reminds one of Glenn Closes makeup removal scene in ""Dangerous Liaisons."" This is powerful, meaningful acting that is a delight to see. If only there were more roles written for mature actresses we might be in for some real treats. <br/><br/>Paul Giamatti stayed in character as Traver's driver and his story about a crippled daughter was delivered with confidence and structure. It was believable. But he has long since proved a talented actor capable of any number of roles. Disney's secretaries both delivered stellar performances. They deadpanned through scenes and added just the right amount of secretarial oversight and tension. <br/><br/>M10. If you see nothing else, see this movie!"

"GoUSN","9","1","4","28 December 2013"," A triumph
","This was a nearly perfect film - in the same way that The King's Speech and The Artist were nearly perfect films: drawn with an eye for cues large and small, in touch with its audience, and a pitch-perfect treatment of the material. There is no missed opportunity here, no overacting, no underacting - we were led into the world of this film, there to come to know and care about its players.<br/><br/>This is a documentary played for drama and comedy. We get pulled in to the early small and large concepts that eventually made the film Mary Poppins great - the wry look, the sly look, the pencil captures, the effect of music, all perfectly blended.<br/><br/>While I did deduct a star for Ms. Travers' loving and conciliatory embrace of a Mickey Mouse plush toy, I did that more to be a realist: I mean, nothing's really ""perfect"", is it? As to objections you may have read about, disregard: --""not all details were precisely true"" - In reducing weeks and years of many human lives to two hours, creative license has to be deployed to make sure the narrative holds together. The near-perfection of this narrative demonstrates that creative license was well used.<br/><br/>--""Tom Hanks didn't get Disney's accent right"" - Walt Disney had an accent? I think of the many legacies Walt left us, memory of an accent is not one of them. Next.<br/><br/>--""Some of the plush toys depicted were not actually Disney's under license yet."" We did not go to see this movie to keep track of plush toy licensing rights.<br/><br/>--""P.L. Travers had a vision of Mary Poppins and Disney wrecked it."" Had Disney not ""wrecked it,"" P. L. Travers, Mary Poppins, Mrs. Travers' deep love for her flawed father would all now have been forgotten, entirely off our radar. Disney made immortal what Mrs. Travers most loved, something that would never have happened had Mrs. Travers not signed over the rights.<br/><br/>--""The title should have mentioned Mary Poppins and Walt Disney, otherwise people don't know what it's about and box office will suffer."" Yes, and can you imagine the reaction of those people showing up and complaining that they thought this was going to be ""just like Mary Poppins""? Nine stars. Brilliant. Simply brilliant film-making."

","First, and many people never learn this,virtually everything produced by Hollywood,based on fact, eventually becomes fiction due to rewrite after rewrite. That's why there's controversy over the validity of the story.<br/><br/>Saying this, Saving Mr.Banks is a great way to see two moving performances, that of Emma Thompson and Colin Farrell. Thompson's portrayal of P.J. Travers, the author of Mary Poppins, is wonderful, and I'm speaking as an American married to just such a proper English woman,who in travers case was actually Australian.<br/><br/>And Farrell as her father once again show his enormous range as an actor in an underplayed sensitive role.<br/><br/>Quite honestly, at first notice you might not even care about the story of Mary Poppins being made into a film.

","Saving Mr. Banks follows author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson), author of Mary Poppins to Los Angeles where she meets with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks), regarding the rights of turning her story into a film. During her journey, she tackles the obstacles of how her vision will be handed to someone else, as well as obstacles from her past.<br/><br/>Director John Lee Hancock showed his inspiring and sentimental side when he directed the 2009 hit The Blind Side, he returns with this light-hearted but very deep film. We follow Travers as she leaves the luxury of her London home to sunny California where she is shown a whole new world. Travers begins as an almost cold and bitter woman, but as the story develops we see her character arc begin to form. The story itself can at time be very light-hearted and funny, but it can quickly shift gears into such a serious and dark territory before you can say ""supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"". The light-hearted aspects basically occur whenever Disney himself is on-screen and when the well-known moments and beloved songs from Mary Poppins are being introduced to Travers by the writer and the song writers and lyricist. The darker aspects of the story show us some of the inspiration for the story and why Travers is the way she is and why she feels how she feels. While it's an excellent story, its light-heartedness makes it appear so much like a family film, especially with Mary Poppins and Walt Disney being key figures. However, this is not a family film at all. The dark and serious aspects outweigh all of its happy moments.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson gives a marvelous performance as our leading lady. She provides a lot of the comic relief as the blunt, strong-willed, and opinionated P.L. Travers. But during the moments where she remembers her past, Thompson can quickly show the emotional side of the character as well as she can the comical sideflawlessly. Providing the happiness and light- heartedness of the story is Tom Hanks as the famous Walt Disney. He portrays Disney so perfectly with his optimistic, child at heart personality, and then we see him the serious side of Disney that we have never seen before. It definitely makes for another amazing performance by Hanks this year.<br/><br/>Saving Mr. Banks is a fine dramedy that provides laughs and charm but also deals with very serious issues that don't work for families to see. But don't let that prevent you from going out and seeing this yourself. On top of a great story, you have Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks giving two of the best performances of the year.<br/><br/>My Rating: 9/10"

Along the way, Emma Thompson gives one of her best performances as the very complex Mrs. P.L. Travers, the Australian woman who wrote the Mary Poppins books. As she fights to preserve her idea of her character, and the backstory behind it that the Disney staff only slowly starts to perceive, we watch her come to terms with her childhood demons. Two of the final scenes, the one between Disney and Travers in London, and then the premiere of the movie, when Travers watches her childhood story come to life on the screen, are the highlights of a movie that has no low lights.<br/><br/>Excess sentimentality, which could have been so easily exploited, is always avoided.<br/><br/>It doesn't matter whether or not you saw the ""Mary Poppins"" movie or read P.L.

","I saw this film twice the week it came out. It is magical and glorious. It made me feel so good I had to see it again to figure out why.<br/><br/>""12 Years A Slave"" and ""Philomena"" are incredibly wonderful films which I regard as must-sees, but ""Saving Mr. Banks"" hit me in a way that I almost think was religious. The impact of the film is encapsulated in an amazing scene near the end of the film in which Walt Disney tells Pamela Travers why Mary Poppins is so important to him. I don't want to say more or it would be a spoiler, but watch for that scene and don't get up to go to the toilet then!! It is so beautiful.<br/><br/>There is a great deal of humor in the film, much of it due to Pamela Travers' eccentricities, but we see very serious flashbacks throughout the film which help us to understand why the Mary Poppins stories were so important to Travers. Colin Farrell does an Oscar-worthy job of portraying the father in those flashbacks.<br/><br/>Yes, they changed the true story a bit to make this movie. Apparently Disney and Travers never went to Disneyland together and certain other details were changed. But a lot of it is very real, and they used tapes of meetings between Travers and the Disney folks to recreate some key conversations. At the end of the movie, as the credits roll, they actually play one of those real tapes, so you can see that what you just saw was not unlike the reality of those meetings. I have read a great deal about the making of this film and P.L. Travers and I am impressed with the trouble they went to to make this film. Travers was far too complex to portray her thoroughly in this film, and I forgive the filmmakers for changing certain details. The end result here is far more beautiful than a straight, 100% true bio-pic would be.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson, Tom Hanks, Paul Giamatti, Jason Schwartzman, B.J.

","Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) usually gets what he wants. But, a promise he made to his daughters twenty years ago, to bring the novel Mary Poppins to the screen, has been a big thorn in his side. No matter how he has approached or wooed the author, Brit P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) she has refused to sign over the rights. But, things change. Her money is running out and she does love her beautiful house and amenities. Therefore, this crabby lady finally agrees to come to Los Angeles and meet with Disney himself. When she arrives, she is met by a very personal limo driver (Paul Giamatti) but she shows him no warmth. Nor does the hotel room, filled with Disney stuffed animals, change her attitude. Most of the creatures go in a closet, while Mickey Mouse has to sit in the corner. At the studio, the celebrated composers Richard (Jason Schwartzman) and Robert Sherman are targets of her unpleasantness, as are all of the other staff members. Just why is this dame so contrary, when everyone is rolling out the bright red carpet? In flashback, the viewer learns of her difficult, unstable childhood in Australia. Especially sad is her relationship with her father, Travers Goff (Colin Farrell), who sparked her imagination, when he wasn't drinking and losing jobs. In addition, he dies young and the children are subjected to stuffy Aunt Ellie (Rachel Griffiths). What will it take to please Miss Travers and get her name on the dotted line? For all movie fans who love the terrific Disney classic, Mary Poppins, here is the tale of how it almost never got made! Ms. Travers was one witch-on-wheels whose demands were only exceeded by her horrible disposition. Yes, she had a difficult childhood, which explains but does not excuse her perpetual coldness. Only Emma Thompson could bring her to life with some small saving graces. The rest of the cast, too, is superb, with Hanks, Griffiths, Giamatti, Schwartzman, and company doing a fantastic job. Especially noteworthy is Farrell; never has he been so touching or polished. The sets, from Down Under to sunny California, are also great, as are the costumes, well conceived script and confident direction. The meaning of the title is realized slowly but is memorable. All in all, don't save a showing of this movie for a rainy day. See it before the wind changes indeed."

"omayfield","10","1","4","25 December 2013"," tell me about human life, i would really like to know
","I am dazzled by this type of film, because it is about real life. I don't know real life. I couldn't tell you where I, for instance, am exactly, what I am feeling or how I got here. I couldn't distill myself or any of my history into an explainable and recognizable plot. But that is exactly what the makers of this movie and presumably the biographical book it is based on have done. The people seem real, the layers of each others lives fit and adjust and make room for each other. And we are given a God's eye view of the otherwise unknowable human stage. How accurate this method of distillation is is hard to say. Certainly there are limitations. At the end we are shown the real person's photos and we are startled to see how little they actually resemble the actors with whom we have just so intimately met, lived and breathed. Movie stars are very pretty after all, and we are not. We resent the real people a little for daring to step on our dearly acquired representations of them. Much of what happened here was taped, and yet the tapes don't quite feel exactly true to the movie, or is it the other way around? We have films about Lincoln, about Kennedy, and a thousand others and yet we don't really know those human beings. Not really. A painting is flat and still, dry pigment on stiff canvas, and no amount of genius or craft can make it more than that, no matter how much the image startles or moves us. The representation of the thing is never the thing itself, ""Dont eat the menu"" as Alan Watts used to say. Having said all that and therefore distanced myself perhaps too much from my admiration for this film, all I have left to say is that to do this kind of art, to take real people and to introduce us to them with dignity, empathy and insight and whatever accuracy the material allows, is a monumental achievement. I write, and everything I write is fantasy whether I want it to be or not. I make people and things up. To do the other thing, to make sense and beauty of what is always experienced as an opaque and chaotic reality as we live it, that is truly wonderful. This is a great film."

"FilmMuscle","8","1","4","23 December 2013"," Mr. Disney, Is That Really You?
","Wait, what? Disney is making a film about Walt Disney? This surely can't be good or genuine. Fortunately, I was proved wrong because even for those who're desperately attempting to discover some substantial flaw, the movie quickly wins you over. Saving Mr. Banks essentially covers the real-life accounts of Disney's and P.L. Travers' (the author of Mary Poppins) relationship. By the time of the early 1960's, Walt Disney had already become the greatest of moguls in Hollywood and his vast empire had already been established. In sum, he was largely successful- living the dream- but one astronomical desire plagued his mind: the wish to capture one of his favorite books (Mary Poppins) on the big screen in typical, magical Disney fashion. However, Travers wasn't exactly the friendliest and easiest individual to work with, fretting over every single detail of life. Once her agent and Walt Disney Pictures finally convinces her to take a flight to LA and sign on for the project, firstly ensuring her significant control behind the production, the true issue emerges: how will the picture come to be when you have two powerful storytellers vying with their own visions? Throughout the narrative, we alternate between the present and Travers' past in which she grows up in Australia with a troubled family that are forced to deal with life-threatening difficulties. <br/><br/>Basically, we're allowed the room to breath and laugh for a certain amount of time, and then, we're relocated to the tear-jerking story of her past, and it switches back and forth from thereon. This institutes a welcoming balance between raw emotion (I could honestly feel the tears lingering in my eyes, waiting to descend) and fun/hilarity. Using the sheer feistiness of Emma Thompson's character (Travers), we're met with plenty of hysterical scenes in which she struggles to adapt to an environment she's not exactly fond of. A significant factor behind the amusement- aside from its utter joviality- to be had with this film are the mesmerizing performances. Emma Thompson is exceptional and will undoubtedly be one of my nominees for Best Actress this year when considering her ability to convincingly pull off a truculent role, being exposed to various circumstances as we observe the genuine reactions. Colin Farrell portrays her alcoholic and deeply distressed father whenever we encounter yet another flashback. Needless to say, his performance definitely deserves recognition; in fact, Farrell and Thompson persistently compete with one another as I found both renditions highly remarkable. Rarely do I witness Farrell take on such a dramatic and mentally taxing role, and he fully delivers in this case. And, of course, we have everyone's favorite, Tom Hanks, who depicts Walt Disney in all his larger-than-life stature. <br/><br/>Quite interestingly, the premise sees a rare storyteller (who still possesses artistic integrity and a strong will in what the next step is) face off against a standard businessman who is looking to persuade and reap profits. Here is ultimately where my issue lies: it seems like an overly positive and safe representation of the Walt Disney who (reportedly) infamously supported the Nazi's, carried a sexist mentality, and so on. That's particularly why I was bothered by Disney Pictures' involvement in this cinematic piece since- no matter what- they'd most absolutely downplay any negative characteristics of Walt Disney. With the story's progression, we never caught any hints of his greed (any instances were played off as light jokes), aggressive ambition for seizing his goals, etc. No, apparently, Walt Disney was thoughtful, kind, and joyous. <br/><br/>As we continue along with this sensational tale, a terrific soundtrack, brought to you by the amazing Thomas Newman's talent and vigor, complements the varying emotion we encounter therein; sometimes lively and gleeful- effectively capturing the alluring atmosphere- and sometimes tragic and melancholy- focusing on the troublous life her younger self led- (what Newman does best as can be proved by the likes of Road to Perdition, The Green Mile, American Beauty, etc.). With that being said, some of the tracks feel slightly too similar to The Newsroom's theme song. From time to time, Newman enjoys repeating himself, but it's still beauty to one's ears, regardless. <br/><br/>While we're on the subject of Travers' childhood, I found the whole ""flashback"" storyline more intriguing than the main one with the plot's advancement. There was just so much more transpiring in history- dramatic, surprising- while the present merely concentrated on Travers' predictable development as a human being. This being a Disney movie at the end of the day, to no surprise, the story loses a fair share of cynicism towards the end, and the last half an hour just feels too ""Disney-like,"" which is jarring when regarding the more authentic feel of the first half. In a predictable manner, Travers loses that fiery flare, and a sense of sentimentality suddenly invades the story. All in all, there's no doubt that I immensely enjoyed Saving Mr. Banks, and the time of year is certainly fitting for such a pleasurable and humorous experience. There's too much likability within for me to expect any probable disappointment, and thus, I enthusiastically recommend this magical picture to everyone."

"jboothmillard","10","1","6","30 December 2013"," Saving Mr. Banks
","Mary Poppins is one of my favourite Disney films of all time, and when I heard that the studio were making a film about how it came to be, I was very much intrigued, not just by the good casting but the highly positive reviews definitely grabbed me, from director John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side). Basically, set in 1961, Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) has been wanting to make a movie based on the popular Mary Poppins novels by British author Pamela 'P.L.' Travers (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Emma Thompson), she has refused for the last twenty years to agree to him obtaining the rights, it is only because of her lack of book sales and money running out that she is reluctantly going to Los Angeles to meet the filmmaker in person. She has no intention of accepting her magical nanny books becoming films unless she is assured that it will not be mauled by the Hollywood machine, she especially dislikes the idea of Disney creating an animated or musical adaptation, and she signs a contract that promises this will not all happen, but Walt, his scriptwriters and composers are pulling out all the stops to make her happy to accept the deal. In the two weeks she spends at the Disney studios, and driven around some places by her cheerful driver Ralph (Paul Giamatti), Pamela is shown imaginative storyboards and sketches for costumes and sets, and the talented Sherman brothers, Richard (Jason Schwartzman) and Robert (B.J. Novak), have many chirpy and enjoyable songs written, but it seems no matter what she will not be satisfied by any of these ideas. Pamela, while going through this creativity process, is being reminded of her childhood in 1906, when she grew up Queensland, Australia, and through flashbacks we see her as a little girl, real name Ginty (Annie Rose Buckley), with her siblings having many happy times with her delightful father Travers Goff (Colin Farrell), but of course she and her mother Margaret Goff (Ruth Wilson) know that he is slowly descending into depression and alcoholism, and of course it comes to the point where his addiction is killing him. Walt is surprised to see the small moments when Pamela may be being swayed by the magic of what the Mary Poppins film could become, especially by the wonderful songs from the Sherman brothers, and a short visit to Disneyland, Walt himself becomes highly excited that the deal may happen after all, but then with the mention of animation in the film, i.e. penguins, she is very angry and returns to London, England with the deal broken. Some time later Walt surprises Pamela at her house and reemphasises why the film means so much to him and his daughter, she is eventually swayed again, having been enchanted by the progress they have made, and Disney understanding how much the father Mr. Banks is a key element to the overall story, and after returning to America a few months pass, and in 1964 the movie Mary Poppins is ready. Pamela is not informed on an invitation to the world premiere, so she heads back to Hollywood herself and is ready to see the finished movie at the Graumans Chinese Theater, she looks around to see all of the audience laughing, singing along and having good fun, and she is moved to tears seeing David Tomlinson as Mr. Banks having bad luck, but in the end it is happy, Walt is happy to she that she cannot help but singalong with a song she joined in with earlier. The final shots of the film are photographs of the real Walt Disney and P.L. Travers during the making of the film Mary Poppins, and there is also the real tape recordings of them and the filmmakers during the script read through meetings. Also starring The Cabin in the Woods' Bradley Whitford as Don DaGradi, Kathy Baker as Tommie and Rachel Griffiths as Aunt Ellie. Thompson is fantastic playing the mostly cranky but slowly turned woman whose stories obviously mean a great deal to her, Hanks is equally fantastic as the most famous animation genius who is determined to create the film as the stories mean a lot to him too, the film is filled with both funny and highly moving sequences, mixing the lead female character's troubled past and the creation of one of the most treasured films of Disney, the best scene is definitely Travers moved and singing along (as I did) to ""Let's Go Fly a Kite"", this film definitely makes you think differently when you next watch Mary Poppins itself, a brilliantly enjoyable drama based on a true story. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Thomas Newman, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer for Kelly Marcel and Best Costume Design. Outstanding!"
"currywh1998","6","1","6","28 December 2013"," A ""Disnified"" Disney Movie About Disney
","""Saving Mr. Banks"" is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. The acting is superb and the writing witty, simultaneous with the nostalgia of Mary Poppins. However, the execution is choppy and the presentation cheesy. This movie has no idea of what it wants to be. At some points, the main characters are caught in moral dilemmas, creating tension that never quite hits its mark due to the tone of the film. In other moments, the characters are dancing and singing when a parallel to the childhood of P.L. Travers is shown. Nearly everything that happens in the movie has a parallel to P.L. Travers childhood. This is frustrating, as there is no typical banter between characters, making them far less relatable. Even in the scenes of drama and intensity, the corny music cues and somewhat mars it. Hanks portrays Disney without representing Disney, while Thompson does an excellent job as P.L. Travers. Tom Hanks could've done a fantastic job, had he been given more screen time, as he only has about half and hour. As for the good, Colin Farrell plays the father of P.L. Travers very well, he is convincing and you can tell that he played a large role in the development of P.L. Travers' character and the way that she carries her life (not to forget Mary Poppins) . The parts of the movie containing his character were by far the best and most emotionally touching. When you leave the theater, you will likely like some of it and not other parts, as I did. The movie loses much of its potency when you discover some of its inaccuracies in the way the story is presented. In conclusion, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a feel-good movie, not one that you go to in search of understanding or artistry. It's an enjoyable movie, but not one with resonance. 6/10"

","Here comes the story of the mysterious lady behind ""Mary Poppins"", and it's a very interesting one. Emma Thompson brings to life the cantankerous author who has a few personal issues with transferring the rights of his precious creation to Disney and Company. She's concerned she will trivialize the material and not honor her heroine properly.<br/><br/>Most of the film is entertaining while showing us the interaction between Travers and Disney and his associates. In fact, had the film been this way 90% of the time, we would have a classic. Instead, it swings back and forth between the negotiations, pre production of the film, and Traver's reactions to the relatively vapid California culture, and the revelations of what happened in her early years in Australia. It is clear she is not able to enjoy or consider variations from her fixed perspectives.<br/><br/>Eventually, the mystery is resolved. Travers and Disney reach a compromise of sorts. He gets his hands on the books, makes his movie, and has a huge critical and commercial hit. Travers is able to experience some sort of cathartic moment, yet it is clear that not everything was up to her standards because there were some artistic choices she deemed not fitting.<br/><br/>Emma's Travers is very good portraying a woman who has a difficult time adjusting, but she is able to show her slow transformation from a rigid spinster to a woman who is capable of understanding how others view her creation and don't mean to disrespect her or her sources. Clearly, she, little by little, becomes a fan of the songwriters, and once she is outside the entertainment world, she is able to connect with her driver because they can relate to some of the same material.<br/><br/>The film is lovingly produced, and as I said before it's best when showing the production of the movie. There are problems with the childhood scenes, mostly because most of the incidents are not clearly defined, and the dialogue is at least vague. Colin Farrell does a very good job as the guilt-ridden father, and Rachael Griffith makes quite an impression as the prototype for the strict but caring nanny. The jewel in the crown is Thompson who is able to earn our sympathy as the can't help but her express her very frank views about a world she thinks is nothing more than thinly disguised parade of illusions with no much essence or heart."

","When you want to bring to life a book to screen can be such a challenging journey. Yet this is exactly what Walt Disney had achieved. This is a story of such passion and commitment that this brings out and as the author was in no doubt reliving her childhood memories touches your very emotions to the core. Sometimes we hold onto grief believing we are doing the right thing for the ones we lost along the way. But just as Walt Disney could see in this great story he wanted to pass on something that is more valuable than the physical e.g the book or movie it was hope based on imagination. This was a sad story but he knew it could be told which compassion and fellow feeling that could touch all of us. We all would like to tell our story and perhaps fabricate the ending so that all of us can come to terms with our loses that happen to us along our life's journey. This gives us time to reflect on our own past experiences and to reconcile with them. Great job!"

","Walt Disney's daughters begged him to make a movie of their favourite book, P.L.

But, as the money grows short, Travers reluctantly agrees to meet and hear Disney's plans for the adaptation. <br/><br/>Walt pulls out all the stops. Armed with imaginative storyboards and songs, he launches an onslaught on P.L. Travers, but she doesn't budge. <br/><br/>But Walt discovers the truth about Mary Poppins, and together they set her free.....<br/><br/>Brilliant is one word to describe this movie, and it's all thanks to Thompson. Her portrayal of Travers is wonderfully complex. At once, you see a meddling Battleaxe, but at the same time, you see a child begging to come to the surface, and you cannot help but like her, despite her little outbursts.<br/><br/>Hanks knows he's not going to outshine Thompson, so he is wonderfully restraint as the big man, and it's to his credit, he's a joy to watch too.<br/><br/>Its funny and equally heartbreaking in parts, and the best parts of the film are set in Austrailia, these set the foundations of the narrative, and really add gravitas to the Disney scenes, honestly, this is Farrell's career best performance, even if he does seem to be channelling Johnny Depp on occasion.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Mary Poppins, this is a must, and if your not, it's still a fascinating insight into one woman's love of her work, and how much it means to her."

","This is a factual story that fits where it touches. In reality, after an initial meeting in which he realized that Pamela Travers was intractable, Walt Disney walked away and left the Sherman brothers to negotiate the rights to the novel, so thanks, Sherman, with your input the film got made. Before we start tossing bouquets in Disney's lap we should remember who actually made this movie. Clue: It wasn't P.L. Travers Studios. As a fiftieth celebration of the movie Mary Poppins it's also a neat PR job on Walt Disney portraying him as a benign uncle who wouldn't say moo to a cow which, if true, would make him the only movie mogul who went from not having change of a match to running his own studio simply by being a nice guy - you know, the ones who finish last. Of course Travers herself was not exactly Mary Pickford so in reality you had two egotists going to the mat. On the other hand the Disney studio does know how to turn out fodder that pleases the masses and that is what they have done here and if you check your brain in the cloakroom chances are you'll get a great bang out of this."

It has made me revisit Mary Poppins and see it in a new light. Saving Mr Banks is a great film that has been put together really well (what would you expect; a Disney film about Disney).

He simply leaned on his already successful career rather than try to act in this movie.
Hanks is a movie star, but he shows here he cannot act.<br/><br/>The movie would be much better without Hanks in it.

","You may be attracted to this film by the two lead actors Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks and, your instincts would be right. These two pull off a wondrous piece of story telling that feels genuine and authentic. Thompson and Hanks have done their homework and manage to incorporate true to life characterisations. A shame Colin Farrell couldn't manage the same as his character stands alone as forced and contrived - maybe he was trying too hard to encapsulate PL Travers' 'idealisation' too much. However romantic her memory, there is still room to make the character grittier. I feel Jude Law might have made a better choice for this role. Paul Giamatti is the readily identifiable US actor you can never name - in this vehicle doing an impression of Eric Morecombe, or so it seemed to me. It is the Ralph (Giamatti)character that enables the pathos of the story to unfold. Funny, interesting, sad and entertaining all in one film. Lovely."

Travers is portrayed as a stereotypical uptight and overly proper British lady, in contrast to Hanks, who plays Mr. Disney. There were some amusing moments and tidbits of musical numbers with Travers and Disney and his creative team on how they don't see eye to eye. But a big side story was Travers's backstory, told through many flashbacks, about her alcoholic father and him never being proud of her.

","Here is an interesting situation. I love cinema and I like the 'movies about movies' genre which I believe has provided some of the best films in the history of the seventh art. Saving Mr. Banks is however a film about a movie that I did not like - Mary Poppins. I was a kid when it was released but I was already disliking melodramas and I failed to be captivated by musicals unless they included my kind of favorite music which was pop and rock. I am still looking for a film by the Walt Disney studios that is credible and contains enough emotion and less sugar to make me feel good during the screening and after it. Director John Lee Hancock's film about the making of Mary Poppins could not change my mind. From my point of view the film inherits many of the flaws of the original. Of course, fans of the original may like Saving Mr. Banks as well, but I do not belong to the category.<br/><br/>The period is the early 60s, the action takes place in London and California, but do not expect anything about the emergence of the pop or hippies to show up in screen. The background is actually exactly the world against which the pop and hippie movements revolted. Famous British writer P.L. Travers goes to Los Angeles to work on the screen adaptation of her novel by famous producer (and theme parks owner, and author of the most charming animated cartoons in history) Walt Disney and his studios. The cultural clash between the two personalities although filled of stereotypes is the funniest part of the film, with the feelings of the estranged author surrounded by what she considers the Californian kitsch superbly brought to screen by Emma Thompson. I like much less the parallel story line about the childhood of the author where the authors of the script of Saving Mr. Banks sought the 'deep' motivation of the novel and the resulting film. All this parallel run of the stories looked to me melodramatic and superficial. The scene that is supposed to be the emotional peak, with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) flying to London to reverse the decision of the author and obtain the screening rights includes a short speech that is close to ridiculous.<br/><br/>We all know the end of the story. Mary Poppins was eventually made, it was the first 'serious', big stars, big screen movie of the studios which have achieved in the decades after a front range position with combinations of the animated and actors movies, becoming champions of the 'family films' genre. The film about its making gathers a lot of acting talents, beside Hanks (who must have put about 15 extra kilos for this role) and Thompson we have Colin Farrell in the role of the loving but failed father of the writer and Paul Giamatti in a charming supporting role of the only Californian that P.L. Travers ended by really liking.<br/><br/>'Saving Mr. Banks' eventually delivers what some people and the producers expect from it - squeezing tears. It does it however the same way the original 'Mary Poppins' film did - using the melodrama tools. So it's a melodrama about the making of a melodrama. Nothing more, a little less. Mary Poppins had the music."
"mark.waltz","7","0","1","17 May 2016"," Justifying the artist's demands.
","An unhappy woman becomes a smashing success thanks to the publication of what is now a children's classic. Like many artists, she seemed to abhor fame and when Hollywood beckoned, she declined. Well, at least with the creator of the allegedly happiest place on earth. The woman was the Austrian born P.L. Travers, her boss to be Walt Disney, and her leading character a nanny almost as prickly as her who was known as Mary Poppins.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the first production of Mary Poppins anywhere was a television version starring character actress Mary Wickes back in 1949. Ironically, right before the movie first went into production, Wickes posed for artist drawings for Cruella Deville in ""101 Dalmatians"". That was an the animated film, and P.L. Travers wanted no part of animation for her story. <br/><br/>She showed up in Los Angeles in 1961 already copping an attitude, and her first meeting with Disney, songwriters the Sherman Brothers and the screenwriters and director did not go off well in the least. But as the Disney magic begin to roll in, this Travers focus on her life as a little girl, her family problems and incidents which she would later utilized in creating her classic stories. Some of the flashbacks slow the film down completely, but her character would not really be understandable had they been omitted.<br/><br/>Honestly, I liked the character of P.L. Travers, here played by the glorious Emma Thompson portrayed with a prickly look like ""Wicked Witch of the West"" Margaret Hamilton. She is certainly not fond of little children, being rather aggravated by the presence of tons of teddy bears and other stuffed animals in her hotel room. She's rather curt with children when she meets them and even at Disneyland won't sign autographs. But in spite of all of that, there is something underneath the surface that shows the sad little girl, and because of that I was able to like her in spite of her being a tremendous grouch. When she during her first hearing of ""Let's Go Fly a Kite"", it is a magical moment just like the many that Disney provided over its glory years. <br/><br/>I must admit, however, that Tom Hanks simply seems to be playing Tom Hanks, vaguely made up to resemble Walt Disney but really not coming like him from my memory of original building of the wonderful world of Disney back during the Glory Days of my own childhood. That is a minor complaint, because I have seen many other portrayals of real-life figures that were even further away than from what Hanks does with Walt. <br/><br/>When Emma Thompson is on screen, the film truly shines and its success is due in the most part to her very detailed performance which is like nothing she had played every before. The conclusion of her story is sad, and her involvement with the much later stage version rather prickly as well, but what results is a fascinating story of great Hollywood history that minus the flaws was quite an achievement. In a sense, I liked it more than then the film which I think today is highly overrated, and certainly much more than the overblown version that came to Broadway in the middle of the first decade of the millennium."

It does include scenes based on real occurrences but the whole premise of this movie goes down the toilet once you learn that, in reality, Travers signed the contract before she flew out to LA.<br/><br/>And based on what I've read Disney didn't give a darn what she thought, though in ""Saving Mr. Banks"" he practically bends over backwards for her.<br/><br/>The movie was aesthetically pleasing, but the back and forth between PL Travers' past and present did not go smoothly."

","Both my husband and I were pleasantly surprised by this movie. I'm afraid that when I see the word ""Disney"" I immediately think of something that will appeal more to my grandchildren. This movie definitely has adult themes. The acting was incredible---the chemistry between Hanks and Thompson so interesting. Two strong-willed characters who gradually shed their tough shells and became friends and colleagues. The supporting cast was also wonderful---everyone from the actors in the flashbacks to the studio collaborators in Los Angeles lent a great credibility to the film.

","""Don't you ever stop dreaming, Ginty, my love."" It's a line which seems pretty ordinary, much of cliché nowadays. But the way Mr. Travers Goff spoke it to Helen has captivated me, and cogently pressed me to think of it on personal-terms.<br/><br/>I wasn't aware of Mary Poppins, and of course its author, P. L. Travers; I didn't really live my childhood with Mickey or other popular child's dream per say. Now I am, of course, and I am with utmost respect and affirmation.<br/><br/>Mr. Banks is Helen Goff's recall of her father—practically unstable, lethargic, irresponsible, drunk, but charmingly idealistic, encouraging, and darling—and is surprisingly considered a bad man (Mr. Banks, not Mr. Travers as you might infer) by Walt Disney's co-writer for the movie. Helen disregards this concept with shrinks, screams, tears, and nostalgia. Her attempts don't go awry as she is finally able to convince Mr. Disney to employ her vision, and not the comic and silly alterations that go hand-in-hand with his Mickeys and Poohs.<br/><br/>Saving Mr. Banks, as I was under the idea of, is not about Mr. Disney; it's not even about Mrs. Travers in the least yet most relevant of sense. Saving Mr. Banks is about saving yourself from the ghastly inappropriate transactions that all ordinary men concede; it's about cherishing your past, obsessing over it, but not losing your faith in future, and in alterations where the need arises. Locking yourself into immoral ghosts of a clingy past sure is a good way of retaining your conscience, but it only happens at the cost of your sensibility and rationality. Keep your imagination with you, but infuse them to reality to get a better view of what's really happening.<br/><br/>That was the moral. So what is the movie? Helen sticks on to her past with her most cherished book, Mary Poppins. In childhood, she is in absolute awe of her father who always sticks by her side, promising that he will never leave her, no matter what. He is true, and accompanies his daughter in the form of Mr. Banks later in Helen's life. She recalls her family's shifting to an apparently barren, and countryside land with a wooden mansion that's rotten for ages. It was the ideal place for her father and consequently, for her. Her mother isn't so happy, primarily because Mr. Travers isn't consistent with his practical undertakings, except for the frequent sips of booze. While never disrespecting her mother, Helen is fairly devoted to her father and all his contributions toward her mental acuteness. Following his death, Helen's narrative drags into the future where she finds her father in her dreams, and in reality, making her ambivalence about the book's adaptation more rigid. She doesn't have an issue with Mary Poppins going to Walt, and getting dismantled by his cartoon-ish tendencies; she is only afraid of the loss of identity and interpretation she has for her father, which she so stubbornly clings to. Ultimately, she is convinced when Walt shares his life's secrets with Helen, and claims how his father and childhood have effects on the present-him, and how he respects her character and thoughts like he does for his own. And so the kite flies and curtains close.<br/><br/>Now that was the movie. So what was the movie like? I think Emma Thompson was astoundingly appropriate for the role, and have a strong feeling that no one else could have done it so brilliantly as she has, with the exception of a few, of course, but even they couldn't have looked so surprisingly similar to the actual P. L. Travers (shown with the credits). As for Mr. Disney, Tom Hanks was fine; I mean he did make me feel like I was seeing Walt Disney himself but he wasn't anything extraordinary with the character, which he could have been with a character so special and lauded throughout time and world. The movie was surprisingly boring; I can see a 7.6 on IMDb and now that I have seen the movie, I feel a little dishonored by the rating. It should have been a 7.1 or 7.2 at most, and even that for the nostalgic depictions of Helen Goff, Colin Farrell's drunk-act, Mary Poppins's premiere, and Emma Thompson's exquisite absorption into the role. Otherwise, it was a forced-up movie. Disney's deliberately trying to mock itself with productions like this—when it was empty of ideas and novelty, it pondered upon extracting out its archives, polishing up maker's biography with a good cast, and biased script, and hitting the peddle.<br/><br/>I can't say I didn't enjoy it, but what I did enjoy has been explicitly listed in my review. Apart from that, nah!"

","All I could think was how could a woman who was so disgustingly rude create such a fanciful lovely character. Boo hoo, just because you have a tough childhood that does not mean you get a free pass in life. The way she treated Walt Disney and the Disney family was disgraceful. All she did was write a few books, Walt Disney on the other hand created dreams. So while I may not like the woman who created Mary Poppins I do love the story.<br/><br/>The subject matter may not be likable but Saving Mr. Banks is a really good movie. It's beautifully told and acted. Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson were most certainly the perfect choices for their respective roles. Even Colin Farrell does a good job at portraying Mrs Travers pathetic father. So it's a sad story, something I wasn't expecting but nevertheless a really good movie."

","Although the film is not entirely based on fact, every film takes some artistic license, even biographies. It was a great story to watch about the making of one of the most beloved Disney films of all time, Mary Poppins, and the trouble they had doing so.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks probably was not the best choice for Walt Disney, as he made no effort to use Walt's mannerisms or vocal pattern at all. I would give his acting a mere 6/10 for effort. Emma Thompson as P.L. Travers was extraordinary, as she was very much indeed closer to the real Travers' voice.<br/><br/>I especially liked the role that Bradley Whitford played as the timid writer of the screenplay, Don DaGradi, who must deal with Travers' many tantrums as she had creative control over the screenplay. It was a very well made film, from start to finish.<br/><br/>However, I am unclear as to why it received a PG-13 rating by the MPAA. But it was great, which is why I gave it 9/10."

","Well, did Walt Disney (Hanks) have a tough time convincing Mrs. Travers (Thompson) that she should allow him to turn her book, ""Mary Poppins"", into a musical, or what.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson is one cranky, uptight, insulting lady. The actress isn't bad looking in any way but make up has done a splendid job of deglamorizing her -- those close-cut curls, that thin red scar of a frowning mouth. I don't know why old Walt flew her from England to Anaheim in the first place. Nobody would get within ten feet of her because it might be catching. What a snot she is.<br/><br/>Walt, on the other hand, is all Middle America. (Everybody calls him ""Walt"", never ""Mister Disney."") He certainly knows how to please people. I always enjoy rides on his Pirates of the Caribbean and The Haunted Mansion. Sometimes I get a kick out of The Flight of Mister Toad or whatever it is, but I don't like to admit it. Walt always has a big smile. He's full of Mid-Western common sense. He's willing to give a little. And Mrs. Travers calls Disneyland a ""big money-printing machine."" That's the kind of lady SHE is.<br/><br/>She fights him all the way, far beyond the point at which we simple humans would have given up. But he woos her, flying to England after she flees Los Angeles, and doing a psychodynamic number of her. Look, Mrs. Travers, both of us have had difficult and sometimes tragic childhoods, but there's no reason to go on living out that tragedy. You've created a story that brightens peoples' lives and I'm a story teller. You see, we have a lot in common. She's seduced.<br/><br/>Both the principals handle their roles with professional aplomb. Emma Thompson in particular is a fine actress. But the director, John Lee Hancock, has over-directed some of the supporting cast. If they show surprise, they don't do it the way you and I would. Instead, their jaws must practically drop to the floor.<br/><br/>There are multiple flashbacks to Mrs. Travers' life as a young girl in Australia. The pattern of dysfunction was cribbed from ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" -- the sober, practical mother; the cheerful, fantasizing, drunken father.<br/><br/>The ultimate impression a viewer is liable to get is that the good folks who greenlighted this thought, ""Mary Poppins"" was a terrific hit and made a fortune. We can't make a sequel, but let's make a movie about how the movie came to be made. It will be a salubrious blend of comedy and tear-jerker. Everyone who loved ""Mary Poppins"" will come to see it. There must be some of the original audience left. We can pick over the bones of the carcass."" I thought it was too long and that the protracted flashbacks were designed to manipulate the audience. The point could have been made in less than half the time.<br/><br/>Never having been a fan of ""Mary Poppins"" -- never even having seen it -- I can only guess what the appeal is for devotées of the original.

"anthonymichaelbangert","9","0","1","3 February 2015"," Let's Go Fly a Kite: Because Disney is a Jerk
","This movie depicts the story of P.L.Travers, author of the Mary Poppins book. Told in two parts, this movie shows the writer in a bad light, as she fights to keep her story the way she imagined it when she penned it. She fights the movie every step of the way, as she sees her work being destroyed by Hollywood. The people at Disney fight back, and usually seem to win, which upsets Mrs. Travers further. The other story is told through flashbacks to Mrs. Travers' early years, where all of the ideas behind Mary Poppins stem from. P.L.Travers came from a broken home with a mother with mental issues and an alcoholic, but genuinely loving, father. This movie stays pretty true to the characters' physicality, but does take some liberties in how they are portrayed. Disney is seen to be hero, rather than the man he was in this situation: a man who tormented and destroyed the work of another who tried so hard to make herself heard. Not saying I don't like Disney's Mary Poppins, (in fact it's one of my favorite movies of all time) but it did take major liberties, and everyone involved undermined Mrs. Travers quite often. However, taken as a film on it's own without background knowledge, this film is well done. Decent script, excellent casting, and amazing acting. I enjoyed watching this film, and would do so again.<br/><br/>Soundtrack: 10- Balancing the whimsy of Disney, and the music of Mary Poppins without over-doing either was a daunting task. I believe it was pulled off nicely.<br/><br/>Script: 6- Good pacing. Character development was OK for some, not so much for others. Many liberties were taken in terms of plot.<br/><br/>Originality: 7- Many plot points were predictable, but a movie about Mary Poppins from behind the scenes? Awesome! Cinematography: 10- This was something I found quite beautiful. There were so many amazing shots, and each scene felt like a different atmosphere, even when in the same location as a previous scene. The director did a good job here.<br/><br/>Casting: 10- I've said this before, and I'll say it again. Tom Hanks can not do a bad role. He is always the perfect casting choice, and he always shines. Add him with Emma Thompson and Colin Farrell, and sprinkle in just the perfect amount of Paul Giamatti and Jason Schwartzman and you have yourself the perfect film cast.<br/><br/>Acting: 10- The entire cast were very solid in their roles, and delivered the parts with such beauty and believability, that I often forgot I was watching a movie.

"g-bodyl","9","0","1","19 January 2015"," The Story of How Mary Poppins Came To Be!
","In 1961, Walt Disney invited P.L Travers, the author of Mary Poppins to his California studios to negotiate the rights for her classic novel. The rest is history. Saving Mr. Banks is a movie that tells how the film adaptation came to be and the struggles that occurred during pre-production. The movie itself is charming and is an uplifting story as it is in classic Disney mode. The movie has strong acting and a wonderful score by Thomas Newman. The movie is funny and also sad. The film is also told by using flashbacks, in which the story is greatly enhanced as we see the influence of the characters in Mary Poppins.<br/><br/>John Lee Hancock's film tells the story how Walt Disney was able to secure the rights to Mary Poppins. But it was no easy task. P.L Travers is a very proud and proper woman. Because of dwindling book sales and financial trouble, Travers agrees to travel to L.A where she supervises the script. But she is not too easily impressed and it takes a trip down memory lane in order to inspire her heart and her mind.<br/><br/>The strongest suit of the film is the impressive acting. Emma Thompson delivers one of her best roles as the stern and sometimes downright mean Travers. Her on screen persona makes her character watchable, even if she is disliked. Tom Hanks takes a step back in a supporting role and I thought he did a great job. However one can wonder if he was overly nice in portraying Disney. Paul Giamatti had a touching performance as Traver's driver. Even dealing with her rudeness, he always respected and was nice to Travers. Finally, Colin Farrell gave an extraordinary performance as Traver's alcoholic father, who she has deep admiration for.<br/><br/>Overall, Saving Mr. Banks is an excellent family film that is essentially a two hour making-of documentary of Mary Poppins. But the film is so sweet and magical, and it is another film that is a recipient of Disney's magic. This film is better than it had every right to be. The performances, particularly Thompsons, is stellar. A end-of-the-year hidden gem. Now let's go watch some Mary Poppins! I rate this film 9/10."

","While this is the story of Mary Poppins, this movie pulls back the drapes on a real life drama behind it all in a 1960's Disney Studio that is at the top of the world then. It shows that even though the studio is at the top, some things were difficult to do.<br/><br/>It is a story not known to exist - the recordings the author of Mary Poppins insisted be made while she was negotiating what was going to happen to her own creation on movie film.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks takes on a difficult role in the same style he did when he has taken on other real life stories in his career like Apollo 13. The difference here is he is constrained by the over whelming memory of Walt Disney which prevents him from making a totally accurate account. <br/><br/>This story does explain how the movie turned out. Dick Van Dyke is near the height of his career when the movie is released but there has always been a side of this movie which is surreal. That is explained here nicely. <br/><br/>The movie is touchingly dedicated to one of Walt Disney's daughters who died in 2013. Very appropriate for this one. Disney and his children are members of the greatest generation of World War 2. His daughter represents a baby boomer that like Annette Funicello has now left us. This is a picture of a generation being left behind. It begs the question - would Mary Poppins be successful in the next generation?"

Yes, everything was great. Except every time Mrs. Travers appeared, I wanted to kick her in the face. What a disagreeable woman she was! I understand, yes, she had neuroses and a crappy childhood and was lonely as an adult. She was lonely, I would venture to say, because she was a royal killjoy, a true defeat of anything joyful. Yep. Would have liked the movie a lot more with a lot less of her. And yes, I do realize she is the focus of it all. In fact, most of the other characters seemed to revolve around her unpleasantness.

While you may won't like this film if you expected something ""shocking"", you'll see that this may be one of the most emotion-filled/ best written movies since ""The King's Speech"" - with much better music. Beware of the fact, that this movie deals with some heavy topic (such as alcoholism and shattered expectations on life). I really recommend watching the original ""Mary Poppins"" before ""Saving Mr. Banks"" since this filmy heavily refers to scenes from P. L. Traver's/Disney's masterpiece.

You already know the history on how the movie ""Mary Poppins"" came to be so no need to go into much detail about it because this movie tells you everything on what happened during the behind the scenes of ""Mary Poppins."" Unlike most movies that are based on true events, this movie is the first time to shows the ideas and the creativity beside recreating the sets from a well-known movie like ""Ed Wood"" or ""Hitchcock."" The cast in this movie are terrific. Emma Thompson does a great job for playing the author of ""Mary Poppins."" She does start off as a woman that you want to smack her in the face for being too critical on Disney; the songs; and the ideas that the filmmakers were going for. The movie does show her past on how young she was as she was once cute before turning into an unlikable person. However, the more you understand her and the more you feel sorry for her. With that said, Tom Hanks is absolutely remarkable as playing Walt Disney. He did captured the spirit on who and what Disney really is, and remaining true to his character. Colin Farrell and the rest of the cast all did great on their own. Thomas Newman's score is one of his greatest scores that he has ever done in his career. The film's cinematography and its setting is also really beautiful to look at; it really doe have that Disney magic, and it is also fun to see Disneyland in the movie. John Lee Hancock does a fantastic job on directing the movie. My only issue with the movie is the ending, because they never bother to show Travers after showing ""Mary Poppins"" to the movie's premiere and tells Disney on how much as she hates the movie, and thinks that it needs to be fixed. After Travers giving her thoughts on the movie, Disney tells her ""Pam, that ship has sailed."" I just thought it would have been something to show, but that is just a minor nitpick. Of course, I understand the filmmakers didn't want the movie to end like that because for what I understand from Thompson's interview is that the movie focuses on Daddy issues which is why they never end on Travers giving her thoughts on the movie. Even Richard Sherman, the man who wrote songs for ""Mary Poppins"" and consulting ""Saving Mr. Banks"" says that Travers is just a contradicting woman. In most interviews, she would say on how much she hates the movie, and in some rare interviews she would say on how much she enjoy it. So I give that a free pass. Anyway, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is practically perfect in every way! I give it a 10 out of 10!"
"Rickting","9","0","2","11 December 2014"," Possibly the most likable film of 2013
","Saving Mr Banks is the true story of Walt Disney trying to persuade PL Travers to let him adapt Mary Poppins for the big screen. Although we all know how the story's going to end, this is one of those films where disliking it is nearly impossible. Aside from the excessive runtime, what's not to like? The Academy snubbed SMB, but it really shouldn't have been snubbed while American Hustle and Dallas Buyers Club got so many nominations. Emma Thompson should have been nominated for an Oscar for her amazing portrayal of Travers, which is one of the best performances from any actress in 2013. Both hilarious and heartfelt, she absolutely owns the film. Tom Hanks as Walt Disney isn't quite as noticeable, but is still excellent. All the other actors are good as well, with a surprisingly moving performance from Colin Farrell. SMB is told with 2 timelines, one a series of flashbacks, unfolding simultaneously. This doesn't get in the way of the film overall and the flashbacks are timed well so as not to break the flow.<br/><br/>SMB may not be full of dancing animals, syrup, endless singing, one dimensional love stories and overloads of colour but it's one of the most delightful movies Disney has ever made. It's a very funny film with loads of sharp dialogue and plenty of wit, and it's well directed by John Lee Hancock, but it's also a very moving film. Both a true story rendered in touching and hilarious fashion and a thought provoking examination of where authors get their ideas from, SMB is a wonderful film and nearly surreally enjoyable. And there's not an explosion or action sequence in sight. It'll make you laugh and quite possibly cry as well. A wonderfully uplifting movie, SMB may be seen as slight and sentimental by some, but in terms of moving and entertaining dramas there aren't many better alternatives. You don't even have to like Disney to enjoy this delightful crowd pleaser.<br/><br/>9/10"
"aimless-46","8","0","2","25 November 2014"," ""Sorry Daddy""
","""I dropped the pears ... sorry daddy"" says the stunned child who will grow up to become the creator of Mary Poppins. The child (wonderfully underplayed by Annie Rose Buckley) has returned from the pear fetching errand to find that her long-suffering father has passed away from influenza during her brief absence. Thus begins a life of atonement for P.L. Travers, who will take her father's first name as her surname and adopt a rather strait-laced no-nonsense existence. The whimsical person she was to have become is instead incorporated into her creation, a character modeled on the physical characteristics of her Aunt Ellie (played by Rachel Griffiths) and the style of J. M. Barrie - who she admired. The film confirms this in the closing credits with two different drawings of Mary Poppins, the first one appears when Buckley is credited and the second one a little later when Griffiths is credited.<br/><br/>Buckley's is the key performance of the production as she must non-verbally sell the child's absolute and unqualified adoration of her father, if the parallel story of Travers' efforts at atonement for not saving him are to ring true. In this the young Australian actress is absolutely convincing and John Lee Hancock demonstrates his considerable acting-for-the-camera directing skills.<br/><br/>The film is an extremely well-crafted tale with two parallel time-lines, Travers' traumatic coming-of-age story and Walt Disney's ultimately successful efforts to secure the rights to bring Mary Poppins to the big screen. Both proceed chronologically, with Travers recalling her childhood in sequenced flashbacks. More subtle is a third story, minimalist references to Disney's own childhood, which serve as a compare and contrast with Travers; with portions of both fathers blending into the 1964 film's version of Mr. Banks (played by David Tomlinson who appears at the center of that film's cast photo in the closing credits) . The film teasingly alludes to a similarity between these two creative people. Both brought a lot of childhood baggage with them into adulthood in the way of father issues. And for both these issues are reflected in the dichotomy of their adult lives. Early in the film they cut-away to the second floor window of Elias Disney's office on Disneyland's Main Street, Walt's tribute to the work ethic instilled in him by his father. Later Disney attributes the motivation behind his retreat into imagination to bitterness about a childhood which was anything but whimsical.<br/><br/>Those behind ""Saving Mr. Banks"" understood what it is like to still be wrestling with childhood demons throughout adulthood and they knew how to make the viewer feel the struggle.<br/><br/>On the other hand the saving of Mr. Banks premise is a non-factor in the Mary Poppins books (the original and the sequels). The film would be more accurately named ""Saving Mr. (Elias) Disney"". Apparently Travers was appalled before, during, and after the screening of the dumbed down film adaptation of her books. And by all accounts she carried her litany of objections to her grave, never permitting a sequel. For 50 years avid readers have been mystified by the adaptation's unrecognizable theme and its peculiar areas of emphasis. The adaptation did not include Travers' best chapter (Mary Popping's birthday party at the zoo among the animals) nor her best character (the star Maia from the Pleiades cluster of the Taurus constellation - who Jane and Michael help in her human form to pick out Christmas gifts for her six sisters). Instead they fabricated additional scenes for the horribly miscast Dick Van Dyke - whose casting even ""Saving Mr. Banks"" acknowledges as being entirely for commercial purposes.<br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

So back to Saving Mr Banks. The movie is told in flashbacks as Helen(who is Pl Travers real name btw) is living in Australia with her alcoholic father(played by our very own Colin Farrell)and her mother along with her little sister. We then meet her as an adult(now played by the terrific Emma Thompson from Nanny McPhee)who goes to Los Angelus to meet Walt Disney(played by the brilliant Tom Hanks who surprisingly look like the real deal)as he wants her book of Mary Poppins to be made into a musical film. Of course she doesn't want it to be half animated or even a musical but with the team that is over Mary Poppins can they change her mind and make her love her book being turned into a film with Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke?<br/><br/>SO what did I think of this movie well from the director of The Blind Side John Lee Hancock(which is one of my all time favourite movies of all time)I actually enjoyed this movie. Did I cry No call me heartless but I didn't cry at it. I knew that (Spoiler Alert btw) that PL Travers dad died from alcoholic poisoning and we see him die on the bed,and also she was sort of a bitch. I mean she was so cynical,so bitter you kinda wonder why was she acting like this and then we know why she was what she is. Overall the acting was great and I love Tom Hanks as Walt Disney he was fantastic as him,also you think he WAS Walt Disney. <br/><br/>My only problem with it was that I felt like watching two movies. One with Colin Farrell(as PL Travers dad) and PL Travers as a kid and she changed her name from Helen to PL. And the other was her as an adult and been shown around by a limo driver played by The Amazing Spiderman 2 star Paul Giammatti and her meeting Walt Disney at his studio.<br/><br/>For 2 hours this is a great film to watch as I bought it on DVD on Sunday for a bargain in HMV and I never seen it before so yes its definitely worthy if you love Tom Hanks in general or just a fan of Disney in general.<br/><br/>Overall I am giving this a B +<br/><br/>7/10"

There probably are some exaggerations, but during the end credits you can listen to a bit of the audio tape that was made during some of the discussions to make the movie.<br/><br/>One thing that the poster with Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson does not show (before watching this I only knew the basic outline of the movie), is the actors involved with this. Be it Paul Giamati or in a really great performance - Colin Farrell. Actually he almost steals the movie (which shouldn't be a surprise for a few reasons too).<br/><br/>The movie might set up the characters on different ends of a scale (like they couldn't be more removed and almost clichéd), but the actors make it more than work. This is a story that might make you weep or at least get you on an emotional ride"

","It may seem a slight concept--Walt Disney and author P.L. Travers reluctantly collaborate on an adaptation of her ""Mary Poppins"" series--but in the hands of director John Lee Hancock (the criminally under-appreciated ""The Rookie""), there's a grace and charm that makes for an enjoyably nostalgic experience, even if the tears generated from the script by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith aren't always earned honestly. The film cross-cuts between the contentious effort to adapt Travers' work and her Australian childhood, where she struggles to save her parents' marriage and, in particular, her father's romantic idealism, which has been crushed by alcoholism. (Her father is played by a fine Colin Farrell.) This earnest effort to ""explain"" (read: psychoanalyze) Travers' soured worldview seems labored and determined and it drags the film's rhythms down; but it helps that Hancock has Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks as the leads--both turn in the entertaining performances one would hope for, which is to say well-suited to their scenery-chomping proclivities. It's a very professional piece of filmmaking, easy to watch and suitable for filing under Guilty Pleasures."

","Saving Mr Banks is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic and very talented cast.I found this true story very interesting,I was not aware of it before this movie that it took that many years for Walt Disney to make Mary Poppins and it was certainly a difficult path in his career.While at first the author PL Travers,played by the brilliant Emma Thompson,is shown as a very ignorant woman that won't let Disney,played by the very likable casting of Tom Hanks,turn her book in to a movie,but after seeing what inspired her to make the book and following her childhood,I actually understood why she didn't like all the music,animation and casting that was done to Mary Poppins.For die hard Disney fans it is a must see,and I would also highly recommend Saving Mr Banks to anyone looking for a good drama or biography film. <br/><br/>After meeting with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks),who is looking to turn her book in to a movie because of a promise he made with his children,P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) reflects on her childhood and works with Disney to make sure the movie pleases her. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Emma Thompson"

","The Oscar winning song Chim-Chim-Charee, a spoonful of sugar and all that may have very well not come to be had the Emma Thompson character, the person who wrote Mary Poppins, had gotten her way.<br/><br/>We have an excellent picture here of what might have not occurred. Emma Thompson gave a fabulous performance as the cantankerous, afraid of facing life author. Amazing that she was denied an Oscar nomination and I suspect that her petition signing regarding Israel had something to do with it. If that be the case, congratulations to the academy for denying it to her.<br/><br/>The author of Mary Poppins had a difficult childhood as we observe. She saw Mary in a far different way than screen viewers eventually saw her. Tom Hanks portrayed Walt Disney in the film and he had quite a time of convincing her what Mary represented. <br/><br/>As the alcoholic father, Colin Farrell did a great job as did Paul Giamatti, the LA chauffeur who convinces the Thompson character that life is indeed worth living."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>Reclusive novelist P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) staunchly refuses to share her literary masterpiece Mary Poppins with anyone, despite being pestered for the film rights numerous times by different people. But she has fallen on hard times and there look set to be even tougher times ahead. So, on the persuasion of her agent, she flies off to America and has a meeting with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks), the most well known man on earth in the early 60's. Initially reluctant and extremely difficult, Travers is also horrified at the thought of Disney making it in to one of his ghastly animations, which she detests. But gradually, the fairy tale mogul wears down her tough exterior and as the film progresses, we learn of the tragic back story of Travers's childhood that nevertheless formed the basis of the fantasy world she escaped to to create her wonder yarn.<br/><br/>Working in a children's hospital, occasionally you'll pass a television set with a DVD playing to keep the kids amused while they wait for an appointment or something, so it's only comparatively recently that the magic of Mary Poppins has entered my life. Kids, or family, films aren't generally the type of thing I go for, as my comments listings will attest to, but something about this film still grabbed my heart enough to become a film I now own. So, in the 50th anniversary of the film's first release, this inspired and enlightening film is highly relevant and was certainly well worth my time, shining some light on the production difficulties the film encountered, not least Travers's awkward, hostile personality. Though well written, the script sometimes makes Travers come off as cartoonishly eccentric and over the top at times, and you're left wondering how it would have been possible for anyone, even Disney, to possibly make her come round.<br/><br/>And yet, throughout the film's tough depiction of her, this is juxtaposed with flashbacks to her childhood spent in rural Australia, where her even more outlandish father fueled her mind with his free spirit and boundless imagination. But his was a tragic existence, blighted by drink and self destruction. And yet, he imparted the words of wisdom that let her mind flourish, ""never to let the world grind you down with how it is, and to keep your imagination alive."" From this, her more human side comes to life, and our dislike gradually simmers to empathy.<br/><br/>Needless to say, if the idea behind the film wasn't exciting enough, it's even more exhilarating with the performers involved, and they all turn in reliably stellar performances. Hanks once again captures the manner and style of his charge with aplomb, bringing a real life character to the screen unlike anyone before him, while national treasure Thompson is perfectly suited to the role of Travers, and there's great support from Colin Farrell, unrecognizable at first as the dad, and Paul Giamatti as Travers's put upon chauffeur.<br/><br/>It's a magical examination of the magic, that will please the long time and even the more recent devotees of Poppins. ****"

","Saving Mr. Banks This is not the movie I was expecting. I was expecting it to focus on Walt Disney, with touches of the story about the making of Mary Poppins, but instead it focused on the author P.L Travers (Emma Thompson).<br/><br/>Saving Mr. Banks focuses on P.L Travers (Emma Thompson) childhood in Australia and her difficulty in allowing Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) and his creative team to bring the movie to the big screen. In the start of the movie P.L Travers (Emma Thompson) is opposed to everything, you can feel the disdain she had for Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) and the types of films he made.<br/><br/>I was intrigued during the movie at Walt Disney's tenacious pursuit in making this movie and to what lengths he would go in order to win over the crusty P.L Travers. I get the feeling from this movie that he was a fan of her as an author but as a human being he was disappointed. You can see how he struggled with her demands, her inflexibility and the general manner in which she conducted herself.<br/><br/>A nice touch to this movie is Ralph (Paul Giamatti), he seems to be the only one in the end who ends up not only respecting her, but earning her respect as well. The good nature of this character and fact that his frustration with her, people skills or lack thereof is not going to change his attitude towards her or is job.<br/><br/>As you follow the story you start to understand how she has been let down by her father (Colin Farrell), who Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) reminds her of with his whimsy and playful nature. You get the feeling that the character needs saving and expect as the movie goes long that eventually she will be saved, but this is not the case.<br/><br/>Midway through when the creative team sings 'Let's go Fly a Kite', you do get the sense that P.L Travers (Emma Thompson) is beginning to change emotionally and become more understanding of the people around her. However by the end of the movie, you will see that the character has not been redeemed, which is a departure from the normal story arc's you would see in a movie of this type.<br/><br/>The cast has done an excellent job to bring this movie to life and I believe that without Tom Hanks, Emma Thompson and Paul Giamatti, this movie would not have had the impact that it did. These exceptional actors showed the diversity not only on the big screen but in real life.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to all who wish to see it and rate it a strong 9/10."

"tommystans","9","0","3","5 August 2014"," Surprised Really
","I finally got to see the movie on Blu-Ray and I have to say the movie is really good and it's rather surprising for how mature Disney went with the movie. Usually when Disney or any film maker like Don Bluth makes a film about a real life historical figure, Pocahontas (1995) and Anastasia (1998), it's all sugarcoated adapting away from the real life events of that figure's history. Here, while it does adapt away some reality from the characters, they tend to keep most of it in. For example, P.L Travers' mother's attempted suicide, when her father died of the flu she, the mother, was struck with grief and was about to drown herself in a nearby lake, this is during her childhood, it wasn't successful, although that was adapted slightly different in the film, but they still put that part in and tend to have such a dark scene coming from the 'The Happiest Place on Earth' that also goes to her father's alcoholism, I do not support suicide or alcoholism though, if you suffer from them or anything else unhealthy, please get help, I'm just surprised that Disney put this stuff in as in the past they sugarcoat their past movies when it comes to historical figures making it inaccurate, that's a very mature move from Disney.<br/><br/>The acting of the characters are so good too, Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson had done so well playing as them. Hanks manage to put some humour, light heartiness and emotion into Walt Disney and Emma Thompson really put in some stern, anger, cold emotion into Travers. I understand that there are some fictionalised parts in the movie, like Walt Disney helping out with the production as in reality he didn't, as it was Travers working with the Sherman Brothers and all in the production of 'Mary Poppins' adaptation. I'm not defending it but I understand that they put it in there for chemistry between Disney and Travers. <br/><br/>I recommend watching this movie, it has good humour and it doesn't feel sappy or bad, you can actually feel for the characters, mostly Travers."

","I have not read any of the eight children's novels featuring Mary Popppins and published between 1934-1988 or seen the 1964 movie musical adaptation, but I enjoyed this cinematic explanation of how the childhood experiences in Australia of the author P L Travers inspired the original story and how Walt Disney and his creative team struggled so long and so valiantly to bring that story to the screen. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks never gives a poor performance and is excellent here in his portrayal of Disney, giving a moving testimony towards the end. However, this is Emma Thompson's movie because she is simply wonderful as Travers, hard yet vulnerable, cutting yet clever.

"bob the moo","Null","0","1","8 June 2014"," Has its flaws but has quality in the design and delivery
","I'm not sure how much of this film is actually true and how much of it is creative license for the sake of a good film, but I'm not too bothered because I doubt too many people come to this thinking they are watching anything other than a piece of light entertainment albeit with a basis in reality. The film concerns the making of the film Mary Poppins – a film that Mrs Travers, the author of the source material is very protective of and that Walt Disney is keen to make and make in a way that he knows will work and sell. Throughout the mostly gently comedic film, we get flashbacks to Travers' youth in Australia with her challenging situations, a fun-loving father and a distinctive house- keeper.<br/><br/>The film is delivered with a rather uneven tone but it is one that it mostly hangs together even if it never really becomes a great film. At its heart it is really sentimental, with a nostalgic and comedic air throughout; at the same time it seems to hint at elements which are factual, but the additions suggest a real push towards more of a warming and touching story. The flashbacks are part of this although the film never really has the depth that these suggest was being tried for. The film seems to be fine with this though and to be honest, so was I. I enjoyed it for its sentimentality and was grateful it didn't overdo it or push for tears or chuckles too heavily; it is a very nicely crafted film where you sort of feel the quality and, even though you can see what it is doing, you at least appreciate that it isn't doing it in a really cheap way.<br/><br/>This can be seen in many aspects – from the look of the film, the sets, the design and the whole tone but also in the performances. Hanks is nicely engaging and takes to his role well but it is Thompson that really brings the most to the film. Her crispness adds to the comedic element of course, but it is her delivery that, by reflection, makes the flashbacks work better than they would otherwise have done in terms of the formative aspects of the narrative and characters. Support is good from Whitford, Novak and Schwartzman, although I thought the film didn't really need Giamatti's character adding to the sentiment. In the flashbacks Farrell and Wilson both do well, and it is nice to see Griffiths in her small role.<br/><br/>Saving Mr. Banks is not a fantastic film but it is a gently entertaining and engaging one. It has its flaws for sure but it wears them well and has strengths that help cover them up; the end result is perhaps sentimental but it is not mawkish and I enjoyed it for its quality build and delivery."
"lasttimeisaw","8","0","1","30 May 2014"," Hardly a hagiography, neither for Travers nor for Disney
","First of all, it is an absurd travesty to exclude Emma Thompson in the BEST LEADING ACTRESS nomination list this year by the Academy members, she campaigned rather hard in the awards season, she is a revered two-times winner and the film is exhaustively friendly towards the academy members, considering FINDING NEVERLAND (2004, 7/10), the story behind another children classic Peter Pan. And most essentially, she is at the top of her game in depicting a quite unlikeable character, the high and mighty spinster P.L. Travers, the author of Mary Poppins books. <br/><br/>Under the direction of a dab hand John Lee Hancock (THE BLIND SIDE 2009, 8/10), the storyline inter-cuts between two time-lines, in the dawn of 20th century in the inland Australia, the tale of woe of Ms. Tavers' childhood and in the 60s, when she flies to Hollywood to negotiate with Walt Disney (Hanks) about the adaptation of her worldly-famous creation on celluloid. The two main deal-breaking stipulations for Ms. Tavers are, the picture must not feature any music numbers, and absolutely no animation is required, which are two leading signatures of Disney's trademarks, and both will be compromised if you have seen the crowd-pleasing and massively successful MARY POPPINS (1964, 7/10). <br/><br/>The 1960s bifurcation engages in a comical contradiction between Travers' British uppityness and the business-centered civilities of Disney and his staff, which amusingly juggles with our empathy and distaste of her, Thompson commits herself integrally with her pitch-perfect acrimony and balances it with a tint of human nature through her friendship with her limousine chauffeur Ralph (a down-to-earth Giamatti). And eventually, her hostility and aversion towards the money-seeking deal will thaw by Disney's self-referencing confession of the hardship in his boyhood. But in reality, Travers never sold off other copyrights of her works anymore after this instance, which denotes the tear-jerking scenes where she is watching the finished film during its Hollywood fanfare premier is more of a reflection and vent on her own troubled memory rather than an acknowledgment to the picture itself. <br/><br/>Equally well done is the childhood narrative, Farrell plays Travers Goff, and we come to realize Ms. Tavers coins her nom de plume after her father, a man dreams of fantasies and lives in fairy tales, whom she nurtures a very close affection to, but life is rough, he is a chronic dipsomaniac, an irresponsible bank manager and her family is the prototype of Banks family in the book, Farrell shines with devoted warmth and poignant endearment during his sequences with the newcomer Annie Rose Buckley, who plays the young author with a nickname Ginty, it has been one of his rare compelling performances to date. Ruth Wilson implodes with a suicidal tendency as her mother, and Rachel Griffiths as Aunt Ellie is criminally underused simply because she is THE real Mary Poppins and she is only allowed a 5-minutes part for her presence. <br/><br/>Hardly a hagiography, neither for Travers nor for Disney, whose subtle snootiness is brilliantly laid bare in the premier segment, when there is no need to kiss her ass, a polite cold-shoulder is all she deserves. So behind every tartar, there is a cause, the film is a success in not patronizing its audience with sugarcoating or spoon-feeding, yet in a tactful manner, it arouses empathy from within, last but not the least, it is also a treat to your ears, owing to Thomas Newman's masterful score saturated through and through."

","""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a ""supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" flick about how the Disney classic ""Mary Poppins"" popped into its development. The movie stars Emma Thompson as P.L. Travers, the author of the ""Mary Poppins"" novel who refused for years for her eye-popping book to be adapted into a Disney movie no matter how eagerly Sir Walt Disney tried to persuade her. Due to financial problems, Travers reluctantly takes the road well-traveled and decides to travel to Hollywood and meet with Walt and the Disney movie clan. However, she does have lots of reservations about how Disney wants to tinker with her ""Mary Poppins"". Sorry that I am feeding you a spoonful of puns, by the way. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" delves in also to Travers' childhood, most notably her relationship with her loving, but alcoholic father. But the magic of this movie is witnessing the interactions between Walt Disney and P.L. Travers. Director John Lee Hancock, who previously helmed ""The Blind Side"", opens our eyes on dreams, imagination, wonder, adversity, insistence, and of course magic; which are all elements Hancock had a hand in to make ""Saving Mr. Banks"" worth the ride. Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith's screenplay was divine. Thompson's performance was excellent as Travers, and it was a bit of a travesty that she did not get nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. Tom Hanks not only helped save Private Ryan, but also had a hand in ""Saving Mr. Banks"" with his superb charismatic performance as Walt Disney himself. Other worthy supporting turns came from Colin Farrell as Travers' father, Paul Giamatti as Disney limo driver Ralph, and B.J. Novak & Jason Schwartzman as film composers Robert & Richard Sherman. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a lovely movie that everyone should experience, and you can take that to the bank. ***** Excellent"
"sddavis63","9","0","1","3 May 2014"," I Actually Liked This More Than I Liked Mary Poppins
","I called ""Mary Poppins"" a solid movie. I liked it. It was good. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is the story behind Walt Disney's effort to acquire the rights to the book by P.L. Travers. It's a fascinating glimpse into the backstory to the book. As the movie opens, Travers is little more than an unlikeable character - considering handing the rights over to Disney after two decades of refusing only because she needs the money, resentful of Disney because of his success and because he wants to make money off the story, refusing to agree to any of the studio's ideas for how to adapt the story for the screen. <br/><br/>But there was more to Travers than met the eye. The movie featured repeated flashbacks to Travers' childhood. At first there was little connection with the story, or with Mary Poppins. But as the flashbacks continued, the backstory is slowly revealed, helping to explain Travers' reluctance to accept any of Disney's suggestions. As we learn more about her troubled and, ultimately, tragic childhood, Travers becomes more of an object of sympathy. Ultimately, there's a bit of Disney's own backstory given as well, and the movie is a fascinating glimpse into the lives of two people who seemed at odds, but who had far more in common than either would likely have imagined.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks (as Disney) and Emma Thompson (as Travers) are both two time Academy Award winners, and both, as you would expect, offered powerful performances in the lead roles. The movie strikes a good balance between being both funny and emotional, and it moves along at a very nice pace. Overall, I'd say it was actually better than ""Mary Poppins."" (9/10)"
"Chrysanthepop","Null","0","1","1 May 2014"," Emma Thompson Delightfully Leads Mr. Banks
","John Lee Hancock's 'Saving Mr. Banks' tells the story of P.L. Travers, creator of the classic Mary Poppins. Writers Kelly Marcel, Sue Smith and director Hancock depict how her loving father who struggled with alcoholism influenced her and her refusal to permit Disney to turn Mary Poppins into a movie. However, what I found to be lacking was Aunt Ellie's impact. Clearly she's the inspiration behind the character Mary Poppins and yet there is so little of her shown in the film and what her influence was is left for the viewer to assume. 'Saving Mr. Banks' is quite well shot. However, the special effects are poor. The editing and lighting are smooth and the score is very pleasing. The writing is brilliant, especially the sharp dialogues and the score is wonderful, particularly the renditions of the 'Mary Poppins' soundtrack.<br/><br/>The film boasts of several superb performances. Tom Hanks does a decent job. He exudes enough charm to carry off the part. Colin Farrell, even though not a convincing Australian, does a remarkable job otherwise. Same goes for Annie Rose Buckley. Paul Giamatti is excellent. Bradley Whitford, Jason Schwartzmann and Kathy Baker provide fine support. Rachel Griffiths is wonderful but she deserved more screen time. But, 'Saving Mr. Banks' belongs to Emma Thompson who delivers yet another transcendent performance marking one of her best works.<br/><br/>Flawed it may be but John Lee Hancock's movie is well worth watching. It's charming, colourful, delightful and very well acted."
"cleary-joshua","9","0","1","22 April 2014"," From the outside, it wasn't going to be much. How very wrong we all were...
","Let's look back briefly at movies about movies being made. ""Hitchcock"" is the main example of this type of film, and was a likable but shallow drama. 2012′s ""Hugo"" (just fitting into the category) was much better, focussing on other people who happen to be related to film. So now to ""Saving Mr. Banks"", which follows Walt Disney's (Tom Hanks) quest to adapt the much beloved children's novel ""Mary Poppins"" into a film. From the outside, and from the far-too-detailed trailer, it wasn't going to be much, just a lighthearted film with some emotional backstories which we all knew the ending of. How very very wrong we all were.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson plays P.L. Travers, the writer of ""Mary Poppins"", a serious woman who has been brought to L.A. by Walt Disney to adapt her creation into a film. Thompson is hilarious in the role, beating down many ideas put forwards and being generally nasty to everyone. The development of the film is an interesting half of the film, and we see where many ideas came from – the characters, the designs, and especially the songs. Taking the roles of the Sherman Brothers are Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak, who provide even more great comedy performances to the film – the scene where they all sing ""Let's Go Fly a Kite"" is particularly brilliant. Hanks is, of course, a fantastic addition as the man-child Walt Disney, and we see both his fun and slightly darker sides throughout the course of the film.<br/><br/>This is only half of the film, however, and the lighter half at that. The other is made up of Travers' flashbacks to her childhood, as she remembers the people who inspired her characters. Colin Farrell plays her father, who tries to keep her imagination flowing even when times are getting hard for the family, and who descends further into alcoholism every day. It's a tragic story, and helps you to understand the reasons why Travers' is so pernickety about the characters – she knows each one of them so well. This is something that Disney picks up on, and the best moments of the film is shared between these two main characters, leading up to a fantastic ending.<br/><br/>The film's other greatest part is its portrayal of L.A. in the 1960s as a warm, perfect place, and the retro landscapes help so much to draw the audience in. Hancock builds fantastic visual contrasts between 60s California and Australian desert in 1906, and we can adapt to the shift in tone well each time we enter one of the flashbacks. The film's strong script is also a huge merit, and many scenes land big laughs. But it is the performances which make it so great and enjoyable, and why we connect so well with the film. Many may ask whether Travers was really that horrible, or if it's just over egged for the film. Well, that's answered during the credits, with actual recordings of the script sessions, and it's then when you realise just how accurate Thompson's acting is. It's a fantastic and endearing film, perfect for any fan of the original book or film."

This film captures the essence of the era, and IMHO should have received way more accolades than it did. <br/><br/>Thank you Rachel Griffiths for providing such a powerful presence and answering so many childhood questions. You rock on!"
"TxMike","Null","0","1","19 April 2014"," Very captivating story of how Walt Disney eventually convinced P.L. Travers to let him make Mary Poppins.
","Let me get this out of the way up-front, this movie is not necessarily an accurate account, even though it is based on real people and real events. It is about the difficulty Walt Disney had convincing author P.L. Travers to sell his studio the film rights to her book, to make ""Mary Poppins."" But from what I can tell by reading various articles some of the details are different from what actually happened. For example, much of the conceit of the movie is based on P.L. Travers not yet having signed over the rights to make the movie, and her going to Los Angeles to work with the writers was also to get her to sign. In reality she had already done so. <br/><br/>P.L. Travers was the pen name of the author, who was born as Helen Lyndon Goff in Australia in 1899. The movie starts in 1906 when she was 7, and during the 2-hours running time of the movie it flashes back often to her childhood. Her father's name was Travers Goff, an unsuccessful banker and an alcoholic who died young, and memories of her father had a lasting effect on his daughter. Her pen name was likely in memory of her father.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson is P.L. Travers and she plays her as a very severe and tactless person. She may have been a bit more fun-loving in real life, but in this movie she is very aggressive in having her own ideas incorporated into the movie script. In fact she insisted that discussions be tape recorded and we get to hear her actual voice during the end credits. She seemed to be pretty close to Thompson's portrayal.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is good as genial Walt Disney, shown in this movie as being quite involved with the process of fleshing out the movie, but independent reports say he essentially turned it over to his own writers to work with Travers and had very little to do with it until the premiere. <br/><br/>The young Helen is a key character, showing her relationship with her father and her early poetry writing, and she is played very well by young Annie Rose Buckley as ""Ginty"", her father's pet name for her. Her dad is played by Colin Farrell as Travers Goff. Her mother is played by Ruth Wilson as Margaret Goff.<br/><br/>A fine actor, Paul Giamatti has a relatively small role as the limo driver, Ralph, but it adds a nice touch to the story.<br/><br/>In all my wife and I enjoyed the movie, it never seemed long and in fact the story is so interesting I found myself wishing it had gone on a bit longer. It may be a somewhat fictional re-telling of the story, but it is very well made and interesting."

","Saving Mr. Banks is a wonderfully Disneyfied interpretation of how the legendary Walt Disney turned Mary Poppins into one of the most beloved children films of all time. The tale is ripe with music and warmth and the quintessential storytelling that makes a Disney movie wonderful. <br/><br/>Emma Thompson portrays the somewhat stoic and resolute author who refused to sign over the rights to Mary Poppins without being absolutely sure that she will be in good hands. You see the character nit picking in the most determined and intentionally annoying ways before she grudgingly falls in love with the magic that comes along with being involved in a Disney Movie. Tom Hanks was the perfect Walt Disney. He showed the lovable side of Disney that all kids love, but you could see the element of the shrewd and uncompromisingly strict man behind it all.<br/><br/>This movie is funny and sweet, making you laugh and cry. You sing along with all of the familiar tunes (both the Mary Poppins tunes and other jingles found in classic Disney movies) and you smile when you notice the scenes that parallel the iconic Mary Poppins scenes. This movie is for the truest Disney fans who believe, to their core, in Disney magic. And of all the nostalgic feelings that flood through you as you watch, the most prominent of all will be a grand desire to watch what they spent the whole movie trying to create - Mary Poppins. I give this film 8/10"
"TheLittleSongbird","10","0","3","11 April 2014"," As Mary Poppins would say: ""supercalafragalisticexpialidocious""
","One of my personal favourite films of the year for sure. Whether it plays loose with the facts(at the end and with the portrayal of Walt Disney) makes little difference to me, regardless of any inaccuracy it is much more important whether the film in question is well-made, well-acted and has emotional and entertainment value. Saving Mr Banks has all of those. The film is beautifully photographed and the period detail is colourful and in the flashbacks evocative. The music is not inappropriate in style and fits with the tone of the script very well, also when you find yourself singing along to the songs included you know something's right. The story is incredibly engrossing, the cleverly interwoven flashbacks are incredibly poignant especially the latter ones, the backstage business with Travers' battles with the production crew and Walt Disney are informative and entertaining and all the references to Mary Poppins- in how the film was made and Travers' opinions on some aspects, in the songs and what the characters and their behaviour were inspired from(especially with Travers' father and Aunt Ellie)- are easy to spot and make you feel very nostalgic. John Lee Hancock's direction is spit spot, I never found myself bored for a second and the acting is great. Tom Hanks is a joy as Walt Disney and his chemistry with Emma Thompson is more than believable, especially in the scene in her house. Paul Giamatti is incredibly endearing as well, the standout of the supporting cast, though Colin Farrell and Annie Rose Buckley also give very good performances. The best assets of Saving Mr Banks are the script and especially Emma Thompson. The script is very witty comedically and is sharply observant, as well as the constant entertainment it also packs an emotional wallop especially towards the end. Mr Banks' redemption always resonated with me in Mary Poppins especially from an adult perspective, and the same happened in the ending scene(it also compelled me to watch Mary Poppins again, still is one of my favourite films regardless of what Travers thought of it). Thompson is outstanding, Travers is a more interesting character than Walt here but this is her film really so that wasn't an issue, she pitches Travers' stubbornness and cantankerous personality perfectly and there is a melancholic vulnerability in her performance too. Travers doesn't behave at all like a nice person here, but from the flashbacks you can really relate to her and understand why she's the way she is, which aside from context struck me as the reason for why they were included in the first place. Overall, a truly great film and one of the little gems of 2013. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"leonblackwood","7","0","2","30 March 2014"," A joy to watch. 7/10
","Review: I really enjoyed this heart warming story about how Mary Poppins came to the big screen. The main element that I enjoyed about the movie had to be the chemistry between the characters and a very well written script that had wit and an emotion with the little girls story. When you actually hear the real recordings at the end of the movie, you know that Emma Thompson's character must have been murderous to work with, but with the success of the movie, it was worth the hassle. Walt Disney had an eye for making classics that will last in everyone's memory forever, so after waiting 20 years to make this movie, he must have seen something that would have touched everyone's heart which is very rare nowadays. The director done a great job with putting this historical event together, but it has to be the performances that made the movies joy to watch. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: After the disappointing Cloud Atlas and the awful Larry Crowne, it's good to see Tom Hanks coming back to form with Captain Phillips and his performance in this film. Emma Thompson played her part extremely well. alongside the 3 writers and musicians that were helping her, or should I say, be dictated to, make the movie that became and still is an all time classic. Even the young looking Colin Farell played his part well which shows that they must have had faith in the storyline and script. I'm glad that the movie made over double the budget because it well deserved.<br/><br/>Budget: $35million Worldwide Gross: $113million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are interested in the making of Mary Poppins and the emotional ties that the writer had with the storyline. 7/10"

","A film about the making of Mary Poppins seemed at first not to interest me. I was 15 when the real Mary Poppins film came out, much too old to think of it as teenage fare but my neighbor next door five years younger than I kept singing and singing and singing ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious."" Who knew the story behind the story of the making of this movie? This was one of the best films I have seen this year, right up there (although a different film) with the excellence of ""12 Years a Slave."" It has a depth I never in a million years thought it would have had. No spoilers here because truly one has to see it to appreciate its heft. <br/><br/>I loved every minute of it. Kudos to Tom Hanks, Emma Thompson and all the rest who played major (and minor) parts. Each was wonderful. It is a touching, sad, beautiful and uplifting film. One can only hope more films such as this would be made where gratuitous sex, profanity and violent mayhem are absent. Hallelujah, it's about time!"
"LinkGoku","10","0","1","29 March 2014"," Nothing short of a masterpiece!
","Saving Mr. Banks is based on Walt Disney's struggle to achieve his 20 year long promise to his daughters to make Mary Poppins, meanwhile the writer Pamela Travers refused to give permission, all the while reflecting on her past.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks brings Walt back to life in this film, he's mesmerizing. Emma Thompson is Travers and though she can be stubborn, she still brings magic to the screen. Colin Farrel, Paul Giamatti, Jason Schwartzmen and many other great actors and actresses give amazing performances as well.<br/><br/>Emoeions run high in this dramedy that's quite funny at parts while keeping its fantastic, dramatic and inspiring story flowing.<br/><br/>While this movie has a few PG-13 elements its still a must see for everyone!<br/><br/>While there are some differences from this and the real events, they do so to give us more brilliant dialogue and acting.<br/><br/>Don't pass up this masterpiece! Two thumbs up!"
"Wizard-8","Null","0","1","29 March 2014"," Taken as entertainment, it's pretty good
","As some people have pointed out, the idea of the Disney company making a movie about the making of one of their movies at first thought explains why the word ""chutzpah"" was invented. And there is also the bothersome idea that this is yet another example of the truth being distorted on its way to becoming a movie. Despite those potential obstacles, I was surprised that in the end I enjoyed this movie. While the movie at times plays fast and loose with the facts, it does so to make the end results entertaining instead of dry. And the movie all the same manages to succeed in showing how authors can be very protective of their works as well as what often has to be done to translate a book into a movie. Also, the movie manages to show what a real pain in the butt the real P. L. Travers often was to Walt Disney and his associates. As Travers, Emma Thompson gives a great performance. Even Tom Hanks, an actor I normally can't stand, manages like Thompson to disappear in his role as Walt Disney.<br/><br/>The PG-13 rating for the movie seems a little harsh. Though the movie does deal with topics such as alcoholism and attempted suicide, I would have given it a PG rating. However, I am not sure that young children are the right audience for the movie. I suspect they might be bored by the movie's talky spirit and lack of action. Adults and older children with patience seem a better audience for the movie."

","SAVING MR. BANKS, a film directed by John Lee Hancock and starring Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson, is a fantastic film.<br/><br/>Growing up, I was always fascinated by Mary Poppins. From childhood, when I watched the musical classic, to later childhood, when I discovered the books I still hold dear.<br/><br/>In high school, I became very interested with this mysterious write, PL Travers (I didn't even know if she was a woman or a man!). So, I did some research on her and her background. Needless to say, I was shocked - she came from a poor family with an alcoholic father and a suicidal mother and rose above it.<br/><br/>Then, when I learned a year later that her story was being turned into a movie, I was very excited. I raced to the theater on Christmas Day and watched it.<br/><br/>This movie is, simply put, a triumph, practically imperfect in every way. <br/><br/>Whoa, hold on - what? IMPERFECT?! <br/><br/>Yes, imperfect. Let me explain.<br/><br/>From the opening moments to the final scene, Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks (as well as some wonderful supporting actors, including Paul Giamatti and Colin Farrell) show us that no one is perfect - and there's nothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>For instance, Pamela ""PL"" Travers is stubborn, angry, bitter, and (really) dead inside. For so long, she has allowed her anger and bitterness towards everyone fester inside. When Walt Disney asks to make a movie of her beloved Mary Poppins, she is reluctant in every way possible, wanting her work to be untarnished by ""silly cartoons"" and the color red.<br/><br/>Walt Disney himself is pushy, somewhat deceitful, and in the end, he does whatever he pleases to her movie. But he respects her and comforts her in many hours of need.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a wonderful movie about imperfect people. Imperfect people making imperfect movies about imperfect people. And, in the end, we laugh, we cry, we applaud, and we go back into our imperfect world. And that's okay.<br/><br/>That's okay."

","If you've grown up with Disney - and Mary Poppins in particular - you'll find it hard to be objective about this movie. After all, it's a real trip down memory lane; and whether you like that experience or not, the adventure will surely cloud your judgment. So perhaps like me, you'll find yourself trapped in a purgatory of time and place: are you in the past, the present, or nowhere at all??? <br/><br/>Hence the power of this movie! There's the lush back-story of Travers' tainted childhood - enriched by the stunning cinematography that depicts the Australian countryside - and enveloped by the gut wrenching drama of her slowly devolving father. Then there's the ongoing saga of Disney trying to wrestle the story of Mary Poppins from the timeworn Travers. In the end, the tussle becomes a therapeutic exercise for both as they finally wrestle their demons out towards a mutually cathartic end! <br/><br/>The acting by Hanks and Thompson is superb, you'll be squirming from the tension of their dynamic performance. By the time the credits role around, you'll be exhausted; but you'll finally be happy for the sappy tunes laced throughout the movie - a little chim-chim-cherooo will be the sugar that helps this movie-medicine go down!"

Travers for the rest of my life, as I truly understand now what the story meant for her. I will also have a deep respect (as I already do) for Mr. Walt Disney, as the film expresses the deep meaning the story of Mary Poppins had for him as well. To have the background story of the author and the meaning of Mary Poppins unfold is simply awe-inspiring, surprising, emotional, humorous, and exciting.<br/><br/>This film definitely deserves a 10 out of 10, as actors in this film played to the role nearly perfectly.

"rannynm","9","0","1","28 March 2014"," Dramatic Inside Look Behind the Scenes of Mary Poppins
","This is a deeply emotional and inspiring untold story of ""Mary Poppins."" The premise is based on the true journey of Pamela L. Travers (Emma Thompson), the author of the book. We learn it's going to take Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) a lot of hard work to get Ms. Travers to share our favorite flying nanny, Mary Poppins.<br/><br/>This film is totally character driven. Tom Hanks is the first actor to portray Walt in a mainstream film. Tom trained for this by visiting ""The Walt Disney Family Museum"" and talking with Disney's former employees including his daughter Diane Disney Miller. Tom is Walt! He captures the dream, drive, and love for life that Walt believed in and you buy every word he says. They also respect Walt's wishes of never showing him with a lit cigarette. Of course, any leading man has a leading lady and we have a phenomenal portrayal of Ms. Travers by Emma Thompson. Emma trained, like Tom, by listening to the recording of the script read-through and practicing the way Pamela spoke. What adds up is a fantastic performance. You feel her emotion and why she is a stick-in- the-mud. This film's cinematography is spot on. It takes place over time from 1906, with vintage clothing and horse carts, to1961, with old cars and urban settings. The way they shift from time period to time period is flawless. <br/><br/>My favorite scene is when Mrs. Travers observes the film for the first time. You see all of the emotional scarring that she has kept inside her whole life, come out. I can say that Emma's performs this amazingly well.<br/><br/>Honestly, it's hard to pick my favorite character. Surprisingly I choose Ralph (Paul Giamatti), Mrs. Travers' chauffeur. He's the first person who Pamela likes and once you see this film you'll understand how big of an achievement that is. Paul's warm and humble performance has an affect on me that is unexplainable.<br/><br/>The moral of the story is, don't let the past rule your present. Pamela has a hard time giving ""Mary Poppins"" up and, with her sad childhood, you can see why. However, she needs to understand that it's time to let it all go.<br/><br/>I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for 12-18 year olds. This film is little more emotionally heavy than the trailer shows. It's a lighthearted film, but sensitive kids may have difficulty with some scenes. <br/><br/>Reviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST!

","I'll be honest, there was only one reason I watched this film: Tom Hanks as Walt Disney. However, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>While I've seen ""Mary Poppins"" dozens of times in my child years (they're like adult years but you're younger), I honestly didn't think a film about Disney trying to finagle the rights away from author P.L. Travers would have been that interesting of a film but I was surprised by how great of a family film the movie proved to be.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson is simply fantastic as Travers as she captures, pretty much perfectly, a character that is intentionally annoying her rights-suitor, who viciously defends her property, who is deep down a broken and sympathetic character and is amusing the entire time. The scenes she shares with, literally, anyone in the film just keeps the story flowing amazingly well and are a joy to watch. Whether it be her annoying the song writers trying to give her a feel for how the movie is going to be, Walt Disney trying to prove that Poppins is in good hands or just Paul Giamatti's character (Travers' driver) trying to melt her icy façade, all these scenes just work to create a character that is not only interesting to watch but crafts a story that unfolds at a terrific pace and is touching the entire way through.<br/><br/>And you can't forget that the movie gives you Tom Hanks as Walt Disneythat's just awesome! ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a terrific family film that showcases the hoops the Disney company went through to bring the iconic film with Julie Andrews to the screen. The movie is touching, funny and heartwarming and has just the right amount of sap and cheesiness to make it a great family film and great enough to overlook the inaccuracies of Travers being okay with the final product (Spoilers: She actually hated the film and never forgave Disney for it).<br/><br/>Greetings, Earthling!

","When you have Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson in the lead, you can expect nothing but greatness , and this one is nothing short of it. This re imagining of how Walt Disney tries to convince P.L. Travers for securing the rights of her work ""Mary Poppins"" is a very involving and an emotionally drenching tale that is very rare to see in a Hollywood flick.<br/><br/>The story begins with P.L. Travers who is struggling financially as there are no more Mary Poppins books and the royalty from her works have dried up. Reluctant as she was for the past 20 years in giving rights of her work to Mr. Walt Disney , she decides to give it a shot provided the script and the re imagining of the character fulfills her demands and inner satisfaction. the film also features the childhood events of the author and how these events have Mary Poppins, the character. This is a story about how Walt Disney persuades Mrs P.L. Travers and whether or not she will grant those rights , is what the story all about.<br/><br/>It is a simple story , with some fine performances. the characters make you believe they are real.Tom Hanks as Walt Disney and Emma Thompson as P.L. Travers are in fine form. They are flawless in their performance, and makes it look so easy. Also a special mention to the performance of Collin Farrell who played the role of P.L Travers' father with great finesse and honesty. <br/><br/>It is tough to direct a movie that has such a simple story line and John Lee Hancock has done a marvelous job with it .In the end I would like to say that everyone should give this movie a shot for its simplicity, emotional content and overall for the child in you.The honesty with which the movie is shot is not going to disappoint you.

","""George Banks and all he stands for will be saved. Maybe not in life, but in imagination. Because that's what we storytellers do. We restore order with imagination. We instill hope again and again and again."" Who doesn't love Walt Disney? Every day you're confronted with it and most people have grown up with it. Almost every day I watch a Disney cartoon at home and still look with admiration, amazement and sometimes childlike joy at the magic that takes place on the screen. It's a bit forced that I spend my time on that. Especially when you have two little kids of 2 and 4 hopping around at home, begging everyday for another Mickey Mouse, Dumbo, or ask me ""Dad please put on that movie with those two dogs that eat spaghetti"".<br/><br/>The only Disney product I really hate is the movie ""Mary Poppins"" . And that for the following reasons. I can't stand Julie Andrews anymore, because of her contribution to ""The Sound of Music"". That's that Brady Bunch movie with a whole bunch of kids in it, with a lot of campfire songs. Every year I have to endure this monstrosity because it's indefinitely shown on television at the end of the year. Looking at Julie Andrews gives me now spontaneous abdominal cramps. Dick Van Dyke is reason number two. That guy is constantly walking around with an enormous smile as if he has swallowed a coat hanger. Every dentist probably begins to drool spontaneously when this walking Colgate advertising figure appears on the screen. And third, I hate musicals ( For more information about this, see ""The Great Gatsby"" review). ""Mary Poppins"" is the only Disney product that will always fail to impress me.<br/><br/>Now it appears to be that this ""Savings Mr. Banks"" is the story about the struggle between Walt and the author of ""Mary Poppins"", PL Travers, to get the film rights in order to make a movie from this famous book. To my surprise it surely wasn't bad and I can only express my praise on the performances of the protagonists.<br/><br/>The highlight is of course Emma Thompson, who plays an outstanding role as the haughty, transverse and unyielding Travers. If Travers really behaved like this, I'd sent her immediately straight back to London. What a nasty aunt she is. If the tape recordings at the end are authentic, you can only conclude that it was indeed such a monster of a woman. Thompson plays in a convincing way the writer who's to proud to give her favorite character away, so that it would only be used, according to her opinion, for commercial reasons. Sometimes she's also a fragile and sad person since she carries a terrible secret from her past as we'll notice during the movie. Whether these are real facts, I don't know, but it would be a plausible explanation for her behavior. There are some really funny moments in this film like the scene where one of the musicians slips away in a sneaky fast way the music sheet with the title ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"". Superb.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks shows again a natural way of interpretation. As if he actually was Walt Disney. For me, Hanks is currently one of the best actors in Hollywood. He can fully empathize with the role imposed and transform in such a way that he becomes one with the character. Whether he is a captain, a castaway or a stranger at an airport, it seems as if he has many years of experience with this matter. A unique actor with a unique gift.<br/><br/>Colin Farell is also brilliant as the father of Travers. A key figure in the story who constantly tries to enchant his daughter with fairy tales and fabricated stories. It's his way to protect her from the horrible and hostile reality of everyday. It's superb to see his mood swings. A good-hearted man who's knocked out by his alcohol addiction. And finally has a real impact on the future of his daughter.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti took care of the role as personal driver of Travers. A captivating role with a sad impact. He's also the first that made a personal contact with her and ultimately was the only one who she appreciated and she could tolerate. Brilliant supporting role.<br/><br/>The only drawback, but at the same time I realize that it was not technically possible to achieve it in another way, was the constant interruptions by flashbacks. In this way, the past and the influence it had, got interwoven in a beautiful way with the present. The sad thing is that this slowed down the rhythm of the story. Not in an annoying way, but still annoying to me after a while.<br/><br/>Towards the end a few handkerchief moments appear. But that was to be expected. But nevertheless, I still enjoyed this film. A historical narrative that explains the evolution of the movie ""Mary Poppins"". I've seen the movie now, It didn't nerve me, but I'll still maintain the tradition I have with the original movie. I'll probably never see it again! <br/><br/>More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/"

It's the story where Mickey Mouse meets Mary Poppins and, after all the award buzz has settled down, I find it hard to believe that Emma Thompson was skipped. It has to be her finest performance, not missing a beat with her witty, sarcastic dialogue and never missing an opportunity to use her wonderful ability of portraying worlds of emotion through a few glances and lip quivers. <br/><br/>It's hard not to over sell the film in terms of her performance because all actors involved were so on point that to not to see how bright she shines in this role is next to impossible.<br/><br/>The script was captivating. The fact that it was Walt Disney and the author of Mary Poppins was not the captivating point. The dynamic of stubbornly holding onto something precious, and the reasons therefore was captivating. The witty banter was captivating. The flow of events incorporated with the past was captivating.<br/><br/>The films hits a high note in terms of humour from the get go, whisks you into a world of adolescent memories and peaks with so much hope. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is an impeccable film that touches on one of the most memorable children movies of all time."

","This movie tells a beautiful story. I had no idea of what was behind Mary Poppins, so I went to see this movie with the thoughts that would only be about the making of a movie with a cranky author. It turned out to be a very touching story about family and love. This movie reminded me why cinema can be important in our lives, why after 15 years Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and all those characters are still in our hearts. Growing up doesn't mean we're going to stop loving these stories because they we're part of growing up and part of our families. Saving Mr.Banks shows exactly that and it's lovely to see that Disney was a man that truthfully cared about what he and others created. More technically speaking, Emma Thompson did a great job, in my opinion (I was actually a bit sad that she was completely dismissed from Oscars, Golden Globes, etc.) and Tom Hanks walked with her very well. It's a family story and it warms up our heart. Not all of us will connect to the characters very easy, but Mrs. Travers will challenge you not to laugh on her very direct answers. I think that even those who aren't completely fans of this sort of movies will have a nice time with this one. Certainly recommend it!"

Johnny Depp's 'Finding Neverland' tells about behind the creation of a magical land and Peter Pan. So there are many other movies about theme like this. This movie is as well based on such kinda story which unleashes creation of the most celebrated musical-children movie 'Mary Poppins' from its book.<br/><br/>Characters like the author of 'Mary Poppins' book, Travers played by Emma Thompson and Walt Disney played by Tom Hanks filled the screen with interesting moments of history. Especially the cultural differences between two countries, England and United States brought lots of humorous scenes to us. The story telling splits into two where one briefs the author's real life incident when she was a child lived in Australia. And another one was about Walt Disney's struggle by the threats from Travers, while being adapted the book into a movie.<br/><br/>Both the characters, Travers and Disney had an uncompromising relationship in the story. Where Travers was fighting not to go wrong in the movie adaptation because the characters from her book means a lot to her. On the other hand, Disney's fight to keep what he promised to his children to make a movie from their favourite book. <br/><br/>One of the best movie of the year. Tom Hanks was okay in a role of 'father of animation'. But I was impressed with the Emma Thompson and also the Collin Ferrell. Paul Giamatti's role was small but wonderfully portrayed. No wonder why this movie got nominated for 2014 Oscar in the music section. Was expecting it to win but failed to do, so sad."

","Saving Mr. Banks dramatizes the story behind the Disney classic Marry Poppins, which reveals the dislikes of the author, P.L. Travers, towards the vision of Walt Disney and his crew to her beloved book. The promotions promise to explore the relationship between the author and the filmmakers that then eventually lead to the existence of the said film. But most of the time, this is Travers' story about how this tale means to her life. The two sided stories are compelling enough, though there are times that feels a little lacking, but nevertheless, it is a quite fun light entertainment.<br/><br/>One side of the movie is Travers' troubled childhood that was at first illusioned by his father's stories until reality fades it into something less magical. The other side is where Hollywood wanted to make her work look shallow in comparison which results to a personal outrage. Her demands sounded preposterous at the start, but thanks to the constant flashbacks it surely takes a lot of time explaining her thoughts by reflecting the pain from the past every time there is a contradiction coming.<br/><br/>What's a bit disappointing here is the author's relationship with Walt Disney doesn't seem enough, like Disney is just a friend that sometimes appear with hardly any build up. The most memorable bits of the pre-production segment are the ones when it's making a joke out of Travers' demands. It's easy to understand that she's difficult to work with, but nice conversations with the people she bumped into seems to be the only solution to calm her down. Things may get too easy around, in other terms, it provides a warmth that we rarely get in movies in a while.<br/><br/>It was the actors who made it so likable. Emma Thompson is terrific, she gives more depth than anything else here by realistically delivering whatever P.L. Travers has to express. Tom Hanks brings a charming enthusiasm that nicely fits to Walt Disney. The rest like Jason Schwartzman, B.J. Novak, and Paul Giamatti adds up the delight to its lightheartedness.<br/><br/>The real story of the making of Mary Poppins wasn't actually as ultimately pleasant as this movie portrayed. It would have been more satisfying if it wasn't too afraid to be too negative on the situation, but by the way, this is a Walt Disney production, how could this be a less nicer play? In other mindset, this is a totally feel-good movie that is loyal to the genre's emotion and heart, and I don't think anyone wouldn't like to have that kind of pleasant experience. Saving Mr. Banks is already pretty amiable to be enjoyed."

","I, as an enormous fan of the 1964 film of Mary Poppins probably came into this movie with higher expectations than most. I was not disappointed in any way.<br/><br/>I feel that both the film, and the two leads' performances have been for the most part ignored by many of the Film boards (possibly due to the number of great films made in the past year, but also could be an unwanted by-product of being a 'Disney' film). Emma Thompson was phenomenal and Tom Hanks was also very good. I enjoyed many of the supporting performances too - Paul Giamatti, Jason Schwartzman and Colin Farrell just to name a few. The soundtrack had a great blend between songs from the movie and new score. The flashbacks and present-day scenes were skilfully woven together, and neither story-line dominated too much.<br/><br/>Another delightful side-effect of this movie is a new layer when watching Mary Poppins. It was particularly amusing to see what demands of Travers' had been ignored! If you are a fan of the original film, you are almost guaranteed to enjoy this one. If not, you will probably still enjoy this film, but not to the same extent.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"hkauteur","7","0","1","25 February 2014"," HK Auteur film review - Saving Mr. Banks
","As a writer, it is my opinion that how authors view the film adaptation of their own work is irrelevant and inconsequential to the quality of the adaptation itself. For example, whether Stephen King appreciates Stanley Kubrick's The Shining fundamentally does not make it a lesser film. This is the central question presented in John Lee Hancock's Saving Mr. Banks. <br/><br/>The story recounts Author P.L. Travers (Mary Poppins), writer of Mary Poppins, reluctantly meeting with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks), who seeks to adapt her book for the big screen. As they are collaborating on the film adaptation, Travers reflects on her childhood growing up in Australia with her father (Colin Farrell), revealing her own personal attachments to the Mary Poppins story. <br/><br/>Emma Thompson breathes a great inner life into P.L. Travers, humanizing a role that is greatly restrained and otherwise very unlikable. Tom Hanks, combining his star persona and natural ease, gives us a living and breathing Walt Disney. Hanks makes everything look so easy. Colin Farrell turns an affecting performance as Travers' chronic alcoholic father Travers Goff, and also props to Annie Rose Buckley as the young P.L. Travers. The heart of the story lies in the flashback segments, as we see P.L. Travers' past with his father in Australia and it shows that P.L. Travers essentially wrote Mary Poppins as wish fulfillment.<br/><br/>Director John Lee Hancock balances the material perfectly. Even though I fundamentally disagree with Travers' persnickety demand of complete faithfulness, I empathize deeply with why she was so overprotective of her own material. It makes for much of the laughs as we watch the gloom Travers single-handedly killing all the child-like enthusiasm of the staff at Disney. <br/><br/>It is probably best to see Mary Poppins first to get a more wholesome experience, as seeing the numerous classic scenes and songs that Travers could have prevented from ever being created gives a whole other level of tension. Also, stay for the credits for a surprise easter egg. Despite probably being overshadowed in terms of awards recognition, Saving Mr. Banks is a very enjoyable experience. Audience will find laughs and tears, as it is a well-made feel good movie.<br/><br/>For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com"
"gkeith_1","10","0","2","25 February 2014"," I DO love the singing and dancing!
","Opposite of Ms. Travers Goff, I DO like the singing and dancing in Mary Poppins. I always have. In fact, if you read my other almost 200 IMDb reviews, you will see that those are my main criteria for judging a movie.<br/><br/>What a dull Poppins movie we would have had without the song and dance. I also truly LOVED Dick Van Dyke in Poppins movie. I do not recall Saving Mr. Banks explaining why Travers Goff did not want Dick Van Dyke.<br/><br/>Then there are the PENGUINS. They are so sweet, and such smart waiters. I liked seeing the tall human-acted penguins at the premiere of Poppins. You can tell that Ms. Travers Goff (I can only think to call her that) must have needed money pretty badly to put up with all the merrymaking changes to her droll movie she thought she'd end up with.<br/><br/>So, was Colin Farrell really Mr. Banks? I don't remember Farrell with a kite or putting up with that silly (not my opinion) suffragist (suffragette is the wrong historical term) ""nonsense"" (also not my opinion). Farrell played a handsome dude not looking like his rather plain, bookish poetry-writing oldest daughter. Somehow the mother was very unhappy, since ""Ginty"" seemed to dote on dear old dad and not on the hard-working slave-driven mama.<br/><br/>Ginty as a child looked way too tall to ride on her father's back. I think that looked pretty unrealistic, if not rather bizarre and smacking of some sort of a little too smarmy relationship with the child IMO.<br/><br/>So the daughter grew up with major thoughts of dear old dad, yet not much was opined about how she tried to save her adult mother from suicidal drowning. Maybe mama was jealous of Ginty and dad being a little-or-a-lot too close, if you get my drift. The young Ginty actress looked tall enough to be on the verge of puberty, etc., etc.<br/><br/>What a mean-spirited P.L. toward Disney himself! Walt had paid for her hotel and air transportation, meals, chauffeur service, etc., etc., yet the English brat was extremely rude. If she hated America so much, she should not have even crossed the pond. Of course, you did not see any such British tycoon offering her a fortune to convert her stories into a film.<br/><br/>I liked Tom Hanks' performance. He seemed to portray the stereotyped Disney with manners, dignity and aplomb. I feel that the character had a very difficult time not wanting to out and out slug the ungrateful Britisher.<br/><br/>Milk first, and then tea. Don't get me wrong. I really liked this movie, because it gave a lot of warm feelings and remembrances. I also liked the Poppins movie clips, although I feel they were too short. I liked the portrayals of the Sherman brothers when they sang, danced and played the movie characters.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I am always fascinated by really life stories. Saving Mr Banks is more than what I expected: it skilfully meshes a few stories together on the same theme â€“ fatherly love to his children x 3; the power of imagination x 3; go after your dream x 2.<br/><br/>The main story line is how Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) and his team work with British writer P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) to put her popular children's book Mary Poppins onto the silver screen. Disney, as a promise to his daughter, has been negotiating with P.L. Travers for over 20 years for her approval. Travers has not been willing to give it away but softened because she is financially challenged. So naturally she wants to have final say in writing the script.<br/><br/>While Saving Mr Banks is pleasant, enjoyable and entertaining, there is a certain kind of heaviness which keeps me intrigued until the deal is finally settled. I like this movie very much because it is so rich and so nicely crafted. I can see the whole production pays a lot of respect to the writer and those who do creative work. To work with artists, we really need a lot of patience. <br/><br/>To pave the background of how Travers has evolved into today's state, we see seamless flashbacks of Travers in Australia when she was a little girl and how her father (Colin Farrell) encouraged her to dream and travel in her world of fantasy. A frustrated bank manager, Travers' father had his own problems which Travers tried but was unable to solve. Perhaps this helplessness has turned into her hang-ups thereafter. <br/><br/>Along the line we see excerpts of Mary Poppins, both in text and rehearsals, which also intertwines with Travers' memory of her father and the final Disney movie.<br/><br/>Very rich content with detailed depiction of the main characters and their emotions. Excellent direction and storytelling skills by images. Even though there are three of four stories lines, I am fully engaged and never feel confused. I enjoy looking at what is happening while wondering how the past affect the present and future. The artistic direction is great as it threw in lots of cues to link the different stories so it is also like watching a detective story. <br/><br/>Emma Thompson plays perfectly the role of a rigid, frigid, cold, tensed and vulnerable PL Travers. Although we constantly see the flashbacks and how her past haunts her present, there still is a lack of connection on how the lovely and imaginative girl would evolve into such an distrusting, demanding and difficult person. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks is moving when he is seen flying personally to London (even though it did not happen in real life) to track Travers down and unlock her hang-ups with the past by exposing/sharing his own unflattering past in earnest sincerity, teary-eyed. Both characters have a difficult childhood. Both bring happiness to millions of kids after they grow up, perhaps as a kind of compensation and healing? But then why did one develop into an optimist and the other a nagger who became so harsh on herself and everyone around her? This is perhaps an issue we need to ponder. <br/><br/>It is a great piece for parents/teachers/adults to watch because we might never realize how even a tiny gesture/word of ours could have immense affect (constructively or destructively) on our children/next generation. Quite a rich movie to munch on and gives you more hope on humanity.<br/><br/>Very meticulous research done. I particularly enjoy the end of credits where the actual tapes of PL Travers are played and we can really feel her nitpicking. Emma Thomson nailed it right there! Also running along the credits are archive pictures of the real PL Travers and Walt Disney. Valuable history.<br/><br/>Cannot wait to see Mary Poppins which I have not seen before. Knowing the background of the author, it probably helps to appreciate this award-winning picture that snatched five Oscars in 1965 after going through a lot of hardship to be put on the big screen. After all, it represents an extension of a girls' love for her beloved father and she has been healing herself by writing, something her father had always encouraged her to do."
"Prismark10","7","0","1","14 February 2014"," The Mary Poppins story
","Saving Mr Banks wants to tell the real story behind the making of the film Mary Poppins.<br/><br/>What we have is a fictionalised tale. Something made more digestible for Disney and the general public.<br/><br/>The real Mrs Travers might had been a curmudgeon and when she cries at the premiere of the film, it was likely to be at disgust at the travesty they made of her book.<br/><br/>The film tries to go to the heart of Mary Poppins, the magical nanny and the effect she has on the Banks family. To this we have flashbacks to the Mrs Travers family life in Australia and that of her bank manager father and his drink problem.<br/><br/>We also have Walt Disney whose children loved the book Mary Poppins, trying to obtain film rights by using his charm and guile.<br/><br/>Maybe Tom Hanks is maybe a bit too winning and charming as Disney, a man who had a bit of a dark side. In real life Walt Disney had little time for Mrs Travers.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson nails Mrs Travers as the difficult to get on with author, desperately in need of money but reluctant to let go of her book.<br/><br/>The film also has good acting turns from Paul Giamatti and Jason Schwartzman. The film is at its best with the making of the film and when Disney is at his persuasive best.<br/><br/>The film does drag a little with the flashbacks and maybe a few too many scenes with Travers being bad tempered."

","The best part about the film is that it starts with a positive note and ends on a positive note. Don't go to this movie for Tom Hanks he is brilliant as always but it is Emma Thompson who has done a marvelous job, portraying role of an impulsive lady and taking everyone else as a nincompoop. The movie starts slow and the viewers have to give full attention in the beginning just to enjoy the fruits of their patience in the later parts of the movie. The director John Lee Hancock has done a great job however, the screenplay of the movie is awesome in other words Supercalifragilisticexpialidocius as described in the movie.<br/><br/>Go watch it but be patient because only once you have uncovered the thick skin you can get full taste of coconut."

","I don't know who is Mary Poppins, or neither P.L. Travers before I watched the movie. And now I do remember Pamela, Walt, Mary Poppins and will no longer simply consider Mickey Mouse as a ridiculous toy. I cannot help bursting into tears when the song came out at the last scene. It reminded me of The Killers's song at that last moment:""are we human? or are we dancers?"" When reality crashes a dreamer's Neverland, can he just survive in a fictional world? It seems that people who survive in the reality will not save Mr. Banks. The movie begins with a dream unachievable, a knot unsolved and a woman untouchable.

"TiagoRicardo","8","0","1","2 February 2014"," A great film for the entire family
","I've only seen ""Mary Poppins"" last week and I was amazed with almost everything. ""Mary Poppins"" it's definitely a wonderful film for the entire family and a proof of all the magic that Disney it's capable of bringing to the world of cinema. Yesterday, after seeing Disney's ""Saving Mr. Banks"" I must confess that I was really lucky for seeing ""Mary Poppins"" on the television. Even thought the fact that the 3 minute-long trailer ruined almost the entire plot of the film, I felt happy and moved by this heart-warming story about how Walter convinced P. L. Travers (i mean Mrs. P.L. Travers). The performances of Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson are really wonderful to watch. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" it's not just a great way to honor ""Mary Poppins"" and all the work of Walt Disney. I think, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" also adds a bit of magic to the flying nanny story. The plot of the film drives the audience to the life of Pamela Travers (the creator of Mary Poppins), after accepting a deal made by Walt Disney to adapt her story to the big screen. At the beginning, Pamela Travers connection to Mary Poppins it's a bit difficult to understand because she rejects some of the ideas that actually made ""Mary Poppins"" a wonderful and touching musical. Days after days, she continues to reject ideas from Disney until they come up with an idea to make her happy. And that idea (the ending scene of ""Mary Poppins"") gave the movie, that touch of magic that I was expecting from Disney. And after the revelation of that idea, the audience finally realizes the connection among Pamela and Mary ""Mary Poppins and the Banks' are family to me"". And that connection it's the reason why I felt moved with all the film, because after that moment all the pieces are finally together. So, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" it's not just a ""documentary"" about ""Mary Poppins"", it's about the real meaning of the flying nanny that comes when winds in the east. After seeing it, you will feel moved, happy and you will want to ear one more time ""Let's Go Fly A Kite"". ""Saving Mr. Banks"" it's a fantastic movie for all the family!"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","1","31 January 2014"," Down memory lane
","I wasn't at all sure but had a hunch, and I was right! The movie opened with a few bars of introduction and then the crispy delight of Chim Chimney, the only song that can sound so bouncy and cheerful in a minor key. I knew immediately that I would be entertained with a trip down memory lane. Recounting the story behind the making of ""Mary Poppins"", ""Saving Mr. Banks"" liberally sprinkled ""in"" line such as: ""Close your mouth, we are not a codfish"". But that is far from what the movie has to offers. For the first time, I was enlightened with the fact that there is quite a true story leading to the legendary movie finally appearing on the silver screen, a story that traversed two decades, as a matter of fact. Nor is this one of your recent proliferation of ""inspired by a true story"" or ""some of these really happened"" stock. At the closing credit, the audience is treated to a parade of yellow-brown-faded photographs, replicas of all the real characters in the movie. To top it all, these final credits concluded with a tape recorder playing back what you saw in the movie: word by word recording of the sessions discussing the script as requested, nay, demanded, by author P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson who, for some outrageous, mysterious reasons, was omitted in this year's Oscar nomination).<br/><br/>This movie is actually in three layers of which ""Mary Poppins"", the movie as well as the book, is one. Those of us who love that movie would be delighted by anecdotes, be they actual or artistically created, on the birth of the many songs that we had been humming in our dreams in more than a half-century. Whether it actually happened that way recounted in the movie (and I have no reason to suspect that it did not), it is fun to note that ""down"" in ""medicine go down"" was initially going DOWN in the musical scale which seemed just natural until it dawned on the Sherman Brothers (B. J. Novak, Jason Schwartzman, both excellent) that ending the phrase going UP added so much more zest to the melody.<br/><br/>The second and third layer were narrated in parallel: the central story of the culmination, in L.A., of a 20-year struggle of Walt Disney (Tom Hanks, at his best as usual) to secure the filming right of Travers's popular book and the background story of Helen Goff, as a child nicknamed Ginty (Annie Rose Buckley, another shining child star in the making) living in poverty in Allora, Australia in the early 1990s with her father Travers Goff (Colin Farrell, good and not quite as you have seen before)and the rest of the family. The fact that P. L. Travers used her father's first name as her pen name is as revealing as it can get. Inasmuch as the titular role invariably takes the spotlight, ""Mary Poppins"" is really about the relationship between a father Mr. Banks and his children. While Ginty carried the guilt (which she should not have) of not being able to save her irresponsible (yet endearing) father, P. L. Travers desperately wanted the workaholic Mr. Banks saved. It was insightful Disney, however, who delivered her and brought her final absolution.<br/><br/>I would be doing a grave injustice if I don't mention Paul Giamatti, in a minor role as Ralph the chauffeur assigned by Disney to Travers. If anyone is truly magical in the movie, it's him. Completely unassuming and apparently totally overwhelmed by Travers's character, Ralph is no fool. When Travers, completely fed up by his repeated mention of the beautiful sunshine (it turned out that there's reason behind it), she lecture him ""Rains bring life"". Very mildly but with absolute composure, he replied ""So does sunshine"". At one point towards the end, Travers intimated to Ralph ""You are the only American I like"". At the end though (without her specifically announcing it) to that list was added a few more, including Disney and her creative team. I don't think she went so far as to like the animated penguins though.<br/><br/>A witty comedy, some poignant moments, not quite Oscar Best Picture material, but a wonderful trip down memory lane and more."

","There is just something about watching Tom Hanks be Tom Hanks. It's just this warm, comfortable feeling, seeing that man light up the screen. It's almost like the feeling you get watching a Disney movie. Saving Mr. Banks, Disney's new movie starring Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks, gives us the opportunity to do both of those things.<br/><br/>Hanks is fantastic as Walt Disney, who spends his days trying to court stuffy British author P.L. Travers (Thompson) into allowing his studio to adapt her Mary Poppins for the screen. What ensues, as you can imagine, is a cat-and-mouse comedy about her ridiculous demands and Disney's attempts to overcome them. <br/><br/>You see, Disney wants to be accommodating. Decades before the film's 1961 setting, Walt made a promise to his young daughters to make a movie out of Poppins, a promise he takes incredibly seriously and pursues for over twenty years. When Travers, who refuses to write new material, begins to run out of money, she is strongly advised to meet with Disney in California to hear his offer for the film rights to her novel.<br/><br/>Travers, however, wants complete control over the entire production. She routinely insults Disney and his silly animation, making him promise that no cartoons would find their way into a film of Poppins. She also disapproves of songwriters Robert and Richard Sherman (B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman, respectively), and takes issue with the casting of the picture, particularly that of Dick Van Dyke.<br/><br/>Over the course of these weeks-long negotiations, the narrative is constantly being interrupted by persistent flashbacks to Travers' childhood in Australia. Her alcoholic father (Colin Farrell) inspires her imagination, but also serves as the reason for her bitterness as an adult.<br/><br/>Saving Mr. Banks is a lovely film in many regards, in particular its acting. Hanks is wonderful as Disney, and his final monologue, delivered from a stationary position while sitting down, is testament to how much he can do with a simplistic setting. Another standout is the always- great Paul Giamatti, playing Travers' chauffeur. Giamatti has no business in a role this insignificant, but takes the dialogue he is given and turns it to pure gold. His performance had me choked up more than once.<br/><br/>Despite its good qualities, Banks has numerous pitfalls, as well. Its script has ""Disney"" written all over it. Much of the dialogue is hokey and transparent, even in the hands of professionals like Thompson and Hanks. The flashback sequences are spread throughout the film in such a way that we get one scene in the present followed by one flashback, and so on. Structuring the picture in such a manner diminishes the real story (Travers vs. Disney) and instead tries to convince us that Travers' origin story is equally as important. This may be, but it is nowhere near as compelling, and its predictable end comes too late for the drama of the main storyline to redeem it. Director John Lee Hancock would have done better to have contained the flashbacks to a few lengthier sequences and wrapped them up at about the two-thirds mark of the two-plus hour running time.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with Saving Mr. Banks, though, is Travers herself. She never becomes a likable or relate-able character, even after the big reveal of why she is so embittered. Walt Disney's charm may break down Travers' psychological walls, but cannot demolish those built between Travers and the viewer throughout the picture. Thompson turns in a great performance, but the movie would have been more effective if told from Disney's perspective rather than Travers'."

","My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was a surprise for my husband who thought it would be boring. Be sure to stay to the end credits to hear the real Mrs Travers tape. The only disappointment, and it was a slight one, is that they obviously did not film the Australian flashback scenes in Australia. As an Australian, and Sydneysider, the initial houses looked like those out of Ocean Township N.J, not innerwest Sydney. The verandah on the outback house was closer but not quite right, especially with the large oak, not a gumtree beside it. We don't really have palm trees like in California. Anyway, it would have been a bit more authentic if they had filmed those bits in Australia but the acting from Farrell and the young girl playing a young Travers more than made for it. Emma Thompson was amazing - my mum insists on her tea being made exactly the same way and they even look similar (not ordinarily- just ET's appearance and manner in this film) :)"

","This is Walt Disney's first ""biography"", in a way of speaking--more specifically, it is how Mary Poppins flew to Hollywood. Emma Thompson (who also played an earlier nanny in the short lived Nanny McPhee franchise some years early) really conveys P.L.Travers's frequent reluctance and selfishness yet also her talent and magic, with Tom Hanks, no less as ""Walt"" (he didn't require titles to address him. Everyone was on a first name basis with him), fitting right into the role... You;ll see supporting plays like Paul Giamatti as the kindly limo driver who has the only true friendship with P.L.Travers, B.J.Novak & Jason Shwartzman as the famed Oscar winning songwriting Shermans, Bradley Whitford as Disney scribe Donald Da Gradif and even the famed Disney secretaries,(unsung actresses Kathy Baker as Tommie and Melanie Saxsson, who is real funny, as Dolly, the one who is in the sessions and brings snacks.) No fancy snacks, no animated Penguins or anything, no songs...you've heard all the (generally considered impossible to deal with) P.L.Travers requests. You'll see childhood Australian 1906 flashbacks of P.L., and you'll find out her real name and the reason for her temper later, in 1961. You'll also see that P.L. was both nice as a kid and only human as an adult, and that Walt Disney could be practically (to use Mary Poppins's obviously favorite adverb there) stubborn as P.L. was. You can hear the songs that the Shermans play, even an actual tape recording as P.L.Travers in real life and on screen insisted on. So, have a spoonful of sugar and see this. And Mr.Banks, of course, was the dad, both in real life and in the movie.I won't spoil what P.L.Travers real name is but the discussion board would have the answer.:)"

","Not to tread on the movie's qualities, but it actually made me want to see Mary Poppins. The story behind the making of one of the most beloved Disney movies of all time showed how much the books meant to the author and, how deep down, P.L Travers searched for her happy ending. Emma Thompson brings the essence of this complicated character to the screen and manages, in the end, to make us connect with her. I must say that I found the woman to be quite obnoxious at first, and while it did take quite a long time, I eventually found myself rooting for her. Tom Hanks just won me over with his portrayal of Walt Disney, a man that with an empire that wants to add another jewel, yet a one with a certain significance to his family, namely his daughters. To Disney, making Mary Poppins is a promise he must keep, and he will stop at nothing to persuade Pamela to sign the rights and stick with the project. Having watched the movie I know understand the title, as it resonates with the most important person in Travers's life: her alcoholic yet caring father which is played superbly by Colin Farrell. In the end, the movie comes down to letting go of something personal and refusing to see it generalized as a light cartoon. I supported Traver's cause and after all the problems that precede it, all I wanted to do was see Mary Poppins come to life.<br/><br/>Rating 7/10"

","Saving Mr. Banks is extraordinary and impeccably ""Disney"". It is charmingly funny, heart touching and a beautiful story giving insights into the creation of Mary Poppins. I was not expecting to like this movie to this extent, but as it progressed I was immersed and completely awe struck. The weaving of the past and present was beautifully executed and brought authenticity to the story also justifying the hardened exterior of Mrs. Travers in the film. As for the characters, Tom Hanks, Collin Farrell and Emma Thompson were marvelous. If anyone could bring Walt Disney's personality to life, it was definitely Tom Hanks in saving Mr. Banks. Although we did not see as much of his personality as we saw Mrs.Travers', I found him to impersonate the role rather well. Even though Mrs. Travers is portrayed to be difficult and unable to be pleased, we continue to love and sympathize with her. We understand her need to project her father positively despite his setbacks. Mrs. Travers loves her father endlessly and in many ways wants so desperately for her real life to have had an alternate ending. When Walt Disney provides this to her through the film, she is relieved and finally pleased. For the first time at the end of the film we see her be able to peacefully come to terms with her past without feeling like she has disappointed her father. At the end of the film we see Mrs. Travers empowered by her emotions as she has finally seen a portrayal of her father in a way that she had always desired and imagined, but in many ways had also been the way she saw him despite his flaws that we see during her troubled childhood. She did not see her father as a cruel man and wanted to conserve her image of him in every way she could. Walt Disney provided her with an alternate and more hopeful ending to her troubles and reality. As a storyteller he attempted to ""restore order with imagination, instilling hope again and again"" (slightly paraphrased). I have not mentioned Mary Poppins at all, as this is the story of how the film came to life. The main focus in this film is mainly on the relationship between Mrs. Travers and her father, between Walt and Mrs. Travers and between Mrs. Travers and the ever so personal and imaginative world created through her book. Mary Poppins is in essence a savior and an idea of hope, a hope that Mrs. Travers/Helen had as a child of saving her father and the very hopefulness that was regained through Disney's film, Mary Poppins. Overall, I absolutely loved this film because of the characters, the story being told and everything about it. I love that the film is about hope and attaining it through imaginative and creative ways. I would definitely recommend this film to everyone!"

","Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) continues his 20 year negotiation with P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) author of the Mary Poppins children's books. Disney flies Travers to the Beverly Hills hotel, because he made a promise to his little girls that he would turn the books into a movie. Travers hates the songs, she hates the first draft of the script, and she refuses to animate any of her characters. While negotiations drag on, Travers recalls her not-so-idyllic childhood with her father, Travers Goff (Colin Farrell) and mother Margaret Goff. (Ruth Wilson) Does Disney ever get the book rights to the Mary Poppins books?<br/><br/>The answer to the question is pretty obvious, so that's not where the drama lies in this movie. The drama in Saving Mr. Banks emerges from P.L. Travers backstory, which contains a lot more pathos and pain than I expected, I thought this movie would be light, jaunty, family fare, but it's more than that. Saving Mr. Banks is a real emotional powerhouse, and it comes to that emotion honestly, not through tried and true tearjerker shortcuts. There are also funny and sweet moments like seeing how the songs were constructed, and hearing the vast emotional range of the songs in Mary Poppins.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. Tom Hanks is at the top of his game playing the amiable, happy-go-lucky Walt Disney. The world is Disney's oyster, and he's sure he can charm Travers into turning over the book rights to Disney. Hanks turns on the charm full tilt, but what makes his role special, is that when the role demands seriousness, Hanks delivers. Emma Thompson has the hardest role in this movie, she is the one rejecting all the script modifications and turning down the money, but Thompson plays Travers expertly, not as a harpy or shrew, but as a loving human being who wants to stay true to the characters she created. Thompson's matronly manner also adds a comedic edge to the role. Bradley Whitford, Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak, add some excellent comedy relief, and Paul Giamatti adds a touching note in a smaller role. Young Annie Rose Buckley does an excellent job in a pivotal role as Ginty.<br/><br/>The writing is excellent, the director moves the pace along, and I don't think the professional actors in this movie need a lot of help from the director in terms of line readings.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful movie, not just for kids, but it has a lot of emotional heft for adults. Saving Mr. Banks is a true family film.<br/><br/>For more reviews that are money in the bank, visit my blog reviewswithatude.wordpress.com"

","Touching and heartwarming, any cynicism I had about Fairy Tales have been washed away.<br/><br/>Pundits might complain that ""It didn't happen that way"" - and in doing so, completely missed the point.<br/><br/>I admit, I was biased going in. I grew up dreaming every day about my first trip to Disneyland. I grew up watching the Wonderful World of Disney. I saw Mary Poppins, more times than I should admit, and wished I had hopped into the drawing with Bert and Mary. So for me Saving Mr. Banks was wonderfully nostalgic. And that would have been enough.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson was fantastic, and that would have been enough (I am a bit surprised she did not get a Best Actress bid).<br/><br/>But this movies gives us much more.<br/><br/>A masterful retelling of true events that throws the main character, and us, into our own personal Fairy Tale. The demons are our own, and that makes the hope that much more tangible. <br/><br/>It's why we tell stories in the first place, and this movie reminds us of that."

","Saving Mr Banks was a Surprisingly amazing flick. I heard great things about, so I went to see it for myself and It made me realize how much I loved the movie Mary Poppins as a kid. The movie was really accurate on the actual life story. Emma Thompson is great as P.L. Travers and Tom Hanks as Walt Disney. Pretty good job as usual. It took m awhile to get used to Hanks Playing Disney. But after 5 minutes of seeing him. I completely forgot it was Hanks. In the movie there are flashback scenes, going into the past of P.L. Travers. People complain that that the scenes feel to fantasy like. There really not. Those flashbacks scenes are told through Travels Prospective. Which actually makes it really good. This was probably the most adult Disney movie ever released by the studio. Now my only problem with that is, if Disney keeps going in the adult direction, will the studio be family orientated anymore. Maybe that's why we have touchstone pictures. Anyway, It was a really good flick to end off 2013. Great Story, acting, great scenery, I loved it. Can't wait to get it on Blu-Ray."
"ayoreinf","9","0","1","19 January 2014"," So it's not the whole truth, but who cares
","There's one flow in the logic of this masterful film that makes you realize you don't see the whole truth of the story behind the struggle between P.L.Travers, and Walt Disney over the rights for Mary Poppins. I mean there're so many things she opposed with passion, and we still know the film was almost exactly as first presented to P.L.Travers, something more should have happened for her not only to give the rights for the story to Disney the way it was finally made. Thing is, I just saw the film, I realized this flaw was in the script and I still didn't care. It was all made so superbly that even the tear-jerker minutes abundant in this movie are forgiven. Emma Thompson is simply superb, as the bitter angry woman, forced to sell her only bankable treasure. As it was already mentioned in one of the previous reviews here, making this bitter misanthropic character likable, is a task only one of the very best could master. Tom Hanks, is as superb as her, I still remember Walt Disney presenting his TV hour, only problem is I'm not sure if I remember him doing it or Tom Hanks, with very little apparent makeup, Hanks simply is Disney, at least the way that Disney's company want us to remember him, but as Hanks plays him - that's the way we also want to remember him. The rest of the cast is as stellar as the two leads - not a single false note in the symphony. The story flows superbly cutting between P.L. Travers memories of her childhood, her lonely life at the time of the main story, and the Disney studio glimpses of the would be film offered to the unrelenting author. Most of the jokes are very gentle ones almost Britishly understated, and it works for the film.<br/><br/>Bottom line, it may not be exact history, but it's definitely a good story told as engagingly as possible in my book, and I liked it for this very reason."

","I went into this movie not expecting a whole lot. I only vaguely remember watching the Mary Poppins movie a single time when I was a little kid (I'm 23 now) and I've never read the book. I enjoy Disney as much as the next person, but I'm not a super fan or anything.<br/><br/>I was under the impression that this movie would be boring when my parents and I were getting tickets to the movie. My parents paid for me, which was the only reason why I agreed to go. The concept for the movie didn't exactly jump out at me.<br/><br/>Well, I just saw it and I can happily say that this movie proved me wrong! It was absolutely bedazzling. The acting was top notch and the story was passionate, heavy, emotional, and heartfelt. It definitely was NOT boring. I caught myself tearing up a few times throughout the movie. It tells an emotional, heavy, and, at times, dark story that I was not expecting. That doesn't mean to say that I didn't leave feeling good, because I definitely did! This movie has a lot of charisma and it is just a joy to watch.<br/><br/>As I said before, the acting is top notch. Emma Thompson does a great job at making a very layered and complicated character. There's a lot more to this character than meets the eye.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks does great at Walt Disney, and I enjoyed B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman as the Sherman brothers. Colin Farrell also has an important role and he does very well.<br/><br/>I especially enjoyed all the old Mary Poppins songs they used in the movie.<br/><br/>This movie reminded me a lot of Finding Neverland.

"tavm","9","0","1","15 January 2014"," Saving Mr. Banks was a nice, if a bit fictionalized, account of P.L. Travers' visit to the Walt Disney studio and her encounters with the man herself
","Just watched this film with my movie theatre-working friend who is a die-hard Disney fan (mainly because of his constant visits to Disney World). So he loved this movie that he previously watched before and I liked it very much even though I knew that many scenes were fictionalized like the idea that Ms. P.L. Travers would eventually love what Walt did to her character Mary Poppins on film. As Uncle Walt, Tom Hanks does justice to the man who created and voiced Mickey Mouse. The studio even allowed a scene of him putting out a cigarette! Emma Thompson as Ms. Travers was also good though it does take some getting used to seeing her be such a stick-in-the-mud most of the time. The most charming scenes are those involving the songwriters, Richard and Robert Sherman (Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak), and their attempts to entertaining Ms. Travers while the whole thing is being recorded at her command as well as her conversations with her limo driver played by Paul Giamatti. Then there are those scenes of Ms. Travers childhood in Australia that delivers some heartbreak concerning her alcoholic father, played compellingly by Colin Farrell. All in all, I highly enjoyed Saving Mr. Banks."
"dfle3","10","0","1","14 January 2014"," Humour, pathos, reality. 100%
","An amusing and entertaining account of the protracted efforts of Walt Disney (played by Tom Hanks) to acquire the film rights to the novel ""Mary Poppins"", by Pamela (Mrs!) Travers (played by Emma Thompson. The reasons why his efforts are so protracted become evident throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Firstly, I have to confess to never having seen the movie nor read the book. Truth be told, it took me ages to work out who the titular character was! Now that I have the seen this movie, exploring the source material and more seems worthwhile.<br/><br/>""Protracted""wellMrs. Travers sort of comes across as a female version of Basil Fawlty in this movie (of the famous U.K. sitcom ""Fawlty Towers"")! She is brusque and has the manner of a stern, toffee English woman. Mrs. Travers is consistently and insistently brusque throughout the movie and most amusing for that. That being said, seeing as how ""Fawlty Towers"" never found favour in the U.S., it might be hard to picture American audiences being much amused by her. There is some nice, subtle humour in the performances of those Mrs. Travers has to work with in the moviethe would be song writers for the film ""Mary Poppins""I recognised one from the U.S. version of ""The office"" (B.J. Novak).<br/><br/>If Mrs. Travers was nothing more than a female Basil Fawlty, then I suppose I might not have enjoyed this movie so much. Thompson, however, brings a great sense of pathos to her role. She is a woman who miserably carries her cross with her all the time. Not having read her book, I wonder how much of a 'disconnect' there is between the author and her creation. Having seen a few award bait movies recently, I can't say that any have particularly grabbed me. As Travers does have a narrative arc or sorts and displays multi-dimensional emotions, I think Thompson deserves a Best Actress award. The recently held Golden Globe awards gave that honour to actresses in ""American hustle"", but to me ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is the superior movie and Thompson a more deserving recipient (I have no idea if Thomspon was even nominated in those awards).<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is also recognisably Tom Hanks in this movie, but it didn't detract from his performance. Seeing as how positively I responded to this movie, I would be generous in giving him a Best Actor award. Seeing as how this movie is made by Walt Disney Studios, it's no surprise that his representation is imbued with a vaseline glow. I was trying to recall what the controversy was with him, so I looked him up on Wikipedia to see if it was mentioned thereit isanti-Semitism and racism. Of course, I doubt if a movie of this sort would really have any business delving into that aspect of his character.<br/><br/>What is good about this movie is how it attempts to ground Mrs. Travers personality with her childhood experiences. To me, it seemed to provide a basic level of insight into her, which wasn't harsh. Without having explored this aspect myself, it seems to me that the film does provide some sort of explanation for the relationship between her book and her childhood experiences. Perhaps I would have liked more insight into the relationship between her childhood experiences and the woman she becamethey seem pretty tenuous in the film, but then again I'm not sure psychonalysis would be of much help here. It's just my sneaking suspicion that there is more to her adult form than what we see in the movie. This aspect is intriguing to me.<br/><br/>If I do have one criticism of the film, it is that it appears quite obscure on her family's story. It wasn't clear to me what Mrs. Travers' father did for a living before he moved his family to the middle of nowhere in Australia. Did he have to change jobs? Also, there is a scene with Mrs. Travers' mum (when she is also a child) where her mum pockets some liquor at the clothesline. Was that drink for her? Or was she hiding it from her husband? More clarity would have been appreciated here.<br/><br/>There was one scene which I appreciated in this movieafter a moment of crisis between Mrs. Travers and Walt, Walt travels to England to see her. He connects with her on a human level, I felt, and displayed empathy with her. The less pleasant scene (although it is played for laughs) comes later, when Mrs. Travers returns to see Walt, unexpectedly. It seems an affirmation of what Mrs. Travers might have imagined their relationship to have been all alongmerely mercantile (on his part).<br/><br/>This movie portrays Mrs. Travers as having her D.N.A. (so to speak) all over Walt's movie. Since the movie is regarded as a classic, it seems her efforts were entirely positive and beneficial to Walt's movie, perhaps? In which case, she's hardly deserving the scorn that she draws at times, right? If she hadn't of been so insistent on her vision for the movie, would have it been as so unutterably awful as she imagined it could have been?<br/><br/>On reflection, it also seems to me that Mrs. Travers is, in fact, a kind of unintentional heroine of this Disney movie. Recently my Duckduckgo (a search engine) app had an interesting news story feed on itvia the ""filmschoolrejects"" website. The story was called ""6 things the film industry does not want you to know about"". Number 6 concerned studios stealing scriptspoor script writers submit a script and an eerily similar one gets made into a movie later on with no compensation for the original script writer. I say ""Bravo!"" to Mrs. Travers! A true hero!<br/><br/>If the movie's script isn't just basically the conversations transcribed verbatim at the time from tapes, then I'd also give this film a best Script award. It's also my personal Best Film so far."
"bdl7431","8","0","1","14 January 2014"," A film about PL Travers....pretty good
","First, let's be honest about this film - it IS about PL Travers. The involvement of Walt Disney in the film is rather minor. Seriously, Tom Hanks probably has about 25% of the total available screen time. Most of it is taken up by Travers' soul searching, her back story, and her interactions with her driver, Ralph, and the film composers and writer.<br/><br/>This is not to say that the film is bad - it is VERY good - but that is due to Emma Thompson's performance and a very strong script and supporting cast.<br/><br/>So if you're looking for an expose about Disney - forget it. Hanks only had to come up with a mild southern drawl for this role - nothing that would stretch his acting abilities. If anything, Disney is soft peddled in the film. The only part when the film shows Disney as being spirited, if that, was when he did not invite Travers to the premier.<br/><br/>Also, if you have any cherished memories about Mary Poppins - and I do - they may wind up getting skewered by the film. Frankly, Travers comes across as total witch - something that biographers apparently agree was a true portrayal of her. It is hard to tell, however, how much of here quirkiness was real and how much was fabricated for the film (her actions with the pears for example).<br/><br/>So, if you want to see a good film with some drama and interesting characters - go."
"johnstonjames","9","0","2","13 January 2014"," An Author's Rare Insight Into ""The Disney Touch"".
","This film, and it's historical footnote, are the first time we've ever really heard a author's view and feelings about the legendary Disney treatment or ""Disney touch"". Most of the famous stories Disney made into movies are by authors who have long been dead and have never been able to express their opinion about what Disney did with their works. One can easily imagine that J.M. Barrie, Lewis Carroll, and Collodi, would all have some complaint with Disney's pop culture, Hollywood approach.<br/><br/>In 'Saving Mr.Banks' we get a first hand account of how 'Mary popping's' author P.L. Travers felt about Disney and his liberties with her stories. Travers was alive and well at the time and Disney had to face up to the author face to face. This movie does not exaggerate much. There are endless recording sessions that were made during the creative process and Travers can constantly be heard groaning ""no, no, no"". It was no inside secret that Travers was highly critical of the Disney machine.<br/><br/>There are a few anachronisms here but basically this film sticks close to the facts and the truth. At least about her involvement with the Disney studio. Her personal life I know little about.<br/><br/>There is so much in this film that is impeccable, but for me, it was the depiction of Walt Disney by an actor, and wow was Tom Hanks uncanny in resemblance, and the depiction of the Sherman brothers. For any die hard Disney fan, these performances are pure gold, especially Hanks.<br/><br/>I've always loved Disney and have a real fondness for his musical 'Poppins'. Disney felt is was his crowning achievement and one of his greatest works. 'Poppins' is perfect subject matter for a film that pays homage to one of the most talked about men of our time."

","They say the best art comes out of depression, traumatic events, and ""sad"" times in one's life. That's what the subject of this film is.<br/><br/>For those looking for a Walt Disney bio flick, you WILL be disappointed, this is not it...It is a character study of P.L. Travers. aka the author of ""Mary Poppins."" In a nutshell, the majority of the story shows us how the story of ""Mary Poppins,"" is based on the author's troubled childhood relationship with her father. If you haven't guessed, ""Mr. Banks,"" is the character who represents her father; there's my big spoiler. These childhood memories are slowly revealed to us while Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) and his production crew attempt to win over the film rights to P.L. Travers' book. <br/><br/>We all know how the story ends, ""Mary Poppins,"" went on to become one of the most successful Disney films EVER so I have to tell you, this is more about the journey than the end result and it is awesome!

Tom Hanks, Emma Thompson, Paul Giamatti, BJ Novak, Brad Whitford, Colin Farrell, and even the young girl were awesome. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Very entertaining and touching.

When Disney goes to London in order to FINALLY convince her it just takes way too long...I was checking my phone at that point. It took too long to land the plane. They could have shaved off a good 15 minutes or so of screen time.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Needed more musical numbers! I know it wasn't Mary Poppins, but listening to BJ Novak and Jason Schwartzman on the piano was amazing!</li></ul><br/><br/>Obviously I couldn't find too much wrong with this film by my giving it an ""8,"" but I am serious when I say that it's a bit overlong. They could have done without some of the dragging moments. Overall though it's a very touching, wonderful, and tear jerking film! It does what few films can do which is really put us in the mindset of the artist. GO see it if you haven't!"
"starry42","8","0","2","12 January 2014"," Very enjoyable, and at times emotional.
","A good chunk of ""Saving Mr. Banks"" tells of the efforts made by Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) to purchase the rights of the ""Mary Poppins"" children's books from author P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson). However, we also get a look at Travers' childhood with a series of flashbacks, in which we get a look at moments in her life which inspired scenes in her books. For example, Mr. Banks, the father of the children in ""Mary Poppins"" was inspired in part by her own father, a banker named Travers Goff (Colin Farrell). Part of the conflict between Travers and Disney revolves around the fact that she considers her stories personal, and the Disney Studio would simply sugarcoat everything. <br/><br/>We get to see the pre-production process of ""Mary Poppins"", from character sketches to music composure courtesy of Robert and Richard Sherman. These scenes are very delightful, and just might have one singing along to the iconic songs, from ""A Spoonful of Sugar"" to ""Let's Go Fly a Kite"". Despite these happy moments, the film is not without it's dramatic moments. The flashbacks depict Travers' father as an alcoholic, which takes a toll on his life, as well as hers. The interactions between Travers and Disney also have their moments.<br/><br/>As far as performances, Emma Thompson was great as Travers. She depicted the author as a snotty British woman who despises America and its people, especially Walt Disney. Tom Hanks does a good job at bringing out the personality of Walt, but his Missouri drawl was a little distracting. Paul Giamatti also appears as Travers' chauffeur Ralph, and he gives a lot of depth to what would normally be a side character.<br/><br/>The only real complaint I have about the movie is flashback transitions, or lack there of. They cut back and forth without any warning. Fading of some sort could have been handy, but that's still just a minor complaint in what is otherwise a flawless picture. I highly recommend ""Saving Mr. Banks"". You don't have to be a Disney fanatic to enjoy it, but it might not hurt."
"billsoccer","9","0","2","12 January 2014"," Best story of the year?
","I thought 2013 had an unusually high number of well-done movies and great stories. This is one of them, and my favorite. The plot of the movie skips between the upbringing of a girl in early 20th Century Australia, and Disney Studios pursuit of the movie rights to Mary Poppins. You eventually realize the girl is the author, P. L. Travers. Her parents are co-dependent, and the father is an alcoholic, bouncing from 1 job to another. He fills his daughter with dreams instead of a sense of responsibility. When Walt Disney enters the story we find he's been pursuing the movie rights for 20 years. Ms. Travers fears the trivialization of her characters and has refused him at every turn. The real story is why and the movie unravels this mystery in a great fashion. This are fine and perhaps Oscar-winning performances by Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks. You'll appreciate the story better if you've seen Mary Poppins, but don't avoid this if you haven't - they'll explain enough so you'll get it."

With two brilliant actors (both two-time Oscar winners) to play the leads, and a story involving two timelines, one exploring the script discussion at Disney office and the other exploring the childhood days of Mrs.Travers in Australian countryside, the movie forms a beautiful and not-so-complex puzzle which keeps you intrigued till the end.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson plays the character of the complex, passionate and unwilling-to-bend author of beloved children's book 'Mary Poppins' with such vigour and range of emotions.

In fact, I think Hanks is much better here portraying Walt Disney than he is as Captain Phillips in his other big movie this year. The Phillips character seems one-dimensional and not particularly likable, whereas Hanks portrays Disney with infectious charm, steely grace, and genuine enthusiasm. Emma Thompson is hilarious albeit practically unrecognizable as the opinionated and intractable British author, P.L. Travers. The supporting cast is excellent, especially Paul Giamatti, B.J. Novak, and Jason Schwartzman. The music is fun and familiar and the dialogue amusing and witty. I laughed out loud several times and was brought close to tears as well. I highly recommend this movie to young and old alike. You will leave the theater smiling."

","Saving Mr. Banks is a film directed by John Lee Hancock, and stars Emma Thompson, Tom Hanks and Paul Giamatti, and centres around the author P.L. Travers, who created the book Mary Poppins. We watch as she goes to Los Angeles to have talks with Walt Disney, who wants to adapt her book into a film. During all this, she reflects on her hard childhood, and how it influenced Mary Poppins later on in her life.<br/><br/>To begin with, the performances. Emma Thompson is wonderful in this film. She brings a lot of energy to a character which almost refuses to get up and have some fun, which in my mind, is quite the achievement. Thompson really steals the show, despite Tom Hanks giving a fantastic performance as well, as Walt Disney. I must say, he nails the moustache! The rest of the ensemble, including Paul Giamatti and the surprisingly powerful Colin Firth, give top-notch performances. Ultimately, in the acting category, there is nothing to criticise.<br/><br/>The film is cut into two halves; one half, where she is in talks with Mr. Disney, and the other being her childhood. I felt that the talks with Mr. Disney, and the arguments she had with the screenwriters and music composers were easily the best parts of the film. They're full of energy, clashing personalities and some wonderful music. When it came to the second half though, her childhood, I found that these flashbacks seemed slightly bloated, or went on for a little too long. For the most part, they did explain important, key events which helped shaped her future. There were a few flashbacks in which I found seemed to drag on a little, and couldn't hold my interest for very long. These flashbacks, I found, were a little more common than I originally anticipated coming into the film, and ultimately, they did negatively impact the film for me.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I can't really criticise this film any more. It's very well acted, well paced for the most part, and the plot is consistent and quite accurate to the real story. This film will win awards, undeniably, and I'm not going to be annoyed by this, as I can understand why. For the most part, it's a very well done film, that should serve as a must watch for everyone! <br/><br/>8.4/10"

","""Winds in the east...Mist coming in...Like something is brewing...About to begin...Can't put me finger...On what lies in store...But I feel what's to happen...All happened before.""<br/><br/>This was one of the few charming and sentimental films I fell for this year and a great deal has to do with the nostalgic effect that Mary Poppins has on me from my childhood. Yes it is schmaltzy at times and has a manipulative feel good vibe to it while at the same time self promoting itself, but I still was emotionally won over by this great story (and I don't care if most of it was made up, I still loved the film, I don't watch movies for facts). Saving Mr. Banks is smart and upbeat and will have you humming some of the songs from the beloved classic long after the credits have rolled. This is the best marketing Disney has come up with to promote Mary Poppins, and a lot of the success is owed to Emma Thompson for delivering such a powerful performance. Her character could be easily disliked for being so severe and unpleasant to others, but Thompson redeems her by allowing us to see where her pain comes from and how much the novel really meant to her. Tom Hanks is also great as Walt Disney and he would've received more recognition for this film if it weren't for those brilliant last 5 minutes in Captain Phillips that stole all the thunder from his performance here. Supporting roles from Colin Farrell, Paul Giamatti, and Jason Schwartzman make this an even more powerful film. Credit also must be given to the screenwriters, Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith, who managed to deliver a charming story while including engaging flashbacks of Travers' past. <br/><br/>Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) promised his daughters that he would bring the beloved Mary Poppins novel to the big screen, but it turned out to be a difficult task considering he has spent the last 20 years trying to convince P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) to obtain the rights of her novel. Convinced that Disney will ruin her beloved book, she refuses to do so. Travers' agent convinces her to travel to California to meet with Disney and try to come up with an agreement considering she is running out of money. Travers spends the next two weeks working with screenwriters (the Sherman brothers played by Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak) at Disney's facility making sure that the screenplay is written exactly how she wants it. Things get complicated as she refuses to compromise to basic things Disney wants to include in the film. The film also presents flashbacks of Travers' childhood growing up in Australia with her father (Colin Farrell) who she absolutely adored but had a drinking problem that eventually ruined him. Her childhood experiences shaped the book and that is why she is so reluctant to let someone else change her story.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock won an Oscar for The Blind Side which was John Lee Hancock's prior film to this one and Emma Thompson might be a front runner to win for her performance as Travers. She makes this film much better than it actually is because if it wasn't for her Saving Mr. Banks would just be Disney schmaltz. I found it extremely hard not feel emotional about this film and it engaged me completely despite the lack of interest I had for the subject matter. I loved Mary Poppins as a kid, but that didn't mean I was interested in seeing a movie on how it was made. Despite all I've said about it being self promoting and manipulative I thought that what worked best was the integration of the flashbacks that allowed us to understand where Travers was coming from and reminds us how sometimes art is connected personally to the artist's past. That is why perhaps a film speaks to us in different ways because we too as an audience bring in our personal past and integrate it into a film finding a connection that perhaps others never will. That is the beauty of art, it affects us all in different ways."

","Mary Poppins has always been a favorite for generations, but how did Walt Disney get the rights to make this film? Disney's ""Saving Mr. Banks"" tells that story through Emma Thompson, and Tom Hanks. I had very high expectations for this film, and I can honestly say I was not disappointed. The film is well-paced, there is no rushing through acts, or scenes. The makers seemed to be sure to take their time to make an enjoyable film. The story line was well done, it was touching in every way, and left the audience with a smile on their faces. Flashbacks were correctly placed, and added to the emotion and life of the film rather than take away like many films have. The music, of course, was familiar to anyone familiar with the famous musical and often times arrangements were made off of the original music and score. Hanks' performance as Walt Disney was excellent, as well ad Thompson as PL Travers, they took their characters, based of course on real people, and performed nearly flawlessly based on what they could know. Overall, ""Banks"" is a great film, and will be loved by anyone who Loves Mary Poppins, and generations after. Overall rating: 8.1/10"
"Suave785","9","0","2","5 January 2014"," A Travers story and a Disney vision
","If you are planning to watch this movie to learn more about the life of Walt Disney you will be thoroughly disappointed. Saving Mr. Banks is a movie that shows how P.L. Travers deals with the decision of letting Walt Disney make a movie about her famous nanny per say. Eventually Mary Poppins was brought to the screen but the real story is how P.L. Travers drew the inspiration for the characters in her novel. P.L. Travers in real life was a very troubled woman who was more likely to scorn and ridicule than sing and dance like Mary Poppins. From this movie you get to see the image of what laid behind one of the great child novelist of all time. You see a woman who is fractured by guilt and has a broken heart invent a character that is her childhood fantasy and let her be molded by someone her complete opposite. This story is not a happy one but a great one at that and shows a touch of the influence Disney had on the people around him. Most noticeably how much P.L. Travers rejects a spoonful of sugar in real life. A lot of the movies attention is on Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson. But the real person that carries this movie is Colin Farrell. He plays the kind but troubled father to P.L. Travers. Paul Giamatti also adds a nice touch to screen as the grounded touch of reality that P.L. Travers is looking for while visiting the magical world of Disney. The best thing to take away from this movie is that Mary Poppins was indeed just a fantasy. It was a movie that was a delight to everyone except the creator of Mary Poppins. Almost all will never know why P.L. Travers scolded the Disney team for making a movie about her beloved Mary Poppins that garnered five Academy Awards. I tend to think that Mary Poppins was never written for anyone else to read but herself. It also was a reality that P.L. Travers would like to revel in but she realizes the harsh truths of the world. It is sometimes easier to create a reality then live in one. Sadly you see this through the eyes of P.L. Travers in this movie as she strives for a mundane and lonely life."

","I didn't love the movie per se, but I appreciated what it was going for. It is very melodramatic, and it took some time to understand the Australian scenes, but the movie was gut-wrenching in some parts and Colin Farell does some of the best acting of his career.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson plays a great lead in the film and really carried the movie... if Mary Popping was about Mr. Banks, then Saving Mr. Banks was about P.L. Travers' solemn past.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is on point as Walt Disney and the supporting cast does a great job of lightening the mood of a pretty dreary movie.<br/><br/>There were a lot of old folks in the theatre, so I don't know that young teen would appreciate the movie as much, my own high-school aged in-laws were visibly restless.

","Tugging at the heartstrings during the most opportune times, making you feel all warm inside on cue and delivering more than a spoonful of ""fun for the whole family"" throughout to counteract the PG-13 moments, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is little more than Disney propaganda. But, when what you essentially have here is a Disney movie, about the making of a Disney movie, portraying Walt Disney, to go in expecting anything scathing would be foolish. That said, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" contains more edge to it than Disney's live action, ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"", made for TV movie worthy track record would have you believe.<br/><br/>Directed by John Lee Hancock (who is well versed in Disney-fying movies) and written by Kelly Marcel (the writer of the upcoming Fifty Shades of Grey film adaptation) and Sue Smith, this imaginative retelling of the making of Mary Poppins (I say this only because in real life P.L. Travers absolutely hated the 1964 Mary Popping's film) depicts a charismatic, compassionate and non-anti-Semitic Walt Disney (played by Tom Hanks) in his attempts to woo author P.L. Travers for the right to bring her beloved novels to the big screen.<br/><br/>The performances all around are excellent, but the standout has to be Emma Thompson, who plays the aforementioned P.L. Travers with the most perfectly disapproving British tone and mannerisms possible. But it is the structure of ""Saving Mr. Banks"" which is the most impressive. With the best sequences being some extremely well timed flashbacks showing Travers troubled upbringing with her alcoholic father (brilliantly portrayed by Colin Farrell) which momentarily takes things out of the farcical realm, dousing audiences with an occasional cold splash of welcome weight and realism.<br/><br/>Final Thought: At the end of the day all ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is, is a film about the making of a film; which on face value may seem fascinating to film students and nobody else. This is also a Disney production, which means the story does not veer from the set in stone generic Disney outline (no matter their differences, in the end every character finds common ground and blah, blah, blah) with a score that instructs viewers how to feel (when Disney tells the story of his hard upbringing, cue the sad music). But there is no doubt the Disney Corporation knows their way around an entertaining film. What can I say? ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a movie that is impossible to dislike."

","'SAVING MR. BANKS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Disney's Oscar hopeful about the production of their 1964 classic 'MARRY POPPINS'. The title 'SAVING MR. BANKS' refers to the father in that film (and the book it's based on). It centers around the novel's author, P. L. Travers, and Walt Disney's struggles to adapt her popular work into a movie. Emma Thompson stars as Travers and Tom Hanks plays Walt Disney. The film also features Colin Farrell, Paul Giamatti, Bradley Whitford, Jason Schwartzman, B. J. Novak and Kathy Baker in supporting roles. It's overly sappy and doesn't deserve awards attention but it is a decent family drama film.<br/><br/>Thompson plays Pamela ""P. L."" Travers (as an adult) in the movie, which is set in 1961 and also has flashbacks to 1907 (when Pamela was just a young girl growing up in Australia). The film revolves around Walt Disney's (Hanks) attempts to convince Travers to let him turn her popular kids' book, 'Marry Poppins', into a Disney movie. Travers was very reluctant to do so and didn't trust Disney. She also didn't want any changes made to her story. The film focuses on Disney's long fight to win over Travers and also pays a lot of attention to Travers' inner struggles with letting go of her past. Farrell plays Travers' alcoholic but loving father (in the 1907 flashbacks).<br/><br/>The film is entertaining but it's drama and sentimentality seems really forced. I like a good emotional and touching movie but not when it's forced down my throat (like Disney often does with their films). I enjoyed Hanks and Thompson's performances but the P.L. Travers character is just a little too unlikeable (to relate to at all). It is funny though and the supporting cast is all good as well. It just feels way too much like a Disney movie (in a modern 'bad' way; not like the good old classics). Other than the forced drama it definitely isn't a bad film though (it just doesn't deserve the Oscar hype).<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAefz9rzS5w"
"RyanCShowers","Null","0","6","31 December 2013"," Thompson Brightens Up a Flawed Film
","I admire John Lee Hancock for his willingness to tackle sentimental, sugary, and heavily cheesy scripts as a director because that tone will reflect on his direction. Though Saving Mr. Banks is a step in the right direction from reprehensible 2009 Best Picture nominee The Blind Side, Saving Mr. Banks has its problems most of which accumulate in the flashbacks that parallel the dominant storyline. In fact, if the flashbacks would have been eliminated entirely, Saving Mr. Banks could have been a charming, meta-tale that film fans could devour like last year's Hitchcock (which I adore).<br/><br/>Faults aside, Saving Mr. Banks is a warm tale featuring a soulful musical score, kooky hairstyles, and fun set designs. Tom Hanks suits his role of Walt Disney and has a few monologues where he puts the optimism and cheerfulness he hinges on for most of the film aside and creates something exceptional. Emma Thompson is rightfully soaking up most of the acclaim for Saving Mr. Banks. Her terrific portrayal full of snootiness and cruel comedy is made complex by burying sorrow and pain deep in her character's past. The concluding scene is so effective because of the truth Thompson displays.<br/><br/>Saving Mr. Banks is about letting go of the past, accepting it, forgiving those who have hurt you, and resurrecting yourself. The other, possibly more lucrative, message: Walt Disney is the cure for all children's misfortunes, even children in their old age.<br/><br/>Grade: B<br/><br/>Rating: 6.5"

","First of all the cast was very good – Tom Hanks, Paul Giamatti, Bradley Whitford (from West Wing), Colin Farrellall actors I like a lot. And Emma Thompson did an outstanding job. The movie shifts back and forth from the early 60's when Mary Poppins the movie was made to the 20's when P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) was growing up as a child. The movie was more of drama during the flashbacks as you see what her life was like growing up and eventually learning where Mary Poppins really came from. During the time in the 60's it is a lot of fun. You see how ornery Travers was and how badly Walt Disney wanted to make the picture and the funny hell she put everyone at Disney through before it eventually was made. And as the movie goes on you get more and more engaged in the often comical battle and the reasons for the battle. It is a very interesting story involving drama, comedy, intrigue and it is a genuine story that most people don't know, about a movie we all know and love. Although I bought my 10 year old daughter, it is not a movie children will enjoy but all adults will. I give it a solid ""B""."
