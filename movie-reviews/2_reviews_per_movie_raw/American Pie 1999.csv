"Starks","8","69","81","7 September 1999"," Classic!!!
","I have to say that the most fun I had at the movies this summer was when I saw American Pie, the funniest picture I've seen since last summer's There's Something About Mary. This movie has taken the classic teenage boy film (Porky's, Revenge of the Nerds) and spruced it up for the 90's.  It is hilarious from start to finish. If you like physical comedy, gross out comedy, sexual comedy, American Pie has it all.  A great ensemble cast of likeable young actors makes this a joy to watch.     <br/><br/>I think this year's breakout star has to be Chris Klein.  He was phenomenal in Election and he is even better here as a jock who tries to soften his image to score before prom. I have a feeling Klein is going to be Hollywood's next big thing and I hope he has a chance to flex his acting muscles in some different movies (I can definitely see this guy in an action film).<br/><br/>Also very good is Jason Biggs who plays the sympathetic Jim character, the guy who is least likely to lose his virginity.  His antics are very funny to follow and he gets the lion share of the laughs. Finally a huge ovation for Eugene Levy, who gets major laughs as the Jim's dad."

","Can you believe it has been 20 years since this film? It is still funny and amusing. The boys were boys, the girls were hot girls and had long hair and flaunted their bodies and the father was super cool.
Nowadays we have Daisy of Disney 'Star Wars' with short hair and looking all 'I have a chip on my shoulder' .. aaarrrgh I am going to stop right there.
American Pie is funny and you should watch it if you already have not."

","I laughed so hard I spit out half the bucket-o-pop I was drinking, and finally had to stop sipping from its fine nectar, because so many times I was hooting and bending over in joy.<br/><br/>There are some slower moments to let you catch your breath and allow for moments of sincerity, but only for a minute. The scenes in the previews (the ones you think will ruin the movie for you) are expounded on ten-fold, so there are plenty of surprises.<br/><br/>During the movie I kept saying, ""This is me and my friends when we were in high school!"" They were almost the same conversations about life, sex and girls; just not as frequently, but it's only a two-hour film. Any guy will appreciate American Pie full tilt, and girls will realize just what hoops guys jump through in order to get their attention, let alone in their pants.<br/><br/>What added to American Pie is that I liked every character, because the filmmakers didn't feel the urge to give us prototypical teen characters. Their personalities are distinctive, and their situations are all different, which leads to a hilarious finale where we see just how their pact plays out on prom night.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, there are genuine moments on the screen where the guys and gals have revelations of sincerity. It adds a needed depth to a film like this, where it's not just raw, raunchy comedy, but important to the lives of the characters who know more than sex is at stake. Which is another reason to like Pie, there are several slices, and sexual conquest is only one of them."
"Jaime N. Christley","7","88","111","14 July 1999"," Astoundingly good-natured sex comedy
","The director and the writer, Paul Weitz and Adam Herz respectively, will do anything for a laugh -- that's good, as it turns out, because this movie has a great many laughs in it.  There's not much of that restricting, suffocating ""logic"" stuff around, but ""American Pie"" is immensely enjoyable. I mean, almost none of the things that happen in this film would ever, ever come to pass in real life, but it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>For starters, the characters aren't all one-dimensional.  Thankfully, they're two-dimensional, so right away it has an edge on 60-70% of all the movies ever made.<br/><br/>Moreover, it's heart is in the right place.  Most high school movies these days are all about cruelty and malice, especially towards (and among) the women.  Not the case here.  This is the first conventional high school movie I've ever seen that made me smile so much (I say conventional because ""Rushmore"" still trumps every one of them).<br/><br/>Furthermore, it's very funny.  I wouldn't dare give away any of the really great gags (we've all seen the trailer -- that's not the one I mean), but I'll say this:  Weitz and Herz are extraordinarily skilled in audience manipulation, which is to say that they know how and when to spring unexpected surprises upon us.  They also know how to use foul language for punch, rather than punctuation.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is another positive.  It's all about joy and high energy -- even music from Third Eye Blind and Barenaked Ladies that suffers from radio overplay fits the mood appropriately."
"Chris-564","Null","42","51","26 September 1999"," My cup of tea. Not everybody's - but certainly mine.
","I had the good fortune to see a sneak preview of this film in England, a couple of weeks before release - and I was very impressed indeed.  Hurrah - a comedy that is laugh-out-loud funny, enough to make you cringe at the embarrassing bits (of which there are many), and smile at the sentiment, which isn't corny in the slightest.  This coming-of-age tale of four boys who make a pact to become men by losing their virginity by prom night is the perfect movie to go the cinema with your buddies to see, but probably not with your family.  Having said that, I saw a family (son, mother, father and grandmother) coming out of the cinema, and they had a great time.  The grandmother couldn't stop laughing, and saying how true it all was.  Which is interesting, if a little embarrassing.<br/><br/>Part of the success of this movie is due to the fact that we've all had to contemplate how we feel about sex, and losing your virginity is something which (no matter how fraught with peril it is) bonds us all because it is a very frightening experience.  It's also a topic which has so much comic potential, and I'm glad that cast and crew don't throw any of the opportunities away.  Here's the thing: if you're going to make a movie that is probably going to offend a few people no matter what you do, and is a very near-the-knuckle affair, why stop at only half-gags?  Go the whole hog, push the boat out, thrust it in their faces.  And that's what ""American Pie"" does.<br/><br/>The performances are all great, if a little clich√©d (are all you Americans really either:<br/><br/>a) jocks<br/><br/>b) geeks<br/><br/>c) sweet, loveable square-jawed heroes/long haired, intelligent heroines? ...gosh, I hope so, that would be so funny for us Brits to watch).  There is yet another high school prom (jealousy sets in once more - see ""Never Been Kissed""), which causes much consternation for all concerned.  There are marvellous scenes between concerned father and embarrassed child, quite the highlight of the movie.  I'll be interested to see how the careers of all of the stars fare after this film.  I wish them all well, but I find it hard to see them all thriving outside a high-school environment (which is good, because it indicates that they all play their roles with a great deal of endearing believability).<br/><br/>It'll certainly give you something to talk about with your mates, and it'll make you think about things, too.  It'll make you check what's in your beer, it'll make you think about apple pie, and it'll make you think more about your relationships.  All of which is good stuff.  The soundtrack is good (although doesn't contain any Don McLean), the lighting is also very good in places, the direction adequate, the editing fine, the .  But at the end of the day, this is the kid's movie, and they make an excellent job of an excellent script and situation, so fair play to them.  This movie deserves to succeed, and I hope it receives a good welcome from us Brits, who should enjoy it a lot.  (Incidentally, this film got a fifteen rating, which I think is about right for it - eighteen would be too prohibitive (after all, isn't this film aimed at people aged fifteen?)).  Take a piece of advice, though - if you are embarrassed easily, don't watch it with members of your family.  But do watch it."
"davispittman","8","7","7","2 August 2017"," Actually turned out to be deeper than gross out humor
","I will say this for American Pie, it's not full out of completely gross out humor like Van Wilder (2002). It's got a couple of scenes based on crude humor, but I was glad to see that for the most part, the movie steered clear of over the top disgusting humor. The characters are good hearted boys that think they just want sex, and for a couple of the characters that turns out to be true, but for a couple other of them, it turns out that just ""getting laid"" isn't the most important thing. I liked that the characters actually ended up to have a deeper want and that they actually end up having better connections with girls that yes may involve sex, but that's not all that it's based upon. Now this movie isn't all love and good hearted stuff, it's got plenty and I do mean plenty of raunchy/dirty humor. Humor that involves male and female masturbation in different ways, premature ejaculation, and very descriptive talk of all kinds of sexual activities. Just FYI in case any of that offends you. There is some truly funny material in the film, I laughed at several scenes in the movie. I didn't think it was laugh out loud hilarious, but some parts were funny. The parts I wasn't laughing at, I was feeling for the characters. I loved the acting from all the cast members. Tara Reid was really good as Vicky. Jason Biggs was a perfect choice for Jim. Thomas Nicholas is great as Kevin. Chris Klein is very good as Oz. And the rest of the cast is good too, but Kevin, Vicky, Oz, and Jim are the biggest characters here. I loved how Oz and Kevin were so adorable and were actually good hearted guys. I really like American Pie because not only is it funny but it's also good hearted and filled with good characters. 8/10."

","American Pie has all the ingredients of a good movie.  First, the plot deals with young people in search of their first sexual experience.  What could be more basic to the human condition?  Second, although obviously fiction, the film has a feeling of reality capturing the awkwardness and anxiety of young people at this point in their lives.  Third, it is well written and not always predictable as each young man employs his own strategy, and of course, in the real world things do not always go as planned.  Fourth, the cast consists of very talented young actors playing characters which may remind the audience of people they may have known.  Fifth, the film has its poignant moments. The final ingredient is this movie is hilarious.  The film has one liners, sight gags, and situations that very funny.  The audience, which ranged from teenagers to middle age, laughed almost constantly and out loud.  CAUTION: This film is rated ""R"" for sexual situations and the use of alcohol by young people.  If you are easily offended or sexual humor makes you uncomfortable, stay away.  However, if you are not in the aforementioned, you may enjoy it.  Three stars!!!"

"dustinkdye","6","12","15","28 July 2013"," 'American Pie' set the bar for teen sex comedies
","""So high school boys everywhere only think about sex, huh?"" my Japanese wife turned to me and said about 20 minutes into ""American Pie."" She looked at me expectantly, as if she wanted to hear me say I was somehow different, above such base pursuits. I could tell she was mildly disappointed when I replied, ""Yeah, pretty much."" Eighteen-year-old boys' raging hormones is a truly universal theme.<br/><br/>There have been four American Pie films to date, not counting the straight-to-video releases. The film notably struck a chord with teens when it was released in 1999. I remember sitting in art class and overhearing a popular and attractive senior girl condescending to an awkward and geeky freshman boy, ""You haven't seen 'American Pie'? The great American sex comedy?"" I still cringe when I remember that.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, it is basically about four senior boys who make a pact to lose their virginity before they graduate high school. They shrewdly determine prom is their last chance to get laid, and devote all their energy to getting a woman in bed at the after-prom party, to be held at the lake house of the cocky lacrosse player, Steve Stifler. The boys, particularly Jim, have a series of embarrassing mishaps along the way, one famously involving a warm apple pie.<br/><br/>""American Pie"" set a new bar for teen comedies. Every teen comedy since has tried, and failed, to top the scene where Stifler unwittingly drinks a beer with a load of semen in it.<br/><br/>Though ""American Pie"" is famous for its numerous gross-outs, the movie is good, and not just gross, because we come to identify with the characters, and the humor rises naturally from the situations. The scene where Stifler slips laxatives into Finch's mochaccino, causing him to make a desperate dash for the nearest toilet, is funny not because fart sounds are humorous, but because the film already established Finch's aversion for public restrooms.<br/><br/>The Stifler character was especially believable. When Heather (Mena Suvari) asks out Oz (Chris Klein) in front of the lacrosse team, Stifler proceeds to make lewd gestures. Heather misinterprets this as Stifler making fun of her, when Stifler was really just trying to embarrass Oz. When I first saw the film at the age of 16, I thought, That's pretty much how high school boys act.<br/><br/>The acting is serviceable. Eugene Levy, who plays Jim's dad, and Seann William Scott, who plays Stifler, are totally convincing in their roles. (Toward the end of the film, watch Stifler in the background check his beer before he takes a sip.) Others, however, give flat performances, especially in dramatic scenes. However, since these scenes take back seat to the comedy, and few of the jokes fall flat from the acting, the mediocre performances don't hurt the overall effectiveness of the film.<br/><br/>Another criticism I have of the film is one that pretty much applies to all Hollywood films, and that is that the kids are too rich. You can usually tell who the poor kid is in a Hollywood movie because he's the one who's not driving a late-model car. His family will still live in a two-storey house. Every student in ""American Pie"" (except for Oz, the only one shown to have a job), lives like the richest kid at my high school.<br/><br/>Overall, ""American Pie"" is an enjoyable comedy that will continue to be the standard against which all teen comedies will be judged. I recommend the unrated version. While scenes in most unrated or extended editions were cut from the theatrical releases for good reasons (i.e., they were tedious), the theatrical version of ""American Pie"" was really a sanitized version of the better, unrated version."

","Review:
'American Pie' is a comedy film directed by Paul and Chris Weitz. It is the first film in the 'American Pie' series.
I was surprised to see the amount of negative reaction to this movie. I remember the first time I saw it and laughed almost the whole way through. The only problem that I had was that I couldn't accept the cast as being an average age of around 17.
The performances were really great for a comedy of the 1990's. Jason Biggs stands out amongst all of them, with his dorky and desperate persona. He blends funny dialog with very funny physical comedy. Also, Alyson Hannigan who has a small but funny role is also great and she says the best line in the movie. Let's talk about Eugene Levi for a second, holy cow what a funny man this guy is. He is so natural as the over sharing father who just makes everybody either uncomfortable or laughing out loud.
What can I say about this movie besides that It's a comedic classic! American Pie perfectly blends a buddy comedy, extreme gross-out humor, and dare I say a coming of age movie. It's one of those movies that is easy to predict when something bad will happen, but that's what made me laugh so hard. Some of the comedic moments are very offensive and this movie could not be made today.
Overall, this movie is a crazy, outrageous, amazingly funny comedy. I recommend it to anybody who isn't easily offended and has a great sense of humor!
4/5"
"ellybendi","9","4","4","22 April 2019"," Classic 90s coming-of-age drama
","I don't often leave reviews but I had to comment how this film is clearly lost on some people. I was 18 when this film came out. Obviously those leaving bad reviews are a lot younger and don't realise the contemporary movie landscape.<br/><br/>The American Pie formula has been used a lot since its release but in its time, it was fairly original. It has humour, some of it cringeworthy toilet/sex humour granted, but it still makes me laugh out loud and turn away in disgust.<br/><br/>Then there are the poignant moments, the coming-of-age stuff that makes watching it worthwhile. The superficial pact the friends make is superseded by the various realisations each of them has by the end of the film.<br/><br/>When rating a film I always ask myself: does it present itself the best way it can? do the actors do their jobs well? does it tell the story? does it evoke emotion or thought? And the answer to all of these is a resounding yes. Ergo, it deserves a high rating.<br/><br/>Plus, it coined the term ""MILF"" and many of these unknown actors went on to have fairly successful careers afterwards. That is testament to this film's quality."
"Buddy-51","Null","41","65","1 February 2000"," crude but amusing sex comedy
","If you are a person easily offended by a film dedicated primarily to the glory of teen sex, you may well view ""American Pie"" as yet another in a long line of cinematic harbingers of the collapse of western civilization.  If, however, you remember adolescence as essentially a period of unending coitus interruptus, you may well find yourself engrossed by this amusing, though admittedly crude, series of sexual and scatalogical gags woven around a plot involving the desperate attempts of a quartet of last semester seniors to lose their virginity on the fast approaching sexual armageddon known as ""prom night.""<br/><br/>""American Pie"" gleans most of its comic energy from its outrageous examination of the crazy and innovative extremes desperately horny teens will go to in order to experience the thrill of sex in lieu of the real thing.  An attractive, game cast helps to mitigate the crudity of many of their actions and the filmmakers' lighthearted tone encompasses the characters in such a cloak of affection that the audience identifies with, rather than condemns, their antics.<br/><br/>As meager compensation for the moralists among us, the film does heavily promote the use of condoms and comes up with even more creative prophylactics for those times when a partner is not available.<br/><br/>""American Pie"" is certainly not for every taste and there are those who would argue that it serves a less than salutary purpose as a guide for already sex-obsessed teenagers.  Be that as it may, the film provides a fair number of hearty chuckles for those of us who can find humor in a group of backward youngsters experiencing the frustration and desperation we have all, at one time, experienced.<br/><br/>I do have one troubling question though:  why do none of these characters, whenever they are involved in a potentially compromising position, ever lock a door?  The answer, I suppose, is obvious for, if they did, at least half the film's biggest laughs would become impossible to achieve.  For this film, at least, such a suspension of disbelief may be a prerequisite.<br/><br/>Be forewarned but enjoy!"

"Niceguy","Null","39","65","11 June 1999"," A shocking, but entertaining comedy.
","American Pie starts right off with shock value, and while the film relies heavily on it, there's plenty of story and exceptional performances to hold your interest.  I attended a sneak preview of what I was told was a rough cut of the film, although there was only one scene that looked unfinished. The underlying story here is that of four high school senior buddies who have made a pact with each other to get laid before they graduate, specifically at the prom.  The problem is, only one of them has a serious girlfriend, and she can't decide if she's ready for sex.  But where the film really makes an impact is in it's numerous masturbation related scenes. There is one scene particularly early in the film that should test your stomach for the rest of the film's humor.  Now while the film may not sound like it has good morals, there is one repeated underlying message, and that is to do what you like and not what you feel pressured to do. Unfortunately, this is NOT the kind of film its target audience should be seeing.  At times it makes getting laid seem like the most important part of high school.  The strength of the film lies in the fact that everyone who went to a public high school can relate to some aspect portayed here, and in the strong and well-timed performances of the talented cast.  If you're mature enough to appreciate the film for its sheer comical performances, then you should really enjoy it.  But if you don't like ""toilet humor"", then you might not find anything appealing with this one.  Definitely not a date movie."

The story follows a Young group of high schoolers four friends who decide they will lose their virginity by end of graduation. I grew up with this Pie I bought this movie on VHS when I was freshman in high school the beginning of the school year and this movie really surprised me. One of my class mates said we should all watch ""American Pie"" in school so I bought this film and I am glad I did, I still have the VHS at home. To me this is the best in the series the original the only one ""American Pie"". This is my second favorite movie in the franchise American Reunion to me is the best one favorite to me.<br/><br/>By the time i did not know any of the cast: Jason Biggs , Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Tara Reid, Shannon Elizabeth, Mena Suvari, Seann William Scott, Natasha Lyonne, Eugene Levy, Chris Owen and Jennifer Coolidge. I did know Alyson Hannigan as Willow from Buffy, The Vampire Slayer. None of the cast I know before.<br/><br/>The movie talks about friendship, loyality, sexy, how to listen to girls and catch one. I laughed when Jim has full missionary sex with a freshly-baked apple pie left on the table. I laughed when Stiffler spikes Finch's mochaccino with laxatives, and promptly dupes him into using the girls' restroom, where Finch suffers explosive diarrhea in the presence of several senior girls. That was funny. I absolutelly love Czechoslovakian exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) in Jim's bedroom and Jim has a striptease going on. I love Shannon Elizabeth to death in this movie. The song Mutt plays by Blink 182 when Jim runs to Kevin and Finch when he put Nadia on webcam. The same song was played on the end of the credits Tomcats (2001) in which sexy beautiful Shannon Elizabeth was the main star one of my favorite comedy's.<br/><br/>Jim Levenstein is my favorite character because he remind me on me. Too bad that sequels ruined this movie. The first one and the reunion in my opinion are the best one to watch. The first movie is really short only 1hr and 35 mins. awesome. Fantastic direction by Paul Weitz the acting from everyone is top noch. It is Rated - R. I disagree with haters who are saying is boring, it is not boring, it fast paced. The pacing is fast and goes fast around. This movie shows how high school was, to me high school was an awesome place which I never had problems, now in real world you have responsibility and your everything for your self. I am proud that I graduate from high school and that I make my driving licence. The movie is not bad and I like jokes. It is been 20 years since this movie come from Universal Pictures so it is 20 year anniversary and it is awesome. The cast reunited for their reunion and they talk about this movie, the clips are on YouTube.<br/><br/>I love the finale in which Jim dancens with Nadia infront of camera I miss and I love that and I love that Jim's dad is dancing. I love, love this movie. Sccrew haters. I love the song Mutt played by Blink 182. And I love the cast: Jason Biggs , Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Tara Reid, Shannon Elizabeth, Mena Suvari, Seann William Scott, Natasha Lyonne, Eugene Levy and Chris Owen. I don't like Alyson Hannigan been geek in this movie but that's about it. I love this movie to death and Tara Reid is awesome as an actress and as a girl who is in love with Kevin who can not say two words ""I Love You"".<br/><br/>I recommend this film to anyone who likes teen comedy's this one is for you, Don't listen to haters."

","American Pie was a gruesome experience for me because the first time I watched it was with my best friend's older brother and father. Yeah, just us three. I was thirteen years old and a little part of me died as the brazen jokes kept piling up and culminating in grossness, upon which the father shifted awkwardly in his seat. With hindsight it was absolutely worth every minute of agony, because the film is such a powerful staple on the raunchy teen comedy wall of fame today and surely one of the most laugh-out-loud worthy films in my DVD collection (which isn't saying much since I have a total of like 20 films but still).<br/><br/>Its premise and execution both bluntly rehash Porky's but it also updates and modernizes its humour, settings and characters. Both Porky's and American Pie will be extremely dated (the former already is) but undoubtedly that will only contribute to the glossy contemporary feel of the films. They both zoom in on a group of brazen ¬ñ but ordinary ¬ñ teenage boys in the last year of high school and unflinchingly follow them as they enter a quest to lose their virginity before graduation, whatever means necessary. American Pie boasts of a quintet of absolutely hilarious guys who take on the mission but botch their way through dates and sexual encounters with fumbling ineptness. What is especially refreshing about the aforementioned is that these guys have no 'assigned quirks' to get the message across but only different personalities. In other words, they are playing it totally straight and the comedy therefore stems from the situations.<br/><br/>Sure 'American Pie' is not devoid of faults. Not by a long shot. It actively perpetuates stereotypes of the jock, the goody-goody two-shoes choir girl, the pimple-faced nerd, the Latin freak and the band camp geek. Far worse is that it presupposes that all girls are emotional predators of sorts, only after a heartfelt 'I love you' and conversely that are guys are horny beasts. Certainly there is a great deal of truth to both stereotypes but come on now ¬ñ it's plain lazy comedy to ride on these clich√©s. Luckily American Pie has far more weapons to offer from its arsenal of comedy. How can you not enjoy a film that gave birth to the comic genius that is Eugene Levy, the fantastic Jennifer Coolidge as a Mrs. Robinsonesque older woman and coined the expression 'MILF'? The answer is, you can't. It's crude, dirty, gross, too far ¬ñ and we love it.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

In the end of course they all achieve their goal, as in all comedies of the American Nature. <br/><br/>Eugene Levy, commands praise as Jim's sex-crazed father, who supports <br/><br/>his son's endeavor.

","July 9, 1999<br/><br/>""American Pie"" is one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen and one of the funniest movies of the year. It may look like a retread of past comedies such as ""Porky's"" because it revolves around four boys trying to lose their virginities on prom night but it breaks new ground and gives us something different: Characters and a sense of purpose. It also aims to show you that high school is the last great memory before entering into the world and the challenges one may face before getting there.<br/><br/>It's about a high school senior, Jim (Jason Biggs) who is awkward, nerdy and lives with his embarrassing father, Noah (Eugene Levy) and mom in West Michigan, Detroit. He attends high school with his friends: Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Chris ""Oz"" Ostreicher (Chris Klein) and the ladies' man, Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas). They are all frustrated with the fact that they are still virgins in high school. They also have a semi-friend who is a jock, Steve Stifler (Sean William Scott) who they despise because he is obnoxious and the only one who is not a virgin. Together, they decide to form a pact to lose their virginities on prom night and discover that it might be a challenge getting there.<br/><br/>The summer has barely started and this is the movie to kick it off. It opens in a rather funny sequence where Jim is attempting to watch scrambled porn on cable. His mother walks in the room and he desperately attempts to hide with a pillow before his father walks in and they discover Jim's fleshy indiscretion. He seems to be unlucky as he winds up in many silly and awkward situations throughout the picture, one of them involving a pie, I'm sure, will become very memorable for Jason Biggs. Real teenagers are inexperienced little hooligans who will attempt to do anything to get the girl and that's what the main focus of the picture is. That's what these characters are and they are written quite well along with actors who dive right into them. The actors themselves are inexperienced but they play them very well as breakthrough performances.<br/><br/>I really admire the characters in this film because they come off as a real people in high school, something teenage sex comedies never get right. Let me make an example: In the 1982 comedy ""Porky's,"" and I use this film because it's awful, the characters are all moronic, loud and mean-spirited, mainly the pee wee character. They spy on girls in the change room like pigs and say all the wrong things because of a poorly written script. These kids are clever, smart and they don't walk around with an inflatable penis chasing all the girls in the school. They have feelings, are human and come off as real teenagers in high school. Stifler is a bit of pig and a smartass but he is naive and acts like he knows everything. Deep down, he knows nothing and that makes him real because he will learn like the rest of them.<br/><br/>There has been a lot of talk about how raunchy this picture and, yes, it's very raunchy and vulgar. Some of the jokes in the film are gross but they are kind of setup to show the viewer where one's action might lead to because you know this film with be in the sights of young teenagers under eighteen and the producers, despicably, know this even though it's Rated R. This picture is not for kids or teenagers and is very much an adult film. One of the characters gets drunk at his own party and something gets splashed into his drink. Think of ""There's Something About Mary."" He ends up drinking it and pukes his guts out to which his friends tease him (Don't party like an idiot and be careful). One of my favorite scenes in the film is when Jim attempts to chase after the exchange student named, Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) and she tells him she will come over to his house to do homework. In Jims head, he is thinking ""She's ready."" His friends convince him to set up his webcam so they can watch the whole show. Instead, he ends up broadcasting to the whole school by accident and they see him dance like an idiot and ruin the whole situation; twice for that matter (Don't let your friends get you in trouble).<br/><br/>Through all the raunchiness in the film, there is a serious heart to it and it comes in the form of a super-dorky band girl, Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) who has a lot of band camp stories and proves that even the dorky chicks have the sweetest heart and Jim just might win hers. Eugene Levy is a laugh riot as he teaches his son ""The Secrets of the Book."" Jennifer Coolidge makes a cameo as Stifler's super sexy mom and her character will be talked about for a long time. Mena Suvari plays Heather, Oz's crush he chases after her and she is a sweet soul that is part of the school's choir who doesn't know she is being played. I found the film compelling in the way it tells the story but I found it a little to advanced for high school. Some of the dialogue between Kevin's girlfriend, Vicky (Terri Reid) and her friend, Jessica (Natasha ) was a little too strong for a high school picture and they are really awkward to listen to. Terra Reid comes off as a complete dummy. The ending of the picture lost me when all the girls are played for suckers and they don't even know it. It just feels deceitful. It would have to finish with a predictable party that attempts to close out their high school days. Nonetheless, this film is a winner and it will leave you laughing with a feel-good time."
"bowmanblue","8","2","2","11 October 2015"," There was this one time ‚Äì at band camp ‚Äì when we watched a really funny film
","Okay, so I know that 'teens behaving badly' is hardly a revolutionary genre when it comes to film-making. However, sometimes a film comes along that, while not really offering much that's new, sort of revitalises the genre (and naturally spawns one hundred and one poorer imitations). 'American Pie' did just this. Four horny teenage boys vow to lose their virginity before they graduate from high school and, as the old saying goes 'with hilarious consequences.' But, unlike all those times where that worn and weary phrase never really quite lives up to its boast, this time it does.<br/><br/>There are times when a film probably shouldn't work, yet it does. This is one of those times. The story relies heavily on 'gross-out' humour. You will need to have an appreciation for rather crude and toilet-based gags to fully enjoy this. Plus, as 'sex' is a major component to the plot, you'll need to be okay with quite a few dirty scenes.<br/><br/>Nearly fifteen years later, you will probably recognise many of the cast, but, back in 1999, they were largely unknowns, the only real recognisable face was Allison Hannigan who played 'Willow' in the Buffy the Vampire TV series. However, despite being a load of non-stars, they all played their parts really well. You'll actually care about everyone here, no matter how dumb they are.<br/><br/>If you're really looking for faults, you could say that it's riddled with clich√©s. The four main lead characters aren't exactly 'fleshed-out.' They're all walking/talking caricatures and pretty dumb (but then they're teenage boys, so I guess the lack of I.Q. can be forgiven). The females on the cast fair a little better. They're slightly more smart and sensitive, but at the same time are largely only there as potential candidates for the four boys' adolescent lusts.<br/><br/>American Pie will never be 'high brow entertainment' yet it is enormous fun for anyone with an appreciation for silly (definitely low brow) humour. Many other films were made after it trying to fit the same mould and recapture the magic. Some were okay. Others were good, but all fell short of this one. Even the official sequels themselves slowly degraded and I didn't even bother to finish all of the fourth instalment 'American Wedding.' I'll stick to this one thanks. And possibly part II."

","There were so many outtakes from everyday life in America. The house parties, the strive to get laid, the bond amongst friends, going to college, and prom all played out in one way or another for most Americans. American Pie definitely blew some scenarios out of proportion, and the result was comedic. Film makers stripped this film down to just the set and a fun script. Most of this movie relied heavily on the script with a nice setting at the end. Dialogue between couples, conversation amongst friends, and advice from parents were all simple yet smart enough to stay funny. Physical humor did make a few cameos. This movie was like a slice of every funny memory from everyone's experiences all mashed up in one pie."

The script was honest, natural, and very funny. I would not be at all surprised if Adam Herz' writing is nominated for an academy award. 1000 years from now, when an inquisitive anthropologist wants to know what it was like to be seventeen in the late 1900s this could be part of the definitive reference trilogy along with ""Breakfast Club"" and ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"".

Or you get the younger comments, who have a different view of the world, as the past has all been distorted or distilled and have a hard time with humour that isn't filtered to stop their poor little eyes and ears getting offended from something they don't agree with.

"rickert","1","19","43","29 January 2000"," Pandering Mess
","The movie can be summed up in the title it had when writer Adam Herz submitted his script to studios. ""Untitled Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be Made For Under $10 Million That Most Readers Will Probably Hate But I Think You Will Love."" It was cheaply made, and it has the words ""teenage"" and ""sex"" in it.  That is why the film got made, and that's just sad.  It really wasn't much of a comedy, it was just an excuse for a string of sex jokes and fart jokes.  If done correctly, they can be clever (see South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut) but in this case, the film just seemed like an excuse to show teens having sex.  There was no ""message"" or truth to be learned from the film, and that is why it failed. Most of those teen sex films from the 80s actually had some kernel of truth buried in them, but there's nothing here at all, except, everyone's having sex and if you don't, then YOU'RE the abnormal one.  The one relationship that I thought was going to be real was the one between Heather and Oz, but instead it just got cheapened by their post-prom-sex.  The movie panders to the worst parts of teenagers, who are obviously the target audience.  The only effect I can see it having on them is to make them think they aren't drinking, screwing, or partying enough.  That is totally the wrong message, but its the only one that is apparent."

While I could see a version of this movie working, the overall desire to be as gross as possible without the benefit of having solid jokes or characters ruins any chance of success.

Even when I was 12 I really didn't like kids or teenagers that much because I though they were completely stupid and so foolish, actually laughing at the sex and toilet humor that they think is hilarious. This movie was full of them, and I was perplexed on how anybody could really find this cute. Personally I think it's disgusting and repulsive, not to mention embarrassing and diminishing to one's reputation. How do you think people regard me? They think I actually am that intelligent. Ew. Back to the movie. I have to say besides the jokes, the movie plot was horrible, very fragile and frail, like a building with a poorly constructed frame. It really had no purpose. They wanted to lose their virginity by prom night? Whoop-dee-doo, there is barely a teenager who doesn't. Way to be unique. The acting wasn't the best I've ever seen, but then again I don't really like most of the actors. I don't really like Tara Reid that much. To me she never picked character's that I actually sympathized with. What disappoints me most about this film, and many recent films, is that they seem to take teen sex, or sex outside of marriage, as some little joke, like it doesn't matter. I'm a Catholic, but this really doesn't have to do with anything about my faith. Sex is a deep expression of love and something that should not be taken lightly, especially since the only reason they want to screw you is to for their own pleasure, or their own sick goals, like in this noble movie(ew). With all the pregnancies, abortions and sexually transmitted diseases, sex is not as carefree (if it ever was) as it used to be, and it doesn't help when Hollywood promotes it as a selling point.

","American Pie tells the story of 4 young boys who are ""unlucky"" in love and all vow to loose their virginity before their High School prom night. With some great laughs scattered in along the way along with great acting talents this movie is a real treat. I first watched this movie last year for the first time (I just turned 15) and I suddenly realised how BAD some ""comedy"" films can be now-a-days. This film is the prime example of how a comedy aspect that, at one point was so original, is now tarnished by some of the movies that are produced now a days. Some of these movies are jokes now a days with basically the same story line and characters (ALTHOUGH REMAINED!), and all has a link back to sex!!!! American Pie is the first movie ever to do this sort of broad comedy and pulls it off very well and is a great film, although some films have copied the idea of this one and has dressed it up and makes it become quite a sick and offensive theme now-a-days. 10 years after this movie was made .. it's a classic and always will be. I love all of the first 3 movies with the original cast and was quite disappointed though i must say with one element in the third movie, which is that some characters do not return. I loved the characters Ozz, Vicky, Jessica and Heather and I thought that they all deserved back in the third and, especially Vicky as she and Kevin had a relationship in the 1st one and an awkward meeting in the 2nd and I thought that it would really pay-off seeing all of the main characters back together for one last time. But this didn't happen and, apart from this, all of the first 3 films are gems in my opinion. American Pie/American Pie 2/American Pie 3: The Wedding: FANTASTIC TRILOGY!! GIVE 'EM A TRY!!

"Bogmeister","5","3","5","23 July 2005"," American dreams of idiotic teens
","I viewed the 'gasp' unrated version of the high school sex comedy which renewed interest in ""Porky's""-style bathroom humor. My guess is the 'extra' scenes involve Nadia-the-foreign exchange-student's striptease while spied on by the Internet. But other than that, there's very little nudity or simulated sex on screen. In fact, just about all the risqu√É¬© stuff happens off-camera: you hear various noises, someone bursts into the room, they gasp at what they see, but YOU don't see it. A famous early scene has a guy with a boner - but it's covered with a sock. All the bedroom scenes near the end when the guys finally get lucky are also demure, as the females are all strategically covered up. Then, of course, there's the infamous 'guy-making-it-with-a-pie' scene. It's just stupid. The entire movie is rather odd. It's almost like watching a TV sit-com show which contains some gross, raunchy ideas. All the kids, especially the males, look like they fell out of a cutesy '80s TV show. They all talk and act like kids from the '60s or '50s. Sure, they're obsessed with sex, but so were kids in the '50s. Then there's the requisite toilet jokes, including the 'guy-has-to-take-a-nasty-dump' scene (in the girls' bathroom, in this case). In the end, we have a typical coming-of-age tale. I suppose when you get to be a certain age (like me), you realize this type of stuff is recycled by Hollywood every 20 years or so. They hype it quite a bit, of course, and teens & young twenty-somethings flock to it thinking it's something which has never been seen or done before. In a sense, maybe they're right. Kids today, like any day, don't believe anything valid existed more than 10 years back. Everything is NOW-NOW-NOW, with no thought to history (or film history). Ironically, it probably would have been better if everyone had forgotten that ""Porky's"" and its sequels had ever existed, but somehow or other, someone manages to dredge up the excrement of low-class material which used to elicit howls of laughter from brain-dead teens (now long gone) for the current masses."

","I saw this movie a few years ago when I was around 14. I must say, I was pretty disturbed with some parts of the movie, especially since I saw this as a freshman in high school.

In the end she does after the senior prom. Jim tries everything from giving her an orgasm through oral sex to sweet-talking/persuasion. This story is surrounded by the issues of Jim√Ç¬°√Ç¬Øs schoolmates, Chris 'Oz' Ostreicher (Chris Klein), Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott), Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Chuck Sherman (Chris Owen).

Waters speaks truly. Don't waste your time with this, there are far too many good films that have and will be made about young people.

","American Pie was the FIRST teenage/high school flick I saw in my life where watching it actually made me feel old.  I was 23 pushing 24 when I saw AP in theaters in '99.  Before that I could still watch teen flicks and even high school flicks, even though I was no longer a teen and no longer(thank God) in high school.  No problem whatsoever.  But I guess in '99 I realized it had been 6 years since I was in high school, and these goofy teen flicks got repetive and boring to me.  The teens in the theater were laughing their heads off, probably thinking that AP was brand new and original, when in reality it is old, old, old, tired and cliche.<br/><br/>I saw AP with two friends, one guy was exactly my age and I looked at him and knew he hated AP for the same reasons I did.  My other friend was still 20 at the time, and he was laughing his head off.  Poor guy, I guess he can be forgiven, when you are 20 a lot of people still think of themselves as ""teens"" and can still watch movies like this.  I know I could,.....until 23. Millions of REAL teens in 1999(unlike my friend who was 20) will cherish ""American Pie"" as ""their film"" a hallmark of their growing years and something that made them ""come of age"".  I guess I had ""Dazed and Confused"" and even ""Clueless"".  But AP will always be remembered by me....it was a coming of age piece for me.  It was the first teen flick I watched where I just sat and stared at the screen trying to remind myself to laugh and stop feeling so old watching this.

Tall virgins, sporty virgins, nerdy virgins, sex-crazed virgins. Heck, whip out the old shopping list because there is a virgin for everyone! You buy one, and get a sexually obliterated apple pie as well. Priceless! If you haven't seen American Pie then, well what are you doing? This is a rite of passage. It turns innocent children into mature adults. Well, it turned this group of friends who make a pact to rid their virginity by prom night. We've got the jock, who thinks of himself as a Casanova figure. Then there's the mature one who refuses to use public lavatories (that's me by the way). Also the popular one who already has a girlfriend but is scared to go all the way to fourth base. Then, finally, there's the dork who is so obsessed with sex that he turns a warmly made apple pie into a fleshlight. Delicious! The beauty and simplicity of this comedy is that all the characters are loveable in their own unique way. It's crude sure, and never pushes any boundaries. Its formulaic narrative never injects any unexpected surprises into its predictable story. The amount of hormones being shown may also put some viewers off, especially with the constant talk of sex. But it's so assured at creating laughs through awkward situations, that you can't help but become attached to these bumbling fools. There are moments of genuine tenderness, particularly during prom night, that culminate into a milestone for my generation. This was the quintessential high school comedy, and it still manages to make me smile. Whether it be Jim's dad precariously talking to his son about sex or Stifler's provocative mum seducing his friends. It's light, raunchy and bursting with plenty of character. American Pie is just so full of flavour, that everyone needs to take a bite out of it. And hey, it popularised the term ""MILF"". That's sure to be an achievement, right?"

It is a great & funny film about a much of guys desperate to lose their virginity but naturally with mixed & hilarious results. Couple of standout scenes here, Shannon E masturbating on web cam & one of the guys having sex with an American pie, worth seeing for those alone.

Jim tries to score with sexy exchanged student (Elizabeth), Oz tries to make it with a straight-laced choir singer (Suvari), Kevin tries to win the trust of his girlfriend (Reid) whose relationship is ending, and Finch pays people to support a new reputation of his. Supporting characters include Jim's guiding father (Levy), obnoxious party animal Steve Stifler (Scott), band geek and Jim's last-minute partner (Hannigan), Stifler's sexy mom and Finch's last minute effort (Coolidge), sex expert Jessica (Lyonne), and wannabe cool Chuck Sherman ""the Shermanator"" (Owen). These other characters add to the hilarity, heart and memorability.<br/><br/>Despite this movie being about sex and totally hilarious, the character development and chemistry are strong, and Kevin's and Oz's subplots are more dramatic than funny. So any super-conservative person would be surprised at the right mix of comedy and drama. The seriousness isn't sad or boring, it is there to strengthen the quality of the movie. Also, everything this movie has is realistic and relatable with the hard times of high school. So it may be about trying to get laid, but that is an aspect that nearly every teenager faces. As the guys get closer to doing so, they also learn lessons on love and adulthood. And since each friend is different, more lessons can be made and the movie gets strengthened even more. Without these strong dimensions, it would just be a stupid late-night comedy.<br/><br/>4/4"

"mattymatt4ever","8","2","3","17 April 2001"," Funny, heartfelt and original
","""American Pie"" set the standard for teen gross-out/sex comedies of contemporary society.  It definitely has some unforgetabbly funny moments. The scene with the beer--CLASSIC!  A film like this is noted for its crudeness, but what makes it special is it disciplines the crudeness and uses it intelligently.  There are few throwaway gags.  And through all the crudeness, there's a heart.  There's a fine love story that develops via each character, and that romance develops smoothly and not at the usual forced Hollywood pace.  And I think that's what made this film memorable. Because we see a lot of movies with crude sexual humor left and right.  The makers of this movie KNOW how to tell a sex joke and any joke that regards to bodily functions.  I think the scene that caught most people's eyes was the stripping scene with Jason Biggs and the foreign exchange student Nadia, played by Shannon Elizabeth.  We do get a shot of her taking her clothes off, but it's not done in a gratuitous manner.  It then cuts to the reactions of every computer user in East Falls, checking out the hot naked chick splattered across their screens.  The way they edited that scene was really unique.  The film even contains Shannon masturbating, and that's also not done in a gratuitous manner.  Then we have Jason barging in on her, and she feels humiliated.  What made that scene unique is SHE made HIM take his clothes off.  Each comic moment goes smoothly because of the timing, delivery and all-out design of the sequences.  So these are no mindless gags we usually are faced with in teen flicks of these kind.  Of course, SCTV legend Eugene Levy steals the screen in his supporting role.  I don't think they could've picked anyone better to play that role. <br/><br/>
""American Pie"" is a treat for teens, young adults and--maybe--some older ones.  I think they should find it quite harmless.  If you have an overprotective adult in the house who gets outraged if they hear the word ""damn"" used--make sure you view this film solo.  But if your parents are more lenient, there's nothing to worry about.  I'm sure they'll laugh with you.  I have a cousin who thinks of ""American Pie"" as the dirtiest film ever made.  She thinks it should get a triple R rating.  She said, ""What kind of dirty teen films are they making nowadays?  Back in my day, I was raised with good, wholesome films like ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""16 Candles.""  She obviously doesn't get out a hell of a lot.  If you're stuck in the same close-minded mode as my cousin, skip this one.  If not--kick back and have some fun!!!"

But man, it's still pretty good!<br/><br/>In the end, I think is fair to call it a ""classic"" of R rated teen comedies, since it inspired a bunch of other movies all throughout the 2000's. And it's well deserved, some few jokes didn't age that well, but it's probably one or two moments. But overall, the movie is pretty funny! At first, I didn't exactly like the characters, but after 20/30 minutes you kind get behind most of them, I think Kevin might be the only one I didn't exactly was rooting for. Oz has some kind of an arc, which is cool, and the scenes of Jim with his dad are just pure gold. Eugene Levy destroys here, and steals the show.<br/><br/>Of course, some parts of it probably wouldn't get made today (like the whole sequence broadcasting the girl in Jim's room). I think that it doesn't have to take the movie's credit of been funny. You have to always stay open minded to judge how something used to be done, and see why it was wrong and how we can improve moving forward. I just think that when you analyze a movie you should always try to consider the it was made, and the circumstances around it. If you think about it, she was masturbating in a strange's house, so, well, she wasn't that less of a creepie.<br/><br/>Anyways, at the end, is a movie with sex jokes, about some dudes getting laid, but is also a bit about friendship which I thought was cool. 99% of people that watch it, are probably gonna want to laugh and not think about anything else, and for that, this movie is perfect, is 21 years old, but still so funny. As we would say here in brazil, is a ""besteirol"" classic.<br/><br/>Obs: Just wanna point out some of my favorite specific moments: Man, the pie scene! Lol, that's probably my favorite interaction of him and his dad (that and the ""I want you to be careful when you put... the croissant""); Stifler's mom saying ""I have an aged 18 whisky... just how I like it"" is just pure gold; The whole storyline which Finch and the rumors are great too."

","American Pie (1999): Dir: Paul Weitz / Cast: Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Eugene Levy, Seann William Scott, Shannon Elizabeth: Here is a vulgar teen comedy where its biggest pitch is to feature a teen male with a baked apple pie plastered over his crotch. It reflects the teenage sex drive with a title suggesting innocence that they do not possess and their parents do not see. Four teenage males make a pact to lose their virginity before prom night. Director Paul Weitz understands the teenage sexual hunger. Eugene Levy steals scenes as a father who understands his son's sexual appetite and arrives home presenting him with issues of Hustler and has long discussions about masturbation. Jason Biggs brings out Jim's sexual longings and becomes involved in an Internet stripteases. Chris Klein takes singing lessons to impress a girl who doesn't realize that she is being played. Seann William Scott highlights the gross humour particularly when he drinks a beer without knowing what was expelled into it beforehand. Shannon Elizabeth is the fixation of Jim as foreign student Nadia whose homework session becomes a web cam sensation. While humour will discourage some, it is the sexual freedom being flaunted that may send the wrong message. Theme regards teenage sexual appetite with an ending that sends the wrong message of clothes coming off and everybody waking up in someone else's bed. Score: 8 / 10"

","Let's not beat about it, American Pie is hilarious. Its crude, raunchy humour and frequently outrageous giggles will leave you scoffing with a mixture of bowel crunching laughter and light shock. Like most teen movies, it's extremely cheesy, but once you get past that, it's only too easy to fall into seeing the flick the way it was intended... without a shred of seriousness. <br/><br/>The plot is simple enough. Four high school seniors pledge to lose their virginity before their fast approaching senior prom. The actors are at their best together, where the totally outrageous script truly doesn't hold back. By far the best feature of American Pie is its on-screen gags, which are both frequent and clever. They're outright brilliant, and will make you howl with laughter. <br/><br/>However, for those who view their cinema closely, American Pie is also an exploration into coming of age. You get the impression that the boys are desperately on the cusp of bridging the gap between teenager and adult. Such an impression is all too easy to relate to, and viewers may feel all overcome with nostalgia at the eventful house parties and sexual banter. <br/><br/>American Pie is comedy gold. It's utterly without dignity, but that's what makes it so wonderful. Sure, the acting's nothing special, but it's the boys' experiences that make it such a laugh. The plot and characters are strong enough that the film isn't totally ridiculous, but it's so cheeky and funny that it's become a popular classic."
"taylorkingston","6","1","1","26 September 2014"," The sequels are better...
","I watched this movie, because my sister said it was one of the funniest movies that she'd ever seen. So, reluctantly, I watched it. I was a little disappointed because of the way she hyped it up. It wasn't a bad movie, just not as great as I thought it was going to be. In my opinion, the sequels are better. And it is so freaking rude. I didn't realize how many curse words and nudity-implied scenes. I do have to say that Stifler is my favorite character from this franchise, and he is incredibly funny. I was surprised seeing Alyson Hannigan, in this movie, because after only ever seeing her as sweet Willow from Buffy The Vampire Slayer, and funny Lily from How I Met Your Mother, I was shocked to see her saying stuff about flutes, you know, going in places.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 6 out of 10."
"joshua-halstead","8","1","1","14 November 2013"," Surprisingly Entertaining, and Warm Hearted.
","I want to start this review with a shocking statement: I am a Christian. That's right, a Christian watched ""American Pie."" Okay, so to you this may not seem like much of a big deal, but trust me, to 99 percent of Christians, it is. See, I grew up being told that these films were stupid, raunchy, cheesy, sex comedies. I put in the disc for AP expected to be greatly offended and find it to be all of those things. I only watched it at first because I am a very big Alyson Hannigan fan and I wanted to see her trademark role. I'll be the first to admit that there is a lot of inappropriate content in the movie, and yes, he has sex with a pie, but I think people overestimate the way that these things are shown. The movie isn't a porn flick. It shows his butt for a few second while he is over the pie. Yes there i frontal nudity on a girl, and yes, it is in a prolonged scene, however, this is probably the most justifiable nudity of any movie in the 1990's. <br/><br/>In the 1990's teen films had become so squeaky clean, and afraid of offending anyone that they had become incredibly unrealistic. AP was a throw back to 80's films like Fast Times At Ridgemont High, The Breakfast Club, and Sixteen Candles. Granted AP is worse than all of these. There is no way to justify the content, but that doesn't mean the movie isn't a good movie. It is a well-written, well-acted, funny, somewhat original comedy with a lot of heart. It brought back the bro- mance. <br/><br/>The fact is that if you are easily offended, you will HATE AP, but if you're not, grab some popcorn, a large coke---and maybe some apple pie-- - and enjoy this truly one of a kind, hilarious movie that(in-case you're one those people who thinks it is) is not a sex comedy but truly a bromantic comedy."
"tgooderson","6","1","1","28 April 2012"," Best to remember rather than re watch.
","It's the summer of 1999, I'm 13 and somehow myself and about eight friends get into our local two screen cinema one afternoon to see American Pie. 95 minutes and a lot of thrown popcorn later and we leave having seen the funniest film we think we'll ever see. Now it's 2012, I'm 26, I have a beard and I've gone back to watch the film that my 13 year old self fell in love with before watching the forth instalment of the franchise next month.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the senior year at High School four friends; jock Oz (Chris Klein), awkward geek Jim (Jason Biggs), quirky Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and regular guy Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) are struggling to lose their virginity before they each embark for college. Having seen classmates like loud mouth Stifler (Seann William Scott) have success on this front and after one party believing that even the dorkiest guy in the class Chuck 'Shermanator' Sherman (Chris Owen) has lost his virginity, the four friends make a pact that they will help each other to get laid by Prom Night.<br/><br/>When I first watched this in 1999 the idea of hearing teenagers talk about and engage in sex during a movie was still novel and outrageous to me. Some of the jokes and more graphic or gross scenes were hilarious and like nothing I'd ever seen before. Now, 13 years later after the likes of The Hangover which have pushed the crude and discussing acts even further, the film feels a bit tame. It's still pretty gross to see Stifler drink from that cup or for Jim to enjoy that pie but sensitivities and audiences have changed a lot in the last decade or so. Much of the humour I liked 13 years ago now feels immature and I suppose this is because it isn't fresh and also because I've grown up. The humour in The Hangover didn't appeal to me either and the trailer for Project X put me off completely. I wonder how funny someone born in 1999 would find this film now. I expect they would find it funnier that I. One character who still remains funny to me is Jim's Dad (Eugene Levy). His interactions with his son about sex are cringe worthy and embarrassing even today. He stole the film and the entire franchise.<br/><br/>One thing that struck me this time round was how poor some of the acting was. Tara Reid is dreadful and Chris Klein even worse. Shannon Elizabeth's accent is ridiculous and the country she is supposed to be from didn't even exist in 1999! Another thing I noticed this time was how sweaty the whole cast looked. I'd never noticed it before but it looked like each actor had gone for a run immediately before reading their lines. I didn't particularly like the sentimentality towards the end and everything ended far too neatly but at least it wasn't a nasty or mean movie. I also really liked the film's soundtrack both in 1999 and now.<br/><br/>Despite all its flaws I still have great affinity for this film. It reminded me of being in my teens, wearing the same overly baggy clothes and having the same overly gelled hair. The film has stayed with me all these years and in a way I wish I hadn't revisited it. It's like that video game that you loved as a kid and you see in a shop for √Ç¬£2. You take it home, dig out and dust down your old console and then realise five minutes in that times have changed. Sure, it was great when you were a kid but you're not anymore. It's best to put it back in the box and remember the good times you had as a kid.<br/><br/>www.attheback.blogspot.com"

","American Pie tells a story of four lads, about to leave High School, wanting to enjoy their last summer together, not to mention getting laid. That's about it in terms of plot - nothing terribly sophisticated or original.<br/><br/>But the four lads and their girls are all well drawn characters, there are some very funny (if rude) set pieces, and the movie has a great deal of heart - yes, it may be smutty, but the genuine relationships between the characters carry a great deal of meaning above and beyond what might otherwise simply be tacky.<br/><br/>It is worth singling out Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad for the funniest performance, and Alyson Hannigan for the single funniest (and most unexpected) line.<br/><br/>And here is where I go against the flow a little. Seann William Scott delivers a brilliant performance as Stifler - obnoxious, crass, loud, overbearing, uncouth, gross. I dislike the character, as I dislike such characters which seem to have become the mainstay of American teen comedies, often being the hub around which everything rotates. By all means have such a character, but when they become the centre of attention (and, worse, become portrayed as lovable and laudable), I no longer want to hang out in their company. This is the direction the series started to follow."
"Stevolteon","Null","1","1","31 December 2002"," Intensely hypocritical *spoiler warning*
","Okay, so this kind of comedy isn't my cup of tea - I spent the film either cringing or grimacing when I guess I was supposed to be laughing, but that's just me. I understand and appreciate that for a majority of people it was the funniest thing ever, and I won't criticise or try to change your opinion.<br/><br/>What I do criticise (other than the predictability) is the fact that it is incredibly hypocritical. At the beginning the heroes (I use the term loosely) of the piece realise that a ""geeky"" character has had sex, whereas as they are still virgins. Obviously this state of affairs threatens the entire stability of the stereotypical teen comedy genre, so they set off on a quest to ""get laid"" at all costs. At this point I could see the end, they all get their wish and it turns out the geeky character hadn't actually had sex, so all is right with the world, but what I hadn't anticipated was the insertion of a life lesson for the foursome. Toward the end they suddenly realise that... y'know, loosing your virginity isn't that important after all...<br/><br/>If the film had cut at that point I'd have been impressed and would have felt ashamed at my misgivings. What in fact happens is that it continues and... most of them do, indeed, ""get laid"", completely voiding the lesson they've apparently learnt. Either this film is vastly hypocritical, or the message it's putting out is ""Loosing your virginity isn't important... so long as you've had sex.""<br/><br/>As far as entertaining people with a receptive sense of humour goes it's obviously a resounding success, but they should have just left it as a string of ""hilarious situations"" instead of trying to throw in a moral."

","I was quite disappointed with this film, as it does not live up to its hype. It's basically the film version of a Penthouse Forum letter, with gorgeous high school girls being wooed by patheticly inept boys. American Pie is saved from being a total disaster by a tone of sweetness, which is mainly supplied by the female characters, who are far more realistic than the males. Really, do after prom parties turn into a night at the Playboy mansion, with everyone pairing off into different rooms for idyllic sexual bliss? This film should have aimed a little higher, and instead of trying to out-gross the Farrelly Brothers should have concentrated on further developing the plot."

","I cannot believe the praise and success this film has received. This film has been hailed by many as the ""Ultimate Teen Comedy"" which to me seems like a total contradiction in terms. As a ""teen"" film it fails because most of the cast look like they are hitting 30 and as a comedy it also fails because of the lack of humour.<br/><br/>The thread of a plot involves a group  of these so called teenage boys who make a bet among themselves to see who will be the first to lose their virginity. What follows is a series of predictable and crude jokes that serve only to remind the viewer about the golden age when comedies like Life of Brian, Blazing saddles and the Sleeper graced the cinematic screen. The jokes are so badly contrived and staged it is ironically laughable (about the only true laugh you will get from this film).<br/><br/>Because of the lack of genuine wit that is apparent in the dialogue the director goes for visual comedy of the most vulgar with certain scenes such as the one where the hero abuses an apple pie and the one where the guy who tries to film his first liaison with a girl through his Webcam for his friends to watch. The only thing funny about that scene is the perfectly seamless live footage his friends are able to view online via the primitive webcam.<br/><br/>The film concludes with scenes of highly unlikely sexual encounters between the lead characters and their so called female conquests. I am afraid this film asks us to drop our expectations of proper comedy to such depths that we cannot enjoy any of what these film perceives as humour. I am glad to read from these reviews that at least there some people out there who feel the same way about this film. This film about a group of guys trying to lose their virginity could only seem funny to those out there who are still virgins.<br/><br/>I hope movie hell is big enough to accommodate the cast crew and even the fans of this ""joke"" film."

Unlike its predecessors, American Pie is never prepared to venture into true bad taste territory, preferring instead to supplant its raunchiness with a desperately twee undercurrent. Scenes of almost gruesome sentimentality are often sandwiched between the cringe-inducing moments which provide the occasional (but genuine) laughs, and the old fashioned values that end up being preached simply stand out as heavy handed in light of the nature of the material and of teenagers in general. There are amusing segments and good performances all round, especially from Eugene Levy's 50's throwback father figure, but second time around the flaws stand out awkwardly.

Fast Times At Ridgemount High (1982) and a larder full of others followed Porky's with similar themes, even if as far as I can remember a pie didn't feature as it does again in American Pie.	<br/><br/>And then last year a certain body fluid became a fashion accessory in There's Something About Mary, which is certainly not about teensters having it off for the first time, but is the most striking example of the tendency for extreme vulgarity in teen market films.<br/><br/>And yes semen again becomes a plot element in American Pie and yet again it's not placed in its intended receptacle, but is this funny as it is intended to be?<br/><br/>Well it depends on whether you are a giggly, embarrassed teenager. The scene is set early in the film when four male friends in their last weeks of high school decide that they have better get laid by the prom. I'll assume that you all know what a prom is. We've all seen enough of these films to know.<br/><br/>Anyway there's the sports jock (Oz) who falls for a local chorister (Mena Suvari). There's Jim (Jason Biggs) of pie fame who's dorky dad (Eugene Levy ) steps in to help with porn mags. Kevin reckons that oral sex doesn't really qualify and strange Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) wants to get in on the act but seems the least likely to succeed.<br/><br/>Things have moved on in the 1990's. The humour is more extreme and the technology is more zappy. In previous decades lewd photographs might have been distributed. American Pie indulges in The Internet and Sexcam. We can only suppose what might be on offer in these films in the years to come as bandwidth improves with internet development. It's however nice to see that these children are up with the latest toys. <br/><br/>Children? Yes the actors don't really look 16 or 17 but the age difference is less glaring than it often is. This subject matter is certainly good grist for the film mill.  Just about every one does have their first sexual experience, which is always at least memorable.<br/><br/>But what of the notion of sex as a singular event rather than as an integral part of whole relationships? And what of sex as a commodity, as a service to sell, even if money doesn't specifically change hands?  Sex does sell and American Pie does that notion no harm.<br/><br/>But still this film does swing firmly to the notion that relationships can be much more than the sex act and one night stands. It will raise a few smiles, but mainly for those who are still giggling behind the shelter shed."

","'American Pie' is a funny coming of age film. For all the crude humor, the movie is really rather sweet. Although the boys start out just looking for a good time, they end up finding love and even maturity. The girls are the ones who are in control of the situation. Alyson Hannigan especially offers lots of laughs as a band geek. Don't be fooled by the marketing and hype, this 'Pie' is warm and touching."

","There are movies for everyone... movies for people who like Drama.... gore... and even harmless vulgar humor.... and believe it be harmless vulgar humor is 'American Pie'! If you do not like movies dealing with such.. then plain and simple 'Dont Go See It!' No need in coming on here and telling people they are 'sick in the head if you like American Pie' like one reviewer did...<br/><br/>Anyways aside from people with rude comments and not taking the fact that different people like different stuff because just maybe we can deal with it.... 'American Pie' is hilarious! It's been a while since I have laughed so much... True it may have a slim plot but with this kind of movie it only can be expected... so I am rating this movie very highly recommended, considering it is in its own genre...<br/><br/>Better than the recent 'Theres Somthing About Mary', 'American Pie' excells in humor as much as fun! A definite crowd pleaser... I for one know I have never seen the audience react as wildly or with such togetherness as with this movie... it was outrageous good fun!<br/><br/>The interesting part is that along with 'sick humor' it acually deals suprisingly well with the slight touches of 'teen' romance and not sinking to far into just plain lust....<br/><br/>Really a treat.. Enjoy it... and don't be afraid to say so... it's worth fighting for... to keep this as one of the best movies of this year (1999)... so far..."

","I am so sick of some of the crap that hollywood has put out in the past years that is supposed to be funny.  American Pie had me laughing throughout the whole film.  As a high school graduate, I can relate to the humor in this movie, as should anybody (especially male) who attended high school and has a sense of humor. Not all guys are like the actors in the movie.  But most guys that I have met in high school and college remind me of some scene in the movie.  Of course some of the scenes were absolutely ridiculous and unrealistic but were very funny as long as you were able to take the humor for what it was worth.  I left the theater with a big grin on my face and did not feel that I spent my money unwisely."
"RonB-4","Null","1","1","10 August 1999"," A surprisingly sweet teen comedy
","""American Pie"" sounds like your average teen comedy, but it  has a certain sweetness that wins you over despite some rather gross gags along the way. A cast of mostly unknown but gorgeous teen actors star as high school kids struggling with sexuality and love.  Four senior boys vow to lose their virginity by prom night, and set out to do so in varying ways.  We laugh at their fumbling attempts, but also root for them to succeed.  In the end, we've seen a guy ""do it"" with an apple pie, but also seen a realistic portrayal of teen love.  What's more, the featured characters are not jocks, cheerleaders or even popular.  It's refreshing to see a movie that would even assume high school seniors could be virgins. ""American Pie"" is a fine date movie and will entertain young and old alike."
"GuyCC","8","1","1","10 August 1999"," A teen comedy that's worth its weight in pie.
","After all of the hype generated about this is a ""must see"" movie, I finally decided to see what this movie was all about once the hype died down a little.<br/><br/>Boy, I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>This movie isn't as ""disgusting"" as a lot of people would have you believe. Sure, there's the opening scene, and the gut-wrenchingly funny pie scene (I knew about this, but it just doesn't compare to actually seeing this), the disgusting beer scene, and a brief nude scene, but there's a lot more to the movie than that.  A lot more.<br/><br/>The story of four guys trying to lose their virginity before the end of high school is one that anyone who is currently in high school or has been in high school this past few decades can relate to.  Sex for each of the guys means a different thing, and their individual ""quests"" to reach their goal are funny, could very possibly happen, and change each of the guys into something more than just a bunch of sex-starved hornballs.  The tables really start to turn when a few of the guys actually start caring about their would-be conquests and other things.<br/><br/>I grew to really like these actors and actresses as they play their roles well, and as they grow in personality past their ""pact"".  They're typical high school kids, like it or not.<br/><br/>Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad is hilarious with his dead-pan delivery and his never-ending attempts to help Jim through his current er, ""phase"".<br/><br/>
Fortunately, the laughs go past just physical slap-stick humor.  The one-liners are more often than not hilarious.<br/><br/>This movie more than reminded me of those classic '80's teen films, blending a great mix of goofiness and the awkwardness that age.  No, I don't think it's like ""There's Something About Mary"".  ""Mary"" was a movie that was funny just for the sake of being so.  ""Pie"", while having its hilarious gross-out moments, also had its fair share of sincere ones.  I liked the kids because they came off as actual people instead of one-joke cardboard teen stock.<br/><br/>I recommend American Pie to anyone who has liked a good John Hughes '80's film or who just wants to see a movie that has likeable characters and is really funny.  American Pie has just become one of my new favorites."

"ester-3","4","1","1","24 June 1999"," just another in a string of disappointments
","Every movie I've seen since Shakespeare in Love has been a disappointment, but this one is the worst yet. I really expected this to be memorable, witty - a satire skewering high school ""values"". instead it just reinforced every stupid idea and stereotype that I expected it to shoot down. ultimately, the moral: even losers get laid, and this makes them, magically, no longer losers; and, yes, sex is the be-all and end-all. The movie begins with a masturbation sequence that becomes the motif - and, yes, it's funny at first, but how many times can a father realistically walk in on his son, and how many different ways can the same gag be repeated before it gets stale? the majority of the kids in the theater with me hooted and screamed just as loudly each time, so i guess i'm in the minority, but i got very tired of humor in the form of simple gross-outs. Don't get me wrong - I thought Something About Mary was hilarious; but Mary had a good script, good acting, ingenuity, and an engaging plot. this movie has none or very little of the four (with the exception of Natasha Lyonne, who is above this movie the same way Jeneane Garofolo was above 200 Cigarettes). If you're looking for a good movie, forget this one. I'll offer an alternative - just as soon as I can find one myself."

The most extreme being a female character visiting a lad from school she barely knows, being left for 2 minutes in his bedroom and returns to find that in his absence she's stripped off and started masturbating over female pornography that she found in his dresser draw. Reality check anyone? This film could have been greatly improved by removing a few ridiculous scenes so that it was male AND female friendly.

Hell, I enjoyed the second movie much more so than this garbage (so much that I bought it... only to realize that I made a mistake, and therefore gave it away).  This movie reminds me of Road Trip, in that everyone gushes about how funny it is, and what a ""classic"" (a term thrown around all too often) it is... yet I don't find it funny in the least.

","I am one of the members of the target audiences for this movie, a horny teenaged male, but I didn't think this movie was all that great.  It is advertised as a comedy, which it is, there are some funny parts, but they threw in a lot of sentimental stuff and slow parts in here.  Like Something About Mary, I thought this movie was way overrated.  A few attempts at gross-out humor and some phallus jokes do not a good movie make.  South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut, which was released just a week before this, was a lot funnier, raunchier, and more fun to watch.  The funny parts do not make up for the slow boring parts.  The movie tries to make you laugh one second and then feel for the characters the next, but for me it didn't work. Good scenes:  The beginning scene, the pie scene, any scene with Jim and his father, the Jim and Michelle sex scene, the Fitch and the one guy's mother scene (MILF-Mother I'd Like to F**k), and the scene with Jim and Nadia.  Bad scenes: just about everything else.  The slow moving parts that try and give the characters feelings and stuff, which doesn't belong in a teen sex comedy.  So if you have a choice between this and South Park, if I was you I'd go with South Park.  Or, if you still want to see a good sex comedy, go out and rent Porky's Fast Times at Ridgemont High, or National Lampoon's Animal House."
"cowsrcool87","1","5","12","9 August 2001"," How can such an awful movie make so much money?
","American Pie was undoubtedly a huge success financially. It gave hope to the struggling teen comedy genre and for the past two years we've had to endure rip-offs even worse than this.  The movie feels as fake and tasteless as a Mcdonald's pie, with almost no genuine comedic moments. Worst yet, near the end we get a moment where our hero, Jim says he's sick of talking about sex and isn't so excited to have it anymore, while the supporting characters nod their heads in agreement. The moral about taking time to have sex is particularly pretentious in a movie like this, and is even more undermined by the fact that they all have sex in the last 15 minutes.  Jason Biggs, as we have seen recent films can barely carry a film without humping a pie, and his career is already burning out.  Unfortunately, American Pie 2 will be released this week, which is sure to make a lot of money. American Pie not only stands as a vastly overrated movie, but one of the worst to ever inspire a sequel."

","Never before have I seen a comedy that fails so miserably as this movie.  At least, I assumed it was a comedy, despite the fact that there was nothing even remotely laughable in it.  Anything that may have had even a small amount of humor was beaten to death by the commercials, so when it came up in the movie, all I could do was groan.  For example, all the jokes throughout the movie about the one kid's slut mom, and how everyone wanted to nail her were wasted, because everyone already knew that whateverhisnamewas would get her by the end of the movie, because it was in the commercial.  Same goes for the infamous pie scene.  If you want to shock people, don't show an edited, less interesting version of your shock scene in all the trailers, or put it on all the posters.  Perhaps had I not expected a pie to be molested, it would have been funny, but as it was, the scene was dull, at best.  I've seen ""Batman and Robin,"" and ""Chairman of the Board,"" yet this holds strong to the title of worst thing I've ever seen.  I wish I could give it negative stars, it was just awful."

It has to be one of the worst movies spewed out by Hollywood nowadays.   Whatever happened to the Noble movie?   Star Wars is one of the last refuges to the ideas that noble beliefs can still be shown on the Big Screen and still be entertaining, gripping, and interesting.<br/><br/>And, what was even more offensive was in a commerical for 'American Pie', it had people singing 'How Sweet it is' to pies(something you'd have to watch the movie to understand).   I took it as a personal insult(the movie, and the commercial) against two songs in which I love(I hope Don and James hears about this outrage).

"paul2001sw-1","3","3","6","2 June 2005"," As conservative as apple pie
","The American high school, as depicted in modern comedy, is a strange place indeed: full of over-aged, foul mouthed jocks and sexy, self-aware young women and what's more, every one of them is affluent. In a country where many real schools have metal detectors on the doors to keep out firearms, it's a relentlessly aspirational world, which, for all the cruelty and anguish on display, the target teen-aged audience can dream that they belong to. In addition, for all the toilet humour, it's a profoundly conservative world as well. 'American Pie', for example, may set new lows (if that's how you want to consider them) in toilet humour, but fundamentally this is a film about the joys of belonging; belonging with your friends, your lovers, even belonging with your decidedly weird father. In this narrative, the fear of isolation is eventually banished through the mere possession of an essentially good heart. Real outsiders, if they appear at all, appear only as losers, virtually labelled as the child-abusers of the next generation in punishment for their failure to learn how to fit in.<br/><br/>In fact, viewed in these terms, 'American Pie' is far from the most offensive film in it's genre, with a little less smug sanctimoniousness behind the smut than is usual in such fare. Unfortunately, it's just not that funny. The plot is simple: four guys try to get laid, and the absence of real narrative reduces the film to a series of set pieces devoid of real context. Even the eponymous pie gag isn't even particularly gross, and there's none of the offbeat charm of 'There's Something About Mary' (which aimed at a slightly older audience and which I found rather funnier than I like to admit). The success of films like this is all about selling a lifestyle: this is a film about how the average teenager might like to lose their virginity. Real life is darker, but also, often funnier as well."

That's the whole plot! Now you COULD make an OK film out of this idea (maybe) but this film doesn't even try. It just thinks up every single way a guy can be sexually humiliated and/or appear pathetic and throws it at the audience full force. Hey, why be subtle? Jason Biggs especially is made to look like the most pathetic loser I've ever seen. I suppose the actor DOES deserve credit for humiliating himself again and again.

"ironhorse_iv","6","4","10","4 June 2016"," This 1990s teen sex comedy hasn't aged well. The pie is starting to stink.
","Directed by then-first time directors, brothers, Paul & Chris Weitz, this raunchy comedy was somewhat memorable at the time for its hilarious jokes about a group of high school seniors, named Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs), Chris ""Oz"" Ostreicher (Chris Klein), Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas) & Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), all trying to losing one's virginity before their high school graduation. While, this movie was a box-office hit and spawned three direct sequels: 2001's 'American Pie 2', 2003's 'American Wedding', and 2012's 'American Reunion', & a lot of really bad, direct to DVDs spinoffs movies such as, 2005's 'American Pie Presents: Band Camp', '2006's 'American Pie: The Naked Mile', 2007's 'American Pie: Beta House', and 2009's 'American Pie The Book of Love'; it's clear, after rewatching this film, a few days ago, I can say that 'American Pie' is not as good as I remember. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found the movie's message to be a bit broken. After all, the film concentrates on bunch of friends trying to force sex to happen, rather than allowing it to happen on its own. It wasn't until, near the end of the movie, they decide that was a dumb thing to do, since sex shouldn't be a goal in itself, but something you do with a person who's important to you and when you both want it. That's a nice little moral that teenager can honestly get behind. However, the filmmakers kinda ruin it, later, by allowing all of them to have sex, all on the same night. As much as I like Mena Suvari as Heather Gardner and Chris Klein as Oz's relationship. I found it to be, a bit shallowed. After all, Oz does kinda bragged about sleeping with Heather, afterwards, despite their characters supposedly, taking their relationship slow. To make matters worse, some of the characters find themselves, being used, borderline getting rape, or committing adultery that night. That's not funny. Despite that, some of the humor in the film, somewhat works. I still laugh at some of the gross toilet humor, this film has to offer. The Pie scene with Jim's Dad, Noel (Eugene Levy), along, makes this film, worth checking out. Still, there were some sequences in the film, I found, to be, too low brow. One of them is the famous 'web-cam' nudity moment. I was never, really into actress, Shannon Elizabeth's work, here as Nadia. I found her foreign exchange student character to be one-dimensional and unrealistic. Not only, does her European accent sounds a bit rubbish, but the whole idea, that she would find Jim, kinda attractive, without his character, speaking once to her is just silly. Her character was pretty much, just written in the film, for fan service. If that, wasn't enough, I really didn't like, how the characters were alright with taping her, while, she's changes her clothes. The voyeurism in this movie is borderline creepy and somewhat disturbing. Anyways, she wasn't the only female character, I didn't like, about this film. Tara Reid as Victoria ""Vicky"" Lathum was very annoying as well. I really wouldn't stand her b*tchy attitude with Kevin in this film. Their scenes, together was such a turn off. The same with the walking-macho-stereotype 'Steve' Stifler (Seann William Scott). Yes, I know, that film help spark Seann William Scott's film career, but gees, his character was really irritating to watch and listen to. Nothing about his character seem real. At least, his character kinda stood out in the film unlike others people's characters. I can hardly remember, the characters, who actress, Natasha Lyonne and actor, John Cho plays as. One character that was very memorable was Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan), despite being introduced late into the first movie and had less than four minutes of screen time. I really hope, for more from her character than the running joke that she was, in this film. After all, Alyson really does make this character, very likable. It's sad, it's that her talent was somewhat wasted here. It is only the second film on, that her character being more than a one-hit wonder, but into a well-developed, prominent character. It's by then, I kinda fell in love, with this character, but for this movie, her performance was fine with me. Another person that really put it, his all was Jason Biggs. I know, a lot of people, crap on him for his mediocre acting, but he really did, make this film, fun to watch with his ability for slapstick. He nearly died from heatstroke and zinc poisoning, during production. So give this man, some props. While, Jason Biggs did fine as the main role in this film. In my opinion, the true-breakout star of this film, has to be, Eugene Levy. He really makes this film, somewhat watchable. Any scenes with him, were funny as hell. I have to give him, mad praise for making this film, work. Overall: While, American Pie upholds the tradition of horny teenage sex comedies made famous by 1980s films like 1981's 'Porky's', 1983's 'Spring Break' and 1985's 'Weird Science', for the late 1990s. It's doesn't hold up, with more of the recent ones, such as 2001's 'Wet Hot American Summer' & 2007's 'Superbad'. It's still, worth watching. Just not, too much, rewatch value."

","I'll be frank, I'm suprised to see all the phrase for the movie.  I (and I am a 14 year old) thought this movie was a long, stupid, immature, unfunny joke that just didn't know when to stop.  The writers thought that each gag would be funnier than the last.  They were wrong.  The movie was nothing but unoriginal, uninspired sight-gags which tried to show a ""human"" side (in a film that exploits your most deeply ""human"" urges) by playing some sappy music and showing some teens have sex (am I the only who, after all the references to condoms, noticed no one seemed to be having protected sex?) could make up for a retarted bore of a movie."

"ExpendableMan","8","2","4","5 November 2006"," Believe it or not, an intelligent look at teenage life
","""Everyone remembers their first piece of pie"" says the tag-line to this movie and bar a few folks who have suffered severe amnesia, or were so drunk the only reason they knew they'd done the deed was through contracting thrush, it's a fair point to make. Everybody does remember losing their virginity and while a movie that focuses on four teenage lads dunder-headed attempts to do just that before graduation rolls around might seem crass, this isn't so much a movie about semen jokes as it is about being a teenager, a sentiment I'm sure we can all relate to in some way.<br/><br/>The storyline is simple, Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) are sick to the back teeth of being sexually frustrated and make a pact to help each other like, make it with a girl dude by the time the end of school arrives - a standard racing the clock scenario that everyone who found themselves four months from University and still a virgin can surely relate to. Along the way they make a number of misguided attempts to achieve this which usually result in the luckless Jim suffering severe humiliation.<br/><br/>Thus far, so very cretinous, but this is no Van Wilder: Party Liason by any stretch of the imagination. These four guys are not cardboard caricatures whose basic purpose is to serve up fodder for a string of smutty jokes, they are genuinely endearing. Jim especially is a lovable, bumbling clown that recalls the nervous, jittery idiot that all of us once were when first confronted by bare female flesh. Oz is a bit of a weak link as his story is somewhat clunky, but the rest of the lads are just as appealing and Kevin's rather sweet relationship with his girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid before she set about destroying her reputation) is handled beautifully.<br/><br/>Backing all this up is an equally strong cast of supporting characters. The girls that form the object of the boys lust are treated with similar dignity, rather than just being another line of bimbos on their way to exposing their breasts in a shower a la Porky's. Alyson Hannigan as the ""not as geeky as she first appears"" Michelle is hilarious, Sean William-Scott is a loud mouthed but ultimately rather charismatic oaf that everyone remembers, but Eugene Levy is the one who shines brightest. As Jim's good natured dad, he shows that parents trying to give their kids a nudge in the right direction can be just as witless as their offspring and he steals every scene he's in and pretty much the whole movie along with them.<br/><br/>Sure, this may make it sound like American Pie is too clever-clever for its own good, but don't worry, there are plenty of bodily fluid jokes to keep the laughs coming, including one brilliant moment where a series of mishaps leads to Jim dancing naked on the Internet that had me clutching my sides in pain from laughing too much. This is still a gross out comedy, but it is a gross out comedy that has genuine humanity behind it and if you're in the right frame of mind, is the sort of film that evokes a real sentimentality for the time when raging hormones and adolescent naivety were an everyday part of life."

","""American Pie"" is a teenage sex comedy that follows the plight of four high school seniors (Jim, Kevin, Finch, and Oz) who make a pact to lose their virginity by the time they graduate from high school and of course, their goal ends up being prom night.<br/><br/>The most unlucky of the four is Jim even though Finch ends up having a pretty embarrassing experience in the girl's bathroom. Jim has a father that won't stop giving him advice regarding sex and shows him pornographic magazines and a mother who freaks out when he is caught watching ""illegal channels"". This character is also caught in several compromising situations from masturbating while watching scrambled porn on TV to being caught by his father having sex with an apple pie. The worst of which is blowing it when he has the chance of having sex with a hot foreign exchange student, which is something that the entire high school sees on the internet. Although Jim ends up losing his virginity on prom night, it ends up being with a band camp geek, who ends up using him. The funny thing is that Jim doesn't seem to mind at all. <br/><br/>Overall, American Pie is a hilarious movie and may very well be the best of all teenage sex comedies. It definitely sets an example for those that precede it."

His straight acting to the comedy around him is legendary, and he shows off his skill in this set of movies.<br/><br/>As noted in my tagline, this movie is funny even if you only saw it and none of the sequels. But where this set of movie excels is in the fact that there are sequels. It shows not only that they can find fresh humor with all of the same characters (a winning point to this set of movies is that it appears that the entire cast returns each time) but that the characters can actually start to slowly show maturity throughout the films up until the American Wedding movie.<br/><br/>See this movie if you want a good laugh, get all of them if you want to have a lot of good laughs and if you want to actually see the characters grow over time."

Unfortunately it is so obvious that Chuck is lying that anyone who was actually surprised by this near the end wasn't paying attention.  Of course, it's hard to pay attention to a movie like this.<br/><br/>The only thing worse than the movie though was the acclaim it got.  A few years after it first came out I heard my friends (I use that term loosely) making the same vow.  Unfortunately, these kids were thirteen.

I first saw this film when I was five years out of high school, and my only disappointment after finishing it was that I never caught it in high school with my buddies. I graduated in 09 so it was a few years past the American Pie craze, but I immediately felt a connection to the East Great Falls class of 99, and would have given anything to have been high school age sitting in a theater that summer.

","Let me make things clear. This movie is not an intelligent, moving piece of art that reflects life in in a beautiful way. But it's not supposed to be. It's intended as light fun. And in that aspect it clearly delivers. The characters are all wonderful. Jim despite being a bit of loser does try to do the right thing and does seem like a nice guy. There's nothing particularly wrong with him, he just wants to know what sex feels like and you do become invested in him as time goes on. Oz is a jock who hangs out with the geeks, not exactly the most original character but a guy with so much charisma you can't help but like him. Finch is an oddball who takes himself a tad too seriously but still means well and Kevin is more mature than his counterparts but still having as much fun as his friends. Each of them are very likable and the way they interact with each other is very funny. When they fall into these ridiculous situations, it's all the more hilarious than it would be to less interesting characters. The two scene stealer's though are supporting characters. Steve Stifler is the obnoxious womanizing asshole who you love to hate. Again kind of generic of a characters but Sean William Scott kills it in the role. He's just so funny and has so much fun on screen. And the other scene stealer is Jim's Dad(Eugene Levvy). This guy is so supportive of his son that it's kind of embarrassing for Jim. I think we can all admit we've had embarrassing conversation with our parents about the birds and the bees but this is just taking it to another level. For the viewer though, it's hilarious. The movie does have some teen drama as well and it does work because you care about the characters so much. Still it still remembers what it is and is an is 80% comedy. I can't say it's as funny as it probably was when it came out but it's still pretty damn funny and if you're still quoting ""Warm Apple Pie"" to this day, you'll know what I'm talking about"
"StevePulaski","8","0","0","21 March 2012"," The structure and plot is the pie, while the characters are the attractive and sweet whipped cream
","American Pie is smarter than many, many other teen films that I've seen over the last few years. Its depiction of the fun, spontaneous antics that exist in high school don't take the nihilistic or dehumanizing route many films of the same genre do. Some have written the film off as ""unoriginal,"" and while it really isn't, it's a comedy for a new generation. The seventies had National Lampoon's Animal House, the eighties had Porky's, and the nineties got a nice helping of pie.<br/><br/>The film follows four naive Michigan high school students, who are close to each other, but not to the people they truly want to be close to; girls. Jim (Biggs) is a pasty, awkward teenager hoping to get lucky with the foreign exchange student Nadia (Elizabeth), Chris ""Oz"" Ostreicher (Klien) is the all-star lacrosse player trying to make things work with the sweet, innocent, and charming choir girl Heather (Suvari), Kevin (Nicholas) is the self-confident and sexually motivated one of the group, hoping to have sex with his girlfriend Vicky (Reid) before they go off to separate Colleges, and Finch (Thomas) is the shy, solemn soul who usually sits idly by while the antics unfold. The four make a pact to lose their virginity by the end of high school, hoping to make it all happen the night of Senior Prom. The gang's motivation comes from their loudmouth buddy Steve Stifler (Scott), who is unapologetically crude, yet irresistibly lovable.<br/><br/>Perhaps the funniest character in the entire film is Jim's dad (Levy), who must be the most conscious and understanding father in the history of film. Many teen films portray parents as out of touch codgers with no knowledge or comprehension of current events. Jim's dad is the total opposite. He is way too understanding, even when his son tries to practice his moves on a baked apple pie.<br/><br/>One character that seems tragically underused is Vicky's friend Jessica (Lyonne). The character is seen at rare points in the film, usually providing her friend with sex insight. She seems like the black sheep of the group, who doesn't fit in anywhere and doesn't really want to. When she does turn up on screen, usually for a slender amount of time, she is witty and fun, much like the rest of the characters.<br/><br/>I was never hugely fond of the eighties' generation-definer Porky's. I found it to be a little weak on the characterization, yet still on par with its projection of high school students. The reason why American Pie soars high on the grading scale is because it manages to provide us with lovable characters that would become familiar to us like those in a sitcom. These characters are sunny and infectious with their one-liners and their wisdom. They aren't indulgent, meaning they are always learning new things and reciting a good moral or two. After not seeing the film in many years, the end scenes were a big surprise to me. It shows the characters are gaining insight and knowledge; I thought that simply couldn't happen in a teen movie. The end also goes in a way one did not expect. I was crossing my fingers that it wouldn't turn into the cartoony clich√© I was thinking, and what do you know, it turned out to be just as sweet as the film itself.<br/><br/>What a joyous and lovable excursion American Pie is. It provides well delivered, intelligent laughs and realizes that it doesn't need to discover a new ""breast per screen"" ratio in order to be funny or memorable. It introduces us to naive, confused teenagers, perhaps somehow reflecting ourselves at the time, and goes from there in what appears to be a totally fresh take on the subject of losing ones virginity. It is simple, efficient, and wholesome even when it shows its darker side.<br/><br/>Starring: Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Chris Klein, Natasha Lyonne, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari, Eugene Levy, and Eddie Kaye Thomas.

","If you hadn't seen this movie yet you should see it right now. Of course im not insisting you guys to watch it if you don't like teen movies but its classic of this kind of comedy.I mean it! This might look little bit stupid because its like a ""stupid comedy"" Thats how i like to call movies like this.Actually they aren't stupid at all it's very hard to create jokes like this and make a movie like this.But I could hardly recommend this movie if you are looking for different kind of comedy something opposite from teens movie like good rated movie with good well known actor and a good storyline or a family comedy because it would be pretty weird watching movies with your children or with your parent (depends who you are).<br/><br/>This movie is way different is about teenagers life, and their jokes. I could say this was one of the best of this kind of comedy i have ever seen! if someone asks for a comedy about teens first movie i say is ""American pie"". This movie would be best if you're looking for something really easy and very hilarious to watch as I said already. Thanks for reading"

It's one of the funniest American teen comedies, and yes.. this movie defined the lives of the teenagers that grew up in the 90s. It's not a deep, heart-breaking story, it is not complicated. It's fun, it makes me laugh every time I see it on TV (which is often) And of course, one of the funniest scenes (and everyone will remember it) is the pie scene, Jason Biggs was the perfect choice for the role, and his father is so hilarious, his bushy eyebrows and his attempts to talk to his son about puberty makes this movie an original one."
"Electrified_Voltage","6","0","0","6 May 2010"," Can't say I never laughed, but this is another overrated immature romantic comedy
","I've been aware of this movie's existence for many years now. Released in 1999, it's a romantic comedy which turned out to be an absolute success and spawned two sequels, ""American Pie 2"" in 2001, and ""American Wedding"" in 2003. I even remember listening to the ""American Wedding"" soundtrack six years ago, but never actually saw any film in the trilogy until this month, when I finally watched the first one. The original ""American Pie"" was released the year after ""There's Something About Mary"", another successful R-rated romantic comedy. I watched that 1998 release earlier this year and really didn't get the hype. I knew this film was a lot like that one, and thought it was slightly better than its predecessor, but still vastly overrated.<br/><br/>Jim Levenstein, Chris ""Oz"" Ostreicher, Kevin Myers, and Paul Finch are four high school friends who are nearing the end of their senior year. One of their fellow students is Steve Stifler, a popular sex-crazed jock who can be very rude and insensitive. After a geeky student named Chuck Sherman claims to have just had sex, and it appears he is telling the truth, the four friends are shocked. Jim, Oz, Kevin, and Finch then all vow to lose their virginity before graduation. Since they are convinced that Chuck has had sex before finishing high school, they figure they obviously can as well. In order to achieve their goal, they will have to get themselves girlfriends before the senior prom, which is coming up in three weeks. They don't have very much time, so each of them soon attempts to find a female peer and win her heart, but as the night of the prom draws nearer, they find that trying to lose their virginity in time isn't so easy.<br/><br/>This R-rated comedy is crude and juvenile from the beginning, showing Jim getting caught watching an explicit channel by his parents, and I have to admit that this made me laugh. Many more crude gags follow, and they often made me laugh at least lightly, including the part with Steve drinking beer which he doesn't realize Kevin has ejaculated into, though I'm not proud of that, and didn't find the scene that soon follows this, with Steve throwing up in the toilet, very funny. There's even a part showing Jim practicing sex on a pie, and this part probably wouldn't have made me laugh had it not been for his father coming in and catching him in the act! The scene with Jim's Dad, played by Eugene Levy, giving his son a bunch of porno magazines, and at least one later scene with this character giving his son sexual advice, also made me laugh. Levy's talent was probably a major reason for this. However, most of the movie isn't THAT funny, and is sometimes pretty lame, even cruel, such as the part where many students get to see the sexual activity in Jim's room on their computers, and Steve giving Finch diarrhea and leading him into the girl's washroom to let it out, even if I didn't keep a completely straight face throughout these segments. Finch even has to face Steve and many other students laughing at him when he comes out of the ladies' room! I also didn't care much for the characters in general, there's nothing too special about them, and very rarely do I see a movie with such a stupid and uninteresting premise!<br/><br/>Some super-raunchy modern comedies are really funny to me, while certain others have failed to make me laugh even one time while I watched them. For me, ""American Pie"" came somewhere in between. I did laugh at times, and I've certainly seen worse excuses for gags than any of the ones I saw here, but the laughs weren't consistent enough, and the movie certainly has some notably lame segments. Since there were parts I found funny, even if that's not necessarily a good thing, I give this juvenile R-rated romantic comedy a 6/10, but thinking about all the lameness I saw in it, I get the feeling even this rating is a little too generous. Unsurprisingly, nothing here made me feel the same way as the zipper accident in ""There's Something About Mary"" (I've said in previous reviews that nothing else in any movie ever has), but like that 1998 comedy, I really don't think this one deserved its massive success."

","American Pie probably needs another review less than almost any movie in the world. Is there anyone left who hasn't already seen the movie, or at least knows what it's about? Regardless, here are my two cents.¬†<br/><br/>American Pie hasn't aged particularly well. It doesn't have the timelessness of some of the other movies in the raunchy teen comedy genre, and it's been greatly surpassed by movies that have come after it. It's still funny in some ways, but a lot of the gross scenes that used to be shocking, are fairly unremarkable by today's standards. The most enjoyment I get from the movie now, is from looking at the substantial cast and seeing how their careers have changed, remained stagnant, or basically ended all-together, since 1999. There aren't many other reasons to go back to American Pie."
"Sandcooler","9","0","0","2 March 2010"," Coming to age
","This movie revived the whole raunchy comedy genre, but really it isn't all about bodily fluids. Its many knock-offs never seemed to get this, but the sex jokes weren't the core of this movie. Sure, it's funny when some dude gets caught getting it on with a pie, but that wasn't really the point. The way I see it, it was really about a bunch of guys trying to cope with growing up. Jason Biggs and Eugene Levy master in awkward situations, but their scenes are also incredibly heart-warming, especially the one with the nudie magazines. My absolute favourite part though (apart from the inevitable Nadia scene) comes near the ending, when Jim finally manages to put everything into perspective and tells everyone of. Such a brilliant scene, or maybe I'm just getting soft. This movie has been called the ""Porky's"" of its generation, and really I couldn't have said it better myself."

","It's gotta be the best movie EVER. Honestly, I think the day I watched the last part of the series was the worst day of my life. It lost all meaning without American Pie. It wasn't easy to continue a normal life after 6 days of American Pie-ing. And then one day, I came to know about American Pie 7. Colors rushed into my life, everything seemed so beautiful.<br/><br/>I might've exaggerated a bit, but yes, that's the sort of effect you can expect the series to have on you. American Pie isn't just a movie, it's a brand, an icon with a huge number of fans worldwide. If there was ever a movie that deserved Oscars and BAFTAs, this is it. It's the most well executed movie/series in this genre (teen sex comedy) ever made. The actors don't seem to be acting, they're rather living their part.<br/><br/>You don't need to think twice before seeing it, run like mad to the nearest parlor, rent it, and wait till folks at home are asleep.

"moviesleuth2","8","0","0","21 October 2009"," An Outrageously Funny Comedy
","Sex by itself is not funny. Nor is anything else, for that matter. The key to comedy is appropriately setting up and executing the jokes. Fortunately, ""American Pie"" has all the requisite elements.<br/><br/>Four best friends, Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) have a problem: They are seniors approaching graduation, and they still haven't gotten laid. Their egos are hurting, but when the biggest geek, Sherman (Chris Owen) gets laid before they do, they decide enough is enough. The four make a pact: each of them will have sex before the Senior Prom.<br/><br/>The key to this kind of comedy is pushing boundaries. ""How did they get away with this?"" will enter anyone's mind at more than a few points in the movie (the prudish MPAA notwithstanding). All the characters are curious about sex, but they don't know how to respond to it without looking like geeks. This kind of awkwardness is good mining territory for comedy, and the creators of ""American Pie"" exploit it for all it's worth. The result is a riotously funny comedy that will have even the most tightly-wound doubled over in laughter for much of the time.<br/><br/>But what really elevates ""American Pie"" from the usual raunchfests (other than its funnier than most of what Hollywood shells out), is that we actually begin to care about the characters in the film. None of them are especially well-developed (this is an ensemble comedy), but they are likable and more importantly, surprisingly real. We recognize Jim's infatuation with the Nadia, the sexpot foreign exchange student. We understand how awkward Oz feels talking to a girl completely different from him for the first time (Mena Suvari). We empathize with both Kevin's fears and uncertainties, and those of his girlfriend, Vicky (Tara Reid). And strange as it may seem, we can see a bit of ourselves in Finch's refined taste.<br/><br/>The acting is actually very good. Jason Biggs has the social awkwardness down pat, and quite frankly, no one shows complete and utter embarrassment like him. Thomas Ian Nicholas is good as Kevin, although he is rather flat in his ""big moment"" speeches. That shouldn't be entirely faulted on him though, the dialogue in these scenes isn't especially well written. Chris Klein is rather flat as Oz, the jock. He's not bad, it's just that Oz could have used a little more energy. Eddie Kaye Thomas is great as the tightly wound Finch.<br/><br/>The girls are great too. Shannon Elizabeth is wonderful as the sexpot, especially because she knows the effect she has on Jim. Tara Reid is good as the girlfriend who wants everything to be perfect when she loses her virginity. Mena Suvari is especially good as the mature good-girl who, despite everything, falls for the jock. And Natasha Lyonne is terrific as Jessica, the sexual know-it-all who is on hand to give advice.<br/><br/>There are three other actors that deserve mention. Eugene Levy is hilarious as Jim's Dad. The teenage years would be smooth sailing if every teenage guy's dad was Mr. Levenstein. When he finds out about his son's interest in sex, he's not horrified, he presents him with porn! Seann William Scott benefited most from his performance as the obnoxious and egotistic Stifler, who's so stupid that he doesn't realize that no one actually likes him. Jennifer Coolidge is hilarious as Stifler's Mom (more than that I will not say).<br/><br/>If you want to really laugh (and laugh hard), ""American Pie"" is a great way to go."

After experiencing some daunting sexual experiences, they decide to create a pact that will increase their chances of scoring before the year ends. The four set a goal to lose their virginity on prom night, for the sake of their own good.<br/><br/>This film has a near-perfect formula ‚Äì a variety of characters that are evident in high schools (making the film easy to relate to), original and funny jokes that run throughout the entire duration, and an interesting conflict (if somewhat farcical). Could have been funnier though. Standout characters in the film are Jason Biggs as the protagonist Jim, Alyson Hannigan as the geeky Michelle (who has a hilarious obsession with telling anecdotes about band camp), Seann William Scott as the high school jock Stifler, and Eugene Levy as Jim's erudite yet slightly dim father.<br/><br/>Although the beginning was great, the end was kind of a disappointment with satisfied. It was very much predictable that they would accomplish their goal yet you were interested in seeing how the story folds.

The two sequels to follow were not as great as this because it is the piece of pie that sliced it open for the others to follow through.

Of course, with the help of the internet, the whole school gets a view of Jim's extremely botched near-sexual encounter with Nadia.

","Besides `South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut' and `Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, `American Pie' has been identified as one of the most highly anticipated films of the post- summer movie-going season.  `American Pie' is a teenage sex comedy, following the sexual misadventures of some well-scrubbed high-schoolers.  This movie focuses on the story of four high school virgins who are more than determined to have sex before graduating from high school.  Jim one of the main characters in the movie is a clumsy guy who seems to be able to mess up every opportunity to hook up with a lady.  Along with this he has been caught by his father in embarrassing situations throughout the film.  His best friends also are trying to score with the ladies but seem to be back at base one as well.  Unlike clam, sweet, teen comedies such as: `She's All That' and `Never Been Kissed,' `American Pie' stays away from the clean cut look right from the opening scene in which Jim gets caught in one of those embarrassing moments by his father.  With a number of gross-out comedic sequences and Jim's father Frank discussing the how's and what's of sex, this film appeals to one of the comedies of last summer, `There's Something About Mary' and over takes it with the `apple pie scene,' the `beer scene,' and the extra activities of a school band geek who gets up close and personal with her flute.

","Crude, rude, crass, sophomoric and predictable at times, American Pie is carefully crafted to appeal to a range of audiences.  But whatever you can say about it, for me the whole thing works!<br/><br/>I do not think you can view this movie as simply the exposition of late 20th century mores viewed through the lens of the average hormonally driven American male.  Rather it is at once and the same time an exposition about expectation.  The expectation of the time after high school, of relationships, of new found physicality, of intimate expression, of going forward into the future.<br/><br/>Herz and Weitz craftily use the testosterone enriched environment of high school as the vehicle on which to carry this theme.  While many characters in literature and cinema have embarked on their own search for truth, American Pie is more about the embarkation upon the journey than the journey itself.<br/><br/>The theme is repeated over and over again, and subtly (as distinct from the crassness of much of the movie) reinforced through out the film.  The journey is presented in the choices of colleges, the coach's speech at the lacrosse game, the `bus' to the prom night party and the duet sung by Heather and Chris.  It is expressed most poignantly by the characters of Vicky and Kevin when they recognize that while they have each consummated there love their futures will lead them to something different than they had envisioned just hours before.<br/><br/>The late teen years are perhaps the only moment in time when the future potential of each of us is present in such abundance and so readily convertible into present achievement.<br/><br/>If you are young (a late teen) and you watch this movie consider how this movie presents a modern parable to you about all the future potential you have before you and how this moment is a but a temporary gift, to be used and enjoyed before it becomes the prevailing present.<br/><br/>If you are older, allow the magic of celluloid and the fine craft of the writer, director and actors to transport you back to a time when the future beckoned and each experience was as new as that spring day on which this movie begins."

While there was a lot of crude humor, high school itself for most people was probably the time in their lives where they were at their crudest levels.  Basically, the message of the film boils down to a teenager's view on sex (especially from the perspectives of 4 male virgins).<br/><br/>The humor of American Pie depends almost solely on the presence of Steve Stifler, who was played brilliantly by Seann William Scott.  He plays the sexually active, egotistical jock that was worshipped by his friends, and while loathed by the band geeks and computer nerds, everybody really wants to be like him.  This character DEFINED Scott's career, and it is a character which he is truly a master of.<br/><br/>Now, about the virgin teenager male's perception of sex.  What's great about this film is the presentation of the humor and seriousness about losing one's virginity.  On one side, we see the semi-nerd Jim have a laughable encounter with the band geek, as well as Finch pulling of a Graduate-esque romp with Stifler's mother.  On the other, more serious side, we see Kevin wind up doing something with his girlfriend which he ultimately winds up regretting in the morning; and Chris, the love-struck jock/choir boy who actually gets this sex thing right.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is a great coming of age film that does a great job showing us that while sex can be fun and really enjoyable, there are serious aspects that need to be addressed as well.  And honestly, who doesn't remember themselves or other people doing the stuff in this film when they were in high school?"

So, what sets this movie apart from all the rest? The characters. Almost every character in the movie is instantly endearing and memorable. Besting them all is Eugene Levy, who shows off the full range of his comedic timing as Jim's good-intentions fueled Dad.<br/><br/>American Pie managed to do two things that very few sex comedies can. Create an interesting and funny premise, and, even more shockingly, deliver a sequel that was even better than the original.

American Pie is groundbreaking in movie history as it explores issues no other film has touched. It's a movie for teens and it is incredibly and amazingly enjoyable. I loved every single second of this movie, the script and directing is well done and all of the main and minor actors play their role well including Shannon Elizabeth, Seann William Scott, and of course Jason Biggs. But the one thing that makes the movie completely enjoyable is the gross out humor and sexual exploitations, all of which are done very well (which is rare).

","Seeing American Pie reminded me of Porky's, which spoke to the group of people who were sex obsessed, desperate to get some, but could never get any.  Much of the movie is getting caught in embarrassing situations in which many of us had experienced but never caught, where those what ifs were always in the back of our minds.

","American Pie--which I had the (mis?)fortune of seeing at a preview screening--does little more than shock its audience into uncomfortable laughter. Although I must confess that I laughed aloud several times, I'm ashamed of it. And while there is definitely an audience for this sort of material, they most certainly should not be partaking of it. Unfortunately, the disturbing emphasis placed on underaged sex and the false message that life as a prep school student consists of little more than trying to shag anything that moves (or doesn't move--a pie, for example) is truly stomach-turning."

"dtaz","Null","0","0","11 July 1999"," Surprising
","Surprised.  That's the most apt statement that I can use to convey how I felt after seeing this movie.  I'd read the press reports and a few reviews. I'd seen the previews.  I expected a cheap, shallow, sex-drenched, teen comedy.  My surprise came at not seeing all those preconceptions fulfilled. Most were, don't get me wrong.  It is all of those things I mentioned above and more, except shallow. I went to see this with my younger (18) brother and we both laughed ourselves silly.  Make no mistake, this is the gross-out, sex comedy of gross-out sex comedies, but if you scratch the surface, you might come away pleasantly surprised.  There is real heart here.  It may be cheap and just a little contrived, but it's there nonetheless.  The premise of 4 bozos making a pact to get laid by prom night belies the underlying story.  What we think of as the end-all-be-all in life----sex, isn't.  The people we dismiss out of hand for one reason or another, might be just what we were looking for, and oftentimes nothing like we had them pigeon-holed.  No, this isn't new ground that's broken here, but it certainly isn't what was to be gleaned from the marketing of this picture. Sex, like anything else in life, is more than what we think it will be be before we get it.  It can lead to love or disappointment; it can make us feel 10 ft. tall or 10 in. high.  Every one of these four guys just want it. They don't look at the who, the how, or the after.  One of the reasons they, and we, cannot is that it's different for everyone.  Like anything else, we take away what we put in (no pun intended).<br/><br/>It is the journey that is taken to get there that make for the laughter here.  It is real.  Moreso than ever portrayed before (mostly).  Fear of parents, fear of classmates, fear of failure, all these are portrayed here with remarkable clarity.  One of the things I liked best about this film was the character of Jim's father, played by Eugene Levy.  Here, for the first time in recent memory, is a parent that is not mean or clueless.  A parent who isn't portrayed as the enemy while remaining a parent.  As uncomfortable as it is for Jim, he finally realizes what a treasure he has there in his father.  In this country, the portrayal of a parent who, while surprised and initially revolted, by his son's behavior, he is willing to concede that he knows what his son is going through because he went through it himself, as did we all.<br/><br/>I would advise, even though it has an R-rating, parents should take their teenagers to see this movie.  If someone is there other than just friends, a young person can see that there is more to this film than masurbation jokes, and parents might get a blunt knock on the head that may jog their memory back to when they were as confused as the people up on the screen.  I'm beginning to think that this country emits some kind of amnesia-inducing ray at all citizens once they start to close in on 30 yrs. old.  It's too bad because, as parents, we are supposed to pass our lessons learned down to the next generation.  It seems to be the norm elsewhere, but here, society teaches us to let each new generation blindly grope about the darkened room of sexual initiation and experimentation.  What is the result:  unwed mothers and fathers, teenage parents, STD's, etc.  These are all things that can be avoided if we are taught by those in the know rather than left to fend for ourselves.  You have to go to class and pass a test to drive a car, but sex, we throw them the keys and say, ""You're on your own.""  The strange thing is, if the wrong decisions are made by the young people, they are vilified.  If you think about it, this is the only situation where these kinds of illogical and arbitrary rules apply.  And that's just sad."

It's a new generation, and, to be quite honest, American Pie was good.  Damn good.  Entertaining and everything.<br/><br/>What distinguishes American Pie from other high school comedies?  There's no unlikeable characters.  It gives you such a great feeling because you've known the characters in the movie when you were in high school.  The characters do what you expect them to do.  When Jason Biggs' character has a naked girl in his room, you yell at the screen for him to go to her, just like his friends persuade him to do.<br/><br/>The dorky guy that you know is lying about having sex, the butthead athlete that you like because he's so funny and stupid, the pretty cool athlete that straddles being king of the school and being himself, the guy who is just obsessed with sex, the dorky guy that hangs out with the semi-popular click, the couple that has been dating forever but aren't having sex, the chick that is so smart about life, the band geek that's got a wild streak. These are all characters we've known, and that's why it's easy to relate to them.<br/><br/>The power of American Pie is that it is not an artistically done movie, and it doesn't try to be.  It knows it's not going to win any awards.  It is a low-budget comedy with Eugene Levy that's main purpose for existence is to entertain.  And really, isn't that what all films should do?"

","American Pie could be simply described as the ""There's Something About Mary"" of 1999. It uses many of the same jokes about certain bodily fluids, flatulation, zit-faced losers and getting it on with an older woman. Needless to say, this film fully deserves its R rating as it goes full out in trying to get laughs and in its high sexual content.<br/><br/>This film is funny, extremely funny at times, regardless of how it is done. By following the adventures of four graduating virgins, all trying to get laid, most films would not have problems getting the laughs. The final scenes of the film wrap it up nicely with some predictable and unpredictable happenings (Let's just say that I didn't expect to hear Mrs. Robinson in this film). Beyond the masturbation, pastry-loving and nude magazine scenes, one almost feels that the filmmakers are trying to end it all up with a Disney ""be good"" message, however, that is all taken away (Thankfully).<br/><br/>The acting in this film is sub-par, but really does nothing to diminish the story. I also didn't care for the Oz - innocent choir girl relationship. How a hardcore, lacrosse playing jock could turn so soft so quickly is something only the movies could do. It also seemed that the gossipy redhead character was totally unnecessary as she added nothing to the film. The script was well written and the director created exactly what goes on for teenage boys at this time in their life. These facts combined with the abundance of comedy help to give this film such a good mark.

","American Pie transports us all back to the much easier time of high school when all we had to worry about was getting a date for the prom, your finals and what to do after high school.  What sets this film apart from the other high school films that came out this year is the amount of time invested in the characters, especially the female characters.  The four male characters seem to think they have it all figured out, much like most of his thought we did in high school.  What we learn, as these guys do, is that life is not that simple.  We watch them make their mistakes and laugh at them because we've all done the same things.  We say the wrong things, make the wrong choices, but it helps us grow.  In the course of this film, the four characters grow as people.  Jim learns of what it feels like to be used, Oz transcends the role of typical jock and becomes something better.  Kevin learns that there is more to a relationship than sex, and Finch, well Finch appreciates the finer things in life.  The only one who really doesn't grow is Stiffler, only because he provides the role of jerk, and he does it well. The female characters are all smart, and they are more than pretty faces. Like their male counterparts, they think they have things figured out, and for the most part, they do.  The one who really stands out is band geek Michelle, played with scene stealing gusto by Alyson Hannigan.  All of her conversations start out with ""At band camp..."" and continue on from there. But, she's a lot smarter than she lets on and in a great scene we see just how clever this girl really is.

Rest assured this movie won't go to far into changing your view on the world, but its what modern comedy is all about, good old raunchy American humor. It mocks a stage in each person's life that is naturally awkward, the ""first time"", with such frankness and a handful of ridiculous comic anecdotes that you can't help but scream along with the other howling patrons in theater.

I really liked the mini lesson on how you can never really prepare - it should just happen.  The montage at the end was beautifully crafted.  This is a funny date-movie.  There are some pretty gross sections in the movies - but you'll see them coming, it's just waiting for them to happen is what it is all about.  Eugene Levy was excellent in this as the Dad who wants to tell his son and seem cool at the same time.

What starts out as a group of guys trying every trick in the book to bed a girl turns out to be a self discovering journey that is riddled with humor that keeps you laughing right up to the closing credits. While there are those out there that may criticize this movie on its content, keep in mind that it is rated R and makes no attempt to hide that fact. Parents may be offended but the reality is that this movie does depict what many teenagers go through during the final year of high school.<br/><br/>All the actors portrayed their roles admirably and a large part can be attributed to good writing. This movie will attract a lot of the teenage crowd (at least those that can get in) but I'm sure that adult audiences will find it just as entertaining. This movie will definitely be compared to ""Something About Mary"" and the simple truth is that AP is much funnier and well worth the full admission."

While there's nothing blindingly original about the story, it DOES have its share of raunchy laughs and gross-out gags.  And yes, it DOES have an unexpected sweetness and innocence laced throughout it similar to ""Mary,"" but without that film's mean-spiritedness.<br/><br/>The young cast is very good, especially Jason Biggs as the innocent and confused leader of the gang who all pledge to lose their virginity on prom night...he seems to be the one caught in a majority of the most embarrassing situations, but admirably seems to escape with his dignity intact.  Eugene Levy is extremely amusing as Biggs' father, trying to impart wisdom to his son  but at the most inopportune times.<br/><br/>A cut or two above most teen comedies and not as irresponsible as you might gather by the previews.

I thought the acting was great--I've seen a few people's comments on here ripping on the acting.  All I can say is that these kids acted like real kids. I totally believed that they were people I could have gone to school with.  As for some people's comments that Natasha Lyonne was the best thing in this movie, all I want to ask is why is it that so-called ""film buffs"" always denounce the acting of every teenager in a film like this, except the eccentric, anti-social one?  Honestly.  I understand that Lyonne really stood out in this movie, and she was good, but she was hardly the best thing in it.  I hate to make personal comments about people on here, but I think that if you're too old to appreciate the accuracy and humor (yes, slightly overblown and disgusting humor, but high school humor) of this movie, you really shouldn't be commenting.<br/><br/>Great job on this movie.

In a time when lame films like She's All That and Varsity Blues portray teens in an unrealistic and insulting fashion, American Pie gives an honest look at teenagers and their thoughts about sex.  However, not only are the characters actually believable as typical teenagers, but the movie presents itself an a hilarious fashion.  This movie contains some of the crudest jokes I've seen, but they all work, and it's actually plausible that teenagers might do these things.  The acting and dialogue are questionable at times, but one thing is for sure--this movie is filled with non-stop laughter.  For once a (teen) movie that is 1) realistic 2) filled with jokes that actually make you laugh out loud and 3) enjoyable for both teens and adults...just don't watch this with your parents.

While I realize that most of these situations are to the extreme, the fact remains that all teenagers have gone through embarrassing moments similar to the ones shown in American Pie, and to not be able to laugh about it means you might be taking yourself, or perhaps the intent of the movie, far too seriously.<br/><br/>
  Beyond the obvious comedic value of the film (and the scenes are too numerous to mention), there really is a message here. It appears at first glance that there's nothing going on except crude humor, etc, but in reality, by the end of the film, the entire cast has learned something about themselves, sex, and the relative importance of sex in their every day life. I think Oz is the best example of a lesson learned in this film. In the end, after all his posturing and grandstanding, he tells his friends that nothing happened on prom night, when something obviously did. Each character learned a little something about themselves and how they fit in to society.

He freaks out and she then says ""Don't you think I know how to turn myself off. Now I'm getting antsy. Want to screw?"" And a joke about semen in a beer and someone else drinking it.

","In writing this bawdy comedy about four friends who will do anything to lose their virginity before going to college, screenwriter Adam Herz set out to overturn the conventions concerning films about adolescents. This is why the script he submitted to the film production studios in 1998 was entitled ""A sex comedy for teenagers which could be made for less than 10 million dollars, which most readers are no doubt going to hate but which you will adore"". After many rejections, the script won some admirers at Universal Studios. There, it was firmly believed in, but no one was going to take the gamble of casting star names. The actors would be unknown, the director likewise. Chris Weitz, one of the producers, convinced his brother Paul to make his debut as a film director with this film, renamed ""American Pie"". Paul and Chris co-authored the script de ""Antz"". Having a controversial sense of humour, they knew that the film they were going to make would create a few sparks. And that is what happened. First with the censor, who banned the film for under non-accompanied 17 year olds, and then with the public, who raced to the cinema, howled with laughter and made this small summer film into one of the blockbusters of the year."

The entire cast of young actors were basically unknowns, but gained popularity since the film went on to be a sleeper hit. Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, and Eddie Kaye Thomas play the four buddies who make that pact; Shannon Elizabeth, Alyson Hannigan, Natasha Lyonne, Tara Reid, and Mena Suvari play the girls in their lives; and Seann William Scott steals the show as Stifler, the one who knows everything about sex. But all the actors are good here. Plus, there are some big laughs throughout. The part of ""American Pie"" that I liked best was the generally sweet relationship between Chris Klein and Mena Suvari.

It requires no thinking skills, or even any apprehending skills. Perfect in-flight movie, considering the other junk they showed (like oh, ""Sweet November""), and perfect cure for boredom. The funniest scene is the Jim (Jason Biggs' character, I'm not sure of his name) and the Pie scene; absolutely had me in fits. And Jim's dad is hilarious as well. Alyson Hanningan is SO irritating.

","""American Pie"" is a film that has been taken at face value by most of its target audience.  To many, it is simply a film about four friends trying to get laid before they graduate high school and go on to bigger and better things (well, maybe, let's see the sequel).  But I believe that the writers and the concievers had something else in mind.  If they wanted to do another sex comedy, they could have done a remake of ""Losin' It"" or ""Porky's"" or something else from the '80s.  Instead, they found a way to incorporate those entertaining tactics into a film with a finely developed coming-of-age message.  The sex part is really just to keep the viewer watching. <br/><br/>
I'm pretty sure that I'm right because 90% of the people I have talked to that are part of a face-value generation have said that ""there's something there"" and that it ""has a message"".  <br/><br/>""American Pie"" could be called an organized sex comedy.

","Well, I too saw the sneak preview of this delightful movie positioned around the quest of four high school seniors to get laid before graduation.  If you think the premise is vulgar, then you may not want to read on, b/c this movie is not for you.  Not only does it put There's Something About Mary to shame with it's liberal use of bodily fluids, but it surpasses it through its hilarious performances and unforgettable scenes.  To put this movie in a nutshell would be to label it a documentary about teenage sexual angst. Needless to say, there are many things in this movie that resemble soft porn, minus the cheesy music and bad acting.  The movie does do a very good job of displaying the different attitudes towards sex and quite possibly (this may be a long shot) love through its use of great characterization. Chris Klein, last seen in Election, brings another genuine performance to the screen, along with Jason Biggs, who's new to me but obviously a pro already, and Thomas Ian Nicholas, a wide-eyed poster boy for Clearasil. But the standout performance, although small, has got to be Alyson Hannigan as a naughty nerd who provides the movie with its most memorable shock...believe me, you'll know once you see it.  Yes, the toilet humor is abundant, but the script is equipped with nonstop laughs and clever interludes.  If you enjoy comedies and aren't embarrassed by the sight of naked women and masturbation, then you have got to see this movie."

","On a scale of 0 to 100; I gave American Pie a score of 77.<br/><br/>Before watching American Pie you must be warned: your sides will hurt from laughing too much, and this laughter will come from mostly crude and rude jokes that come with endlessly imaginative actions and fantastic one-liners. And after watching it you also must be warned: you will never, ever, ever under any circumstances eat apple pie again, so make sure you have a slice before you watch this laugh-a-minute teen comedy.<br/><br/>At a high-school party, four friends Jim (Jason Biggs), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas), and Oz (Chris Klein) find that losing their collective virginity isn't as easy as they had thought. But they still believe that they need to do so before college. To motivate themselves, they enter a pact to try to be the first to ""score."" And of course, the senior prom is their last best chance. As the fateful date draws near, the boys wonder who among them will get lucky. More importantly, do they really want to do it at all?<br/><br/>To get the flaws over and done with; Natasha Lyonne is underused, and it is a shame because she is by far the most interesting character in the movie, she has some great quotable parts in the script (`It's not space shuttle launch, it's sex'; `I like to keep my options open') and hopefully, in the up-coming sequel, she'll get more time on-screen. There is also a largely unfunny toilet ¬ëgag' with the character of Finch, the scene totally steals from Dumb & Dumber, and crapping scenes have been done much funnier and much better. Okay, back to the good stuff, the cast is fantastic, Biggs is a great find (unfortunately he kind of ruined his career with some dumb comedies after he invested the part of Jim), Klein is sensitive and believably hip, while the chick-a-dee's like Mena Suvari, Tara Reid and ultimately Buffy's Alyson Hannigan, who manages to steal the entire film with only one line. This is one blast of a fun movie, I can guarantee you'll be chuckling and smiling a long time after watching it.<br/><br/>If not perfect, American Pie is easily the best teen sex comedy of 1999. Highly recommended any time, any day."

","American Pie, which is trying to capitalize on the success of the Farrelly Bros.'s There's Something About Mary, does an excellent job of living up to its predecessor.  American Pie tells a somewhat realistic, though very exaggerated, story of four high school seniors who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night.  The appeal of this movie, much like with 'Mary,' is not the story, but the gross-out comedy.  And there is much of that in this film.  Still, the story is not lacking, and this film does present a sweet tale of friendship and the troubles of adolescence.  But the main reason to see this is for the great laughs and shock value, as it has plenty of both."

","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>This is a cute, even sweet, coming of ager with an attractive cast. But be warned, if sex offends you, you will be offended. It is also more than a little on the juvenile side, especially the first half or so. I can't even discuss the subject matter on Amazon.com, which is just as well. And you DON'T EVEN want to know why it is called ""American Pie."" Suffice it to say that if you're past your early twenties much of this will seem lame and adolescent. If you're younger, you may just crack up over all the crude, but sometimes sharply observed humor.<br/><br/>Thus the question: why did I watch it? Easy: Mena Suvari. The beauty of American Beauty is here a drama dweeb--or is that a drama geek? Actually she sings in a jazz class, which I suppose is close to the same thing. At any rate, she is not a cheer leader nor the queen of the hop, just a pretty girl with values. She is excellent. Also good in a supporting role is Alyson Hannigan (from TV's Buffy) as a nerd girl who surprises with what she learned at band camp. Eddie Kaye Thomas as the boy (Paul Finch) who learns that women only get better with age is just perfect. However, I think Jason Biggs was a little lamer than was absolutely necessary. Sean William Scott was true to his part as your classic neanderthal jock.<br/><br/>Funniest line, from Biggs, after finding Michelle gone in the morning: ""I was used--Cool!""<br/><br/>Another reason for watching this film is that one does get some, no doubt twisted, idea of what passes for adolescent sexual preoccupation these days and can compare such notions to an earlier era. Call it suburban anthropology.<br/><br/>As I was watching Mena Suvari I got to thinking about the appeal of her very captivating face. Like fashion models and other stars with child-like faces, we adore her. Why? Call it neoteny. This led to a further thought. In the future, as we continue to look more and more like our children, some day we and our children will look the same. (Perhaps this could be a good idea for a science fiction story.) Some say the appeal of imagined aliens is that they have child-like features (think of the big round heads and the big eyes). But really they are unconscious caricatures of ourselves and the values that we most esteem, brains and photogenic eyes.<br/><br/>Anyway, American Pie is kind of sweet if you are not offended by vivid depictions of adolescent sexuality or crude bathroom humor. And there is more sophistication to the relationships than might be supposed at first blush. It ends at the prom, as all good American coming of age flicks should. The boys grow up and begin to learn the difference between love and sex, and the girls find they no longer have to teach the boys how to kiss. This is an American Graffiti for the new millennium."

The big dance AND graduation are coming up and we still HAVE TO get laid."" Jim (Jason Biggs) is a bright but socially inept guy whose despair at being a virgin only increases his foolishness. He gets little help from his dad (Eugene Levy); his ideas of sex lectures are to thumb through a copy of Hustler magazine with his son. When Jim's using his webcam, the movies reaches its climax. He's playing professionally like a real virgin. The part he's trying to make his hair the way girls like is realistic. However, along the way, a few lessons are learned, and at least a few of the boys' questions are answered, balancing most of the film's vulgarity. The best characters used in real romantic scenes, were Mena Suvari and Chris Klein. Their appearance was one of my personal favorites which was played professionally in this movie.

Why, why, why?<br/><br/>Many comparisons have been made to ""Animal House"", some favorable, most UNfavorable.  In my humble, rank amateur's opinion, this picture is superior.  There is no food fight, nor is there anyone who remotely approaches Belushi in terms of comic talent.  But the story is not as preposterous in ""American Pie.""  It stays real to the characters without having to resort to something that distracts from the main goal of the picture.  People in ""Pie"" do wacky things, but you believe them.  People in ""Animal House"" do wacky things, but there is no clear motivation.  Okay, these movies are not necessarily concerned with such mundane tasks as finding motivations for every action, but there was more of it in ""Pie"" than there was in ""Animal House.""  Since it was more believable, it seemed more natural, and thus it was funnier because the characters were just being themselves without TRYING to be funny.

At least this film eschews the cliche' of the High School Jock Bully and his Sadistic Henchmen [tm] and puts the guys pretty much on par with each other, socially and sexually.<br/><br/>Sad as it is to say, I found the most entertaining scene in this entire film a ""forced him to drink laxative.. egads!

","Well eh¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö yes. This is a film that depicts the way teenagers behave in a great way. The stuff they talk about the way they treat each other and so on. The only thing that just might not be entirely true here is that kids of my age (17 ¬ñ 19) don't actually need to get laid before going to college yet or maybe that's just because I live in a little hellhole. Here in our town it is more about kissing (french kissing most of the time). There are actually people who do that 3 or 4 times a night (both males and females). Of course coming to the conversational part of the movie, I can't speak for the girls, but the guys, well they sure like to observe pretty girls, they sure like to talk dirty and stupid and they sure as hell make some dumb bet's or pacts. Some may even do pretty dumb stuff, like Jim, but I haven't witnessed that, I only know the stories (maybe I'm lucky not to have seen some things). If you don't want to hear this or read this, you should stop and start reading the next bit after the blank line. This filthy story is actually from a German film (but I've heard a story about a few drunk guys a friend of mine knows who did the exact same thing). In the film (and in reality, according to my friend) a couple of guys lay a piece of bread on the ground and form a circle around it. Then they started masturbating and the one that came missed had to eat the slice of bread. Well that is quite nasty I must say and I feel far worse than what was depicted in American Pie, for it was intentional.<br/><br/>
On to the film I must say I was not so disgusted as many of you Americans might have been. Most of the stuff there seemed pretty natural to me (with a few exotic outbursts, but hey it is a comedy). But what I really think is strange about this is that never have I read a review or comment about this film (or heard from one of my friends) is that there is actually a bit of romance between all that talk about sex and the gross ¬ñ out comedy. That I found particularly good, for it brought some real refreshment tot the film. Due to the romance it was not the way that there needed to be one crude joke or action after another, you know. That is something that often happens in spoofs like The Naked gun. In those films they become so determined to make you laugh, rather that they totally cross the line and become ridiculous instead of being funny. They should be looking for something refreshing, like the romance here in American Pie (which is a film that can hardly be compared to the naked gun for it is not nonsense). Back to American Pie though. It was not only the story and the jokes that made this a good and fun film, the good performance of the young actors and actresses helped a lot too. They were all good, though there is one actor I must mention separately and that is Jason Biggs. He was really great. He was the best of the bunch, for he was the one featured in the funniest parts of the film, plus he came over like a real funny guy, who was kind of new to everything and who behaved most like I would have behaved I guess (I think he reminded me of myself and that's why I liked him so much).<br/><br/>
This really is a film I can recommend to everyone, for I don't see how you could be  offended by the jokes and the situations. The only thing there may be for me to say that this is a film suited for no one under the age of 16 or so (because of the content, although I can imagine I might have liked it then only because of the dirty jokes and not because I had the feeling that the way me and my friends behave is in some form the way teenagers around the world are behaving, maybe even RIGHT NOW). I sure as hell want to see a sequel and I sure as hell know I'm not going to need force someone to make American Pie 2.<br/><br/>

","*SPOILERS , kinda. but its obvious how its gonna end. in a typical hollywoodian fashion.*<br/><br/>The movie deserved a 9. Its a funny comedy about senior high schoolers trying to get laid before the year ends, and I liked it. But I only voted a 6. Here's why: I could relate to Jim and the others throughout the whole movie, except at the end. Jim says ""I'm tired of everyone hyping sex, I dont wanna do it anymore. To hell with it all"" (close enough). Ok, if the movie had ended with at least ONE of the ""good guys, normal guys"" not getting laid, the message or moral would've been ""ok, some guys make it, some dont"". good. but it didnt. they had to have all the ""normal"" kids have sex, and the viewer,<br/><br/>if a male teenager, will leave the theater thinking ""ok...so if i dont have sex while in high school, im a loser like Sherman"" (that's what many thought, and that's what the previous reviewer Longtrip thought) . How screwed up is that? I mean, only a select 30% (im only guessing) of guys got laid at my high school, does that make the 70% remaining losers? No, but that's the message you got from American Pie. That you're like Sherman. (for the record, I didnt get laid in high school). I really wish at least Jim would've stayed a virgin, at least until the next year. Also...whats up with using 24/25 year-old girls to play the role of 18yo's? huh? Shannon Elizabeth is a PLAYMATE, yet they pass her as a regular 18yo student. The average teenage girl watching the movie will obviously notice the difference in looks between her and the sexy cast of American Pie, who's supposedly ""normal average 18yo's"". No way that'll help her self-esteem, in this f***ed up world where girls think that if they dont look like the girl on the cover of Seventeen, they'll scare guys away . So, both male and female teenagers that are like me (that are part of the aforementionned 70%), when leaving the theater, will walk out with a bad taste in their mouth.<br/><br/>I liked American Pie. Half-way through the movie, I was thinking that I'll be giving it a 9 here. but with the moral/message it has, I cant allow myself to give it more than a 6, sorry. Have a nice day, people. (oh, and sorry if I dont express myself as eloquently as some other reviewers)"

","I am a recent college grad and got to see this movie with a friend I hadn't seen since we graduated high school together.  This movie really hit the spot and gave us an opportunity to talk about our glory days in high school. Many seem to complain that sex is too often the topic, but unless you don't remeber because your too old or are ashamed, sex is a major issue to most at that age.  The only way I can see people not liking this movie is because you did not share these experiences back in your day.  Finding your first love, losing your virginity, and being in the tightest group of friends you ever had and ever will have because you grew up with them for so long.  And that ""next step"".... it can prove to be the last time you have the opportunity to have as much fun like the characters in this movie seemed to have.  I can only imagine those who hate this movie being one of the band dorks or the likes of the ""Shermanator"" and I feel sorry you missed out on the experience and wild ride high school could have been."

"djskillz","10","0","0","7 July 1999"," Nothing bad to say
","Sitting here and trying to write a review for this movie is hard to do.<br/><br/>I'm sure there are bad things to say about this movie. You could say it's vile, disgusting, and offensive. I can't say that, though, because I didn't find it any of those things.  Actually, I'm having trouble defining it period, as I am still a little overwhelmed by it. At the moment, I can say it is by far the funniest movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The comparisons to 'There's Something about Mary' are relevant only because it brings you a new style of filmmaking, bringing you humorous after humorous moment. There are several kinds of brilliant films; ones that make you cry, ones that make you yelp and scream; ones that leave you feeling like you just had sex and the ones that make you laugh uncontrollably.<br/><br/>'Pie' fits into the last two categories, no pun intended for the sex feeling. Maybe it's me, but when I left the theatre, I ran home. It was playing with Notting Hill, which I discarded for the opportunity to play preacher and call on everyone I knew, telling them to go to 'Pie'. The movie made has put a feeling of light-chested-ness in my body that hasn't gone away. The movie is just that good.<br/><br/>The movie is this good because of the script. Like every single movie, a script is the end all of the sucsess of it. The 'Pie' script is like nothing you could expect, there has been nothing like it before. There have been comparisons to the John Hughes' and Porkey's films, but beyond the intial premise it is inaccurate. Because of the flexibility of the censors, and how much society is now accustom to, 'Pie' sets new standards and again stretches the lines of censorship. ""Porkey's' and Hughes' films were made to be somewhat innocent. It apologizes for being racey. 'Pie' makes doesn't offer you one, and instead asks for one because you doubted it before you got in there.<br/><br/>The next most important element of a good film is the actors. In all of the great films, we rememeber the actors just as much as the plot and the setting. Jason Biggs, the lead character, and our protagonist because he's always a loser, is dead-on. He plays Jake to the last detail; the shy guy in everybody's class. Chris Klien, who shone in Election, again shines here as a wanna-be sensitive jock.  He commands such an aura, and easily gains sympathy and respect from viewers. The female actors are lead by a band geek Alyson Hannigan and Sex Therapist Natasha Lyonne. A somewhat rookie actress, Mena Suvari, plays a jazz ensemble goodie-two-shoes and interest of Klien.  She is absolutely intoxicating, and her looks, even though she is not as attractive as Tara Reid or Shannon Elizabeth(both in the film, as Vicky and Nadia respectfully), draws people, at least me, to develop a crush on here. Lastly, Eugene Levy, the SCTV vetreran, brings a character to life that we can all say 'Hey, that's my dad!', in one scene or another.<br/><br/>You could talk about the style of shooting, and other production notes, but unlike 'Saving Private Ryan', it is not important. The movie is meant to make you laugh. You are supposed to be impressed because it is so funny, not  because you have learned something. The movie accomplishes this like Michael Jordan wins. It deserves kudos until there is no more kudos.<br/><br/>Like Phantom Menace, go in with an open mind. Adam Herz, Paul and Chris Weitz, Jason Biggs, Chris Klien and Mena Suvari. Remember those names, as you will try so hard to forget this movie, but fail, because it so good.<br/><br/>I guess I found something after all to say. I'll rephrase: Sitting here and trying to write a bad review for this movie is hard to do."

","""American Pie"" is one of those movies that looks really crude and stupid in the previews, but turns out to be sweet and actually good in reality.  There is nudity and a lot of things that moral people would consider ""questionable material"", but that is also funny.  Despite a few ridiculous situations, the movie is actually surprisingly in tune with high school kids and realistic. The plot is basically this, four high school senior boys make a pact together to lose their virginity by Prom Night.  A lot of mix-ups happen, as well as humiliations and popularity shifts among the other seniors.  One thing that I don't really think is realistic, though, is the fact that the students all remain more-or-less friendly and don't really go for each other's throats all of the time, despite the fact that they have all been terribly humiliated and embarrassed.  This leaves the film a little more innocent, though, and doesn't really hurt it much.  So, in conclusion, this movie was funny and pretty much realistic, with a few sip-ups."

For example, all four friends succeded at their goal of losing their virginity by/on prom night, two of which with someone they truly loved. Nobody got their girlfriends pregnant, accused them of being whores, or took them to the abortion mills. The 1950's neo-greaser attitudes towards sex is missing here, and that suits me just fine. Alyson Hanigan is not as annoying as some might believe, playing the role of Michelle(..named after ""Meyrink,"" perhaps?), the nerdy-flutist, who's only life outside of school is at band camp. What a pity, until you find out what else she does with her flute in her spare time. I was as 'antsy' as she was, after hearing that line, even though I should've seen it coming. <br/><br/>

","Over here in the UK, we seems to have been bombarded by American teen comedies, either on TV or in Film. We wouldn't mind, but none of them seem to be that good. Of course we haven't actually made any ourselves, so we're hardly in a position to criticise, but the really sad thing is that the teen-com concept is full of potential. Finally, someone was daring enough to explore the outrageousness of lusty adolescence. American Pie was born!<br/><br/>Make no mistake; the main strength of this film is it's sheer vulgarity. The usual patronising moral preaching that accompanies, and spoils, so many films of this type is absent. Replacing it is a no holds barred look at teenage angst, sexual curiosity, and the art of bodily function jokes. In addition, the subject of masturbation has never been approached with such an unflinching eye!!<br/><br/>The young cast, all relatively unknown, offer some impressive performances. The individual honours belong to Sean W Scott, who is repulsively likeable as Stifler, even if it is nothing more than a role as the typically moronic American Jock. However, the most skillful moments of the film are provided by Jason Biggs and Eugene Levy, who offer an excellent double act as the son with strange methods of experimentation and the father, whose methods of sex education are at times equally bizarre. The sense of awkwardness as they endure their 'man to man' talks is remarkably convincing.<br/><br/>The film isn't consistently funny, but the half dozen side splitting moments are more than enough to keep you amused, even if you have been told of them in vivid detail prior to watching. (Like I was)<br/><br/>At times though, American Pie can certainly be accused of feeling a bit familiar. After all, the guys trying to get laid routine has been done a thousand times before, and some of the jokes (such as the old classic of post laxative attack panic) are hardly original, but the film does include some touches that save it from being totally predictable. For example there is the character of Finch, the mysterious member of the sex-obsessed quartet with sophisticated mannerisms, and the way the Jock element is played through Lacrosse, rather than a more obvious or traditional American sport.<br/><br/>The purists will no doubt, make criticisms about it's over explicitness, and other such garbage about the corruption of the young, but as usual they are looking deeper than is necessary. While you could argue that American Pie brings attention to the awkwardness, anxiousness and confusion of adolescent sexuality, it is really just an entertaining comedy, with grossness that lifts it head and shoulders above the rest."

","This is the funniest movie I've seen in quite some time.  A few people compared it to Porky's, but I think it was better.  I was a teenager when Porky's was out.  Whereas Porky's had a number of funny scenes, American Pie was 90% funny.  Also, some of Porky's jokes were mean spirited.  It was refreshing to see a funny film that thrived on the funny side of the human experience instead of making jokes at someone's expense. I saw the uncut version on pay per view so I can't diss movie go-ers for their reviews.  But if you get a chance to see the uncut version, do it!

","Yet another teenage rite of passage flick churned out by the Hollywood sausage factory. However this one is low fat, not particularly salty and has quality ingredients. Four senior high school buddies vow to lose their virginity by the end of the high school year and before they go to college. (Naturally, everybody's going to college even if it's on a Lacrosse scholarship). You'd think that wouldn't be hard. Well of course it's not, but the trick here is to keep the audience guessing as to how. The girls (no gays please, this is Middle America) are eager but inexperienced (with the exception of a ridiculously tanned and beautiful exchange student from evil old Eastern Europe who seems to have been at it for years). So are the boys. There's too much talk and not enough action, lots of false starts and misunderstandings.<br/><br/>Naturally, in an update of this hoary old storyline, the Internet get used to broadcast round the campus the hero's fumblings with Ms Czech Republic (shades of Hot Lips Hoolahan and the company dentist in ""Mash""). Naturally, the climax (and I use that word advisedly) comes at the after-prom party, and it is a multiple one. Naturally, the parents scarcely seem to be aware of what's happening (except for one who becomes part of the action - ""Mrs Robinson"" is a potent American myth). Naturally, the guys are types, your ordinary average sex maniac who'll try it with a warm apple pie, the gentle jock, the pimply guy with sophisticated tastes, the other ordinary average sex maniac who actually has a girlfriend but isn't getting very far.<br/><br/>OASM no.1 (he with the apple pie and awful parent) is nicely played with eager desperation by Jason Biggs, who looks a lot like Adam Sandler but is a lot less irritating. Chris Klein as the jock puts in a sensitive performance, as does Mena Suvari (a stand-out in American Beauty as the beauty) as his Kylie Minogue-like girlfriend. The rest of the cast are all pretty ordinary, but it's a nice looking production appropriately filmed in the springtime.<br/><br/>The US education system succeeds brilliantly at one thing, prolonging the dependency and emotional immaturity of adolescence of kids who go to college. They won't have jobs and be free of parents and school, not to say school friends until they are at least 25, probably 30. It is of course all a conspiracy so Hollywood can sell movies like this. That half of the population who don't go to college and instead wind up in McJobs at $5 an hour (if they are lucky) will of course hit reality much earlier. I'm not sure they will find much to relate to here, or all that much to envy, at least on the emotional front. <br/><br/>If you can't be bothered watching this movie just view the trailer - it has most of the funniest bits in it."

","A hilarious caper from beginning to end! It echoes of past greats such as Porky's but with far more sensitivity and youthfulness, more likened to the John Hughes classics of the last decade. Even at the senior prom, the band are playing a cover of Simple Minds' Don't You Forget About Me, perhaps paying homage to The Breakfast Club. Although these eighties trends are relived, the film keeps up to date fairly well and to emphasise this, one of the gags involves the Internet!<br/><br/>The plot is simple: four high school senior lads make a pact to lose their virginity before they go off to college. They have, basically, until Prom Night left, and they don't even have a date. Although the plot centres around sex, it is more to do with dealing with adolescence than the typical over-confident characters in a lot of American teen-flicks which centre on the college student. The film deals with sex as an issue of uncertainty to both genders; a refreshing change for this new age of brat-pack movie.<br/><br/>With certain exceptions, the characters in American Pie are easy to identify with. They are almost likeable in their geeky ways, and their parents almost tolerable! The only thing that misses for me is that perhaps I am too old to fully appreciate it. I have a feeling that it was designed for people of similar age to the characters within the movie for full impact. Being the case, then, I would imagine many who see it are below the certificate minimum.<br/><br/>However it is a film for all to enjoy, although if you have a dislike for toilet humour then avoid it. It relies on this as its backbone and the theme of masturbation is rife, albeit hilarious! Watch out for familiar faces from Buffy, most notably Alyson Hannigan. Perhaps not one to see with your better half, but your younger brother will adore it!"

For crying out loud, tell them to that people do have sex and they do masturbate. So why not put it on the big screen? Tell them that no matter how hard they will try to make sex and masturbation go away they will never succeed because they both are a natural part of a human life cycle. Sex, nudity and jokes sell - that's what American Pie counts on and it is right.<br/><br/>The cast of virtually unknown actors gives a great performance and for those who only go to see a movie for ""positive messages conveyed to the world"" the film does even have one - at the end the characters realize that life is not just about sex. Some of them even fall in love with their movie partners (only to be separated later when they go to college, but that's a different story). So, please all you people who have no clue why you go see a comedy, get one or don't go. You have your right to have an opinion, but you're not necessarily right (at least in this instance). American Pie (and most other movies) is not meant to convey positive messages to the youth, scold people for having sex, nor encourage them to have sex. Am. Pie doesn't glorify sex, nudity, or alcohol, it simply points out the obvious - they are all there, right here, in our very lives. It's a comedy that is close not just to teenagers but to adults as well, because so many of both groups can relate... All the ""message seekers"" should try to see this movie with open eyes and stop being so ""goody-too-shoes"".

It looked to me like a pretty accurate depiction of adolescent sexuality--its not all G rated, but then adolescence wasn't either.  <br/><br/>Mr. Biggs is certainly not afraid to do wild things and perhaps his scenes are the most memorable in this movie--I chuckle just thinking about the ""illegal channels"" scene, for who in their adolescence hasn't explored auto-eroticism in fear of being discovered by his family?  His dancing scene in front of the computer camera perhaps will go down in the annals of comedy--at last something Lucy never did before!

","Considering the immense publicity given to the film and it's more 'noticeable' bits I was somewhat surprised to find myself not the least bit shocked by the whole thing. Sure it was funny but not laugh out loud funny, not the burst my sides laughing funny that I had expected. I actually found it to be a good film on it's own, more of a nineties spin on the old John Hughes tales of growing up and wondering exactly who you are and what you want. The fact that the main focus of the film was sex changed nothing as it more than emphasised the fact that sex is only truly great when you are with someone you love. It also placed safe sex prominently, yet subtlely, in the window. It also marked something of a radical shift in teen films by not strictly placing every one in a distinct social group (The band nerds aside). The fact that the four main characters hung around with each other despite their apparent differences made the film more realistic in my opinion than the clearly divided 'The Breakfast Club' fivesome. It was more 'Ferris Bueller's' and was all the better for it. Stifler was a truly brilliant character and I hope teen film writers take a leaf from this movie in how to deal with the 'cool, rich' male leads. To label this film a 'gross out movie' is to completely misunderstand it. I found myself agreeing for the first time ever with Leonard Maltin that it's a good film with it's heart in the right place. Not overly moralistic or totally without decency it takes a good stab at what it's really like to be an 18 year old on the brink of entering a world unlike anything they've seen before. I liked it, but not because it's got masturbatory gags or endless sex remarks, but because it dealt with issues and a context never before seen in teen movies.

","With the great genre of 'Teen Comedy' looking decidedly tired at the moment it is refreshing to see this well directed, scripted and acted offering reminiscent of John Hughes's great teen comedies of the 80's such as 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' and 'The Breakfast Club'. The young previously unknown actors worked perfectly together with Jason Biggs doing a wonderfully confused 'Jim', Eddie Kaye Thomas a suave 'Finch' and Natasha Lyonne shines a streetwise cool as the dry witted 'Jessica'. Adam Herz's script is pacy and never fails to keep the viewer enthralled. Perhaps however it's greatest feature is the fact that it doesn't treat a presumably younger audience as though it has the brain capacity of a fly (Be watching for a very funny reference to 'The Graduate'). It's fast, funny and manages throughout to hold onto a central issue.  My only complaint is the incredibly harsh rating it received in the US.  Far from being unsuitable for persons younger than 18 I recommend that it is shown to all people in high school to help de-mystify the issue of teenagers and sexuality."

","You know, when I was a lad in the eighties, the big deal for us teens was Porky's (and its two sequels). In that film, set in Florida in the 1950s, a group of horny high school kids tries their very best to lose their individual virginity as soon as possible.<br/><br/>You can consider American Pie an update of Porky's, except that it's a LOT funnier while still retaining all of that raunch. The hook for Porky's was that you got to see a little nudity, which was a big deal to a teenager in the early eighties. Pie surpasses the raunch and adds dollops of good, solid, vivid, and (especially) authentic characterizations. While the kids in Porky's were fairly stereotypical, the kids in Pie are.... well, typical, really. <br/><br/>Of course, some things never change, and the driving force of the story in Pie is that males just wanna get laid, while females want it to be just right. The movie also tackles such issues as true love, masturbation (male and female), pornography, sex toys, orgasms (male and female), older women, and even diarrhea! Quite a lot to cram into 90 minutes, but not only does the film not skip a beat while delivering these goods, it does so with such honesty that you'll very rarely see in a so-called teen film of the late nineties. And I'm pretty sure it's the only film ever to tackle the all-important issue of sex with pastry!<br/><br/>(Side note: Good to see Thomas Ian Nicholas, from Rookie of the Year, a little more grown up - so to speak!)"

","I just saw a sneak preview of this film, and it's difficult to try to place it.  It is definitely unlike the recent slew of teen movies that Hollywood seems to be churning out.  Why?  Well, for starters it has characters who each and every person can honestly relate to, not simply the caricatures which are so frequently featured on screen nowadays.  It has a couple of incredibly risque sight gags, one of which puts the infamous hair gel scene in ""There's Something About Mary"" to shame.  But the biggest reason it stands out is that it reminds me more of the classic 80's teen films (updated in content for the 90's, of course) than any of the cookie cutter 90's teen films have...by far.  This is ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" fixed up for a new generation.  It unabashedly deals with teenage hormones and masturbation, and is unafraid to show it.  Unlike the awful ""Cruel Intentions"", which tried to make teens appear over-experienced and sexy (failing miserably), ""American Pie"" beautifully illustrates the awkwardness and anticipation surrounding the loss of the big V and the trials of teen hormones and sexual frustration.  I highly recommend.  It'll have you rolling on the floor laughing, both from what's on screen and recognition of the humor of your own first time."

","A film worthy of repeated viewing again and again, and the nudity is not the reason.  It's a movie written expressly by guys for guys, but somehow women like it as much as men do.  The movie has so many scenes of absolutely hideous embarrassment alternated with scenes of triumph.  There were somewhere around ten times in the movie when I started shaking my fist and going, ""Yeah, baby!""  Why?  Becausen this is a movie that so many guys my age (I'm 18) can relate to.  We cringe with embarrassment beyond what we've ever known when we see Kevin get caught spouting off about trying for a sexual homerun; we cheer when we see the guy get the girl not because she coerced him into saying ""I love you"" but because he truly was interested in her.  This is immensely gratifying for us to see, partially because we never see it in real life.  For fans of the movie ""Swingers"" I would highly recommend this as a guy movie.  <br/><br/>Storywise, this is very well written.  As noted above, there are some similarities to ""Swingers"" - obvious scenes when you can't help but feel sorry for the guy acting too effeminate or being too much of a pushover - to be contrasted with scenes (like Mike's dancing in Swingers) where you want to stand up and cheer.  It's the tension between these moments of ""I can't watch this!"" to ""You just learned how to be a man!"" that gives this movie its great appeal to me.  When I first heard of the movie, I swore that I would never see it.  I heard of scenes with a pie, of awkward porno-magazine distribution scenes, of the endlessly repeated ""Band Camp"" lines, and of a guy using a tube sock to encase something other than his foot.  Yes, these are indeed gross, but you must realize they are realistic gross.  Whether or not they cross into gratuitousness is up to you, but I feel that this film's reputation as ""The Most Dangerous Film to Our Youth of All Time"" is undeserved.  The gross scenes appeal only to the easily-titillated, or social reformers who need an excuse to impose some more limits on what we watch.  Watch it for yourself, and how you really think.  You'll find it worthwhile."

","When I first caught the trailers for American Pie I thought that it was going to be too crude.  There was no doubt that this film would make Something About Mary seem like a Disney flick.  But now, in the comfort of my own home, having just witnessed the DVD version of American Pie, I have to say that it is an excellent movie.  Having been raised on films by the Zucker brothers and Mel Brooks, that's a difficult statement to make.  But those movies were the early stages of making sex a comedic subject, and American Pie is the next step in the evolutionary chain.  I'm sure I was as shocked at some scenes as the previous generation were at segments of Airplane! or Blazing Saddles.<br/><br/>It's difficult to believe that this is the Weitz brothers first film.  The story flowed extremely well, particularly over the raciest subject matter. And the cast is superb.  Had the screenplay been handled with less finesse, or the lines read with less youthful innocence, I'm certain this would have been a movie to avoid.  But instead I found it a great escape.<br/><br/>Eugene Levy was the only cast member I recognized from previous roles, and he did a very credible job as the loving father awkwardly attempting to help his boy pass into manhood.<br/><br/>I would strongly recommend American Pie to any of my friends interested in comedy films.>"

This whole film was awful.  I don't care if that's truly the way teenage boys think, I think it was insulting, degrading and exploitative of women, not that the female characters in the film were any better.  Disgusting and nowhere as funny as it was advertised to be.  I've heard that in America burns to sensitive body parts has eventuated because of sex-crazed teenage boys sticking stuff where it doesn't belong.

","I am not about to tell you about how obscene or offensive this movie is - and no doubt it is both of those - because I know that you've heard enough about that.  I am also not going to lecture the film industry either on gradually shifting the limits of comedy to the point where story is no longer a critical aspect provided that you can put the characters into as many embarrassing and disgusting scenes as possible or on how despite the films rating which supposedly restricts admittance to those 17 and over (yeah, right), it is a perfect example of Hollywood's marketing to an audience for whom it maybe shouldn't be.<br/><br/>American Pie is a textbook case of all of the above points.  It's plot, high school seniors vow to lose their virginity by graduation, sinks beyond unoriginal and enters blatant cliche territory.  But, the fact that you get to see one of the characters masturbate with baked goods makes up for it in the laugh department.<br/><br/>That said, American Pie was NOT a bad movie and for that matter I DID like it...sort of.  It's characters were certainly likeable enough and somewhat sympathetic.  And indeed, I caught myself laughing at things that I probably wouldn't want to admit to.<br/><br/>However, like so many teen sex comedies before it (however much more explicit this one is in relative comparison) it is stale and  predictable.<br/><br/>
A few redeeming performances, notably Chris Klein who, although, seems to be playing the exact same character as he did in Election, comes off honest and refreshing.  Even more notably, Eugene Levy, who more or less using his comic genius managed to add hilarity to an otherwise dreary work."

"baumer","9","0","0","6 July 1999"," Incredibly humourous and an honest look at trying to get laid in highschool.
","American Pie is the funniest movie that I have seen in about five years. Something About Mary had me laughing, Big Daddy had me holding my sides, and South Park had me shocked but humoured.  American Pie is heads and shoulders above any of these films.  What makes this film so funny is not only its attempt to humour us, but its honesty in every scene.  And that honesty can bring us back to what it was like to be there.  So whether you lost it ten years ago, yesterday of even five minutes ago, you can relate to the feelings that this movie has.<br/><br/>It is three weeks before the prom and four friends have made a pact to get laid before the end of prom.  The four friends consist of a guy who has been dating a girl for quite a while but hasn't gotten past third base.  Another is a shy guy that has problems doing his "" business "" at school because of cleanliness issues.  A third is portrayed at first as the quintessential jock that just wants to use his athletic prowess to meet the ladies.  And finally we have Jim.  Jim is the guy that you see in the commercials.  He is so sexually inept that when he tries to talk to a girl, he shies away before any words will leave his mouth.  And when he has a naked girl in his room, he "" blows it "" twice, before he can get the prize.<br/><br/>The most interesting situation was how the jock "" OZ "" grew in this movie. He started off as a typical jock.  Then he meets a girl that he really likes.  And suddenly he doesn't just want to have sex, he really cares about her and at the end when we see them together, it makes you feel warm.  It is their relationship that makes you remember what it was like to really like someone for the first time.<br/><br/>There are many other delicate and poignant scenes in the film concerning love.  Kevin and Vickey's relationship is a tricky one because they both really like each other but she is not sure if she wants to take that last step.  This causes some friction in the relationship, but when it is resolved, it is written so convincingly that you are happy for them.<br/><br/>This film combines some true intelligence and romance with a wickedly funny look at the complexities of sex.  And nothing is sacred here.  They explore female and male oral sex.  They talk in depth about orgasms and of course masturbation is a big topic in this film.  And that makes it side splittingly funny and incredibly witty.  American Pie really is a miracle. It was written by Adam Herz and this is his first film.  And judging by his ear for dialogue and character, he will be around for quite some time.<br/><br/>The one performance that I wanted to call attention to was Chris Klein as Oz.  I wasn't sure where I had seen him before so I looked him up in the IMDb.  And he was in Election.  And he was great in that film too.  But here he is honest and sincere in his performance and he lends credence to his character.  He is very good in American Pie and I believe he will go on to do bigger things in Hollywood.<br/><br/>So if what you are looking for is one hilarious film and you like Something About Mary (tripled) kind of humour, then this is your movie.  If you don't like that kind of film, don't even bother to see this film.  But you are missing a true treasure.  Thsi film reminds me a bit of a combination between The Breakfast Club and Fast Times.  So check it out.  You will laugh and you will cheer when you walk out of theater.  The only bad thing about this film is that it ended.<br/><br/>One final thought is that you should really beware of the chicks in band that play the flute.  ( Wickedly funny!! )<br/><br/>Wonderful movie!"

American Pie has run away from its pubescent pack by capturing high school the way it really is.  Four years of frustrated preoccupation with sex; what it is, who's done it and how to get it.  This movie is hilarious, mostly because it depicts the essence of what it is like to be wrestling with the confusion of emerging sexuality while trying to convince everyone else that you are cool.<br/><br/>Director Chris Weitz has found the right balance between sexual obsession and teenage self consciousness.  The fact is no-one is as experienced as they pretend, and they're scared to death of the embarrassment it would cause if everyone knew.<br/><br/>The skits are mostly funny, sometimes raunchy, sometimes touching, but always right on the mark emotionally for that age group.<br/><br/>
Jason Biggs (Jim) takes the cake (pie) when it comes to comic prowess in this film.  Alyson Hannigan is priceless as the nerd girl refugee from band camp.<br/><br/>This film is a must see good time.  Check your maturity at the front door and just enjoy."

","""American Pie"" starts off with a bang, and gets a bit shaky from there. This story of five friends who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night is often hysterical, occasionally dull, but always interesting.<br/><br/>Jason Biggs leads the cast as Jim, a young man who is growing increasingly frustrated with being a virgin, and goes to great lengths to lose it. Let's face it, this guy is forever going to be remembered for the hysterical pie scene, but has other embarassing moments as well, either always being walked in on by mom and/or dad or a beyond description funny internet snafu. Great job by this first timer, and I can't wait to see what he does next.<br/><br/>Chris Klein (""Election"") plays ""Oz"" as he's called by his friends.....this mr. popular lacross player is probably the most interesting character in the film, with an absolutely adorable characterization.  His attempts to woo choir girl Heather (Mena Suvari (""American Beauty"") are so sweet and genuine that it adds a needed dose of humanity to this otherwise crude comedy.<br/><br/>Since we're on the subject, Mena Suvari plays good girl Heather to the hilt. A stellar singer and somewhat distrusting of Oz at first, she eventually realizes there's more to the boy than first thought, and she falls for him. This young woman is gonna be around for a long time to come, and is gonna be a major player before long.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is good, Tara Reid (""Urban Legend"") gets a better character here, and does a good job, Shannon Elizabeth as the sexy exchange student Nadia, Eddie Kay Thomas as the nerdy Finch, Seann William Scott as the rude jock Stifler.  All good characterizations and believeable as people you went to or go to school with. Alyson Hannigan (TV's ""Buffy"") was easily the biggest surprise for me, the nerdy character (much like Willow) suddenly gives way with THE line in the movie.....towards the end, pay special attention!!!<br/><br/>Two others stood out to me.....Eugene Levy as Jim's dad, hysterical as he tries to reach out to his son concerning sex.  He is a scene stealer and was easily the highlight of the film.<br/><br/>The other was Natasha Lyonne (""Slums of Beverly Hills"", ""Detroit Rock City"") As good an actress as she is, she was woefully underused in this one.  She rarely is on screen, and is giving advice to the others in short spurts when she is.  Ms. Lyonne deserved better than that, and that is my only gripe.<br/><br/>""American Pie"" is a good coming-of-age movie for the 90's, but is often very off color and crude.

Of course, like any movie you have a feel for what you hope to _get_ out of the movie right before the lights dim...I was expecting something outrageous and over-the-top, especially because I had the Unrated DVD starting to spin. I mean, this cut couldn't even land an 'R' rating. South Park did (although certain MPAA members came out later ""regretting"" their decision to shy away from the dreaded NC-17), so I was expecting something on par. Truth is, American Pie bogied, if not three-putted. It had a throw away message (sort of like South Park, but less campy and almost taken seriously, a definite negative) about the virtues of beating down peer pressure. It had forgettable characters and  a weak script. But that's hardly why I was excited to see it...I wanted pure, unadulterated, NC-17 teetering outrageousness...and I didn't get that.<br/><br/>The mutilated pie was funny. And I never really thought about how useful a flute might be...but that was about it...all the gags seemed so...forced. I couldn't tell if I was supposed to take the movie seriously or not, and that's its inherent flaw. If you're going for the push-the-envelope gusto, by all means strap on the booster rockets and GO (which, by the way, was a far better movie chronicling the outrageousness of teen angst.). Jim and the gang were so...serious, and even if that was the intent, it wasn't very amusing as it unfolded. For example, as Jim consistently struck out with a man on first, I really didn't care...it didn't HURT, hit the brotherly sympathy nerve, like the answering machine scene in Swingers. All the characters were positively dull and terribly zero-dimensional.<br/><br/>I don't mean to analyze this movie to death although I probably just did, which makes me something of a hypocrite.

I am just tired of being duped into believing that there is new stuff on these movies."

","Let's be brutally honest folks..teenage boys want to get laid,first and foremost. This movie captures the reckless abandon i myself and so many other friends have experienced. Sure some of the humor was gross and juvenile..But it's a teen comedy not CNN Worldview. Comparisons to ""Porkys"" are misleading as this movie is actually funny and modern while Porkys,imho, was boring and excruciatingly tedious.

"Adrian-32","7","0","0","23 December 1999"," A fusion of raunchiness and warmth
","""American Pie"" is not you average teen flick. It's reputation for being raunchy and outrageous is totally justified, given the fact that it does refer to, and sometimes show, everything involved with sex, from bodily fluids to masturbation to using food as a a metaphor for third base. It's sort of like a ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" touched with ""There's Something About Mary"" grossness. Believe it or not, this film is relentlessly honest when it examines teen guys, with their consistently raging hormones, driving them to explore just about everything. Yeah, it does get a bit silly at times, but is also, strangely, illuminates alot of information about teens adults don't know about, or probaly don't wanna believe. But it's not like the lead characters are one-dimensional youths trying to get laid, there are actually some touching moments near the end where they come to realisation that relationships and love will always be more fulfilling than scoring. ""American Pie"" manages to successfully combine hilarious toilet-humour with warmth, and it owes a lot of credit towards the performances, everyone showcases potential, including Jason Biggs. Okay, so it's gags do get a but tiresome, and some character's don't develop well, but overall ""American Pie"" is a teen comedy worth watching."
"Brogan","9","0","0","6 July 1999"," Gross, disgusting, raunchy, perverted, and excellent.
","Gross comedies, some work (THERE SOMETHING ABOUT MARY & BASEketBALL), others don't work too well (AUSTIN POWERS 2 & SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER, & UNCUT).  AMERICAN PIE is different, it's not a movie like AUSTIN or SOUTH that relies on it's gross humor to save the muddle script.  No, instead the gross humor is a medium for a decent script that winds up working well, very well! The plot is about four high-school seniors (Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, & Eddie Kaye Thomas) who make a pact, that they are to lose thier virginity by the time they graduate.  The idel time to ""score"" is on prom night, so all four guys are working and preparing for prom night.  Oz (Chris Klein), a jock, joins the jazz choir to impress another choir member, Heather (Mena Suvari) and to show that he too can be a sensitive guy. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) wants to give his current girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid) the perfect moment while having sex. Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), is acting very smooth and charming, trying to impress the entire senior female class with his outrageous rumors. And then there's poor Jim (Jason Biggs) a young man who is at his sexual peak, and has a crush on the foreign exchage student named Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth). From there on is a rollercoaster with the same equivalent as a Six Flags rollercoaster, of non-stop laughs and gross out jokes.  How would I compare this to other comedies as thrill rides?  AUSTIN POWERS 2 and SOUTH PARK are the scary ""kiddie"" rollercoasters.   BIG DADDY is the wild, but not scary of the rollercoasters, like a medium thrill.  ANALYZE THIS and AMERICAN PIE are the monster coasters of laughs.  The ones that people wait 3 hours in line, freak out while on the ride, and want more!  Well, that is what you get after seeing AMERICAN PIE, you want more! These young actors are all going to be famous, the same way AMERICAN GRAFFITI, FAST TIMES, & DAZED & CONFUSED made most of thier stars big.  I'm sure 15 years from now, their will be a collector's edition similar to GRAFFITTI and FAST TIMES.  This is the FAST TIMES for the 90's teens, but it also appeals to the 20 something crowd, like me.  I really did enjoy seeing Chris Klein play the same type of person he played in ELECTION.  Jason Biggs was very funny as the unfortunate Jim, who is unlucky most of the time.  Tara Reid and Mena Suvari are both very good as the girls who are wondering if they are making the right decision.  But the two I thought stand-out are Shannon Elizabeth and Eddie Kaye Thomas.  Elizabeth is GORGEOUS, she will get tons of iternet hits by the end of the summer.  And Thomas is both very smooth and calm, he's very similar to a calm David Schwimmer. People are calling this the PORKYS of the summer.  It isn't PORKYS was very silly, immature, and cruel.  The guys were sex-hungry idiots, and the girls were brainless sex objects.  I would rank this film with the better comedy of 1982, FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH.  Like FAST TIMES, it's full of laughs, and it has heart.  PORKYS didn't have any heart, just cruel jokes. AMERICAN PIE will tickle the young adults funny bones the same way ANALYZE THIS tickled the adults and seniors funny bones. But this film isn't for those only under 30, I'm sure that older people will enjoy this film the same way they enjoyed THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY.  Will the pre-teens will try to sneek into SOUTH PARK or go watch AUSTIN POWERS 2.  The real men and women will be watching AMERICAN PIE, and lovin' it.  Just like I did. ***** (out of *****)"

Being a teenage, hormonal guy, i can relate to Jim, Finch, Oz, and the other guy. They remind me of me and my friends. The quiet guy, the geek, the jock, and the nice guy.<br/><br/>Basically this movie is about four guys, Jim Biggs, who needs to learn to pleasure himself in the bathroom becuase he gets caught every flippin time, Jim is quiet and doesn't exactly know what to say to girls, even if the most beautiful girl is naked in his own bedroom. Then there's Finch, classy, high society, and never sh*ts at school, always goes home, everyone calls him Shitbreak. Then there's Oz, he's on the lacrosse? team, and needs to learn how to be sensitive, then there's the other guy with the hot girlfriend, who is more experienced than any of the other three combined. After a party of hopeless attempts to get some play, they decide to make a pact to get laid on prom night.<br/><br/>This is definetly one of the funniest movies i have seen in a while. My favorite character was Michelle, the band girl. ""One time at band camp"" is the beginning of her every sentence and ""it was so funny."" is the end of all them. She was so hilarious.

"Capps","8","0","0","6 July 1999"," Finally, a true teen comedy!
","In a year of- no wait, scratch that- in a decade of major league disappointments in the genre of teen cinema, Universal Pictures has finally delivered a flick that lives up to the standards of such raunchy classics as Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Porkys.<br/><br/>American Pie is a genuinely funny film. While it seems as though most of the gross out humor is a blatant result of the success of There's Something About Mary, the laughs truly are quite original and not forced. The film is reminiscent of when John Hughes was writing in his prime in the mid-late '80s, back when teen comedies actually appealed to teens with true emotion and hysterics.<br/><br/>While the script is very well written, the cast is really the driving force behind the film. American Pie would not have been half as funny had there been ""IT"" boys and girls such as Freddie Prinze and Jennifer Love in it. Actors such as Jason Biggs and Natasha Lyonne are the true stars to watch out for nowadays. The expressions, deliveries, and characterizations are priceless all around the board. Each individual actor expresses his/her character with a certain sense of pragmism and originality that it's hard not to like any one of them.<br/><br/>I don't think I really need to discuss the plot or some of the best scenes in the film because they really have to be seen to be appreciated. Just make sure that while going to the local multiplex to catch the latest big budget filmmaking disaster of the '90s, you save a little room inside your cerebrum of entertainment to catch an outstandingly funny, smart, and emotionally satisfying flick that might not be sold out on two screens."

","American Pie is a funny and alarmingly clever film that became one of the sleeper hits of the summer of 1999.  It is a teenage T/A film, reminiscent of those produced during the eighties featuring such superstars as Phoebe Cates and that girl from ""Tomboy.""  However, American Pie is well made, well cast, and delivers exactly what it intended to do, while others of its mold, such as the Porky's series, simply lapse into derivative slapstick and un-funny scenes.<br/><br/>I found American Pie to be very imaginative and incredibly witty, and it depicts the lives of teenagers in a sweet light that could have easily degenerated into some sort of ""Kids""-esque oversexed romp.  Young adult viewers will enjoy this film not because of its truthful story line or dead-on performances, but rather its non-complicated gross-out comedy.  In other words, parents don't faint when you decide to take a seat next to your son or daughter and watch it.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

"Andrew-6","7","0","0","6 July 1999"," Better than some... worse than others...
","Well, I, like many of the other people who've commented on this flick, had high expectations going in. I was let down, but not as much as some people. This film is funny. Much more than most other films I've seen this year (but, I must say, that isn't saying much). And I'd also like to add, this is, again IMO, better than most 'teen flicks'.<br/><br/>Now, here's my take on the flick... Masturbation plays a big part in here... This isn't bad, and the scenes, IMO, worked for comic effect without being too sick.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't that bad, it could've been worse. A couple of the actors worked for me: Alyson Hannigan (She's funny, what can I say?), Natasha Lyonne (as always) and Chris Klein (of 'Election' Fame). Let me explain the last one... Chris Klein has played both of his characters he's had this far, well, vacant. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that he's a bad actor (or vacant for that matter)... I think it's intentional, that's why it works.<br/><br/>And, my take on the whole 'teen flick' bit... This is a teen flick, plain and simple. However, I don't think this film is just for teen, adults can appreciate the humor too. Though it is sad that they'll probably think that the vacantness of the characters is an overstatement. Unfortunately, it isn't, it's more of an understatement.<br/><br/>To conclude... all and all, this film is worth a look. Make that a look at matinee prices (don't blow $10 or $12 on it)."

","Well, what can I say that hasn't already been said? Now, I know this movie is called a comedy, but I found it a little too gross to laugh at sometimes. At any rate, I really like social satire, from obvious sources like ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""National Lampoon"" to more hidden forms, like anything by Mel Brooks (""Blazing Saddles"" especially) and ""South Park."" American Pie sounded like a neat idea, because I don't think that the 90's have been spoofed enough. In the 60s, social satires like THE PRODUCERS were around. Then, there was BLAZING SADDLES in '74. The 80s gave us ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" which I liked alot. But the 90s has given us either 60s throwbacks or fantasy satire(where the film is satirizing something that doesn't really exist!) Now, I know that if someone made a movie(like BLAZING SADDLES) with negative images of minorities, or dancing Nazis,there would be riots in Washington. But maybe, that's where these new comdies and ""satires"" go wrong. Instead of blithely attacking current issues (racism, political corruption, murder), they go after themes that were cliches back in 1580 when William Shakespeare was the world's leading satirist! AMERICAN PIE is nothing more than a more graphic teen love story. It's saitre could be seen on a variety of levels- we could perceive it as a representation of the carefree 90s, where little can go wrong. we could perceive it as an attack on the machine age a la MODERN TIMES (the Internet camera left on in the room) And we could perceive it as a comment on the voyeurism that goes on today (the friends eagerly watching the TV hookup to the room, etc.) Take it or leave it, AMERICAN PIE was the ""big"" movie during the summer of '99-the summer that Hollywood agreed that audiences were ready for scenes in a kids' comedy that are more shocking than the most disturbing images of SCHINDLER'S LIST or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN! My only problem with the whole thing is that in twenty-five years, AMERICAN PIE will seem just as shocking-but in a different way. How- I don't know. But, witness BLAZING SADDLES. I mean, it couldn't get released today because of the racism, but in 1974 the racism was the least of the problems-it was the language and the famous campfire scene. But today, the language heard in that R-rated movie can be heard in any PG rated movie or TV show, and the campfire scene can be found in such children's movies as DENNIS THE MENACE! So, I wonder, in 25 years, where this movie will stand. The sex scenes won't be the problem. The problem will be something that we don't even notice today. What-I don't know, but it will be interesting to find out what it will be."

Of the other three, one is a jock who has to learn how to treat ladies with a little more respect, and the other two are completely inept at even talking to girls.  Needless to say, this mix provides for some great laughs and entertainment.<br/><br/>American pie is crude, there's no doubt about it.

What I don't want is maturity and Prince Hal.<br/><br/>It could be argued that THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, last year's Hollywood masterpiece, leavened its gross-out with generous portions of ick, but a love quest was built into that film from the beginning, the success or failure of which was going to have an emotional effect.  Also, the characters were significantly older than the kids of AMERICAN PIE, so the pay-off was more believable, and because the characters were so sweet, more satisfying.<br/><br/>AMERICAN PIE is about a quartet of hormonal boys who want to get laid before they go to college.  As 49% of the population experience this agony at some time in their lives, the film has to be pretty accurate in its details to succeed, and it largely is.  The guys are very likeable and believable, their mishaps ring very true.  Their worldview shapes the film, and is rarely betrayed.  The film, which everyone compares to PORKY'S, is miles above that infantile gag in its relatively even-handed treatment of women, who are not the inscrutable, unattainable, type, but a varied, complex lot. Even the set-piece with Nadja, which begins as sheer exploitation, ends up with the male lead deeply humiliated.  <br/><br/>The universal implications of the title are a wild misnomer: it should have been called Upper-Middle-Class American Pie.  Every character lives in a big house, with no real dysfunction, so that they can afford to spend all their time fretting about sex (I'd forgotten how much EFFORT goes into this, though).  Every character is going to college; every main character is white.  An AMERICAN PIE from the projects would be a very different film.<br/><br/>For a comedy to be lastingly funny, there has to be trauma.  That's why the mature angst of one couple strikes me as false.  The growing relationship of another is lovely, but unlikely: it's like gross-out films lack the bottle to go all the way - the repulsiveness has to sweetened.  The Farellys tried with KINGPIN, but were accused of misogyny, even misanthropy.  Only SOUTH PARK dared to go all the way, cynically parodying feel-good redemption, But, hey, that was only a cartoon, right?  And yet, even the maturity is a lie.  The characters learn that a selfish obsession with having sex is not the most important thing in life, and yet they do anyway.<br/><br/>But I don't know why I'm carping.  AMERICAN PIE is a side-splitting hoot from start to finish.  LIke all the best comedy, the humiliation is linked to character, and Jim's experiences especially are among the funniest things I've seen in years - the practicing; the understanding talks given by his father; his immortal strip-tease; the pie!  Priceless.  Shame he looks like a cross between Ross Geller and Adam Sandler.<br/><br/>A more satisfying melancholy concerns the allusions to Hal and Falstaff. Like the former, the characters have big careers in front of them, and must reject the exuberant licentiousness of their youth.  There is a real sense of loss at the end, of a time having certainly past, which is perversely moving.  Most adult figures condone, even encourage, the teenage hi-jinx: they know it's as good as it's going to get.<br/><br/>None of the misfortunes really spring from malice, so there is rarely a bad taste left in one's mouth (except Stifler's).  Director Weitz could become a great comedy director - he knows how to cut scenes short for maximum effect: more experienced comedians drag on and on.  My only complaint would be the relatively short space allocated to Finch - he is a wonderful character, filled with a strange, devious self-confidence behind his apparent geekiness: you've got to like a guy who can wisecrack in Latin."

He has a full time girlfriend and their relationship becomes the cornerstone of the film's drama. Both are unsure of their relationship and how sex should fit in it. Finch is the shyest and strangest characters. He borders on a nerd but he formulates a plan to make him the most talked about boy in the girls locker room. The only unconvincing element of the four guy's adventures was with ""Oz"". His efforts border on sentimentality and his playing of a character who wants to find his sensitive side doesn't work.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are used effectively.

"msj","9","0","0","1 September 1999"," A good film reflecting teens sexuality issues
","American Pie is a great movie. Why? I'll try to explain... When I first saw the film i laughed at the scenes where Jim was discovering his own sexuality, or lack thereof. But if you think about it for a second, isn't that the problem of many, many American teens nowadays? Adults are constantly proclaiming that sex is bad, something you should stay away from until you are at least 67! I so very often see adult Americans tell their mid-puberty-hormones-going-wild teen kids to stay away from all things fun, and not to forget - natural. ""We accept the world presented to us"" Ed Harris said in The Truman Show, and I agree to that. If I were told all my life that blue actually is red - I would believe it, but that doesn't make it right. American Pie shows us all that sex is a problem teens struggle with, and it is the parents obligation and privelidge to assist and guide their children. A very important point here is ""guide"", it's better to tell your children ""how to"" rater ""not to"", I believe. ""Man shaped in Gods vision"" ring a bell? Just kidding. We need more reality in films, especially American films. Even a comedy like American Pie can have an important story to tell, and I believe this film gived it a very good try, perfect I'd say. Today's society needs some ""Grrrr"" and ""Swinging, baby"" as a great british spy would say! So my final comment is that American Pie is a great film, very funny, the actors do a good job portraying young frustrated, scared and real teenagers longing for ""love"". It makes a good point which can be helpful in life, for both parents and children. Is it dangerous to tell kids that sex is allright? No! Love and sexuality is a great thing! And it's important."

","Warning: This Review Contains Plot Material<br/><br/>I really liked this movie a lot.  A lot of the scenes were great (including the now infamous Jason Biggs and the Pie scene), and the acting was hilarious and excellent.<br/><br/>I thought the two strongest characters who really made this movie extremely entertaining were Eugene Levy and Alyson Hannigan, and I don't think many people disagree with me there.  Eugene Levy, playing Jason Biggs' father, was just downright hilarious as usual.  Seeing someone like Eugene giving a sex-ed role like he did was just so funny.  Like when he saw the condoms in his sons room, or the opening scene (I still laugh thinking about this) when he walks in on his son....I just can't get enough of how funny Eugene Levy was in that movie.<br/><br/>The same goes true for Alyson Hannigan.  Seeing her play the ""geek"" (no offense) on TV's Buffy, the Vampire Slayer, a show that I love, and then seeing her change of character in this movie is hilarious.  At first, you see her pretty much resembling her dorky character in Buffy, but then she suddenly changes, and she becomes a totally different person.

","American Pie - ***<br/><br/>This film tells the story of four male high school friends in Michigan who enter into a pact with each other to lose their virginity by prom night. Jim (Jason Biggs) is an average kid who finds himself tongue-tied whenever he attempts to speak to a beautiful classmate like Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth,) a foreign exchange student.  Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) has already gotten to third base with his longtime sweetheart Vicky (Tara Reid,) but he cannot figure out how to... steal home.  Oz (Chris Klein) is a Lacrosse jock who joins the choir in order to meet chicks.  There he meets Heather (Mena Suvari,) who becomes his duet partner.  Finally there is Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas.)  A true outsider at the school, Finch supplies his friends with homework assignments and refuses to use public restrooms. During the weeks preceding prom night, the guys pursue various romantic entanglements.  Sometimes they find enlightenment, sometimes they find humiliation, but mostly they find humor.<br/><br/>When American Pie arrived in theaters, it was already cloaked in controversy.  Here is a mass market comedy, geared toward teens, which barely escapes the dreaded NC-17.  The film is so raunchy that it has been dubbed ""There's Something About Pastry.""  Consider the tag line on the poster:  ""There's Something About Your First Piece.""  Is the movie too raunchy?  No - but it pushes the envelope.  There are three scenes in particular which will probably achieve a certain infamy.  Let us quickly dispense with them so we can move on to the rest of the film.  (1) The opening scene, in which Jim finds a unique use for a tube sock.  (2) The party scene, where Stifler (Seann W. Scott) takes a drink of beer only to find that it is laced with a certain bodily secretion that was taboo in the mainstream cinema until 1998.  (3) The scene in which Jim has intimate relations with an apple pie.  Yes, the aforementioned scenes are crass, but are they funny?  Jim's scenes are, because they both end in his being caught by his father.  And they both reinforce the awkwardness and desperation of the teenage male.  Stifler's scene, however, is merely gratuitous.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most surprising thing about American Pie is its warm-hearted center.  Unlike Porky's or any of the other alleged ""sex comedies"" of the 80s, American Pie gives all of its characters, both male and female, well-rounded personalities.  Of course the guys are interested in sex. But they're also supportive friends to each other, and they're interest in women is multi-dimensional.  Oz, for instance, finds that he falls in love with Heather.  What started out as a crass conquest turns into a rather sweet romance.  The picture is also quite funny at times.  I particularly liked the scenes between Jim and his father (Eugene Levy.)  Another blockbuster scene is the one in which Jim performs a striptease for Nadia.  What Jim does not know is that his performance is being beamed across the internet. American Pie is also successful in the way it presents us with the standard teenage stereotypes (jock, nerd, choir girl, band girl, etc.) and then proceeds to tear them down and show us that all of these characters have other dimensions.<br/><br/>Alas, the film sometimes gets in its own way.  The direction, by Paul Weitz, is rather rudimentary, even clumsy at times.  The truly romantic moments are undermined by dreary, by-the-numbers musical interludes.  Finally, I felt that the film sometimes reveled too much in the humiliation of its characters.  Granted, humiliation is a part of life in high school.  That is why I liked Jim's sexual encounters with Nadia, the sock, and the pie; while Jim was humiliated, his father would painfully try to explain that ""it's perfectly natural.""  But I felt the movie crossed the line when Stifler slipped Finch a laxative, leading to an embarrassing encounter in the women's restroom.  This served absolutely no dramatic purpose.  Likewise, the character of Sherman (Chris Owen) achieves total public embarrassment at the conclusion of the picture.  Dramatically it is meant to be Sherman's comeuppance, but I felt that it was too harsh - even for him."

One other point that I would like to make about this movie, is that you see growth in all of the 4 main characters....the most in the jock, Oz...then Jim, the dork...then Shit-Break, Finch...then the only one w/a girlfriend. This movie wasn't all humor, and eventually showed you that sex isn't everything.  At that point you're kinda like wow...neat, and it seems that the movie is over....but then it goes back to the hilarious, laughing your ass of humor.  I was fortunate enough to see an early version of this movie, and can't wait to see it at theaters, to see if they changed anything...good luck, and you haaaaaave to see this movie!!"

","American Pie is what great teen films once were and what they are supposed to be.  In a time when lame films like She's All That and Varsity Blues are making big bucks, American Pie actually comes through as an extremely hilarious and very entertaining film.  Not only is the movie filled with non-stop laughter, but the characters and the message they send are fully realistic and plausible.  This, by far, is the funniest movie since There's Something About Mary.  Nudity and countless sex/masturbation jokes...what else could you ask for in a movie."

","Excellent movie. Though initially suspicious of this movie (how can a stupid Hollywood comedy about high school kids be any different than all others), I ended up delighted. This is something different. What makes the film great is an excellent cast (the youngsters from this film are unbelievable) and the absence of that stupid consumer-society predictability that colors all those commercial Hollywood productions. The extent of predictability still found here is excused by our sympathy to the protagonists and so familiar troubles they go through. A thumb up. Bravo!"

","Well, in this world of mimicry, its no surprise that movie producers have much less room for innovation than for duplication. American Pie is yet another example of this. After the suprise hit ""Theres something about Mary"" was released last year, Universal just had to get in on the action. So they made a film with a similar theme, reduced the target audience age by about 10 years, and ""American Pie"" was born. Only now we have a film which is so gross, so tasteless, and so immature that it makes Mary look like a G rated family adventure. If you think the hair gel scene in Something about Mary was pushing it, check out the expectoration-beer scene in this movie.<br/><br/>
I've always been a huge fan of the 1980s comedy skin flicks like Porky's, and don't really mind gross humor (I loved Trainspotting) as long as its got something good to balance it. But all this film has is annoying teens drinking, reading porn, and finding new ways to beat a proverbial dead horse (don't even consider that a pun) with a nonsensical apple pie scene that has already been made notorious from TV advertisements. Sure there are a few attempts to make this film seem original and innocuous, like a choir subplot and Eugene Levy's fatherly concern (He happens to be a likeable guy), but nearly every scene in this movie revolves around boringly crude bodily function humor.<br/><br/>Im sure this movie will do well when released on video, its an ideal teen slumber party feature, but its a far cry from its much handier 80s progenitors. If Cinemax ever decided to have an adult TGIF, this would surely be their focal point. After all, its merely an R rated version of ""Boy Meets World."""

","There's really nothing spectacular about American Pie other than the fact that it really is funny as hell. I found myself in a state of general disbelief in several parts of the film (namely the opening scene and the now infamous pie scene which both featured humor at Jason Biggs' expense). Yeah, this movie is Porky's with better writing and more heart - but hey, so what? Who didn't love the Teenage Sex Comedy genre when it was on top years ago? Alright, movies like Meatballs Three sunk that ship (and rightfully so) but now the genre (as they all seem to do) has returned with a bang.<br/><br/>Looking back on those movies from the eighties, the realization occurs that they just weren't all that funny. American Pie is very funny. There were points while watching Pie when I couldn't hear most of the follow up jokes to the big gags because the audience was laughing so loud. The characters (both male and female) are certainly likable enough even though it's not clear whether there is a future star amongst the young actors (though Biggs deserves something for his self-deprecation). However, proper accolades must go to veteran comedic actor Eugene Levy who is simply brilliant as Jim's straight-laced dad. It is their hilarious and at times very touching relationship that really shone through for me. Call me crazy but if there is any justice at the Oscars this year Levy will get a supporting actor nomination. But, alas, we all know that comic actors seldom get the nods they deserve from the academy (Murray got wrongfully slighted for Rushmore last year in my opinion).<br/><br/>Overall, American Pie is perhaps the best Teenage Sex Comedy of all time. So, if you're starved for a delightful romp or if you've ever been to band camp"

It was nice to be taken back to such confusing times for a chance to laugh at myself.<br/><br/>One tiny editing mistake... when Finch enters the pool room and finds Stifler's mom, he actually pulls the door towards him and walks in.

There more I watched the more I was impressed. It defined the teenage male so accurately and comically while at the same time creating some substance. Oz, a jock, explores his sensitive side in chorus and falls in love rather than just lusting. Ofcourse there is lots of shallow humor but that can be lots of fun too.

But the movie exceeded all my expectations, as not only was this a comedy, it was one to which almost anyone could relate, and see themselves in one of the film's characters. There are several unforgettable scenes, which will no doubt become classics, but the main objective of the movie, along with providing gut-busting laughs, is to present a message that one is free to make his own decisions and to disregard peer pressure.  I'm not going to spoil the movie for those who have not seen it yet, because some of the jokes are funny only when seen for the first time, but the jist of it is: YOU HAVE TO SEE AMERICAN PIE if you like to laugh and are any kind of movie buff.

While many critics have unjustly compared American Pie's gross out factor to last year's There's Something About Mary, a film which rests squarely in the surreal and twisted category, Pie makes a good and solid argument that the fumblings of sexual awareness among teens is at once hideously awkward (parents discovering their son's masturbatory predilections) and uniquely mature (a girl realizing her suitor may not be what he seems).

There's also a scene in which one of the characters is shown having diarrhea in the school lavatory, complete with sound effects.  The scene has no other reason than just pushing the envelope of movie grossness.).  The famous ""money scene"" of the movie in which an apple pie is used as an onanistic prop was funnier when I read about it than when I actually saw it (the scene also owes a lot to Phillip Roth's novel ""Portnoy's Complaint,"" in which the masturbation-obsessed title character has a go with a piece of liver intended for the family's dinner.)  The young characters in the movie are appealing and that alone keeps the movie mildly enjoyable.  The funniest scenes are those that are the least gross: Jim's Dad tries to explain the birds and the bees;  Finch and his friend's sexy mom (who is like Mrs. Robinson on 'ludes) go about seducing each other (Mom: The scotch is aged 18 years, just the way I like them.)"

How can anyone not appreciate a line like ""One time in band camp, I stuck a flute in my p**sy.""<br/><br/>Much like Three O'Clock High, Weird Science and Some Kind of Wonderful, American Pie dealt with real high school issues.  Not only did it make you nostalgic for your high school days, but it was also edgy and offered scenes that many directors would dare not show in today's super-PC world.  In fact, they even had to edit the scene involving Finch and Stifler's mom on the pool table, since the actor who played Finch was only 17 years-old at the time of filming.<br/><br/>As a lover of cheesy 80s movies, I'm glad someone finally made a movie to compete with the classics turned out a decade ago."

The cast members are believable as high school students, and even brought back some memories of my days in high school.<br/><br/>Be warned that this film has a high gross-out factor and uses little restraint with sexual humor.  However, unlike last year's overrated gross-out hit ""There's Something About Mary,"" the laughs are virtually nonstop, and you do not see all of the funniest gags in the trailer.<br/><br/>The script is very clever, and actually is a tad sentimental amid all of the offensive goings-on.  The film is peppered with pop-culture references, and even pays homage to films like ""The Graduate"" and even ""WarGames.""  The film even delivers a good message.  The four guys learn during their quest for the dirty deed that having strong feelings for someone you truly care about is equally as gratifying.<br/><br/>I really couldn't find anything wrong with this film.

","Before I begin reviewing the movie, I would like to ask those of you who have panned this film for being juvenile, why something with sex jokes, or masturbation jokes, is automatically immature and unintelligent.  After all these things certainly go on in our society and in the lives of teens today. Any subject, as long as the the way it is presented is clever, can make a good joke.<br/><br/>Now, I have to say that this movie was hilarious, but it also had a lot of heart.  The point of this movie was not to gross the audience out or to satirize teenage life, but to be a celebration of a difficult but fun time which all of us go through.  These characters are not one-dimensional losers as in satires like Beavis and Butthead which attack the stupidity of the generation, but real likeable people going through an extremely tough time which all of us know about.  The gross out jokes work so well in the movie, cause we all know they are true.  All of us probably know someone who would masturbate with an apple pie to get a better feeling.<br/><br/>The performances in this movie were mostly excellent.  I especially liked Mena Suvari as Heather.  Not only is she beautiful, but she seems destined to be a romantic lead in the class of a Meg Ryan.  Jason Biggs and Eddie Kaye Thomas were brilliant as two awkward teens.  Eugene Levy is hilarious as Bigg's awkward dad. Although she was not given much to do in the movie, I think that Natasha Lyonne could be the standout of this film.  She is so great at playing girls with tough exteriors, like in Slums of Beverly Hills. In this movie, she steps up the attitude, and crudeness, giving some of the funniest lines in the script.  All in all, I would say this is a great teen movie, up there with the Pretty in Pink's and Say Anything's of the late eighties.  American Pie is hilarious not because of it's crudeness, nor is it insensitive towards women like Porkies, but because it shows in a humane way the insecurities of an everyday teen."

","""American Pie"" was truly a movie that shows the average teenager going through major sexual scenarios. I should know, since I AM a teenager. :) Plus, I laughed my butt off in the progress.  I never thought I could watch a movie in a theater and be allowed to fall on the floor and laugh so hard, that the guy next to you would tell you to be quiet. It was a true masterpiece of teenage intelligence. The sex, the humor and whatever was in-between just made me EXPLODE in laughter.<br/><br/>On a side note, it was really good to see Eugene Levy do a recent role due of the fact that I haven't seen him in any movies lately. I would like to see him do some more movies in the near future. This is some great Canadian talent we are missing. Even though his role in, ""American Pie"" wasn't much on the silver screen, he still made me laugh before he said anything.<br/><br/>Cheers to the American Pie cast and crew! Great Work!"

","In the tradition of such classics as Porky's and Fast Times at Ridgemont High, American Pie shows a very honest and funny depiction of what is really going through the average high school senior's mind.  Unfortunately, this movie has already been underrated by being compared to There's Something about Mary, which, despite good box office performance, was very short on laughs.  American Pie is the best good time comedy to hit the theaters in years, and should not be missed.  Both men and women alike will be talking about this movie for a long time."

","Most comments I have read about this film point out only the ""gross-out"" elements.  What people seem to be missing is this is one of the most realistic films dealing with the subject of teenage sexuality.  Yes, some scenes are juvenile.  However, the film also portrays safe sex and realistic sex--not the usual ""acceptable"" Hollywood sex (Jack and Rose have sex after knowing each other for only two days in Titanic, where were the Puritan critics then?).  It seems sex is only OK in films if it is glamorous and has no mention of condoms.  As a 23 year old female, I appreciated the realistic portrayal of high school boys as I remember--horny and clueless.  However, these boys do learn some respect for women, at least more than they had at the beginning of the film; and, the girls do not allow them to get away with their disrespect and juvenile actions.  I think this is not a bad film for high schoolers, as it contains no violence and is actually quite entertaining."

","A particularly big deal was made about this movie in my neck of the woods because it is set in West Michigan, where I live.  I saw this film thinking that it would probably be an embarrassment to the state but I left pretty proud of the flick and its writer, also from West Michigan.  American Pie isn't for little kids and it's not for older adults, its for teens and twenty somethings who have experienced high school in the 90's. These are the people who will appreciate the film for what it is, an excellent comedy that personifies high school and exaggerates the experience just a bit."

","American Pie is a great sex comedy.  I would have to agree with another critic in saying that you can't truly appreciate this film unless you're past all that (ie., high school).  I also think that you can't really appreciate this unless you spent all four years of high school in the 90s. This film plays on the ""hang-ups"" that are trademarks of the time.... the pressure to get laid, masturbation, the use of the internet and other technology, etc.  The shock value in this film was amazingly high, which I thought is what made the film what it is.

","""Porky's"" or ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,""  are two of the greatest movies of this caliber.  American Pie, which does a great job in following suit, is one of the most refreshingly entertaining movies I've seen in the last several years.  It contains many pranks as well as many schemes that backfire, and plenty of humor to get the politicians in an uproar.   But I was very surprised at the fact that the movie carried many redeeming messages with it.  IE, sex, although enjoyable and sometimes being the only goal of horny youngans, is not the most important thing in life, they only think it is. I know I'm not alone in my theory.  Many of us were once horny teens who at the very least, THOUGHT about doing unspeakable things to simulate the act of sex.  And if you laugh while watching this movie's depiction of this very point, put yourself into that category.<br/><br/>Movies about high school have been on the lame side for the last 5 or 6 years.  American Pie will hopefully start a rebellion against the ""She's All Thats"" of the world.  I say this because I get offended when directors portray high school as this adult world where everyone knows the score and seems to be so organized and on top of things (ie Dawson's Creek, Beverly Hills 90210).  Myself, along with most of the other 440 people in my graduating class (as well as the rest of the country's high shcool population) didn't know anything, now looking back on it.<br/><br/>American Pie is a movie for anyone who was once a confused and curious teenager in high school, guys and girls alike. The bluntness of the humor may suggest it's only for men.  DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE.  Under all the bits and pranks, you will find an actual movie with loads of charm that is well worth your time."

","With ""Ten Things I Hate About You"", ""She's All That"", ""Idle Hands"", ""Cruel Intentions"", ""Carrie 2"", and ""Never Been Kissed"", I'm very tired of teenage movies with bad teenage actors trying to make disastrous teenage performances with lame teenage dialog and bad thirty year old directors. I'm up to my ears in this crap and it keeps making money. ""American Pie"" isn't ground breaking material. In fact, out of all the examples above, this film is the best reason to fully examine why exactly this material is so beloved by the 17-21 year old film audience.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Adam Herz and director Paul Weitz fashion ""American Pie"" as this year's ""Porky's"". A movie about four high school seniors who vow to lose their virginity before prom. Each one will woo a fellow student to varying results, each will engage in completely unfunny comedic shenanigans that left my screening audience with tears in their eyes. I had a lump of coal in my stomach.<br/><br/>It's rare to come across a comedy that on the outside has really nothing wrong with it. It tries to be funny. It's gross-out gags are appropriately gross (but damn them for outright stealing the laxative gag, so soon at least, from ""Dumb And Dumber""). It also features the grotesquely gratuitous nudity that I adore from a sex comedy. After ""Pie"" was served, I was left with the feeling that the audience was had too easily. If this move would have been half as clever as it could have been, we would be witness to the biggest teenage comic gem since Ferris took the day off.<br/><br/>The script is a loose concoction of distressingly elementary teenage drama intermixed with bawdy gags involving bodily secretions in beer, foreign exchange students (actress Shannon Elizabeth will be forgiven when she badmouths this performance in the future), self ""love"", and the typical set-pieces that come around whenever a ""movie"" keg is tapped. The entire film reeks of disrespect to females, but I will surely be creamed by everybody for bringing that up. I'll just leave my criticisms to the simple ""It's just isn't funny"". None of it. When Austin Powers drinks a cup of liquefied stool or the South Park kids swear without remorse, both films have plenty of ingenuity up their sleeves (in South Park's case, brilliant musical numbers). We can count on hysterical visual gags or rip-roaring lines to back up the questionable material. ""American Pie"" can't do this. It isn't written with care or respect to the audience. Director Paul Weitz doesn't help the proceedings by making ""Pie"" the most aesthetically bland film of the year. That's surprising considering ""Blair Witch Project"" is shot with a camcorder and ""South Park"" is a creation of construction paper and glue. It's a long shot, but some style might have made the bad medicine go down easier.<br/><br/>The cast of ""American Pie"" isn't anything to write home about. Chris Kline was memorable in April's ""Election"" as the dimwitted jock with the heart of gold. Here he plays... the dimwitted jock with the heart of gold. Those scoring at home, scratch him off the list of ones to watch. Personal faves Natasha Lyonne and Tara Reid are asked to do nothing more that be the ""girls"" of the film. If they needed the money badly, that would explain their presence. Both actresses have done better previously. Here's to the hope that they make rent this month and get back to films that exploit their respective talents more precision. Again I blame Paul Weitz's blasted direction. All that is expected of this cast is reaction and shock, not acting. Even comedy needs talented actors. That's why Eugene Levy (""SCTV"") makes the only favorable impression here. He's a comedy legend and he doesn't have to break a sweat to make a joke click. The rest of the cast could learn a thing or two.<br/><br/>""American Pie"" is like catnip for teens. It's outrageous, it's naughty, and the boys are cute. There's always that feeling when I don't like a certain comedy that I didn't quite get it. I don't feel that here. ""Pie"" is a bad film. A comedy that forgot the jokes and remembered the nonsense.---------------- 2"

Kevin is dating Vicki, but has trouble balancing his feelings for her and his desire to have sex with her.

","The original American Pie is certainly a classic comedy on the must see list, but it's not the best of the seven American Pie inspired films. Personally, I preferred the second one too the first, as everyone was much more relaxed and knew each other, making the movie flow better. Don't get me wrong, this one certainly had it's funny moments, but in my estimation it wasn't as good as the second one. Jason Biggs & Alyson Hannigan are hilarious, but for all they bring to the table, bad actors like Eddie Kay Thomas and Chris Klein take away, making the good performances moot. American Pie is a classic teen comedy about sex and it ushered in a new era in comedy that's still relevant today.

","Ordinarily, I avoid American teen movies like the plague. But a good movie is a good movie, and this is one of the best examples of this normally obnoxious genre. Its basic premise ¬ñ a group of high-school leavers endeavour to lose their virginity before setting off for college ¬ñ is a fairly simple one. It is in the quality of the comedy and (some) of the central characters that sets American Pie apart. The story centres on Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs) and his attempts to get beautiful exchange-student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) into bed. The best supporting roles (and side stories) come from the high-brow (and slightly pretentious) Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Steve Stifler (Seann W. Scott) who both provide additional colour and depth to proceedings. To be frank, I found Oz (Chris Klein) and Kevin's (Thomas Ian Nicholas) stories to be fairly bland affairs, straight out of a teen magazine (they were virtually redundant in American Pie 2). With its American college rock soundtrack and its almost National Lampoon mindset, American Pie does feel a little dated today. Nevertheless, it contains enough quality to make it worth a viewing.<br/><br/>Owain Bevan"

","A 6.8 rating for this movie is ridiculously low...<br/><br/>I don't think I've seen this much hostility towards a movie in quite a while. I don't remember the IMDb being the hotbed for PC, prudish people to spout their moral qualms. What is clear, however, is this: this post will do nothing to change people's minds about the movie, so rather than try to convince people that this movie was freaking awesome, I will attempt to sum up where the appeal is.<br/><br/>The claims of some of its detractors are true. The movie relies heavily on crude humor (very much in the mold of Something about Mary, which also started off with a 1-star rating by some prude), but very accurately reflects the type of conversations that teens have. Example: Jim, walking into school, says to Kevin ""I saw the Little Mermaid last night. That Ariel, she's so hot."" C'mon, what 17 year old kid hasn't thought that? <br/><br/>What sets the movie apart from others in recent memory, though, is the heart with which it is done. The accuracy in the conversations and the way the people deal with the issues that always arise during that time in a person's life is fantastic and, as a result, gives the movie-viewer a powerful sense of nostalgia for those days when the struggles of life seemed impossible, but were so fun at the same time.<br/><br/>Who will like this movie? People who are young at heart, people who are wasted, and people who want to be transported back to a great period in their lives. Prudish people- pretension need not apply.<br/><br/>As one prude worries, ""in 10 years, I fear this may be a cult classic."" Too late. Awesome movie."

","I scored this film 7 / 10 & am quite chuffed to see it's overall rating is 7.0. Thus, I must be fairly representative of the audience on this one.<br/><br/>I'll start however, with the one and only real criticism I had of this film. It was about as funny as a road accident. It was entertaining, easily to follow, had likeable characters, a surprisingly good storyline, but to describe it as a comedy must contravene every trade description law in the book.<br/><br/>To hear people rave about how hilarious this film was, you'd think it was Airplane or Naked Gun. It's not in that league, at least insofar as a comedy film. It could be another classic example of the American / Australian idea of comedy being completely different to Europe's & vice versa, as I watched this, though thoroughly enjoying it, completely straight faced throughout. Much in the same way, many Brits do with 'Cheers'. Extremely good lighthearted entertainment, but not particularly amusing.<br/><br/>I must also have watched an edited version as I cannot believe the emphasis people place on the character Stifler. Apart from the incident in the toilet, I recall very little else of him. He wasn't part of the pact after all.<br/><br/>Other than that though, it was good. I tend to avoid films with the first word 'American' like I avoid warts, as I do with so called sex comedies, given the amount of crap that come out of England in the 70's, in this genre, so this film was a recipe for diaster with me, but I really did enjoy it.<br/><br/>I anticipated a shagfest of pre pubescent teens making crude jokes, (especially given the pathetic knob in apple pie scene played to death in the trailers), and a glamourising of teenage sex, to make it seem like the be all & end all of every teenagers life, when most will tell you it isn't & that they do have other interests. But it wasn't really that at all, infact, for large parts the tone was to the contrary, I'm sure it conveyed some positive messages.<br/><br/>So for mild light hearted entertainment, I'd certainly recommend this. It's good fun, but not in the 'ha ha' sense.<br/><br/>But one thing, please, all in the US & Hollywood. Can this be the last film or song that you export, even just for a year, where the whole story revolves around 'Prom Night'? We've had enough of them for a while. Nobody else has Prom Nights. Us in England have never been to one, and don't really have any idea what they are. We don't export films about fat northern compere's in stringed vests & strippers on stage in Working Mens Clubs."

","After all the hype surrounding this flick, I expected to laugh.  I didn't. At a couple points, I smiled.  I thought the relationship between Jim and his father was fairly well done.  But otherwise, this is just another worthless teen comedy, kowtowing to the least discriminating of audiences. Is it too much to ask for a comedy that makes me laugh?  There hasn't been maybe of those in a the past few years.  Most of them are more obsessed with making penis jokes.  It makes me want to spit."
"mentalcritic","Null","1","2","12 August 2001"," I guess it is funnier if you're American...
","By ""American"", of course, I mean your attitude towards sex and sexuality is more tightly wound up than that of Fred Nile or Pat Robertson. It would be much easier to relate to this film under those circumstances than say, if you and your girlfriend were having threesomes with her best friend once a month by the time you were seventeen. It's a little harder to sympathise with the characters of this film if you happen to fit that profile.<br/><br/>The saving grace of the film, of course, is the characters. In spite of them being pulled from something Pat Robertson might have read as a boy, they are genuinely sympathetic and easy to relate to. The dialogue during the prom lifts this film out from under the weight of gutter humour and gives it some kind of moral. There was definitely a sense of closure to the end of the film, rather than the usual disbelief that marred the sex comedies of the eighties. I guess this comes from the fact that the characters seemed to have genuinely matured and changed as a result of their experiences, rather than remained idiots.<br/><br/>All in all, a genuinely enjoyable film with well-written, genuinely likeable characters who, in spite for their Americanisation, have shades in them that everyone can recognise. Now all we need is a film that combines the premise of this film with a more Fight Club sort of mentality. Maybe I should get around to writing that autobiography..."

","I am a fan of teenie movies, I always love to watch them. Mostly, the stories are pretty similar, but somehow this genre has a certain appeal to me. Maybe because I never did something crazy in my teens? Who knows.<br/><br/>Anyway, American Pie is really a good movie, a splendid proof that the teenie movie genre is not dead but alive and kicking, and that to portray teenagers in a entertaining way, you don't have to kill them all off (Scream, I know what you did last summer) or let them talk like old men and women (Dawsons Creek) - you simply have to let them act like what they are: Young people looking for the right way to do things, searching for their identity and - off course the focus of this movie - for their sexuality.<br/><br/>
While the story is certainly not all new, the way in which it is shown is really hilarious. There are some extremely well placed very crude, but all the more funny jokes, and the characters are simply likeable in their desperate attempts to loose their virginity. Highlights like the ""rendez-vous"" with Nadja or the blow-job scene with the not so politically correct disposal of the seminal fluid are simply too funny to resist.<br/><br/>All in all an extremely well done teenager comedy which I recommend to every one who has stayed young at heart.

"Lunchbox-8","Null","1","2","22 January 2001"," Funny teenage flick but a little overdone
","""American Pie"" was a good way to confront important teenage issues.  Some examples include sex, sex, and, uh, sex.  ""American Pie"" was a pretty funny movie.  It was great to see history in the making.  I'm not saying that this was a really important movie, but it put fuel on the ever-kindling fire of dirty teenage flicks.  Without ""American Pie"" movies like ""Road Trip"" and ""Scary Movie"" wouldn't even have been considered for production.  ""American Pie"" didn't really pioneer dirty flicks, see the Farelly brothers for that, it did though provide a precedent for the already mentioned movies.<br/><br/>  Although ""American Pie"" was somewhat meaningful for pubis movie goers, it really was just an excuse for teens to see nudity.  Some teens aren't blessed with Cinemax and Showtime, God bless those forsaken souls, and have to appease their carnal requirements.  This film was just an excuse to provide a little bit of water, in the ever dry throat of teenage lust.  Some scenes and situations were less than raunchy though, and showed the importance of relationship as more than just physical but it showed that mutual likeness can be lovely.  Returning to the risque scene, some scenes weren't appropriate for most young teens even, and kids these days here and retell more dirty jokes than Rodney Dangerfield and Saturday Night Live writers combined.  <br/><br/>  So, if you're into raunchy teenage comedy, you'll like ""American Pie.""  If you're a young teenager who doesn't know what snowballing is (very obscure term, see ""Clerks"", great movie, to find out you fledgling dirty terminologists) or if you're not sure what pea-braining is (I made that one up), don't see it.  Wait till you see movies like ""Dumb & Dumber"" or ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (Just kidding, don't see that one!), and then allow yourself to relsih in the brilliance of vulgar teenage writers inspired by Southern Comfort and Bong Residue.  If you're a parent screening the movie for a sleepover or something like that, pretend that you never heard about this film.                Choose Wisely and Enjoy!"
"llihilloh","Null","1","2","21 January 2001"," This is a joke, right?
","I've seen some bad films, but this one walks away with the award. If I was part of the cast, I would be ashamed to have even taken part in something this ludicrous. If I was part of the crew, I would die mainly because I am too stupid to think of anything more funny-realistic-intelligent etc.<br/><br/>What I would really like to know is how this film got an R rating. The majority of the viewers would more than likely be teenagers. I can't see any normal adult sitting through a movie that ruins the image of *some* good teen flicks. This was definitely not meant for teenagers. Any parent that allows their son/daughter to see this needs their head examined. Is this really what the film industry is becoming? I know that it used to be frowned upon if a married couple slept in the same bed. We're talking a while back, but you get the idea. If this is something that is thought of as quality movie making, I hate to see what's to come.<br/><br/>Being a teenager, I really don't get why so many people my age found this sort of trash amusing. It had the typical high school beauties, lack of comedy (despite what MANY people thought), lack of intelligence, a terrible script to start out with, and poor casting overall. For those of you who found this sort of thing funny, what were you thinking? And I must ask, how can the same joke seem to be pleasing for the entire film? A couple of losers are dying to lose their virginity, yeah, yeah, yeah. Heard it before. The whole joke revolving around the pie incident is down right disgusting.<br/><br/>There's nothing more irritating than watching a movie where there is not one normal face in the crowd. The cast is by no means beautiful, but it just so happens that the actress chosen to strip for the camera isn't exactly an old hag. And why did they even have to do that little stunt? In one word to describe the cast: un-talented. If the writing was supposed to be comical, mission not accomplished. The casting department needs some tips on how to cast actors and not just some twenty somethings that are supposed to be playing high schoolers. <br/><br/>I can't repeat on how the movie lacked comedic writing, but I just can't get over how people actually laughed at this. The writing overall was awful. It was actually funny to think that something like this has an $11 million budget. <br/><br/>What was Universal Pictures thinking when they agreed to make this? At that point, they must have been hanging on by a thread. The idea that a high school boy supposedly has sex with a pie is beyond words. It wasn't funny but very gross. The thought of a guy actually doing that is absurd. I wonder how many boys tried that after they watched this? The whole movie basically revolved around that one thing. You can only stretch it so far.<br/><br/>
Again, this film with little sex jokes and actions slipped in was very disturbing especially when it was allowed to be shown to kids that are waiting to do them. When I had heard about the apple pie, I thought that the film was in serious trouble. But then it got worse when I was able to see a little strip tease. How I wish this scene would have been skipped. I for one didn't particularly appreciate that. I mean it's only fair if they show a guy. Right? Everything else like the parts with Vicky and what's-his-name were also dumb.<br/><br/>It's pretty bad when movies like this are made. All I can say is that lets hope no more teen, bottom of the barrel films will be made. If the makers and industry people are this desperate, save the money for when a decent flick comes along. Why waste the money and the movie goers' time?"

This is a wierd film, when you think about it: a strange mix of There's Something about Mary, Animal House, and Stand by Me that just doesn't sit right, somehow.

This movie is more about going farther with sex humor than before, not about our society getting worse. As society goes on, more and more stuff that was banned in the past is allowed to be aired.

Well, that's not what it is about. Indeed, there is much more to the movie than just four kids wanting to have sex.  There is a story of relationships between friends as well as a big sports theme (lacrosse particularly).  This is not only crude humor, it isn't slap-stick all the time.

This scene gives you a pretty good impression of just how much you will probably laughing through the movie. We then move on to Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) who already has a girlfriend, Vickie (Tara Reid), but have been at the same level of their relationship for quite some time now.  There is also Chris (Chris Klein) who is a Lacrosse player and is too insensitive to maintain any relationship with a girl.  And finally, there is Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) who is the fourth friend and doesn't try to hook up with girls that much.  But when the four guys make a pact to get laid before they graduate, they all become enthusiastic.<br/><br/>
  First time-directors Chris and Paul Weitz do a great job with ""American pie"".  They seem to remember pretty well what their high-school graduation must have been like because the prom scene seems to be recreated in the exact same way it was for them.  They also seemed to know exactly when to cut the comic scenes perfectly so that they don't put too much and turn their jokes into stupid jokes.  Also to be mentioned as supporting actors are Sean W. Scott as Stifler, Natasha Lyonne as Jessica and Eugene Levy as Jim's dad.  It's a great movie with great humor and I highly recommend it."

","American Pie is a pretty good coming of age teen sex comedy, but despite the fact that there was plenty of tasteless humor, it was still a very predictable done-before, and Done better, kind of movie.<br/><br/>It is hard to believe that even with all of the masturbation and sex jokes that the movie got a ""18 years old"" requirement for it's unrated video release.  <br/><br/>After four High school guys get together and make a pact to help each other to lose their virginity, we get to watch and have a fair amount of laughs at their ongoing attempts, which of course culminate at Prom Night.<br/><br/>Pretty fun, with decent performances by the young cast, although it is Shannon Elizabeth really stands out as a very sexy young performer."

"D-Gen-X","10","1","2","1 January 2000"," A Very Satirical Story of Teenage Sexuality
","Like ""There's Something About Mary"", this is one comedy that would make you constantly say ""OH NO!!"" and chuckle really hard.  But this time, it's about 4 teenagers who want to lose their virginity before their high school graduation.<br/><br/>WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD WITH SOME CRUDE SEXUAL LANGUAGE. One the teenagers is Jim, perhaps the main character of the film because we've all seen the VERY PRIVATE side of him.  The guy was a total loser on trying to score on the ""Eastern European"" chick, Nadia.  First he makes a total a** of himself when he ""tries"" to get into a conversation with her at a party, only to laugh like a dork; then he ""tries"" to ""experiment"" with an apple pie, which he successfully does ONLY TO GET CAUGHT BY HIS DAD!!!  I mean my God!!!  What's wrong with this guy??  Is that typical teenage stuff? I doubt it.  Well at least he succeeds into getting Nadia naked in his room, but then (while being broadcasted LIVE on the Internet) he ejaculates not once but twice before she could even get on him!!  <br/><br/>
Oz, the jock, is probably someone we can all relate to.  We all want to accomplish being with the person of our dreams (him joining the jazz choir to score with a cute girl), but then we end up getting dumped (Oz insulting her with the other jocks behind her back) and decided to ""be ourselves"" (Oz REALLY practicing the jazz choir solo for a contest); then perhaps that special someone may come along (her coming back to Oz, and then some [cough] more).  Honest.  <br/><br/>All Kevin and his on-and-off girlfriend did was talk about sex.  Only Kevin starts the conversation (and then some more) and she ""tries"" to refute that.<br/><br/>The best one (and perhaps the funniest) was Finch.  He was a total loser, but then he eventually scores with Stifler's (another jock) mom, whom the guys call a M.I.L.F. (Mother I'd Like to F***).  Finch played this thing really smooth.<br/><br/>There was a lot of realism in the story, considering the fact that it's teenage nature to explore sexuality, but very satirical (and raunchy).  It's funny, fresh, and actually fearless (for filming some of the things that kids below 13 shouldn't see).  A 10!!"

","I heard this movie was really great, so I saw it and was glad I did.  It's not as ""shocking"" nor as ""repulsive"" as I heard from many.  I think this movie accurately portrays a teenager's struggling life and the situations that occur.  All of the characters in this movie are funny, and likeable. The pie scene wasn't too explicit, but the implications were there.  The DVD contains tons of extra so if you like this movie I'd highly recommend it. However, subject matter in this movie isn't exceptable for young kids, but I think 14 and 15 year olds can handle it."

","Four teenage boys vow to lose their virginity by prom night. That's it. No spin, no Dawson's Creek irony and no Shakespearean undertones, which is partly why it works so well. The rest of it is down to a screamingly funny script with brilliant dialogue and hilarious (often gleefully tasteless) situations, but one that also gives us believable characters while also giving us quite a serious message and ultimately being quite touching by the end. All the performances are top notch with Jason Biggs in particular revelling in his character's increasingly outrageous situations from screwing an apple pie while his dad walks to premature ejeculation while the whole school tunes in on the Internet and his '50s styled Dad very well used is nothing short of a creation of comic genius. From beginning to end, this priceless gem scores all hits and no misses, but it's Alyson Hannigan, as the geeky flute player, who with one line, steals the entire film."

","[may contain SPOILERS] Why is it that so many people call this film ""shocking"" or ""crude""? I think it is really funny, well made, an excellent film. No, you will not find any messages about ""racial and/or social injustices"" here; it's not that kind of film. Its message is all about sex, teenage sex, recreational sex, period. Teenagers want sex: is that shocking? Is sex crude? If that's so, then we are all crudely made beings!<br/><br/>I was surprised by the good quality of both the actors and the gags. I expected less, perhaps influenced by the comparisons to ""Porky's"". It is also well directed, the action runs smoothly, the gags are not overdone, and the scenes are cut at the right moments. Too often directors seem to fall in love with the jokes and keep a scene going far beyond the point where it stops being funny. Some jokes here are predictable, but funny nevertheless, e.g. the ""milky"" beer. Others came completely unexpected to me, such as the point where the geek very matter-of-factly declared her innovative use for a flute. I liked the ending too: happy, manicheist, everyone gets laid and the bully sees his mom in sh*tbreak's arms.<br/><br/>There are many characters in the film: the four protagonists, the several girls they are running after, the bully, the dad trying to be helpful, etc. Some of these characters were not developed extensively, there was no time for that, but we get a good sketch of each, like a wiring diagram that shows the interconnections without unnecessary details.<br/><br/>Well, I know that public references to sex were considered crude in some centuries, notably in the late 19th and early 20th.

This movie was about four high school teenagers making a pact to lose their virginity before senior prom. The outcome is pretty surprising too. The reason I say that this movie is so realistic is because it completely relates to teenagers today. Same problems, same way of thinking, etc. 	Some people say that the gross-out humor is what makes the movie bad, but in my opinion, it's what makes the movie fun.

I  remember that in one scene, they were at a party and this one guy, Jim, walked up to the girl that he liked and didn't know what to say so he just started to laugh with the girl and her friends and then walked away.

"ViciousCXY","2","2","8","23 January 2020"," No depth. No story. No point.
","Okay.. where to begin.. I've heard about this movie for a long time and everyone sings it's praises, hailing it as a hilarious teen comedy with heart. I can safely say that this film is the most unfunny, cringy, awkward, uncomfortable movie I've ever watched with the heart of an empty bucket.<br/><br/>The plot: A group of high school boys decide to attempt to lose their virginities before they graduate.. So they're not seen as losers?
See, even this kind of plot (although it's VERY shallow and VERY thin) can be entertaining if written properly. But it isn't. The characters personality traits consist of being a virgin and being absolutely obsessed with sex, and that is all, for every single Male character. There's not a single scene, Not. A. Single. Scene. That doesn't involve a sexual context.<br/><br/>The music: Lots of 90s Pop Punk. All the songs sound the same, might even be the same song honestly, it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest. There's also quite a bit of generic, uninspired background music, yay. We get no interesting sound design, just fart noises, shallow music and ambient sound (hallway footsteps, people talking in the background of a scene, etc).<br/><br/>The Cinematography: Not a single shot in the film with any kind of thought behind it. There's really nothing else to say. You're not going to find a shot that looks as if it has any kind of meaning, and you're not going to find a single shot that has any kind of depth. The colours don't mean anything, the framing doesn't induce any emotion, the composition is tripe. Even High School Musical has black belt level Colour Theory, compared to this shell of a film.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Please.. If you value your time.. AVOID this movie. You won't come out of this with anything other than a strong regret that you didn't watch something else. Ugh."

It's one of those movies that is easy to predict when something bad will happen, but that's what made me laugh so hard.

"johnnyboyz","6","1","3","12 March 2017"," Routine situational-comedy, which seems to want to say something although isn't sure what or how to do it
","The cultural and sexual revolution is referred to as such because it revolutionised, aside from certain other things, attitudes towards culture and sex. Where it hit in the 1960's, among other places, was the United States of America and ""American Pie"" is less-so a commentary on why we-are-what-we -are than it is a reasonably funny depiction of a group of people living their lives in such a fashion BECAUSE of what preceded them. If GK Chesterton once said that ""...there is a certain fury in sex that we cannot afford to inflame, and that a certain mystery and awe must always surround it if we are to remain sane"" then Paul & Chris Weitz's 1999 film should seem like a kind of antithesis to this. <br/><br/>Indeed, I do wonder if the central characters in ""American Pie"" even know of the origins of the world outlooks they each possess. One of them, Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), seems to cut more of an esoteric figure than the others, or perhaps that's just because the others know less of the world than it first seems. Despite his nature, however, not even Finch seems to know why there exists a sudden rush amongst a class of youngsters to lose their virginity before the termination of an American high school year. <br/><br/>Writing in ""Unspeakable Things"", British social commentator Laurie Penny describes sex as 'something you do' - not as something '...you wait around for someone to do TO you', before going on to describe her virginity as something she 'shook off' at the first opportunity she had ‚Äì as if it was an annoying bout of influenza. ""American Pie"" captures this whole ethos somewhat well ‚Äì the notion that abstinence is virtuous, or that sex is something else other than mere recreation, rears up in drips and drabs but not enough to convince us it's what the makers actually think. <br/><br/>""American Pie"" depicts a diverse set of boys: one speaks Latin and drinks expensive coffee. Another, Chris (Chris Klein), is a bulky lacrosse player. Kevin already has a girlfriend; is close to sex anyway and is granted, I think, the deliberate privilege in this regard of being the best looking of the five while Stifler (Seann William-Scott) treads an uneasy line between unfriendly lout and colleague you cannot afford not to have. The last, Jim (Jason Biggs), we sense is some kind of lead ‚Äì his father was, we feel, present when much of the aforementioned cultural revolution unfolded and was amongst the first to break the taboos. His willingness for Jim to follow in his footsteps hits a strange spot between curiously heart rendering and absolutely deplorable. Depending on your politics, of course...<br/><br/>Each of the boys is in their final year at your standard American high-school, but none of them have had sex yet except for Stifler, who seems to want to have it again, although is hindered by this fresh swarm of vultures now surrounding what was once his easy prey. They induce an agreement between them that they will press to lose their virginities before the year is up and a graduation prom takes place. How they go about doing this involves a diverse set of approaches and circumstances, neither really overwhelming the other and each different enough to entertain us reasonably well. <br/><br/>One character eventually only finds what he is looking for when he gives up all hope and accidentally finds it right under his nose ‚Äì a process of maturing enough not to especially fall into a trap of hedonism and rather to take things as they come. Chris only joins a soppy choir group to score one of the many women who sing in it, although is depicted as to actually coming to care for one of the girls there.<br/><br/>Much of the gross out humour involving toilets and the consumption of bodily fluid is unwelcome, but then it always is in these films ‚Äì writers never learn. Fortunately, these instances are rare and one can feel struck ultimately by how reigned in its material actually is. For instance, when the film finally bares a pair of breasts, we feel as if we should flinch because there has not been the cascade of nudity and 'raunch' we were perhaps expecting - the likes of which others in its genre have succumbed to. <br/><br/>Does one really recommend ""American Pie""? Not especially: it is episodic and often quite disgusting, but it is not a film one can easily despise. Is it really a film which, hysterical conservative shrieking aside, really sends young men and women out to 'get laid' as soon as possible? It seems to present sex, or the pursuit of sex, as something frustrating; bumpy and ultimately superfluous to a good, hearty relationship with someone whose time you genuinely enjoy, but it seems nonplussed about people going out to get it anyway. The film is a long way from being a triumph of conservatism, but it does not seem to argue the case for the other side quite as manically as I remember it doing."

","This is one of the best comedy films I have ever seen. The first one beats all the other American Pie movies. The jokes are incredible. I was laughing so much, I thought that I would puke or I would suffer a heart attack from all my laughing. The acting was great. In my opinion, I thought that Jason Biggs and Thomas Ian Nicholas were the best. Jennifer Coolidge had great cameos as Stifler's Mom. The girls were very hot and they got my attention. The script is excellent, the music was just right, and this is a valuable piece for a large movie collection such as mine. I highly recommend this for people between the age of 15-40. Most adults after the age of 40 will think that this movie is horrible and won't be able to understand most jokes. I give this a definite 10/10."

","THIS FILM changed my life!!!!! I come home everyday and throw on American pie and it never fails to make me feel great. In terms of film-making there is nothing to fault, fantastic acting, a hilarious script and inspired direction all add up to the greatest film ever brought down to earth from heaven. It truly is god's gift to serious movie-goers, such as myself, finally a film that does not talk down to individuals. I seriously think this film should be shown on a large screen in any country with social or political unrest and the light hearted comedy would really sort everyone out. I'm watching American pie on my telly as I write this thanking god that I have the absolute pleasure to be alive at the same time as such a masterpiece of film-making. It truly deserved its thirteen Oscar nominations as well as its prestigious ""film of the millennium"" awarded by the UN. Go watch it now and feel yourself grow as a person!!!!!"

","Well Amercian Pie will probably be remembered as the best teen movie of the 90's. This movie introduced the world to Jason Biggs (Jim), Shannon Elizabeth (Nadia, the foreign exchange student), Sean William Scott (Stifler), and Eugene Levy (Jim's Dad). <br/><br/>Eugene Levy is the dad that every son wished he had. Eugene steals every scene he is in and is just so lovable. Jim(Biggs) is like just about every teenage boy, he just wants to get laid, but some of the things he does are unlike every teenage boy, I won't spoil it for those of you that haven't seen it but it's extreme. Stiffler is the instigator of everything and as guys know there's one Stifler in every group of friends. Nadia is the hot foreign exchange student who Jim wants and she is willing to let Jim have her..but is Jim up to the task? At one point they are in a situation, that every teenage boy has imagined himself being in, in Jim's room.<br/><br/>This movie is hilarious and goes to extremes for laughs. John Cho also makes himself known in this film as one of the MILF guys. American Pie is one of the greatest teen comedies ever made."

","American Pie (and the whole trend of high-school comedies it started) can be described best Farrelly bros. comedy for adolescents. A constant barrage of vulgarity and cheap sex-jokes without an actual story to tell. American Pie introduces four desperately horny young men who make a pact. Before their graduation, they have to lose their virginity no matter what! To obtain this goal they're willing to go through all possible forms of public humiliations and mockery. Throughout the whole film, it is exclusively the male teenager who's portrayed as a filthy-minded creature. The girls in American Pie are sensitive, intelligent and generally considered to be the superior species, which is a pretty fresh and satisfying point of view. The films contains a few sequences that are notorious already¬Ösuch as the `bakery-masturbation'-scene and ¬ñ oh yes ¬ñ the magnificent striptease by the gorgeous Shannon Elizabeth¬Ö<br/><br/>
American Pie is lamebrain entertainment in its purest form. The acting is overall good, with some new fresh faces as well as some veteran actors (Eugene Levy steals the show as Jim's dad). The jokes work, the screenplay contains some fun, memorable quotes (`It's not a space shuttle launch, it's SEX') and the creators DO know their classics! Just look at the terrific reference to `The Graduate' near the end of the film. You can easily skip both sequels though¬Ömore from the same, only worse. American Pie became a huge success and one of the biggest box office hits of the late nineties; while modest, intelligent little films from that same period are being catapulted straight into Oblivion. Cinema may not always be fair, but American Pie sure is fun!"

","Characters can make or break a movie, and this goes especially for ""American Pie,"" a rude, crude, and downright raunchy film that would probably be considered one of the worst of the decade if not for the film's obvious love of its characters and their shortcomings and exploits.<br/><br/> Some of the best of all comedies are so simply because they treat their characters with such loving affection - from works of comedy such as ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" to more dark and brooding comedies like ""Fargo."" Without love of characters there is a lack of respect, a film goes nowhere and an audience senses both and disregards it. A film like ""American Pie"" may not be the best of all films but I laughed, not so much at the gags but rather because the characters taking part in the gags seemed pretty darn infectious and sweet. Beneath the crudeness there's a heart - you just may have to dig through some waste to get there.<br/><br/> The film lacks the honesty and realism of teenagers that made John Hughes' 80s films so appealing to audiences - this is more or less a routine sex-and-prom teen comedy - but, like I said, the characters make up for this. It's about four graduating teenagers - Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Stifler (Seann William Scott) - who make a pact to have sex by prom night. Bring the whole family to this one - you'll have a ball!<br/><br/> A pretty immature and borderline basic plot we have that is put to pretty good use through some crazy - though immature - antics. The title of the film is more than just a figure of speech. There's a scene where a foreign exchange student named Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth, not to be confused with Elizabeth Shannon of ""Saturday Night Live"") undresses in the Biggs character's room and *everything* is broadcasted across the Internet. I can't divulge into anything else because I'm writing for family websites. But let me say that if you think ""Austin Powers"" had a mouthful of innuendos, ""American Pie"" has that plus some. (It's sad to think that they had to guarantee an R-rating by inserting nudity and constant language - is the MPAA so ignorant that without nudity a film crammed with sexual innuendo like this would be PG-13?) We also get to learn the meaning of the word, ""MILF.""<br/><br/> I really can't say very much about this movie, or even go into its plot any further. All I can say is that I laughed. I liked the characters. I liked the innocence of blunders; that the characters often do things and humiliate themselves but not on purpose like in some comedies. But what holds me back from giving this a great rating is that the content is a bit too strong even for those 17, which the MPAA finds a suitable age to view this (it makes promiscuity seem all the more nerdy; the characters never consider the after effects of their night of passion). It is a very typical and cliched teen sex comedy, in a way, which holds back my rating a bit. It is a pretty funny film, no doubt, but the basis and outcome are both very typical. It makes one laugh while at the same time wishing Ferris Bueller - an intelligent, resourceful, sneaky teenager whose mind was not cliched and always focused on sex - would return. Where's John Hughes when you need him?<br/><br/> 3.5/5 stars -"

","I saw ""American Pie"" in July '99 when it first came to the theater, something I rarely do anymore with DVD and ""home theater"" at my disposal. Anyway, I remember clearly, when the lights went on at the end a young lady looked around and told her boyfriend, ""Look at all the old people in here."" I was one of ""the old people."" This week my wife and I saw the highly mutilated version, sanitized for TV, and it is only a shadow of the real film.<br/><br/>Simple plot - 4 friends make a pact to lose their virginity before graduation from high school.  That thin thread motivates all the situations that follow. The movie is bad because it depicts ""SEX"" as a somewhat frivolous activity that all boys, and many girls, spend much of their free time thinking about. That's my real gripe about films like this, it cheapens relationships and gives already confused teenagers and young adults more motivation for immoral behavior.<br/><br/>Still, there are a few genuinely funny scenes. My favorite is the extra-powerful laxative that results in the kid going quickly, but into the girls' restroom. The internet video of ""Nadia"" changing and getting sexy in the boy's room. The ""sex talks"" between son and father. The ""contaminated"" beer on the nightstand. Mom and dad coming into his room while we was getting off on watching scrambled porn on TV. <br/><br/>There are a few sweet moments at the end, however the film overall has a very flawed message and in a generous mood I rate it ""4"" of 10."

","I already made my feelings heard about this movie back in April (if you look you will find it among the messages), giving it two stars out of four.

The actors were actually worse then I thought they were, and the ""morals"" at the end were so cheap.  Of course, I still believe that it's unfunny in long stretches and pales in comparison to ""There's Something About Mary""."

","OK, so I'm pushing 30 and I missed the big whoop about American Pie<br/><br/>when it released.  I've just caught it on DVD, expecting to detest it,<br/><br/>but to my amazement, it left me smiling.<br/><br/>American Pie is primarily a morality tale, with the message that good<br/><br/>things (eventually) happen to good people.  This is not at all what I<br/><br/>expected.  People who were scandalised by American Pie should really<br/><br/>take a look at the similarly themed classic Animal House, and ask<br/><br/>themselves which one delivers a more wholesome message.<br/><br/>American Pie is an effective, if slightly heavy handed comedy.  The<br/><br/>scatological humour is unnecessary (and I mean that in a good way),<br/><br/>but is fairly well handled.  The delivery and timing of all the leads<br/><br/>is exemplary, even if most of them look a little long in the tooth to<br/><br/>be high schoolers.<br/><br/>As to the ""gross out"" elements, they are only a little more extreme<br/><br/>than in the crop of 1980's ""bad kids"" films, and are par for the<br/><br/>course for the late 90's ""There's Something About The Dumber Kingpin<br/><br/>Who Shagged Me"" genre pieces.  And looking back to my high school and<br/><br/>college years, it occurs to me that, hey, it was *exactly* like that,<br/><br/>drunken fumbling, body fluid mishaps and all."

","After hearing a bunch of good stuff about this film and then finally seeing it, I was disappointed by it.  The characters are pretty likable, depictions of high school seem pretty down-to-earth, and Jason Bigg's pie scene is the best thing in the whole movie, but there's nothing much else.  It's slow and unfunny in pretty long stretches.  The sentimental material seems to overshadow the fact that it's a ""raunchy sex comedy"".  It still has plenty of gross-out material, but barely any of it makes a big impact on you the way ""There's Something About Mary"" does, and it's not so funny either. ""Mary"" handled sentimental AND gross-out material much better.  It's also sad that, with the exception of Mena Suvari doing ""American Beauty"", none of the main young actors who do a favorable job here (Biggs, Chris Klein, Tara Reid, Seann W. Scott, Thomas Ian Nicholas, and Eddie Kaye Thomas) have done anything good or, in the case of Thomas and Nicholas, anything at all.

","I was so hyped to see this film and when it was over I was completely in shock about how mindless this film was.  I can see why younger audiences might like this film because there's really nothing to compare it to.  As for the 24+ crowd, we've seen this before during the early and mid 80's. I hate to say this, but AMERICAN PIE makes PORKY'S seem like an AFI top 100 film.  At least with the latter, there was more plot to it than just trying to get laid before a certain time period.  I've seen a more developed plot in a haiku than AMERICAN PIE.  And as for the humor, every joke you could see coming from a mile away.  It seemed that filmmakers went to great lengths to set up every one of the jokes, even if that meant compromising the story, or lack of, with contrived elements to make the joke work. Wait ten years and watch this movie again and I'm sure you will have a much different spin on it.<br/><br/>And for those of you who are comparing this to THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY... please don't!  TSAM is such a better film because the humor seems very spontaneous, and the film is made by people who understand how to get a legitimate laugh.  Timing, originality, and the element of surprise are the keys to making a funny movie.  If you know the punchline before the joke is over, how is this funny?"

","Let me start out saying that (at the time of writing) I am an 18 year old American Male which from what I gather would normally be in the target audience. Watching this movie was not by my choice but rather my parents put it on when it was on TV.<br/><br/>There are just so many things wrong with this movie I don't even know where to start. Basically the premise is that these four ""boys"" make a pact to have sex before graduating high school which is already extremely absurd. And the comment about penises unused is just plain nonsense unless they never urinate?<br/><br/>Most of the scenarios are incredibly unlikely and just plain ridiculous. For example the scene where Jim convinced Nadia to change her clothes at his house and she just starts MASTURBATING in his bed. Really?? WHO goes into someones bedroom believing they are just down stairs and does that? Nobody. And what the hell was with the ""Are you ready for a partner?"" portion between Jim and his Dad?? The characters also had no depth or much defining characteristics and in general were just plain unlikeable. It was to the point that I often forgot who was who which is not a good sign for a movie.<br/><br/>Another thing is I did not agree with the message that this movie was displaying. Basically just saying everything is always about sex and that it is all that matters in a relationship. Reinforcing the pressure for people to engage in that type of activity more or less as young as possible. I found the movie disgusting on many accounts because it was just too crude and found it hard to watch within the first 20 minutes. The part early on where Jessica says to Vicky ""It's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex."" is a perfect example of the wrong attitude.<br/><br/>I had very few actual laughs (perhaps three in total) other than laughs of embarrassment rather than actually being funny. It would have been a pure bore if it were not so disturbing.<br/><br/>And the ending was by far the worst. Although in some ways ""Oz"" was admirable for becoming more sensitive and caring but still unlikeable nonetheless. The sex scenes were nothing other than highly unpleasant to watch. And to top it off the part where Kevin(?) and Vicky decided they could not make it ended up making me sad. So at the end of the movie I ended up sad and disgusted from the previous scenes.<br/><br/>Personally I don't want to end up feeling like crap at the end of movies.<br/><br/>So to summarize: If you are looking for something funny or good or even decent. STAY CLEAR of this movie. It is not good.<br/><br/>If you really want to see a ""teen"" oriented movie, at least watch something good like Back to the future.<br/><br/>If you are looking for something funny, there are plenty of other choices that will give real laughs."

","This film tells the story of four teenagers seeking to lose their virginity before the end of high school. Directed by Paul and Chris Weitz, has a script by Adam Herz and has the participation of Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas and other actors.<br/><br/>Sex has long ceased to be a taboo but it's not easy for a parent to discuss this topic with a son or daughter. It's part of life and it happens sooner in our times but there are clear boundaries between a healthy sexuality and a dissolute life. This has always been my personal opinion and I am sure that sex is good since it's lived with awareness, responsibility and maturity. And unfortunately, this message of maturity is totally absent of this film, that seeks to do comedy with immaturity and obsession with sex. For the guys in this movie, fu...ng is what matters, even if with an apple pie! It's the clash between a generation that didn't talk about sex and a generation that only talks and thinks about it, overcoming the barriers of shamelessness and making sexuality an animal obsession and an objective in itself. What saddens me most is to see that our adolescents (both boys and girls) are increasingly look like the characters in this film. Make it a comedy is not funny and doesn't help us to show the error that is to have this mentality. We are creating sexual perverts, and movies like this only contribute and profit from it.<br/><br/>This film is the paradigm of teen film, one of the most stupid and insipid film genres created for the seventh art. Decidedly, the movie industry is able to reward us with masterpieces in the same way that we can throw up on the popcorn. Who have children, keep this film (and all it's sequels and spin-offs) prudently away from their eyes for the sake of their proper sex education.

The main premise of it is just ridiculous: a bunch of insecure teenagers so desperate for others acceptance that they will do anything to lose their virginity. Being popular among a idiots is so important for them that they will disrespect themselves, just so they are part of some pathetic little group.
Why is this so important anyway?
We all need movies with better examples, specially the younger generations.
Real friends don't demand that you lose or virginity (or that you keep it for that matter). In fact, your private life is none of their business and they shouldn't keep asking awkward questions. It's rude, to say the least.
The film is not funny, is sick and disgusting, has a boring ""story"" and perpetuates a lot of prejudices and stupidity. That is not humor, it's cruelty and dementia disguised as comedy to justify such a sick and sadistic story."

","I never watched this film back in the day, I never found the trailers all that funny for it. My fiance told me how funny it was so she pulled it up on Netflix and we began watching it. It had an opening that was sort of amusing, a disgusting scene involving a beer, a completely retarded scene involving a pie and a bunch of losers trying to lose their virginity. Wow, what a concept! Like there has never been a film like that in the 80's or several of them! Suffice to say, by the end, I haven't laughed much at all and my fiance was baffled as to why she found it funny back in the day. <br/><br/>The story, why four guys want to lose their virginity. One of them is a jock who tries to lose it with a college chick, but she doesn't go for it. One has a hot girlfriend who gives him oral and not understanding why he really cares and two are just losers. We get to watch them try different techniques to get girls like joining a jazz choir or having a girl come to your house, but you'd rather send a crappy feed to your friends than try to take advantage of the situation. Seriously, this crap makes that Tom Cruise flick ""Losing It"" seem really great by comparison.<br/><br/>So there isn't much in this film I found funny. The whole pie scene which is kind of this films big laugh scene is completely moronic. Why the hell would someone do what the character did to that pie!?! Like his family isn't going to notice it gone? The beer scene was just gross as all get out and not funny and none of the characters are likable. They are like Friday the 13th victims to me, hence, I would be rooting for Jason to kill them horribly! <br/><br/>So this film was a huge success and made lots of money back in the day. I do not understand why, other than people have very differing taste as to what is funny than I have. The actors in this film all were retched human beings and Eugene Levy as the father was moronic and I usually like Eugene Levy. This would go on to spawn several sequels, but near the end they were pretty much direct to DVD fare as like a lot of comedy franchises it got wore out quick.

It is undeniably funny in some parts and it certainly has its special charm, but the acting and characters aren't that great besides maybe the Stiffmeister and the Sherminator. It was an enjoyable, but also forgettable comedy of the 90's and there are obviously much better comedies out there, like The Forty Year Old Virgin, Superbad, Pineapple Express, There's Something About Mary and even Forgetting Sarah Marshall. I had some good laughs, but overall not that memorable, aside from a few iconic scenes and performances. The film isn't even close to being awful, but it's not great either.

","There's a reason why I don't watch comedies. This is another perfect example.

There was literally nothing I enjoyed about this raunchy comedy. I didn't mind it at all being raunchy (in fact that made it more tolerable), but it was just not funny.<br/><br/>Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs) was a complete idiot and and the over-acting on Seann William Scott's behalf as Steve Stifler was so theatrical and annoying.

","""American Pie"" is already 16 years old by now. How time flies. It was a huge success back then and everybody from younger age groups, mostly teenagers growing-up, had seen it back in the day. Obviously, with time, it has lost a lot of significance, but it was maybe the 1999 film that reflected society the best back then. It has not aged as a classic or must-see comedy by any means, but these 95 minutes are certainly worth the watch. There are some really funny scenes in there, the beginning when Biggs' character gets caught masturbating by his parents, basically every scene that has Eugene Levy or Alyson Hannigan, Stifler or Stifler's mom, the pie scene... There were definitely also many scenes that weren't really that interesting, which is why I cannot give this film a higher rating. It is certainly not funny from start to finish, but during its best moments, it is extremely funny I think.<br/><br/>This was directed by brothers Paul and Chris Weitz before they became Oscar nominees. The writer is Adam Herz and he has basically written almost nothing outside the ""American Pie"" franchise. The cast includes a handful actors that are still known today, but no real superstars. The most known is probably Alyson Hannigan, an actress I like quite a lot and when this film here was made, she was already quite a star thanks to ""Buffy"". Back to ""American Pie"", this film is probably at its worst when it tries really hard to be also dramatically relevant in terms of relationships and sex between young males and females. It's not really working. But the comedy makes up for it on many occasions and makes this probably one of the most known comedies of the 1990s. Still today, almost everybody over the age of 20 has heard about ""American Pie"". You could maybe say that it was a defining film for a generation back then. Still, it's not a masterpiece or a classic, but definitely worth the watch if you are looking for a light goofball comedy. I recommend it. And if you like it, you can check out some of the sequels too if you're in the mood."

","The first American Pie is a teenage comedy on the top movie list in 1999, but it's not the best of the seven American Pie series. For me, I preferred the second one, as everyone was more relaxed and knew each other, making the movie better. Don't get me wrong, this one certainly had it's funny moments, but in my estimation it wasn't as good as the second one. American Pie is a classic teen comedy about sex and it inspired a new era in comedy that's still relevant today. It has the crazy and good looking youth we see in today's comedy, but unfortunately also has some really lame jokes and bad acting, that thankful went out with the nineties.If you hadn't seen this movie yet you should see it right now. I'm not convincing you guys to watch it if you don't like teen movies but its classic of this kind of comedy. This might look little bit weird because its like a ""Weird comedy"".Actually, they aren't weird at all it's very hard to create comedy like this and make a movie like this. But I hardly recommend this movie if you are looking for different kind of comedy something opposite from teens movie like good rated movie with good well known actor and a good storyline or a family comedy because it would be pretty weird watching movies with your children or with your parent. This movie is way different about teenagers life, and their jokes. I could say this was one of the best of this kind of comedy i have ever seen. if someone asks for a comedy movie, i always told them to watch American pie. This movie would be best if you're looking for something really easy and very hilarious to watch as I said already."

","The quintessential teen sex comedy that surfaced on the silver screen at the turn of the new millennium and went on to spawn a franchise consisting of numerous sequels & a direct-to- DVD spin-off series while also influencing pop culture, American Pie is a delightful, hilarious & harmless comedy that does exactly what's expected from it... and then some more.<br/><br/>American Pie tells the story of four high-school seniors who decide to make a pact to lose their virginity before they graduate and attempt to achieve their goal of getting laid by prom night. The plot follows their adventures as almost all of them run into embarrassing but also hilarious situations at one time or another and find the pressure mounting as the prom night approaches.<br/><br/>Directed by Chris & Paul Weitz, American Pie features a shallow plot line & weak characters and yet it manages to be a smooth ride for the most part that never takes itself seriously & simply swims with the tide. The humour is crude, the laughs are plenty, the film is aware of its limitations and tries to have fun with what it has, and the cast does well with their given roles plus their chemistry clicks.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, American Pie remains an endlessly enjoyable, thoroughly entertaining & surprisingly good piece of genre filmmaking that still brims with freshness, packs a massive dose of nostalgia, and exhibits a lot of charm over the course of its runtime. Not everything works out in its favour & a couple of moments may have lost its potency over the years but American Pie still works because its heart is at the right place."

","Many times I have heard positive feedback from my friends about this movie , but somehow it did not have time to see and even begrudgingly .

Each of the main characters I easily recognized himself and his friends. For this movie is a huge plus .<br/><br/>The humor of the film at the highest level, the mass is very funny and amusing moments.<br/><br/>Also worth noting is the incredible acting. Actors chosen perfectly. Hard to imagine that the role of Jim decides someone better Jason Biggs - relaxed and calm in dealing with friends, it is closed in conversations with girls. An excellent job with their roles , Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas and Eddie Kaye Thomas . But a separate credit goes to Seann William Scott , who gave the film a whole new mood.<br/><br/>Many may think that the AP has attracted only by his vulgar jokes , but this is not the case.

","American Pie (1999) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Four high school seniors make an agreement that they're going to have each others back so that they can lose their virginity before prom night. That's pretty much all the storyline one needs to know and I still remember when this movie came out people said it was just riding on the coat tails of ""gross-out"" comedies like THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY but looking back on the film after all these years there's no denying that it's really one of the best comedies to come from that era. I think the film works best as a throwback to those teen sex comedies of the 1980s like PORKY'S and FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH. The movie benefits from some gross out humor but a film needs more than just that and what's at the core of this movie are some wonderful performances and a realistic story about friendships in high school. With that said, no one should be expecting some heart-warming moments because there really aren't any and that's a good thing. Instead we just have one outrageous set-up after another and yes the majority of them are in the vulgar manor. This includes having your parents catching you masturbating, streaming yourself and a girl via the web and of course the infamous pie sequence. One could be party a killer and say most of this would have been avoided had the character just learned to lock a door but that would just take away the fun. The movie goes for a lot of jokes but the thing is that most of them work. I'd say the only one that doesn't is a sequence involving a toilet but this is just a small portion of the film. Another major benefit is that the cast members are so good with each of them really making their character something memorable. Jason Biggs, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Chris Klein, Seann William Scott, Tara Reid, Alyson Hannigan and Shannon Elizabeth are all extremely good and help make the film. Eugene Levy also deserves a lot of credits because his reaction shots are some of the funniest bits in the movie. American PIE was obviously influenced by certain movies but it's never a rip-off and instead it just delivers a great, if at times disgusting, time."

","First of all I have to say I really laughed in the scene that Jim said angrily ""I hate sex!! I've never done this I already hate it"" or something like that.<br/><br/>In the first 20 minutes, I was ready to give it a bad review. American Pie began too silly and seemed to be a movie for pre-teenagers. But after the web camera scene, it began being funny and entertaining. You know, putting funny jokes much after the beginning makes the spectator loses the interest for the film, the writers here were really brave to do that (and fortunately, it worked). It deals with many of the youth issues, such as insecurity, inexperience, curiosity and growing up. The end of the movie is mind blowing; they really made it in a way to satisfy the spectator (and me as well, of course).<br/><br/>Also, Jason Biggs proves to be a real actor that deserves the attention he had in here. I just watched this film and right after I went to youtube to see his interviews. He is really very different from Jim, which shows he can act and leave the comfortable zone with talent. American Pie is a legitimate classic that everyone should give a try."
"KevinB12","8","0","2","12 November 2010"," Great movie, but why not make another American Pie without foul language
","This movie is sexy and provocative, especially for Shannon Elizabeth getting on to Jason Biggs. Although sexuality and nudity are okay, but I do not think foul language is a good idea because what I saw the South Park movie is that those South Park kids should not see this foul language Terrence and Phillip movie. The reason I assure you that foul language is wrongfully uncalled which is my suggestion not to have that in other American Pie movies. Parents should not use foul language on their kids because it is wrongfully uncalled. I think foul language should be forbidden in future American Pie movies because as what Sheila Blofowsky would say ""Because it is evil!"""

","It is one of the most beloved comedies of the last decade, seemingly revered by all members of Generations X and Y; the first of a series that supposedly includes no less than three inferior sequels; AND the popularizer (if not the originator) of the term ""MILF."" It also jump-started the careers of actresses Shannon Elizabeth, Alyson Hannigan, Tara Reid and Mena Suvari. So I thought it was high time that this baby boomer finally caught up with 1999's ""American Pie,"" and you know what...this film really is some funny stuff, and had me--a hard person to make laugh out loud--laughing out loud any number of times. The film's plot, about four soon-to-be-graduating high school guys (Jim, Oz, Kevin and Finch) in pursuit of the Holy Grail (i.e., losing their virginity by the night of the senior prom), may seem like a familiar one, but it is fleshed out with likable and amusing characters and benefits immensely by a brightly clever script. Among the funny scenes are any that include Eugene Levy as Jim's embarrassingly decent, well-meaning father from hell (the scene with the dirty magazines is a riot!); the plight of poor Finch in the ladies' rest room; the initial making of the boys' pact; and, of course, any bit with ""the Shermanator,"" the most hilarious would-be (nerd) Lothario until ""Superbad""'s McLovin' came down the pike eight years later. The film has a raunchy exterior and a sweet soul, and ultimately gives its audience the mixed message that sex is always better when it is combined with true love.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","0","1","14 July 2008"," ""American Pie"" stands out despite what it might stand for
","""American Pie"" should be better known to the world as ""the comedy that launched 1,000 terrible movies."" This is the film that slapped a sticker on the genre ""Teen Comedy"" and convinced movie producers everywhere that the way to attract the overpaying audience of teenagers is to give them movies focused around sex and sex jokes. While ""American Pie"" certainly deserves that rep, lost in it all is what makes ""American Pie"" better than all those movies (including those of the same name that followed it). This is a comedy that despite glorifying teenage sex, has an sense of genuineness that anyone who has graduated high school can't deny and that's what makes it stand out.<br/><br/>The film follows four friends who make a pact to help each other lose their virginity by prom night. Nice, simple and vulgar. What makes the comedy tick is that these friends are all different and attached to teenage stereotypes. Naturally, they find themselves in situations with women that come into conflict with these stereotypes or make for comedic opposites. This is a character-focused gag comedy. It's not slapstick, but all about gags making you empathize even more with these characters. While it's all very formulaic, it works somehow. You laugh and yet you have some vested interest in what becomes of the characters.<br/><br/>Credit to writer Adam Herz for creating such memorable characters, though the actors themselves are half the success. Director Paul Weitz knows when the script is at its strongest and helps get these young actors to make some believable stuff despite their insensitive hijinx. Somehow, he gets a believable performance out of Chris Klein, for example, who plays Oz, the jock who decides to ""extend himself."" Normally he'd seem like a junky character, but his unlikely relationship with Mena Suvari's character works despite just an OK script.<br/><br/>Most importantly, it must be stated that this film kind of operates with the liberal mindset of those who understand teenage sex happens so you might as well make it into something funny. To its credit, the film does address issues of safe sex and being in love and having sex, but that's not to say the film addresses moral issues, because quite frankly, it doesn't hold them with high regard.<br/><br/>So as much as I want to hate ""American Pie"" for all the stereotypes and formula work, there is a lot of strong work being done with this film. It has terrific characters and most importantly a sense of being true to real life--though only the real life of one who accepts teenage sex as part of real life. The fact that Weitz was able to get these great performances out of a bunch of 19 and 20-year-olds is really impressive. So despite all the ridiculous gags and unnecessary jokes and bad movies the followed, ""American Pie"" really does work on a higher level and deserves to recognized for its contribution to pop culture (The term MILF has transformed the porn industry) and the comedy genre."

","Fed up with their lack of success with the opposite sex, four teenage boys make a pact to lose their virginity before leaving high-school.<br/><br/>In 1999, the teen sex comedy¬óa genre that had last flourished in the early to mid-80s¬óreturned with a vengeance when American Pie became a runaway success at the box office. Directed by newcomer Paul Weitz, and featuring an almost unknown (at the time) cast, the film had 'em rolling in the aisles thanks to its no-holds-barred, gross-out humour. Masturbation; oral sex; premature ejaculation; diarrhoea; intercourse with baked goods; the accidental ingestion of baby gravy: nothing was considered off-limits to these guys if it had the potential for hilarity.<br/><br/>However, what made American Pie particularly special was that, despite the fact that the film's humour consisted primarily of wall-to-wall vulgarity, it also managed to be kinda sweet in the process. The main characters, a group of likable high-school geeks who are faced with the seemingly insurmountable task of getting laid, are not presented as vacuous ass-holes with one-track minds, but rather as young adults who are simply coming to terms with the responsibilities and pressures of adulthood: something that most people have to deal with at some point in their lives.<br/><br/>Of course, from a bloke's point of view, it doesn't hurt that the film also features some rather gorgeous women: Tara Reid is oh-so pretty; Mena Suvari is doe-eyed and innocent; Shannon Elizabeth is smoking hot (and nekkid!); and Alyson Hannigan is there for all of those who dig nerdy chicks.

Clever, original, laugh out loud funny to a point you hate to see this great comedy end. Comedies are the most difficult of genre to do really well, but this one hits the mark.

It would have been easy to make a total fiasco out of such a movie, but this movie is well balanced and well made. The characters are likable and the acting good. Some of the gags are original, and I like the style of humour. It deals with teenage sexuality without overstepping the line for vulgarity and without being embarrassing. Another reason I liked it - and the reason for taping it - is that I hope it can break the barrier when it's my turn as a father to explain certain facts of life to my children in a few years. The movie shows teenagers that it's normal for everybody to be shy and awkward when first encountering love and sex, and that those who are bragging all over the place do it to project a false image. The movie shows what works and what doesn't work when looking for a girlfriend, and that certain pranks that go over the line can have serious consequences. It also shows teenagers that they are not weirdos if they have sexual desires or fantasies. That said, not everybody will like it. Certain will find the humour too gross. Others will find it too puerile."

","Here Are Some Facts...<br/><br/>American Pie is a 1999 teen comedy film directed by Paul Weitz and Chris Weitz and written by Adam Herz. This was the first film directed by the Weitz brothers. The movie is centred on four boys who make a pact to lose their virginity by their high school graduation, and their subsequent adventures. The title refers to a scene in the film in which the lead character is caught having sex with a pie¬óearlier he was told that ""third base"" feels ""like warm apple pie"". It was a box-office hit and spawned two direct sequels: American Pie 2 in 2001, American Wedding in 2003. Singer Don McLean was credited for allowing the name of his hit song to be used as the title.<br/><br/>This film ranked number 49 on Bravo's ""100 Funniest Movies"", and ranked number 32 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the 50 Best High School Movies. In 2000, readers of Total Film magazine voted American Pie the 6th greatest comedy film of all time.<br/><br/>Since the conclusion of the American Pie trilogy, featuring the courtship and marriage of Jim Levenstein and Michelle Flaherty, the American Pie name has gone on to be used as an entity similar to National Lampoon. The American Pie entity has spawned three spin-off films: American Pie Presents: Band Camp, which was a direct to video release in 2005, and American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile was released on DVD in December 2006. The next film, American Pie Presents: Beta House will be released in 2007."

","American Pie (1999, Dir. Paul Weitz) <br/><br/>Jim, Oz, Finch and Kevin are four friends who make a pact that before they graduate they will all lose their virginity. The hard job now is how to reach that goal by prom night. Whilst Oz begins singing to grab attention and Kevin tries to persuade his girlfriend, Finch tries any easy route of spreading rumours and Jim fails miserably. Whether it is being caught on top of a pie or on the Internet, Jim always end up with his trusty sex advice from his father. Will they achieve their goal of getting laid by prom night? or will they learn something much different.<br/><br/>Before 'American Pie' was released, the amount of sex comedies for teens was very small. Now, American Pie isn't just a breakthrough comedy for its many young stars, but also a breakthrough for sex comedies. The characters are so lovable and really make you feel connected to them. The casting choices were spot on. No other actors could possibly be imagined playing the characters. Everyone can relate to the characters in some way. There are some great lines in the film, especially from Eugene Levy, who is the best character of the series. There are some great gags which can look repulsive too. It's a fantastic comedy to watch, but not really the type of film to watch with parents. Only if they know what goes on in a teens life.<br/><br/>""Tell me he did not just get out the chair."" - Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) ""He got out the chair."" - Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas)"

OK in some bits it is crude but this is aimed at a teen audience so teens do not really care if something is crude because it is normal in their lives. The characters and actors are alike in ways and the directors really worked hard with them to get the audience a real experience of teen life.Basically you have gotta group of teens who all want to get laid on prom night.

","A classic in its own right, American Pie is a hilarious sex comedy that is mostly true to life. While all of the sequels are much better than the first installment, the first one is not to be missed because it started it all. The casting is amazing, ...(read more)because without Alyson Hannigan, Jason Biggs, and Sean William Scott, the movie would not be anywhere near as good. The writing and the characters really draw you in, and things are real to life while also cleverly mocking teenagers and their way of thinking. The plot is highly original for when it was made--by now it has been copied and mocked numerous times. The movie is so easy to like, and, as stated before, all of the sequels are better than the first one. See this before this others because it's not disappointing in the least."

","It certainly has a lot to answer for. The various duplicates Hollywood managed to fart out in it's wake - some pretty good (Orange County) most excremental (Van Wilder) - might force even the most easily tickled specimen to rethink American Pie's worth. I can safely assume most of them would still think it one of the best gross-out comedies ever. It it probably always will be that sub-genre's Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>Whereas the likes of Animal House and Fast Times At Ridgemount High were more of an amusing observation of various deadbeats and juveniles, American Pie manages to find heart in it's characters. I still love John Belushi's impression of a zit, don't get me wrong. But I think American Pie's compassion is what gives the cake it's icing - that and Eugene Levy (I wish he was my dad :D). Jim (Jason Biggs)'s attempted conquest of foreign exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) is certainly cringe-worthy but never crass. We like Jim. We want him to succeed. He's definitely somewhat of a dumbo, but not a complete fool. And for once the female characters have a healthy balance of sexual attitude, which in the past was mostly about guys trying to catch them changing.<br/><br/>Don't get it twisted. This is a rude and crude comedy, with some great gags and a few stock characters that we didn't need. Some of the films worst moments involve Chris ""make a table out of me now"" Klein attempting to shed his jock image to reveal his sensitive side, which apparently involves joining the choir and then singing and dancing in the male showers. For all the gross gags in the film, this was certainly the most vomit-inducing. But apart from that there isn't much to complain about.<br/><br/>Easily offended? Probably not for you. For the rest of us though, this is unadulterated hilarity, with a side order of sweet."

","Capitalizing on ""There's Something About Mary""'s success, ""American Pie"" has some Michigan high school students trying to lose their virginity. The most famous scene of course involves a certain pastry, but there are plenty of other gross-out scenes (namely the beer). Really the best character in the movie is Eugene Levy as the kindly dad who's always willing to talk about sex and everything related thereto. I haven't seen any of the sequels, and it seems that most of the unknown cast members haven't done anything of particularly high quality since this movie came out (although Shannon Elizabeth and Jason Biggs both had great roles in ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back""). All in all, this movie is ridiculous, but pretty funny. On the subject of anything, would that one scene with Shannon Elizabeth - you know which one I mean - count as one of the famous sex-drive-inducing scenes in movie history?"

","Out of all the teenage comedies we were bombarded with the last couple of years, this one is by far the best. The comedy is cruel and perhaps predictable but the execution of it is perfect, thanks to the actors and the characters they portray and some excellent spot-on timing.<br/><br/>Really what makes ""American Pie"" superior to other teenage comedies are the characters. There are lots of characters in the movie and all are well constructed, crazy in their own way and simply fun to watch. On top of that their dialog is very good and highly realistic and believable. Although I normally hate it when some teenagers are being played by some twenty year old, I had in this case no problems with it, simply because all of the actors fitted their roles like a glove. I especially liked Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott. But best role of the movie was played by Eugene Levy as Jim's dad. Quite honestly one of the best and most hilarious movie dads ever created!<br/><br/>Most of the jokes and dialog are cruel and is mostly about only sex and poop but it works surprisingly hilarious, with as a result some hilarious classic comedy moments. Of course the apple pie sequences has already become a bit of a classic but I even liked the whole web-cam strip sequences with Jason Biggs and Shannon Elizabeth even better. Yes, I even liked the poop humor with Eddie Kaye Thomas as Finch in the movie. There are truly some hilarious sequences in the movie that are perhaps at first sight a bit lame and predictable but all perfectly timed and performed by the actors. Poop- and sex humor just doesn't get any better than this!

","In my opinion, this is a good movie with raunchy content. One thing I hated most was the nudity, especially when Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) was pleasuring herself on Jim's (Jason Biggs) bed. The reason I found this was because she had no top on. In my opinion, this movie had very funny humor, even though it was vulgar at times. Another raunchy part was when Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) was in the toilet. The thing I liked most was the prom. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""If I ever have kids of my own, I'm not going to let them see this movie until they're grown up.""

","OK first things first. When I watched American Pie for the first time I didn't expect much at all... from what I'd heard it was a pretty dumb ""gross-out"" comedy that was every 15 year-old boy's favourite film but was highly over-rated. I was right in some ways.... some of the humour is a bit silly and predictable, and there is no doubt it was over-rated - this film is no classic. However, I found it surprisingly enjoyable. Most of the humour was actually really funny, and I found myself laughing a fair bit while watching the film (that hasn't happened since Team America ;) ). The film does get a bit sappy towards the end when it tries to push a few predictable messages about love, but it still carries through to the end well on the strength of the characters. Jim is lovable and sad at the same time, his Dad draws laughs every time he appears on screen, Stifler, Finch, Sherman and of course Michelle are great characters as well. However I found Oz and Kevin, and their respective girlfriends, rather annoying. American Pie is by no means a great movie, but I feel that it did well for what it was trying to achieve. I recommend that you give it a try some time, no matter what you've heard, its actually a decent film."

I didn't split my sides like I did the first time but that's often the case when you have high expectations. Yes much of the jokes are gross out, but not to the extent of the films that followed that really have taken it too far.

Jim is hopeless with women, Oz has joined the choir, Finch is a loser and Kevin's girlfriend Vicki (Tara Reid) doesn't want sex.

"hall895","7","0","1","1 September 2005"," A mostly satisfying slice of pie
","OK, so it's not The Godfather or Gone With The Wind. It is what it is, and what it is isn't that bad at all. American Pie is a silly farce and if you're willing to turn off your brain for a couple of hours and just go with it you may well find it rather enjoyable. If you're looking for a ""serious"" movie with some deeper meaning, well then you've obviously come to the wrong place.<br/><br/>The story, such at it is, revolves around a group of male high school seniors desperate to lose their virginity before graduation. But the story's not really the point, it seems as if the story's just there as something to fill space between gags and jokes. And there are plenty of gags and jokes, many tasteless, mostly funny. But even as we race from one joke to the next there is time to get to know a widely disparate cast of characters. Jason Biggs plays the central character of Jim, a mostly hapless type who finds himself on the wrong end of most of the jokes and gags. There's Chris Klein as the athlete, Eddie Kaye Thomas as the eccentric and Thomas Ian Nicholas as the seemingly normal one of the group. Outside the main circle of friends is the outlandish Stifler, played with perverse glee by Seann William Scott. Of course there are also the girls our boys are chasing. Tara Reid, Mena Suvari and Natasha Lyonne wander through but the two standouts are Shannon Elizabeth as foreign exchange student Nadia and Alyson Hannigan as geeky Michelle, two characters who will have a few surprises for the boys chasing after them. Also of note is Eugene Levy as Jim's dad. It's the only real adult role of any significance in the film and Levy brings his typical comic genius touch to the part.<br/><br/>Anyone can do a teenage raunchfest but American Pie is something more. It's a raunchfest with heart if that's at all possible. We get to know and sympathize with these characters and watch them evolve over time. But we also get quite a few laughs at their expense along the way. Certainly American Pie will not go down in the annals of history as an all-time classic. But it's a funny, enjoyable, satisfying experience."

I also enjoyed how the film ended with Vicky becoming more independent and practical when she realised it wasn't going to work with Kevin - strong woman! It was also good how Oz remains a virgin, proving that this wasn't just about guys getting laid - there were also tender emotions and heart-felt feelings in there.

","American Pie is one of the many great films of the 90's. It goes into the minds of high school teens and shows whats really goes on. With its awkward funny moments and lovable characters this is a must see. You can relate all the characters to you and your buddies back in High School. Although it has a very loose plot it makes up for it with its hilarious scenes of what guys think sex should be and how much they want it. I kept wanting more and it kept delivering more great humor. It also includes a good romance scene or two. I recommend this for anyone who likes their humor with some nudity and perverted actions. On the other hand it has some cheezy jokes and some bad displays of acting. Its almost hard to notice the mistakes in this film because you are trying to maintain control of yourself as your cracking up. Jason Biggs delivers a great performance as Jim Levetstein, the nervous guy who isn't so lucky with girls.

","Aside from being an extremely funny movie, the friendship dynamic shown by the four main characters made this movie. Although #2 may have been funnier, the story line was much better. Sean William Scott as ""Stifler"" was by far the most humorous in the film, and should have had more face time. His facial expressions, tone and lines were all hilarious. He played the dumb jock/player perfectly. This was one of the best characters I have ever seen in any film. All four main characters were very good in their roles. Eddie Kaye Thomas as ""Finch"" was another great character. The dynamic between him and Stifler throughout the film were extremely entertaining. ""Oz"" was the most suave of the four, but lacked in the comedy department. Eugene Levy played the awkward dad very well. Although ""Kevin"" was somewhat annoying at times, his final scene with Tara Reid added just about the only drama element, and anyone who has had their heart broken can empathize with him. This film will become the next ""Animal House"" and be a required college flick."

","Before this film the successful teen movies were from John Hughes (Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Breakfast Club), and then they got crude and gross in Porky's and National Lampoon's Animal House, this was a much needed return to the genre that combined all the elements into a modern box office hit, from director Paul Weitz (About a Boy). Basically in East Great Falls, Michigan, four high school friend, awkward and sexually naive Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs), lacrosse team player and assumed jock Chris 'Oz' Ostreicher (Chris Klein), confident student Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and sophisticate Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) all share something in common, they are all virgins. At the party of swearing and sex-obsessed Steve 'Stifmeister' Stifler (Seann William Scott), geek Chuck 'The Sherminator' Sherman claims to have lost his virginity, so the four friends make a pact that they will lose their virginity (consensually) before they graduate high school, and the prom is the last opportunity to do it. Kevin tries to convince his sweet girlfriend Victoria 'Vicky' Lathum (Tara Reid) that they have been together long enough to take the next step, but she sometimes wonders if he is just with her for sex, and gets advice from knowledgeable Jessica (Natasha Lyonne). Oz joins the jazz singing choir to find a girlfriend, and he gets the attention of Heather (Mena Suvari), she does find out his reputation, but he wins her back, especially when he leaves an important lacrosse game for a choir competition, and specifically for her. Jim gets embarrassing advice from his Dad (Eugene Levy), masturbates a apple pie (he was told third base was like ""warm apple pie""), and he attempts to get with Czechoslovakian foreign exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), and he puts his attempt on web cam for the whole school to see, as he prematurely ejaculates twice. Finch meanwhile does not seem to be making many attempts to find a girlfriend, he is found out to have paid Jessica to spread rumours about his sexual reputation and get a date for the prom, but Stifler has revenge putting laxative in his drink, leading him into the girls' bathroom, and come out humiliated and dateless. At the prom Kevin and Oz have their dates, Jim was forced to ask flute playing band geek Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan) as his date - she also apparently hadn't seen the internet video, and Finch is alone, the pact may be dwindling, until they overhear that Sherman lied about losing his virginity, taking pressure off the boys. It is at Stifler's post-party can fulfil their pledge, Kevin and Vicky in the upstairs bedroom, who afterwards break up because of college differences; Oz and Heather in the dock house, after he confessed the pact and realised his true feelings; Jim and Michelle in the young Stifler brother's bedroom, Michelle confessing she did see the video and is surprisingly aggressive; and Finch alone strays into the basement and meets Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge), she is attracted to him and they have sex on the pool table. Jim, Oz, Kevin and Finch have breakfast together the next morning and are all happy that they fulfilled the pact, and they toast to ""the next step"", and it ends with Jim dancing on web cam for Nadia, with Jim's Dad peaking and walking away dancing embarrassingly. Also starring Molly Cheek as Jim's Mom, Lawrence Pressman as Coach Marshall, ""AM To PM"" singer Christina Milian as Band Member, Justin Isfeld as Justin - 'MILF' Guy #1, John Cho as John - 'MILF' Guy #2, Eli Marienthal as Matt Stifler and Casey Affleck as Tom Myers. The cast of young adults are all suited to their parts, Biggs as the likable fool, Klein as the jock wanting to change, Nicholas as the wannabe nice guy, Thomas as the slightly weird Corinthian, Scott as the obnoxious foul-mouthed womaniser, and Levy as the embarrassing father. The film is full of just right balance of stereotyping, and it invented and popularised the term MILF (Mum I'd Like to F***), the characters all have their own great qualities, the story is one you can easily follow, and the slapstick and dialogue jokes all work fantastically, it is certainly one of the best teen movies ever made, a must see comedy. It was number 10 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments for the Internet broadcast, and it was number 7 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!"

Simply because this film quite accurately depicts the life and behaviors of (perhaps ALL) teenagers.<br/><br/>I recently read a comment made about this film (a negative one) and i found myself developing the image of an insecure 35 year old who had no fun at high school, irregardless of this, how can someone be watching ""American Pie"" for the first time in 2002...American Pie 2 was already released then...Behind the times, yes, perhaps.<br/><br/>Overall to come onto IMDb and write a review of what IS a ""CLASSIC"" and the ""STANDARD"" for any teen movie to this date is just quite funny actually, i have met many types of people with all kinds of personalities and not heard one thing wrong or negative about this film.I do not believe in comparing one teen movie to another because each are their own films, with their own plots/sub-plots, one liners etc etc.But in order to accurately draw up some sort of conclusion and/or list of titles in order of the better, then this must be done AND as much as i love the ""PIE"" Series of films i have many other favorites that in my opinion don't add up to feel as fresh and funny as the ""PIE's"" but FUNNY they very much are.<br/><br/>If you watch this movie and feel totally disgusted/disappointed/bored/sick/revolted/annoyed even, well think of this, MAYBE it's something to do with YOU and your personality, remember this IS entertainment, NOT REAL LIFE! If it were it would be totally boring.<br/><br/>A lot of people (Peeete from UK for one) say the creators were being dishonest etc about the story and it's world far from reality!? What did you do with your friends at school? i agree there is a lack of real behaviors i.e bullying etc but if you take time to hear what the film-makers have to say you will realize you are out of your own depth, Adam Herz clearly states in the ""making of..."" that his school-life and friends had an ""OMAGE"" feel to it....The point i am making is MY SCHOOL felt like this....Yes some people hate each other BUT it's cast away in the shadows when you bring to light the ""togetherness"" feel everyone has.American Pie : Stifler is the (somewhat more verbal less physical) bully.It's all there for your ""real world"" eyes to see but when you directly compare this Flick to your actual life then YOU ARE OF COURSE GOING TO BE Disappointed! Comdeies are made for laughs, i laughed, a lot, therefore this is a pretty damn good comedy, i just wish that in the real-world where we all live more people could just let themselves go when watching a film of this genre, instead of getting all worked up over a movie about a dude who screws a pie :) ********* out of **********<br/><br/>9 out of 10 because life just isn't perfect!"

I guess we do have to give the movie credit, it does feature high schoolers who are still virgins, something that few movies still acknowledge. Jason Biggs plays Jim, a confused teenager who does not quite play the whole social scene perfectly, but is an overall nice guy. His friends are Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thoman Ian Nicholas), and Paul (Eddie Kaye Thomas), with a passing acquaintance with Stifler (Seann William Scott, in the role that made him). Stifler is that jock in high school that it was an honor to have him know your name. As prom day approaches, the stresses of the senior days of high school get to all of the friends and the comedy takes off from there. The movie does have a fresh look at how teens today deal with life, and does have crude comedy that is unthinkable, but you know what, I'm sure somewhere it happened to someone. Eugene Levy plays the father in a perfect role for him, he covers the uncomfortable parts of raising a growing boy well. American Pie is a funny movie about 4 boys trying to have sex, and if that sounds like entertainment to you, go see it already!"

"Sinclair_Mikael","10","0","1","21 January 2005"," Steve Stifler is the franchise!
","American Pie is a classic coming of age story about four boys who can't stand the idea of graduating high school as virgins. This movie contains a lot of crude sexual humour that is obviously not suitable for young children but it may come across the wrong way to certain non-open-minded adults. As most movies have sex scenes these days, this movie actually contains two oral sex scenes (although obviously no sensitive body parts are shown: no worries for the littluns, but why would they be watching anyway)?<br/><br/>The film is low-budget, but the story flows well and the characters are down to earth (and so damn funny!) Seann William Scott is absolutely head-over-heals hilarious as the obnoxious Steve Stifler. If you own the DVD or VHS, you may want to rewind and view some of these priceless Stifler scenes over and over again:<br/><br/>1.) Stifler asks if the boys are coming to his party.<br/><br/>2.) Stifler greets Vicky, Jessica and Sherman at the party.<br/><br/>3.) Stifler comments on Oz' failed attempt to hook up with a college <br/><br/>girl (party).<br/><br/>4.) Stifler has some pale ale (party).<br/><br/>5.) Nadiavision (the monkey adds to this one).<br/><br/>6.) Oz practising his duet in the showers after lacrosse and Stifler's response.<br/><br/>7.) Stifler's revenge on Finch (Finch in the can).<br/><br/>There are more, but those are all I can remember.<br/><br/>Eugene Levy plays Jim's ""open about sex"" father. I felt that his embarrassing discussions with Jim were not funny to say the least (though they were intended to be), but some people liked them.<br/><br/>Tara Reid is her usual ""hot"" self in this movie, and Natasha Lyonne looks good as well.<br/><br/>The acting is not as horrible as people say. Chris Klein's (Oz) lines seemed a little forced in some places, but he made up for them with some of his other scenes.<br/><br/>This movie can be watched over and over again and enjoyed as much as the very first time. If you enjoy sexual humour (which most of us do: some won't admit it though), this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>This movie was followed up by two sequels that I'm sorry to say were not very good, but they are worth watching just to see what Stifler will do or say next.<br/><br/>The unrated DVD of American Pie has a crapload of bonus features, so as Ferris Bueller would say:<br/><br/>""If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up!"""

"michaelgrantham","Null","0","1","22 July 2004"," Great Movie, very funny sex comedy
","I first saw this film when I was away from home staying alone in a hotel and decided to go the cinema for something to do.  It was a 3 screen cinema and when I got to the desk they asked me what I wanted to see and I had never heard of any of the films.  I chose ""American Pie"" at random and sat down with no idea what to expect - comedy, drama?<br/><br/>Very quickly I was clutching my sides and laughing out loud.  I may be an oldie (late 40's when I first saw it) and a number of other oldies clearly didn't like it and have labelled it a teen comedy.  Well that is just what it is, but hilarious nonetheless.  True it is a little crude in it's humour but if you are reasonably broadminded you will enjoy it.  I just had to put something in to correct the views of the other oldie stick in the muds. Some of us have retained a sense of humour!<br/><br/>The now famous scene where Alyson Hannigan reprises her geek role from the early Buffy series, but with a surprising twist, was pure magic, as was the ""warm apple pie"" scene with Jason Biggs.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"
"Old Joe","Null","0","1","28 April 2004"," There is something about your first piece!
","While this movie might be a very funny look at the very taboo subject of sex, I feel it is the right time for me to give my opinion on what was a very popular teenage film. This film had a cast that was extremely funny and a story that should and does appeal to many teenagers. However I am going to also throw some ideas to young people, that think sex is just a game or something which has to be dared, pressured or made a pact on in a group to do, to thus gain the greatest human conquests, of getting 'laid', (a term I totally disagree with).<br/><br/>In this coming-of-age comedy, a group of friends at the end of their senior year make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night. In their outrageous attempts to fulfil this mission, they come to some surprising, hilarious and often touching realisations about themselves, their friendships, their notions of love, romance and their relations with the opposite sex. As the fateful date draws near, the boys wonder who among them will get lucky. More importantly, do they really want to do it at all?<br/><br/>This story was very funny the first time I watched it, in a packed cinema. Yet as I have gotten a little older, my feelings on the movie and what it is about have changed quite substantially. Having the four main characters try to find glory with a girl has been done so many times, but then again I can see this film had some sort of originality to it. I did like the direction this film took, under the guidance of the Weitz brothers.<br/><br/>The cast this film had, while rather unknown in talent, was extremely good. I enjoyed the role that Jason Biggs took on especially. To think that his character Jim was bagged for almost everything he did, it was even more courageous to act it. I remember in an interview, he said he had no problems doing the 'pie scene'. I am not sure I would have been so calm about it. Jason has gone on to do movies such as the disappointing Loser and a film called 'Boys and Girls'. The other obvious favourite in this film would have to be the gorgeous Shannon Elizabeth. She was very good as exchange student Nadia. The scenes she has with Jim are priceless, but alas of course he 'blows' the chance with her.<br/><br/>Other members in the cast include the innocent Heather (Mena Suvari). She was a different member of the movie's group who stood out a little bit, and made the right decisions for herself. The better role the Mena has done would have to be in American Beauty, where she was a lot more liberated in what she did and said. Finch was played Eddie Kaye Thomas, and I can relate to the way his character is treated in American Pie. He is the supposed 'brains' of the group, yet outside of the classroom he was made a complete idiot of.<br/><br/>The other standout role in this film (if you it can have such a thing?) would have to be that of Stifler (Sean William Scott). He was the bragger of the film, saying he can score with any girl he likes, which in reality is probably true. Why I don't know? Sean has also appeared in other films such as the crazy 'Dude where's my car', which I did not like, 'Road Trip' and in the tense thriller 'Final destination'.<br/><br/>Yet we have other roles such as Vicki (Tara Reid) and her onscreen boyfriend Kevin (Thomas Ian Nichols). While Jessica (Natasha Lynne), the flute toting Michelle (Allison Hannigan) and Oz (Chris Klein), round out a pretty good cast. Yet the one person who was a little older in this movie, but still very good, was Jim's Dad (the hilarious Eugene Levy). He was so funny, that he could almost be my favourite of the whole film, with his adlibs just great.<br/><br/>Yet this film makes a great mockery of something is meant to be so special. If people around the world try to lose their virginity, because others around them have, then I am afraid to say that sex has lost all it sacredness and value. Yet also think about what the consequences are of a sexual relationship. The AIDs virus is a deadly part of our society now, as are other STDs. Then what about unwanted pregnancies? They are common occurrence these days, which is a real problem. I am not so sure that this film worries about issues such as these, instead trading them in for a good laugh instead. Can people see where I am coming from?<br/><br/>This film also reminded me a lot of films such as the totally funny 'Mischief', starring the gorgeous Kelly Preston. I remember reading that this film was based a little bit on Mischief. It also felt a bit like 'Fast times at Ridgemont high' and the brilliant 'Breakfast Club'. In that way I say that American Pie was good, yet it also had originality that it could only have.<br/><br/>I have heard many people who loved this film, especially young immature teenage boys (who else but the silly looking boys hey?). Yet I met one girl who said that after one hour of viewing this movie she told me that she had to leave the cinema. I am not surprised by this reaction. As a Christian, I feel that sex is a gift that was given to us by God. Yet the general public abuses something so special by making it a very selfish act. We are not making love any longer, but sleeping around to get better names for ourselves. If people can not see that American pie does this to a very big extent, then our younger generation are more na√É¬Øve than I thought!<br/><br/>CMRS gives 'American Pie': 4 (Very Good Film)"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","0","2","17 April 2004"," Probably the best of the teen comedies
","This is pretty much the film that started the whole trend of making teen comedies with a lot of sexual jokes and gags, and definitely one of the best. Any teen will be able to identify with the situations and the characters, at the very least to some degree. The plot is very good, and it moves along at a pretty good pace; sort of laid-back, not too quick but not slow either. The characters are all well-written, very real and even though some of them are cliches or stereotypes, you can identify with them and understand their actions in the different situations. The actors all perform well, I didn't really think any of them did a bad job portraying their respective characters. I think the script was very well-written, it allowed for some extremely funny scenes(of course, there were also some right-out disgusting scenes, this is an R-rated teen comedy after all), and most of them were pretty true to life too. The humor was very good, and had an excellent pace and timing. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys teen comedies, and aren't easily offended. Especially teens will like it, and identify with a lot of it. 8/10"

","If i'm in the mood for a sexy good time as far as film goes, then I know I can count on my copy of American Pie. It's the one movie that i've watched time and time again since it was first released on dvd, and have found it to be interesting each time I see it. Truthfully my all time favorite scene has to be Jim and Nadia in his bedroom, and her making him strip for the unbeknowest to her camera. This is the one film that can now be landmarked as an american treasure right along with the classic Animal House. Of course the two are totally different films, but good old natured fun in both aspects. Another thing I loved about AP was the ensemble casting. It's like looking at my own circle of friends that I went to high school with. That's another reason for my liking this film so much, just for the pure reflection of it all, and the overall genius in the humor."

In the late 70's, Animal House was the one that officially started it all. Then, in the 80's, Fast Times at Ridgemont High was the landmark teen comedy. Then, in the late 90's, came American Pie. It took us into the new Millennium with two more installments which I would rate as highly as, if not better than, the original! Now, I am looking forward to seeing what the landmark teen comedy of the 2000's is!<br/><br/>There is a pattern that seems to have emerged... Each landmark film makes at least one of its cast a star. Animal House made John Belushi a cult legend (and Tim Matheson also to an extent), Fast Times made the film careers of multiple actors who today are household names (Pheobe Cates, Judge Reinhold, Sean Penn to name but a few), and American Pie gave new found success to Sean William Scott (and also gave Jason Biggs some star status). And that is just a brief overview.<br/><br/>Its a true comedy gem and it will definitely go down in the film history books with its name etched next to Animal House and Fast Times at Ridgemont High, among other classics."

And Oz's shedding his Jock persona and signing up for Choir to prove to Heather (Mena Survari) how much she means to him.

I'm certain if John Hughes ever watched this he'd be thinking, ""You know, I was competing against the same crap 20 years ago.""<br/><br/>American Pie's biggest blunder is that it relies too much on insulting the intelligence of the audience in exchange for breaking ground.  This is what made such movies as Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Breakfast Club superior.  What makes such things as Monty Python and Dr. Strangelove so ENORMOUSLY superior is that they don't think the audience is stupid enough to walk into their movie to begin with.<br/><br/>The ultimate victim is the so-called ""heroes"" themselves because they are cardboard prop-ups of the typical American high school teenage.

"thegoalie_99","Null","0","1","4 April 2004"," A funny and truthful teen flick (4/5)
","Every man is ashamed to carry the heavy burden of being a vergin.  As men, we tend to think if we ain't getting, it won't come.  It's this think that helps make ""American Pie"" an honest and brutely funny exploitation of what we'll go through to have sex.  The story's about four friends Jim (the oustanding Jason Biggs), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nichols), Oz (Chris Klien), and Finich (Eddie Kaye Thomas).  As the four approach the end of their senior year, they come to a horrifing realization: they may end up going to college as vergins!  It's the taunting of recently defowlered geek Sherman (a smug Chris Owen) to force the boys into a pact: to lose their verginity by or at prom.  So sets in motion the events leading up to the big night.  Each of the four guys has there own scenario: Kevin is trying to convince long time girlfriend Vikki (Tara Ried) that he loves (and he's not lieing either!) and it's okay to have sex.  Oz is trying to become a more sensitive guy, which leads him to ""Goody, Goody, Choir Girl"" cutie Heather (the adorable Mina Sivari).  Finich manages to spread rumors throughout school that he is...um...""gifted"".  And Jim.  Poor Jim.  First, he gets caught watching porn, then he has an embarissing talk with his father (the brilliant Eugene Levy), onstintlly pines over forein fox Nadia (the sexy Shannon Elizabeth), And...well I won't spoil it.  Then of course there's Stifler (Sean William Scott), Oz's jock friend who constantly torments Oz about Heather and Finich for...well, just for being ""s*** break"".  But of all the girls in this movie, my favorite is band geek Michelle (cutie Allyson Hannigan), whose hand with her instament!<br/><br/>Looking at all the charecters, its not hard to relate to any of them (for me, it's the shy, ackward, and neive Jim how I root for).  And that's what makes this movie great: charecters.  With the exception of Stifler, non of the guys in the movie are protraid as horny jerks.  Instead, they are so caught up in the manly image of having sex, that they don't realize till the end that it may not that big of deal after all.  In the process, we see two male charecters evlove from kids to men.  Oz's realtionship with Heather helps him to put things in his life into perspective (the lacross/choir scene is the best example of this).  Kevin's journey is to realize what it really means to ""love"" someone (i.e. Vikki).  While Jim and Finich evlove as well, it's not with the same depth as Oz and Kevin.  One of the film's highlights is the father-son relationship with Jim and his father.  While these are at times halarious, they display the fathers mission: teach his son the real world of sex.<br/><br/>Writer Adam Herz gives the charecters and story a sencere and truthful outlook on not just sex, but with high school, relationships, and growing up.  But it's the Weitz bros. who close the ball game.  Refusing to make a ""Farrley Brothers Clone"" of a movie, they don't try to make EVERY joke as discusting as possible (though some are bad).  Also, they don't want it to seem that the whole world hates the film's heros.  It wants the best for them and wants them to be happy, but they have to fall on their face once in awhile.<br/><br/>I do have some complaints about this movie though.  First, I don't like the charecter Jessica (Nastasia Lyonne).  Yes, I know she severs as a confidant to Vikki, but she just doesn't work for me.  Second, the charecter Michelle plays a big role in the movie, so why is she seen so sparingly?  Finally, the film follows too many ""Teen Flick"" clichas (thankfully, those doppy cliches from other movies don't jump to the forefront too often).<br/><br/>But in the end, I have to say that I loved ""American Pie"".  It's a crude comedy with heart, and in ranks as one of my favorite teen flicks (right behind John Hughes' ""The Breakfast Club"")"

Tara Reid and Thomas Ian Nicholas never locked there door when they decided to cramp his tongue.  Shannon Elizabeth didn't lock her door when getting dressed.

","I have read the other reviews left by other users and professional critics. Most agree that this movie is funny however some disapprove of this movie because its vulgarity and because of its targeted audience.  I believe that this movie is pretty vulgar but not to the point that it becomes non-tasteful and obscene.  As far as the targeted audience of teenagers, I believe that this movie is suitable for any teenager 15 and older. The truth is teenagers today are pretty vulgar and so most teens can relate to many of the situation in this movie (at least most guys can).  The issues dealt with in this movie have been discussed and acted out among teens for the longest.<br/><br/>If you're against this movie because it's vulgar you need a reality check! If you have teens, then listen to their telephone calls, snoop though their stuff, check their computer, and I bet you will be shocked!<br/><br/>The fact is that this movie just reflects teens today and what teens are doing today are the same things teens have done in the past!  The only difference is today is a little more high tech!   Besides, if you take away the vulgarity then alls you have left is a boring movie that promotes ""good values"",  (a movie that no one would watch).  With the vulgarity you have a funny, believable, movie that promotes ""good values""."

","I basically agree with the previous commenter Dave, in that this movie comes across as an obvious teen sexploitation flick. Yes, agreed, it's gross, lame, juvenile, sensationalistic, vulgar, vapid, and... oh, never mind, you get my drift.<br/><br/>But I do part company with the previous commenter in one respect, and that is that I don't believe any of this silly mish-mash as being ""true"", not for one minute. This movie, to my eye anyway, simply does NOT depict real true-to-life teenagers with their real problems (other than that most relevant one - getting laid before graduation) and real anxieties and insecurities. <br/><br/>I thought most of the teens in this film seemed unrealistically sophisticated, and my ""suspension of disbelief"" suffered a fatal blow right from the opening. Hey, where were the pimples? (It's also supposed to be set in Michigan, but is obviously filmed in sunny Southern California, thus adding to more of the feeling of fakiness that I got from this movie. Geez, is it really so hard to get a cast and crew up to Michigan these days??).<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it is an okay film as a parody of teen life, and even has some poignant moments in it.

","First, as an avid Kevin Smith fan, and after reading some of the reviews on this tasteless, and relentlessly retarded movie; let me just say to those who compared this movie to the likes of ""Clerks"" are right and wrong.

And lets face it, theres no way in hell this movie can compare in terms of the script and the writing capabilities of Kevin Smith.<br/><br/>The unfortunate thing about this movie is that it's true: High school students today are shallow, vacuous, and pretentious and only care about their own social lives. They may seem to care about issues and events that really do effect lives, but it's all a cover to appear much more intelligent than they really are.<br/><br/>Even more unfortunate is the movie itself. I hate teen exploition movies. All it does is take the fears and thoughts of teens on dating, and turn into unfunny mindless jokes for cash and cheap laughs.

"dee.reid","10","0","2","17 February 2002"," There is a lot more purpose to this movie than some people think
","""American Pie"" doesn't sound like much because of its simple premise: four guys(Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, and Eddie Kaye Thomas) enter into a pact to lose their virginity by prom night.  Now it's only natural that this movie would be immediately dismissed as another dumb sex comedy, but I believe that ""American Pie"" is much more than that.  Now I'm no expert, but I believe that there is a lot of hidden subtext here.  One of the scenes that I want to focus on, is the scene where Jim(Biggs) and Nadia(Shannon Elizabeth) are in his bedroom.  Now since Jim had walked in Nadia, she probably felt embarrassed and wanted to see the opposite effect on him.  When it's finally time to get down to ""business"", Jim by this time is so nervous that he n**s his boxers.  Nadia is then about ready to leave. Jim desperate and realizing that this may be the only chance he has with Nadia, starts to bring out the porn.  Nadia forgives him and they start to go at it again but then Jim blows his second chance.  I believe that this is probably the most important scene in this whole movie.  I say this because I think it was meant to show how nervous some people may get about first-time sex.  Now just because Jim had blown his big chance with Nadia, does not mean that she will think any lesser of him.  I mean after all, it was their first time doing anything together.  Now another part, which is the case of Sherman(Chris Owen) a.k.a. ""The Sherminator"".  Sherman is so sure of himself, that many people including our four heroes, think that he can score with any girl he meets.  This is wrong and this ultimately leads to his timely humiliation at the prom.  Strangely enough, his whole ""Sherminator"" act is only able to successfully attract the attention of one lucky lady(try to guess who).  Third is the case with Stifler(Seann William Scott).  Now I'm sure we've all known of at least one Stifler in our lives.  My definition of someone who is a ""Stifler"", is a person who only lives to party, have sex, and makes fun of those who can't; Stifler-""see you guys in the 'NO F*****G' section"".  What girls see in him or how he's even able to get girls is beyond me.  Fourth is the rapidly evolving dating relationship with Kevin(Nicholas) and his girlfriend, Vicky(Tara Reid).  We know that these two have been going out for quite some time.  Kevin is quite anxious to move to another base.  As he says, ""enough of this b-job bulls**t"". Vicky, feeling unappreciated that she probably can't please her boyfriend enough, dumps him.  Kevin then has to resort to ""Kama Sutra: The Book of Love"".  He begins reading the stuff in the book is eventually able to win back Vicky.  Fifth, how many of you have ever tried to change the way you act just to win a girl's heart?  I'm sure some of you have and Oz(Klein) is doing just that.  After the fiasco with Oz's first date, he begins to see things in a different light.  ""You can't try to win a girl over by repeating cheese-ball lines"" says his date.  Oz then takes this into account and after entering into the pact, he spots a young choir girl(Mena Suvari).  So Oz signs up for chorus just to win her heart.  At first he's just doing to get to her but then true love comes into play he finds himself vying for her affections.  He is eventually able to win her over but not by his physique or duty to the pact, but by his determination to find true love.  Sixth, is the minor situation with Jim and Michelle, the band geek(played by Alyson Hannigan).  Michelle- ""this one time at band camp..."" you know the rest. This relationship here is probably one of the higher aspects of ""American Pie"" because it goes to show you that you can't just put a label on anybody no matter how weird they appear to be.  Sure Jim ends up regretting his decision to sleep with her, but in the end, he'll really thank her for it and he will be glad he did.  Lastly, dear old Finch(Thomas).  Isn't it strange the things that we do out of desperation?   <br/><br/>Now are you beginning to see what I've been getting at?  This movie is showing us how our sex lives have or may turn out to be like.  Not all of our encounters will turn out to be total disasters and we won't end up doing it with baked goods(hopefully).  Some of us may turn out to be a ""Sherman"" or a ""Stifler"" or maybe some us won't turn out to be anything at all.  Some of us may have to change our personalities completely to just to win a girl's affections.  Some of us may end up having to resort to extreme measures to get what we want."
"jayekrohn","10","0","1","12 February 2003"," Male counterpart to the ""chick flick""
","American Pie should be taken out of the category of 'teen comedy' and to me, should be placed under a special video store category called ""The Male Counterpart To The Chick-Flick."" Most men can probably relate to the humor in the film in a way that only the most fussy or virtuous male could not. It is funny in a towel-snapping, vulgarity-spewing, sexual one-upmanship way, a real ""guy"" film. Studies show that most men think of sex approximately once every three minutes; this film reflects a compressed thought process in a man's late teens when the hormones are a-ragin'. Sex is fantasized about, idealized and bragged about (although often with no corroborating truth). Women can say, ""guys, you just don't get it"" at a For Women Only or Vagina Monologues get-together, but this is a film that mirrors what growing up from boy to man is about. <br/><br/>The film stars Jason Biggs as the dopey, sexually naive Jim Levinstein, under duress to meet the deadline of losing his virginity by the end of prom night. Along with Jim are his three high school buddies, Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Oz (Chris Klein), and Paul (Eddie Kaye Thomas). These characters are symbolic of high school cliques; Kevin, good looking, popular; Oz, the jock; and Paul, the eccentric intellectual. The fifth wheel is Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott), a teammate of Oz's and son of a divorced mom, who has the run of the house, dad's money to burn and a mouth, well, worse than a sailor's. <br/><br/>As true in high school, people gravitate to Steve Stifler's house (not to Steve, really, he's hunky, but an insufferable pig) to take advantage of his monied hospitality, endless weekend parties, and, for the testosterone-charged, a portrait of his svelte mother on the wall. <br/><br/>The character of Jim's father, only known to the audience as Mr. Levinstein, is played by Eugene Levy. It is on the relationship between Jim and his dad that a supporting foundation is built for the film. What man doesn't recall in a profoundly agonizing way the ""father-son"" talk? It is remarkably performed by Levy. But he is a father who loves, and hugs, his son despite Jim's embarrassed protestations. Without going into a great deal of (unprintable) detail, the film centers around the pact between the four friends, and a typical teen male's challenges: uninterrupted masturbation, excelling at sports, the battle of peer pressure and self-esteem, partying and drinking illegally, and having a long enough relationship with a woman in order to make it on prom night (""trophy"" dates gladly received). Of course, college is a given for all, it's only a matter of a few more months to enjoy freedom. <br/><br/>The female roles, starring Tara Reid as Kevin's steady girlfriend, Vicky; Natasha Lyonne as Tara's older and sexually wiser friend Jessica; Mena Suvari as Oz's girl, Heather; and Jim's European exchange student and fantasy-of-the-month Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), give the film added complexity. Alyson Hannigan plays the hilarious Michelle, the cultist music student; she ends up being Jim's date as a last resort. Paul Finch, Jim's scotch-swilling friend, starts a rumor about the size of his ""equipment"" in order to get a prom date, but is tripped up by Stifler. Finch attends the prom alone, but revenge is sweetly his. <br/><br/>After the post-prom party at Stifler's cottage, the buddies gather round--revealing their stories. Sex turns out to be really just a part (although pleasurable part) of what makes the earth spin, a part of being a man, and in many cases, overrated. Welcome to the real world, men. <br/><br/>American Pie was marketed as one of a multitude of modern ""coming of age"" teen films, yet was vastly different from the genre. Although the film remains true to form with sight-gags and gross-out sexual comedy, it veers off the formulaic path by a plot that develops relationships between individuals that are actually endearing to watch. If you are willing to sit back, relax and enjoy the ride, the nostalgia trip is well worth it. All faint-hearted need not apply."

","The 1980s ran rampant with two types of genres: the slasher flick and the teen flick. Of course both genres are just plain awful with very few exceptions across the board. ""American Pie"" feels like 1984 all over again. This is a mildly amusing film that is fueled by sexual tension and ignorance as four young men (Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Eddie Kaye Thomas, and Thomas Ian Nicholas) vow to lose their virginity before graduating high school. The target date: prom night (big surprise). What follows are gross-out jokes aplenty with silly situations and crazy outcomes abound. While ""American Pie"" is not a very good film, it does try to send messages about youth, sex, and love, but ultimately falls flat on its face. This film also launched the careers of many of its performers (Mena Suvari, Shannon Elizabeth, Seann William Scott, Natasha Lyonne, Tara Reid, and Alyson Hannigan), but as with this film their credits are unimpressive to say the least.

All the lines and attempts the guys use to pick up girls are so cheesy, but you can see how a high school guy could actually try to use some of the lines/methods (... I said *some*).  You don't have to be in high school to enjoy this movie (although it wouldn't hurt).  You also shouldn't be expecting anything too deep.  This is just a comedy about some high school guys trying to get lucky.  If you liked ""Ferris Beuller's Day Off"", you'll like this. Although it's a better movie since it doesn't have all the situations that would never happen like F.B.D.O. does.<br/><br/>The movies I watched in high school were all basically just made to show tits.  This actually relies on humor instead of nudity (although there is some nudity).  If you're looking for a good comedy, and not offended but the the subject of sex, watch this one.  10 out of 10"

"Polter-Cow","Null","0","1","6 June 2001"," Not as funny as it thinks it is
","I just watched *American Pie*, the much-talked about blockbuster hit of the summer of '99, the year that many, many far superior movies came out.<br/><br/>The Matrix. eXistenZ. Run Lola Run. The Blair Witch Project. Three Kings. American Beauty. Go. And those are just some of the ones I've *seen*.<br/><br/>Highlights of *American Pie* include the presence of Alyson Hannigan, Natasha Lyonne, and Tara Reid having an orgasm. And scattered amusing scenes, and a couple good lines.<br/><br/>But it's really not that funny, unless you find it funny. Sex can be funny, yes. *Sex and the City*, *Election*, and countless others have proved that sex can be done very humorously to affect me. I'm not going to try to analyze what they do, but I do know what *American Pie* does: It assumes that anything involving sex is inherently funny. A guy screwing an apple pie? Okay, kind of amusing, but the scene's a huge letdown since you basically see everything you could possibly see in the trailer. It's like the *Scary Movie* philosophy: People having sex is funny.<br/><br/>And then there's the scene where the stereotypical jerk spikes the oddball's mochaccino with laxatives. Okay, now how many freaking times have I seen someone's drink spiked with laxatives for comic effect? I think I've lost count. It may have been a bit funny the first time, but it's not now, and we definitely don't need to see anyone on a toilet with repulsive sound effects. Is this the best Adam Herz could do? Perhaps my idea of clever is different from everyone else's.<br/><br/>So *American Pie* didn't suck, per se. It had its moments, and I laughed more at it than I laughed at *Big Momma's House* (I think that made me laugh...twice), although I'm sure the filmmakers thought I would laugh more."

","(spoilers) American Pie is yet another goofy teenage comedy full of trashy sex jokes and idiot kids trying to get together with beautiful girls, and in the end, it works for everyone except that weird red-headed guy. I'm so sick and tired of movies like this, and if Sean William Scott had not been in this movie, there would not have been a single funny part in it. American Pie is an exploitative film that takes advantage of the vast amounts of immaturity readily found in modern audiences.<br/><br/>I'll admit that I laughed at the movie, but it's the kind of laugh that lasts for seconds, and as soon as it's over, it's never funny again. You actually feel cheated because after you watch the movie you can look back and you realize how dumb the jokes really are. Except, of course, for the scene at the very end when Steve Stifler walks into the basement of his house after the party (`Mom? Shi*brick?!'). THAT will NEVER stop being funny.<br/><br/>I don't want to give the impression that I feel that this movie was pounded out in five minutes with no thought and then thrown into production just to make money, because I realize that on some levels, maybe one or two, it is quality comedy. But on all other levels, make no mistake, this is fast-food cinema. It may be fun to watch, but there's no nutritional value."
"whiplash","Null","0","1","25 April 2001"," A minimum flop.
","This movie has to be called a total blunder. Although enjoyed by an inconceivably large amount of teenagers, American Pie has an immensely great lack of filmmaking and talent. It combines wretched humor, a contemptuous plot, and superficial characters without common sense. What's the point? American Pie is a rather embarrassing affair with its pathetic humor and minimum 'comedic' tone. I find it hard to believe its huge boxoffice success. The movie, however, had one bright gleam; Eugene Levy and Jason Biggs as father and son, whose performances were delightful.<br/><br/>My conclusion is, after having suffered through the full duration, don't EVER waste your precious time on this film. It's crap. The only reason I ever saw it, was to be able to declare about it."

","A light-hearted romp among a group of American High School students who make a pact to get laid within the next three weeks.  Despite their bravado the boys are naive and inexperienced in matters of sexual behaviour.  This makes for some hilarious situations in their first approach to the opposite sex. Taken in the spirit of fun, the risque bedroom scenes are acceptable in context though some might find them rather offensive.  The teenage boys are so infatuated with salacious sex one wonders if their brains have relocated between their legs,  It's a real situational farce with characters being caught in compromising positions.  For me there were quite a few memorable scenes. For example: the father/son discussion about women's bodies as illustrated in the centre folds; the girl who discards her clothing in a bedroom which has been set up with a computer and digital camera and the whole stripping and masturbation sequence broadcast on the internet; the wolf whistles from the students next morning; the young guy giving a girl a taste of foreplay while he considers his next move in consultation with an illustrated sex folder; an irrestible urge to masturbate in a hole in his favourite fruit pie baked by his mother.... It goes on and on through a series of sexual activities that are accomplished with such naivete and awkwardness, it can't help but raise a few chuckles.  The scriptwriter has cleverly captured some of the frustrations of growing up in the turbulent teenage years.  The film goes at a good pace as the scenes bubble along one sfter another and the film is about the right length too.  Any longer, it would tend to become repetitive.  The singing group adds variety to the film and the background music used to accent the comedy in some of the scenes is a brilliant and original idea."

","...""American Pie"" is a ridiculous and vulgar High School coming-of-sexual-age comedy. A pathetic cinematic endeavor, this senseless string of vacuous gags and situations is not for the jaded or sophisticated and will play best in frat houses and college dorms or to audiences with a similarly unfettered sense of humor.

","If evidence was needed that mid-80's nostalgia is here, we get it in AMERICAN PIE. It is no more credible than a remake of Porkys or Screwball Hotel, not that it matters. The makers of those pictures were very aware that plots and characters were irrelevant, so rude set pieces instead were the order of the day. They were rarely very good (the oft-cited classic ANIMAL HOUSE belongs to a different genre altogether).<br/><br/>Riding into cinemas on the back of THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY did not hurt this films box office potential. The makers laughably suggested this was an evolution of the genre. Judging by its success, you can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time. What separates AMERICAN PIE from the rest is a series of poorly devised high school romances. Which would be okay if it was still funny. It isn't.<br/><br/>The most explicit homage to the original inspirations is the casting of Eugene Levy (a chorus of `who?' rings out), best known for being John Candy's sidekick in a bunch of forgettable idiot comedies. So his `comeback' hardly rivals Travolta's.<br/><br/>AMERICAN PIE belongs to a time called `mid-80's'. That time is long gone. It belongs to a genre of jocks-and-sex comedies. The originals still inspire occasional bouts of laughter on late-night television. Watch them instead. It's cheaper."

","American Pie is a teenage comedy that works on a level and then does not on conservative levels.  And that can be summed up by one word as does not not work for conservatives- Pie.  This film has many teen stars that will probably make it as good actors (New Jersey native Jason Biggs is in 2000's Loser already).  Also, this film is the best for teenagers looking for a laugh after Austin Powers 2.  <br/><br/>The story is simple, but the scenes are expanded.  The plot involves 4 seniors who want to lose their virginity by the end of the school year. What ensues is a journey that makes Dumb and Dumber look like The Winslow Boy.  Pastry sex, lacetive dumps, premature ejaculation, the sex books and Eugene Levy provide the best parts of the film, and the romance provides the parts when we can pause from laughing.  Because this film is one of the best comedies and films of the decade.  A+"

","I really remember very little of this movie.  Not because I wasn't paying attention, but rather because the writing was so light and fluffy, I never really got a feel for  who the main characters were.  This is a movie about events and actions rather than emotion or even thought. <br/><br/>
There are definitely some funny moments in the film, but I never really laughed out loud.  I think that perhaps if I were a junior high student, I might enjoy the jokes a bit more.  The film feels like an 80's teen comedy with a few sexual jokes thrown in.  I liked the character of Stifler, the profanity spouting cretin that all of us have to deal with at least once in our lives.  Eddie Kaye Thomas reminds me of a young Nicholas Cage in his role as Finch with a kind of lazy charm.  The music is fairly standard for this type of film.<br/><br/>I try not to go into a movie with any expectations, but this movie was really disappointingly average, sickeningly sweet, and unrealistic.  The main characters in The Wood, a movie with a similar premise, are much more interesting, believable, and intelligent.  Frankly, even the characters in Tarzan have more depth and personality.  I only recommend this movie to those who enjoy shutting off their brains for a couple hours (not always a bad thing to do)."
