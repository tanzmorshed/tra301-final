","I enjoyed the sequel ""Meet the Fockers"" more than the original ""Meet the Parents"" for one reason: the performance of Dustin Hoffman. Overall, it was a fine ensemble cast and good scripting of the jokes and situations surrounding the irrepressible ex-CIA agent and family patriarch Jack Byrnes (Robert DeNiro). But Hoffman's character Bernie Focker, an attorney who retired to become a full-time dad to his son Greg (Ben Stiller), grounds this comedy in solid human values that raise the film beyond the level of nutty comedy.<br/><br/>I admired how Hoffman's character revealed genuine pain following the nasty remarks of Jack Byrnes. For example, the shrine of framed memorabilia of his son's accomplishments was ridiculed by Jack. One could empathize with Bernie's pain which he registered at the criticism. Indeed throughout the film, the most memorable scenes were those with Hoffman's character on the defense, but also taking the offensive against Jack. <br/><br/>The film also included some wildly funny moments, such as the teenager born out of wedlock to Greg's babysitter, a young lad with humongous eyebrows who was a dead-ringer for Ben Stiller's character and Jack's outrageous motor home rigged with listening devices, which provided him with his command center for spying on the Fockers. Much credit should go to director Jay Roach for outstanding comic rhythms, timing, and pacing.<br/><br/>In the end, this was thoroughly enjoyable movie, which had the surprising effect of providing a good window into family values unusual for Hollywood film comedies."

","There are many movies where the performances are so good that the weaknesses of the movie itself are almost oblivious.<br/><br/>The casting in this film, bringing together the stars of the original with Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as Greg aka Gaylord Focker's parents, is sensational.<br/><br/>While I admit that I believed I would read comments and reviews about the crudeness of the material, I believe the reason this is not a typically tragic Hollywood farce is due to the strength of the performances and the interaction of the characters.<br/><br/>As you know, the premise of the movie is very simple. Prior to the wedding of Greg and Pam, the two families will meet. In typical Hollywood sequel fashion, we already know that the Byrnses are somewhat reserved, set in their ways. So it is no surprise that the Fockers are almost the complete opposite.<br/><br/>Hilarity ensures, some crude, some overtly sexual. But the cast is skillful and it plays more like a comic version of ""Closer"". You will believe that Bernie and Roz (amazing performances by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand) are Greg Focker's parents. Not only is their interaction genuine, their love for their child is as well. Part of Greg's embarrassment is the knowledge of his parents' ""quirks"" and how different they are from the Byrnses. Ben Stiller aptly conveys this while not backing down from his love for his parents.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, stern Jack Byrnes scans the Fockers for clues to prove why he should not like them, therefore not allowing his daughter to be married into that family. His design of the RV is classic Jack Byrnes. What is an improvement in this film, is that Jack discovers some things about himself and his relationship with his wife and daughter that change him. This may be the funniest performance in Robert DeNiro's career.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, there are themes that everyone has experienced but most of all, how important love is. The love of another and the love of family and friends. There is a very good example of this in a scene between Teri Polo and Ben Stiller, after some new information is exposed that could possibly tear them apart once again.<br/><br/>All in all, when you know the cast is having a good time, the audience does too. I will be seeing this one more than once."
"Radio_Lady","9","168","257","20 December 2004"," We've Been ""Focker-ized""!
","""Meet the Fockers"" sounds like ""Meet the f-u-u-"". Oops! Can't say that because of FCC guidelines. Just the same, the title pretty much describes the level of the humor in this Ben Stiller comedy. But that's redundant because it IS a Ben Stiller movie. Clearly my expectations for this movie were not high and, maybe because of that, I found ""Meet the Fockers"" quite funny.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. This is not a movie for everyone. First off, the writers did not miss a single opportunity to play off of the name ""Focker"". It's silly and gets a little old but it somehow works with the other repetitious low-down gags.<br/><br/>Focker is the family name for Greg (Focker), Ben Stiller. The funniest Fockers, however, (now I'm doing it) are Greg's parents Bernie and Roz, a loose and liberal Florida hippy couple still living in the last century and enjoying every minute of it. Dustin Hoffman, as Bernie displays a previously unrevealed talent for over the top comedy. Fitting perfectly with Hoffman's Bernie, is Barbra Streisand as Roz Focker, reminiscent of the ""zaftig"" Lainie Kazan. Bernie is a yesteryear lawyer who has not practiced since who knows when. Roz is the main breadwinner from her business as a sex therapist to the elderly.<br/><br/>Greg is not too eager to reveal his parents' true nature to his fiancée's parents as they all come to visit to get to know one another better. Teri Polo nicely plays Greg's fiancée Pam. Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner play her stiff and straight parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes. Oh  also add in some baby low-brow by Spencer and Bradley Pickeren, two adorable twins playing Little Jack.<br/><br/>So, go low, go loose -- or don't go at all -- but if you like Ben Stiller, go see ""Meet the Fockers"". Dustin's antics will crack you up and you'll enjoy Barbra back on the big screen after so long. Rated a B+."

","MEET THE FOCKERS made me laugh a lot. It probably has more laughs than the original, but the laughs aren't as big or as fresh or as subtle. And as sequels go, it contains many scenes that are mere variations of the original: the dinner gone wrong, the sports competition gone wrong, the pet gone wrong, the Owen Wilson cameo, the ""focker"" puns, etc. But many of the variations are quite inspired. Thanks to the terrific cast. De Niro, Stiller, Hoffman and Streisand all look like they're having a great time. Each is given a scene or two to really shine; De Niro and Hoffman fare the best. A child actor's also been added to the cast, and he's a scene-stealer. I just wish Blythe Danner (Mrs. Byrnes) and Teri Polo (Pam Focker) were given more to do. But, as entertaining as I thought the movie was, expect many critics to be turned off or pretend to be turned off by the numerous toilet jokes. I say, flock 'em!"
"christian123","6","152","249","22 December 2004"," The critics are wrong, this movie is funny
","After convincing his fiancée's parents to allow them to marry, Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) now has to deal with what happens when her ex-CIA father Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) meets his own wacky ex-hippy parents, played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand.<br/><br/>I really wanted to see this film when it was first announced. The original was very funny and it had a great repeat value. However, the reviews started coming in and they were all negative so I was a little discouraged. I still went to see it and it turned out to be very funny. The critics really need to lighten up since they turned away a fine comedy. Sure, some of the gags are old and tired but they still work. They use a lot of ""Focker"" jokes and of male nurse jokes sob that kind of got annoying but it wasn't an overload either. The story is pretty much the same as the first one except now Greg's parents are thrown into the mix and nothing ever goes right. The writers came up with a bunch of different, funny situations and some of them were recycled while others were new.<br/><br/>The cast is great and they help move the film along nicely. The best was clearly Dustin Hoffman as Greg's dad. He was hilarious and fun to watch on screen. Ben Stiller was okay but his uptight character role is kind of getting annoying. Robert De Niro also gives a funny performance and he is now forgiven for appearing in Godsend. Barbara Streisand was surprisingly funny and bearable. I usually cannot stand her but she was alright in the movie. Blythe Danner gives a decent performance, nothing really special. Teri Polo was the only miscast in the movie. She just didn't fit or look well next to Hoffman, Stiller and De Niro. Owen Wilson makes a cameo and it was decent, a little unnecessary though.<br/><br/>Jay Roach directs and he does a good job with the movie though it was a little too long. 115 minutes is kind of long for a comedy and because of the long running time, the film starts to bore around the end. They should have taken some things out to keep the film shorter and interesting. I also didn't like the character little Jack. He was the grandson of Jack (De Niro) and he was very annoying. The addition of the baby character was unnecessary and it kind of brought the film down. Compared to the original, the first one is funnier and more enjoyable. The second one is still pretty funny but it doesn't have a good repeat value. However, the film is still worth checking out in theaters. In the end, please ignore the critics and check this film out in theaters. Rating 7/10"
"bob the moo","Null","14","18","11 March 2008"," An extension of the original film done bigger but to lesser effect
","Firmly part of the circle of trust, Greg Focker is planning his marriage to Dina and has put off a big family get together for as long as he can. With no further excuses, Greg and Dina join Pam and Jack as they take their RV down to Florida to meet the Focker family. With an eye very much on his bloodline, Jack is keen to judge his future son-in-law by his parents, which spells problems when he finds himself living with two very liberal and touchy-feely Fockers.<br/><br/>I'm in my thirties now and it probably is not very impressive that I can put words together in a basic sentence. Whereas for a two year old it might be a real surprise if they were to discuss their opinions on political matters as such with you. What is the difference? Well it is simply one of expectation. Coming to the subject of films, expectation can often make or break a film, with perhaps a poor Pauly Shore movie being better received by viewers than a poor Spielberg film partly because you expect that standard from the former but more from the latter. So it does help this film that with the very title you are informed that you are not about to witness the sharpest of comedies.<br/><br/>With this in mind I went in with a forgiving eye, just hoping for laughs but I was not really prepared for how most of the film is unimaginative and base. In the first film we had Greg contrast with stern father Jack and hilarity ensues; here we have the same setup again but this time Greg is replaced as a device by his parents. What this means is that the film essentially aims at the same low targets as the first film and mostly hits them. To avoiding being too boorish on this subject I will admit that moments are funny and that the casting was a nice try but mostly I just found it obvious and dull. Toilet humour, a retread of the CIA stuff and so on supposedly provide the comedy while the drama is the same superficial relationship stuff as before.<br/><br/>The cast mostly do their best to try and lift it. Stiller mugs along well enough but the real fun (such as it is) comes from De Niro and Hoffman. The former more or less just does his stuff again but is enjoyable enough, while the latter is at least having fun with a silly character. Streisand and Polo have lesser roles but still have a bit of fun, while poor Danner is just a plot device to try and the give the film some sort of centre. Cameos from Wilson and Nelson don't add much to proceedings and don't even get me starting on the annoying Pickren twins who are not only irritating but made more irritating by the way the film overuses them, apparently in the belief that ""Little Jack"" is funny and/or cute when really he is neither. Roach's direction is nothing short of pedestrian  even the choice of theme music is obvious and easy.<br/><br/>Overall then this is a film that people who really liked the first film will enjoy. Those that just ""liked"" it may find that they didn't like it enough to watch it twice, which is what is happening here. The cast play it up as much as they can but really this is just an extension of the original idea done bigger but to lesser effect."
"BrandtSponseller","9","41","62","30 April 2005"," A different kind of comedy than Meet the Parents
","Series note: As this is a direct continuation of Meet the Parents (2000), it is recommended that you watch that film first. It gives necessary background exposition and characterization for this film.<br/><br/>Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker (Ben Stiller) and fiancée Pam Byrnes' (Teri Polo) wedding is fast approaching, and their parents still have not met each other. So Greg and Pam fly from Chicago to New York to meet her parents, Jack (Robert De Niro) and Dina (Blythe Danner), before heading off with them to Miami to meet his parents, Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Mother Focker Roz (Barbara Streisand). The problem is that the Byrnes are staid, conservative (though slightly crazy) types who would never think of showing public affection, while the Fockers are still hippies--she is a sex therapist for elderly couples and he's a lawyer who became Mr. Mom once Gaylord was born. Can Gaylord keep his parents reined in enough to not cause Jack blow his lid and try to stop the wedding? Although I didn't think Meet the Fockers was quite as funny or successful as Meet the Parents, it's still funny and successful, with a bit less of an emphasis on nonstop outrageous humor and a bit more of an emphasis on the often amusing complexities of extended family relationships.<br/><br/>If you've seen Meet the Parents first--and you should--some of the material, such as Gaylord's job, jokes based on the ""Focker"" name, and even Jack's background and disposition will have less of an impact, which initially partially depends on novelty and surprise. Additionally, director Jay Roach and the writing team of James Herzfeld, Marc Hyman and John Hamburg telegraph quite a few of the punch lines. For just one example, it's obvious that something is going to happen to Gaylord's rental car in New York as soon as we hear him opt out of purchasing insurance, blowing it off as a ""scam"" to make money.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Roach and crew make it clear from the start that they're not exactly shooting for the same style of film as Meet the Parents. This is evident from the beginning, which cleverly pokes fun at Meet the Parents' ""gradually going to hell in a handbasket"" style by having everything go exactly right.<br/><br/>Roach aims for classic scenarios of families colliding that have surprisingly serious subtexts (and in the real world, these kinds of situations do have an attendant humor, at least when we're not right in the midst of them). Every family tends to have its own customs and norms, its own take on ethics, etiquette, politics, religion and so on. Naturally, when we try to merge families through marriages, uncomfortable, often embarrassing, and frequently tense situations abound. Aside from the humor, this is the crux of Meet the Fockers.<br/><br/>Another important subtext that occurs in various guises through the film (and for which the potential was there in Meet the Parents even if it wasn't capitalized on in quite the same way) is opening up to ""free"", honest expression of one's thoughts, feelings and desires versus showing a ""proper"" public face. This is particularly amusing and poignant in the case of Jack, whose job involved obtaining honest expression, but who is the strongest case of putting on a false public face--to an extent that he's bought into the persona himself. In a way, Roach and crew are suggesting that if we can really reach that ideal self-expression, maybe those family mergers, and even other kinds of cultural encounters (such as the Fockers' run-in with the police) could proceed more smoothly.<br/><br/>So it's not so important whether Meet the Fockers is as funny as Meet the Parents. Roach isn't just trying to make you laugh, even though he does so frequently. Despite all the comments in others' reviews about sex-oriented humor (how could you not expect that in a film with a title like this?), or general ""low-brow"" humor, the comic situations here are more sophisticated in many ways than a typical ""outrageous"" comedy. That means that you're not going to laugh out loud, with tears streaming down your face, as often as you're going to be sitting there with a big smile on your face watching scenarios such as Bernie trying, and mostly succeeding, to hold on to his hippie ideals no matter what the short term costs. This is more a humor of slightly exaggerated but realistic folly, played fabulously by a stellar cast."

","Despite the reviews being lukewarm, I went to see this movie on a recent afternoon because I had a couple of hours between holiday visits to friends. It was the only film that fit my schedule. It was not my first, second or third choice and if I had absolutely anything else to do and if the weather had been any more cooperative, I would have run - not walked out of the theater. I decided that since it remained at the top of the box office for another week, maybe, just maybe there was something redeeming about it. There isn't. Nothing. And the audience agreed. There were probably 20 of us and not one person - not one - laughed at any point in this movie. It is one of the most pathetic wastes of talent since - since - since I don't know what. Shame on everyone associated with this horribly unfunny movie."

","Meeting the Parents of your girlfriend can be stressful enough. But having her parents meet yours can sometimes be a recipe for disaster, something Greg Focker finds to his peril; when both sets of parents meet on the eve of his wedding. Made after the success of Meet the Parents, Meet the Fockers carries on where the last film left off, with Greg delivering babies while his stuffy future father in laws delivers ultimatums, both with memorable results. Of course Greg is now finally in ""The Circle of Trust"" a circle that is headed by Jack, Greg's uptight future father in law, retired from the CIA, yet still firmly attached to his former profession. Meanwhile Greg's own parents are laid back and free with their emotions, his mother being a sex therapist and his father a house husband. Knowing Jack's conservative ways Greg is delighted but terrified at his fiancés news that they are going to have a baby. Worried of Jacks reaction, things get worse when Greg's old teenage crush reappears, along with a 15 year old son who is a dead ringer for Greg and, as far as Jack's concerned, a prime contender for a DNA test . Meet the Fockers is based purely in the realm of a one joke movie (i.e. the family's name) and so has the longevity of one (i.e. very short) The main problems with the film is the heartbreaking (from a film fans point of view) sight of Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand all participating in a film that Benny Hill would have passed at. Streisand, the powerhouse all singing and acting legend, is here reduced to teaching senior citizens how to have better sex, something I could have lived without seeing. Hoffman is clearly having fun, although quite unaware that the audience isn't. His scenes with De Niro have a chemistry, but the scenes themselves do little to their reputations. One scene with Hoffman sitting on a toilet and De Niro in the shower waiting for him to ""finish"" really felt like an all time low, and when Hoffman flushed I hoped their careers wasn't going down with it. One high point is the appearance of Owen Wilson (Stiller's Hutch to his Starsky) who shows up at the end, but by that time I was too busy sawing through my wrists. Meet the Fockers has an incredible waste of exceptional talent, and that my friends is no laughing matter."

","This is an incredibly funny movie. I can't believe the lackluster reviews that this film has received. It's one of the most consistently funny films to come out in recent memory. I (and the rest of the audience for that matter) laughed hardily throughout. Dustin Hoffman, Robert Deniro and Ben Stiller are great. The female characters aren't given much to do, but give adequate performances. Not being a Streisand fan, I was a little apprehensive about her casting, but am pleased to say that she is very good in the role and stands toe-to-toe with hubby Hoffman. The movie is quickly paced and provides very little ""down time"" where the comedy bogs down. It's a great mix of slap-stick, witty banter, strong comedic performances, crude humor and even cutesy fowl mouthed toddlers. To me all these high brow critics need to lighten up. Comedies should be judged by whether or not they are funny and that's it. The bottom line with this film is that it's hilarious. All those critics are coming off as smug ass hoooooooooles."

","Believe the critics because this one is just a rehash of the first and I don't remember laughing even once during the entire film. Unfortunately, this sequel continues in the same vein as the original. Making fun of Greg's profession as a male nurse and using his last name in virtually every way possible to replace the sexual expletive, this film appears doomed from the start for family viewing.<br/><br/>Along with heavy innuendo based on the family moniker, much of the script's humor relies on overt sexual themes for the punch lines. Working as a seniors' sex therapist, Roz promotes erotic exercise moves and candidly discusses options for an amorously repressed couple. A paternity case, a busload of buxom cheerleaders who start to remove their tops and an incident of mooning are also played for laughs. As well, a toddler learns to swear repeatedly and gets his hands on some hard liquor when a flustered caregiver is distracted by an incoming call. The results are supposed to be funny, but the farce often comes up short in good taste."

","In Meet The Parents Ben Stiller had to win the trust of Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner the parents of his girl friend Teri Polo, that famed 'circle of trust' in the Byrnes family. Now the whole family is going to Florida where Stiller's parents the Fockers have a palatial estate and ideas that definitely run counter to those espoused by DeNiro.<br/><br/>That opposition is the basis of the wonderful comedy in this sequel to Meet The Parents. With the casting of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as Stiller's parents, Meet The Fockers is as funny, maybe funnier than the original film.<br/><br/>A whole lot of Focker family secrets are exposed in this comedy and with three of the biggest movie names in the past 40 years in the cast there was definitely built in box office. DeNiro, Hoffman, and Streisand show some incredible comic timing in this film.<br/><br/>There's nothing these two families agree on. Even down to the fact that Hoffman's a dog person and DeNiro a cat person is humorous material. The cat turning on the dog in the DeNiro/Danner trailer is a memorable scene.<br/><br/>Another favorite of mine are the touch football sequence. I doubt Kennedy family touch football was ever like this. There's also a memorable encounter with a Barney Fife like deputy where DeNiro, Hoffman, and Stiller all go to the pokey. Oddly enough Danner and Streisand hit it off well. Streisand is a sex therapist and makes good money doing it as we see by the way the Fockers live. In fact Hoffman though a lawyer became a stay at home dad. That really gets super macho DeNiro's dander up.<br/><br/>Fans of any and all of the players here should make Meet The Fockers a must for your viewing list."

","Gliding on the good graces of its predecessor, this new installment has very little to showcase in the way of ground breaking comedy. Not that anyone would expect a sequel to 'Meet the Parents' as being a 'departure film' or a film that would ever titillate its audience with anything close to resembling an 'over the line' type of comedy. No, this film is just a very safe and predictable sequel.<br/><br/>This sequel force feeds us the chronic Ben Stiller humiliation angle scene after scene. Adding to the comedic clockwork, the producer and or director (or whatever moron in charge), decided to work in the 'baby genius' sub plot into every 7th minute of the film. As if that wasn't enough dumbing down, we're all supposed to be delighted by the dog and cat show that takes place inside DeNiro's 'home on wheels'. The fact that the punch line to this dog and cat chase joke is predicated on one of the animals landing inside the toilet, seems an appropriate place, the proper level if you will, where this film seems most at home.<br/><br/>Infants that are more intelligent than adults, cats that are smarter than dogs, how could this film succeed? Well, it can't succeed. However, I have to admit to one thing about this film being good. The performances of Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffman were good. I was surprised to see a return to comic form from Barbara Streisand. She really should have been making comedy/musicals these past few years...er...decades. Comedy really suits her. Both her performance and Hoffman's are surprisingly good.<br/><br/>Not to take anything away from DeNiro who is also likable, but I was more interested in the 'wacky' hi-jinks between Streisand and Hoffman.<br/><br/>Here's the thing. The movie is enjoyable, but I rolled my eyes way too much for me to consider this a great comedy. It's a comedy that is very much by the numbers, for the numbers.<br/><br/>If you don't mind a comedy that works down to Mall level, where you can see the jokes coming, then watch it on DVD.<br/><br/>I would have given this movie a 5/10, but Streisand and Hoffman were a pleasant enough surprise. I didn't hate this movie, I just didn't like it all that much."

Gregs last name was a humorous topic in Meet the Parents, but it really falls flat in the sequel. Every two minutes they try to spin off a joke about focker or gaylord and it seriously got old in the first two minutes of the sequel. As for the rest of the movie it was incredibly unbelievable. The reason Meet the Parents was so successful is because the audience can relate to Gregs situation meeting the parents and the unfortunate situations that come about. If you plan on seeing this movie I really hope you still go to stitches every time you here the word focker and do not mind a mediocre sequel with cheap laughs. The only time I laughed during this movie is when some guy fell down the steps and spilled his popcorn.<br/><br/>And before I forget....If you cast a vote for this movie or any other please be realistic. Over 50% of the people who have casted a vote for this movie have given it a ten. How ignorant can you be.

Being the 'likeable' guy what an amazing twist for one of his characters. Nobody came out of this movie with even a mediocre performance. I wish somebody benefited from this movie, I really do.

","I never thought I'd see the day when the words 'Robert De Niro' would guarantee one thing only - you are about to watch a bad movie. To be fair though, the blame is not really his. Meet the Parents had the occasional funny part, and they were all in the trailer.<br/><br/>Humour is completely absent from this. I wasn't expecting much, and was still gravely disappointed. Everyone in the cast deserves better material. The sight of De Niro in a strap-on breast feeding device is a truly sad sight and an indication of how low his career has sunk. The only unfunnier things on display here are Hoffman and Streisand. Their characters are simply embarrassing. I admit to being unable to watch the whole film, so if it picked up towards the end I would give it more than one point. But it was the longest 54 minutes of my life."

","In this sequel to 'Meet the Parents,' Gaylord Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) has finally invited his fiancée's parents, ex-CIA agent Jack Byrnes and his wife (Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner) to meet his parents. Jack wants to know if Greg came from a good gene pool. Jack discovers that the Fockers are very strange. The Dad (Dustin Hoffman) is a hippie and retired lawyer, and the Mom (Barbara Streisand) is an open sex therapist. Jack begins to thinks this is not a good family for his daughter to marry into. Greg's parents are so proud of Greg that they have a wall of honor with Greg's ninth and tenth place sports awards. The two families try to become one family. This was one hilarious movie, which I laughed from beginning to end. This is proof of the old adage, that actors don't like to work with children and animals, because they stole the movie. The child spoke with sign language and had some of the best comedy scenes of the movie. The toilet scene with the cat and dog was just so funny. (Universal, Run time 1:30, Rated PG-13) (8/10)"
"rowmorg","1","5","7","27 April 2005"," To think that the purveyors of this trash want to wipe out the French cinema
","Hollywood (and you can't get more Hollywood than Universal and Dreamworks) is still fighting the subsidy battle in Europe. They have already forced French films on to specialty shelves in video rental outlets in France, where Hollywood blockbusters line the shelves. In cinema terms, the French (who invented the moving picture) are guests in their own country. Meet the Fockers, with its offensive and ill-bred title, stands for everything nasty and greedy about the superpower movie industry today. It is a rehash of used goods. It dispenses with a story line. It cynically exploits children and animals for unfunny gags. It is filled with smut. It presents a debased, unrecognisable, version of Jewish religious ritual (the shotgun wedding at the end). It recycles actors who are past their use-by dates, presumably in order to pay lower fees. The credits suggest that Robert De Niro put money into this picture. What a laugh. The family values cynically promoted in this picture seem to have little interest for him in his private life. Perhaps it was a make-work project for himself. He has driven his acting career to such a low point that his phone must have stopped ringing long ago. Compare Al Pacino's fine work in a picture like The Merchant of Venice. Compare the noble treatment of Judaism in that fine picture with the trivialisation of it in this movie. Dustin Hoffman must be desperate. His character is made of pieces of cardboard that don't even match. One minute he is cuddling DeNiro, kissing his neck and preaching love, the next he is brutalising him in a tediously choreographed US football game in the garden. He's about as funny as a patient in a mental home. Barbra Streisand...well, there's a lady who once could sing. Her voice was huge and her record sales matched. But she can't do comedy. Ben Stiller has aged. He no longer looks the ingenu in close-up. His character fails to work when played by a middle-aged man. Apparently the spaniels are paying to see this junk. Perhaps they think it's funny, or just sit there remembering the previous film and thinking this must be funny too. Perhaps they wait patiently, then exit agreeing that it was very funny so they feel they did not waste their money. Who can explain these mutts? The US audience increasingly seems to be getting the films it deserves. Sorry I can't be more positive---there are films I like, I swear. But increasingly, they are never from the US dream machine."

"FGIARDINA","1","7","11","31 January 2005"," A complete disappointment
","First of all, I have to say I am not a fan of art movies, in fact, I enjoy light-weight movies. With that being said, let me put it straight - Fockers is an embarrassing and stupid movie. <br/><br/>I wasn't expecting a masterpiece or a hilarious comedy. However, I did hope to give a few laughs. The movie ended and I had not even SMILED. I was shocked by the number of old, rude and recycled jokes, none of them really funny. Just plain stupid and preposterous. <br/><br/>While Meet the Parents was cute, naive and entertaining, this Fockers is a test for the patience. I mean, who above 10 years-old can laugh at those impossible situations ? What about that baby ? The van which looked like the Batman car ? The police officer ? The maid with the Spanish accent who was Ben's first sex relation ? Do we need more prejudice than that ? I kept expecting a gay character to come along. <br/><br/>I wonder who is worst in this film. Ben Stiller is just AWFUL. I don't like him at all but he manages to be even worse than his average - can it be possible ? yes, it could. Talk about acting classes. His bride, Pam, is a nobody at the film. Pam's mother is wasted. I was sad to see Robert De Niro in that role. He ruins every scene with those faces and fake mannerisms. <br/><br/>Well, now there's Barbra ... There is certainly a limit to what an actor can do for money and she crossed it without thinking twice. She and Hoffman are the only acceptable things in Fockers but they can't save the day. They do have a nice chemistry but it's impossible to deal with that lousy screenplay. I felt sorry for being a Streisand fan, I really did. We have come to expect excellence from her and what do we get ?!?! Fockers ? Her first film after so many years ? I really blushed in that scene where she has her breasts covered with cream. That's not funny, that's stupidity in its highest level. She could have used her verbal brilliance (the same one we see in What's Up, Doc?) but she never does. Anyone could have been Roz Focker, Streisand didn't bring much to the role, at least, not any of the things we have come to love her for. <br/><br/>Anyway, the comparison between Parents and Fockers is inevitable. The first one was quite funny. Fockers is a true waste of time, good actors and money. <br/><br/>On a scale from 1 to 5, I give it a 1 1/2 just because of Hoffman and Streisand. I considered leaving the theater several times throughout the movie, I just didn't because of Barbra and the hope that the film would improve, which never did. It is hard to believe Fockers will possibly be the highest-grossing comedy of all times in the USA."

","I saw the movie last night and like many of the other parents in the audience with their children was very disappointed. The only audience that I had ever observed leaving the theater more quietly was the one with which I shared the Passion last year. This movie should definitely have been rated ""R"" for the continuous sexual content and unnecessary barrage of sexual natured comedy. I may have found Meet the Fockers rarely funny if viewed only with my spouse, but having my 13 and 14 year old children with me left me continuously defensive of the next scene. This is definitely a movie only for the lesser intelligent adult community."

The new characters, specially the one played by Dustin Hofman, who did a superb job, were really hilarious and added a new dynamic to the story. The lowest point of this film were the scenes that involved the baby (Pam's sister son), instead of spend so much time with him ,the writers should have developed more Owen Wilson's character. It may not be the best comedy ever made, but Meet the Fockers is a very good and funny movie, with excellent performances and a good script.<br/><br/>My rating: 9/10"
"FilmSnobby","1","22","45","15 January 2005"," Life-support machine for DreamWorks.
","Like virtually all mainstream releases, *Meet the Fockers* is, of course, really too awful to warrant an amateur review: only the professionals should be forced to deal with the dreary task. But a movie whose cast includes Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, and Barbra Streisand would SEEM to invite discussion. Thirty years ago, such a cast would have indicated a Major Motion Picture. In 2005, I'm sorry to report that these living-legend actors have been inducted -- however profitably to themselves -- in the ongoing mission to Keep DreamWorks Afloat. The Stiller/De Niro ""franchise"" has officially joined the *Shrek* series as an anomalous money-maker for the studio. The creative bankruptcy of Messrs. Spielberg, Geffen, and Katzenberg resulted in the demise of both the TV and music units of the company; and as for the movie-wing of the operation, that creative bankruptcy has never been more clearly demonstrated than with *Meet the Fockers*.<br/><br/>But, as I've said, *Fockers* appears to be making a lot of box-office dough, so the sheer awfulness is likely to continue. Expect *Fockers 3* and maybe even a *Fockers 4*. (Expect the same for *Shrek*, too.) In fact, the sequels may go on and on until somebody over at DreamWorks finds a way to concoct a good movie. Or maybe Spielberg will occasionally drag himself into the director's chair and put the aging Toms -- Hanks or Cruise -- through the motions of the occasional spurious blockbuster.<br/><br/>I realize I've not talked much about the movie itself, but why bother? The first film of the series, *Meet the Parents*, at least had the chemistry between De Niro and Stiller, and an overall funny premise: the nice Jewish guy desperately trying to fit into the suburban milieu of a pathologically WASPish family. The Stiller character's all-too-human propensity for telling white-lie upon white-lie complicated his troubles and increased the comedy. In *Fockers*, Stiller and De Niro are curiously muted in their (few) scenes together. One wonders if they were getting along on the set. But on the other hand, the movie isn't focused on their interpersonal dynamic anyway, choosing instead to make De Niro the put-upon character, overwhelming him with the stereotypical ""earthiness"" (i.e., ""Jewishness"", I suppose) of the Focker parents. This diminishment of De Niro totally misses the point of what worked in the first movie, which is that he was a larger-than-life maniac whose expectations were so high that nobody, especially not Ben Stiller, could hope to match them.<br/><br/>As for Hoffman and Streisand, they bring nothing unique to their stereotypical roles: any pair of aging actors would have sufficed. The fact that they're introduced by way of an answering machine only cements their irrelevance. I even doubt that they've enhanced the box-office profits, as most people under the age of 30 scarcely know who they are, anyway -- Hoffman and Streisand haven't been major screen presences for some time. Which brings me back to De Niro: he had better play *King Lear* or its contemporary equivalent, and do it fast. One tires of watching this great actor continue to trash his legacy with these god-awful comedies. He needs to remind us that he was once considered the greatest screen actor since Brando. (But then, Brando ended up as a joke, too. Curse of *The Godfather*, perhaps?)<br/><br/>1 star out of 10."

","I think this movie was fantastic, it was absolutely great. There was tons of laughter, and it didn't drag on like most movies does. It wasn't the same old jokes, and it wasn't the same old boring continuation of Pam and Gaylords lifes, they actually had new story lines and something else because they were able to develop two new characters and give this something new. The characters were great, real funny material, they were real down to earth characters. Its cool how they took laid back people and matched them with pams parents, who are strict and uptight, makes for great comedy. Even the animals were freaking hilarious, not the same old story line where you make something else boring happen, this had life and was a great sequel.

","I beg to disagree with most of the critics on this one. I actually liked this movie a little better than 'Meet the Parents', and it is very rare for me to prefer a sequel to the original. There was some good acting in this movie, which is no wonder given the caliber of the cast. Make no mistake, this was definitely not a masterpiece, the script could have been better and the last 20 minutes of the film are a little overdone and cheesy, but all in all a decent, entertaining movie.<br/><br/>One thing I found to be a little disturbing about this film is the message it sends, especially to the younger audience: 'It is wrong to be straight, to have strong principles and self-discipline (the Byrnes), whereas it is proper to have no inhibitions, no discipline, no job (somehow everybody is rich anyway) and the world is just a happy merry-go-round (the Fockers). Even coming from liberal Hollywood, this is still wrong."
"mtwolff73","1","10","18","28 December 2004"," Typical bad sequel with pathetic attempts to top the original
","This movie ranks right up there with some of the worst comedy sequels of all time. Other ones in the same league that come to mind are Caddyshack II, Vegas Vacation, Beverly Hills Cop III, Blues Brothers 2000, and the long list of comedy sequels that were so pathetic that they had no business bearing the same name as the originals.<br/><br/>The constant sex jokes involving Hoffman's and Streisand's characters, the tired uses of the last name Focker as attempts at jokes, and the many attempts at one-upping the original with recycled over-the-top versions of the same jokes made this movie flat-out painful to watch. The topper was the illegitimate child thing involving Gaylord's affair with the Focker's housekeeper at 19 (in which he lost his virginity--and the Focker parents would be proud of him for this??). The truth serum scene at the party goes down as one of the most painfully unfunny scenes in cinematic history.<br/><br/>The sad thing is, there should be plenty of possibilities for humor when it comes to a story of in-laws meeting. This movie misfires on almost all attempts, however--and with even more in the way of stars than the first. Stiller can be funny when the writing doesn't get in the way, and really only Teri Polo maintains any credibility throughout this flick. I wouldn't waste a minute of your life with this movie, but if you must, at least wait until it is shown on TV."

","Meet the Parents was a funny and original movie. Meet the Fockers was completely the opposite. Every joke in the movie is based around Gaylord Focker's name. Which got old in Meet the Parents. One thing that especially bothered me about this movie was Deniro's character, In Meet the Parents he was not trusting of Gaylord, and despised him. His main purpose was to make it so that Gaylord would stop dating his daughter. In Meet the Fockers, Deniro almost has a liking for Gaylord. If he didn't like him four years ago, and Gaylord is exactly the same, why would he like him now? That is one of the many unanswered questions of Meet the FOckers. ANother is, ""How did a movie starring Dustin Hoffman, Robert Deniro, and Ben Stiller turn out so bad?"" Another question is, ""Why did the movie makers feel it was necessary to Be so offensive?"" The Focker parents are just Jewish stereotypes, and extremely offensive. The father is a lawyer, and the mother is a sex therapist for seniors, is that not offensive and stereotypical? Also, the only two Hispanic Characters are a maid, and her son. And, of course she is a single mother. My final question is, ""How did a movie this bad make so much money?"" It was number one for at least four weeks straight. ""Why did so many people make the mistake I made by seeing this awful movie?"""

The situation about the families is totally ridiculous and at the end everything is solved as usual, the happy ending and everyone are in peace with each other. Predictable situations are present all the time, since the fake breast, Stiller's speech under drugs, pregnancy, etc. Another movie with the same structure: a preface, a simple comedy/drama and a happy ending. No more to think, everything is solved. Another stupid movie to forget very quickly (I hope). No more to say about it. Awful"
"freshkidd","1","12","23","22 December 2004"," Horrible trash
","I enjoyed Meet the Parents but I couldn't wait for this one to end. The characters changed (for better or worse) because of the addition of the new characters and the new dynamics. The sexual obsessions of the Fokker parents could have been funny but instead they seemed to be the only components of the characters, becoming predictable and boring. Ben Stiller went from the lying nebbish to a pathetic loser (well many of his parts are) who tries to please everyone but the pathos made it unfunny. DeNiro goes from a humorously funny paranoiac to a really nasty, cruel SOB. Example: *SPOILER* The humiliation of the young boy at the wedding served no purpose and was never resolved. I noticed there was an Obstetrics adviser. They should also be advised that Sodium Pentothal cannot make people say what they don't want to, it just lowers the level of suggestion and use of it requires questions to be asked not a free-lance speech such as Stiller gave. It also has to be given IV and can't just be jabbed into someone's neck. Fokker peres could have been more appealing by showing other aspects of their freedom other than sex alone. (although their pride in their mediocre son was a bit touching). For a comedy, the movie produced a lot of uncomfortableness in me, mostly based on the sadism and the terrible situations people were placed in. The resolutions of all the problems were shallow (""Oh, all right, I forgive you""). Stick with the original."

Kenneth Branagh as a schizo prince...maybe Gary Oldman as a excessively flatulent cab driver...what a pity George C. Scott has passed on, in drag he could have been the perfect Grandma Focker. Seriously folks, the people who paired Deniro and Hoffman are to be praised...just think if they had been around long ago perhaps they could have gotten Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde to write together... perhaps they could have written dirty jokes or, even better, subway graffiti. Anyone who doesn't see this movie for the disgrace that it is has no business writing about film. To take two actors of this caliber and waste them on a souped up TV sitcom... well lets just say the producers should never be allowed to ATTEND another film much less make one. Marlon Brando left Hollywood, stopped making films, retreated to a desert island, gained 500 pounds and pretty much made a joke out of himself when his acting career essentially was over... too bad Robert Deniro couldn't have done the same.

"Brent_P","5","11","21","15 May 2005"," Good acting covered up by poor writing and terrible directing.
","For those of you that have not yet had time to go out and rent ""Meet the Fockers"", don't sweat it and just wait until it's on TBS. If you're a fan of the original, you'll be severely disappointed and if you haven't you'll either be sick or confused with some occasional chuckles. ""Meet the Fockers"" probably looked good on paper and probably had a high demand since the original was so successful, but it failed to meet expectations and forgot what made the first one such a comedic hit.<br/><br/>""Fockers"" stars the original cast with the addition of Dustin Hoffman (Bernie Focker) and Barbara Streisand (Roz Focker), as the Byrnes family takes a trip down to Miami to meet Greg's parents and plan the up coming Focker-Byrne wedding. That's really as deep as the plot goes, with the additions of few side elements that take place during the vacation.<br/><br/>The first was practically a classic as it featured Ben Stiller in his usual ""everything goes wrong with me"" role that makes the audience stress out beyond belief which is supposed to induce laughter. It did work though, as Stiller's position of meeting a potential spouse's parents can be nerve-wracking is somewhat believable. In the sequel, the main comedy was focused on the Byrnes family meeting the Focker family, trying to hit it off and with Greg caught in the middle still trying to impress Jack with his usual antics and trying to change his parents.<br/><br/>The main reason this movie was near unbearable was the the intelligence insulting writing, especially the gag bits, that still revolved on Jack's borderline OCD and over protectiveness of his daughter, constant sexual innuendos, the drenching use of the word ""Focker"", and the just plain fact the whole situation was totally implausible. To start with, the sexual innuendos (and I use this term loosely) was way out of control, which this tactic was practically non-existent in the first one. I have no problem with sexually laced jokes and gags mind you, but the jokes in this movie were too forward, not funny, over used and didn't fit: Jack's fake boob to feed his grandson (don't ask), Bernie's missing testicle story, the awkwardness between the conveniently placed babysitter with breasts big enough to make Pam Anderson blush who Greg lost his virginity with, Greg's infant foreskin than landed in the fondue pot during dinner, and Roz's and Bernie's open sexuality that is present throughout the whole movie. Was there really a need to write in a scene where Greg has to stop his parents from having sex with Streisand covered with Cool-Whip from the waist up like strawberry shortcake, due to the fact his future in-laws where sleeping right below, on the first night? All this movie needed was an apple pie and Stifler and it would been complete.<br/><br/>Also, as may read in several other reviews, was the constant use of the word ""Focker"" which was practically run into the ground in the first one was in full affect this sequel. Not only is it in the title, but it it's also used like every 5 minutes. Yes, we all get it, it kind of sounds like a similar four letter word that may be considered vulgar. So, if we get it, why doesn't entire cast get it? This is where my entire beef with implausibility comes in. Both in-laws doing various gags through out the movie was down right idiotic and insulting, as all four the parents seem like sophisticated people; including one being a lawyer and one being ex-CIA. Would a house host really go to the bathroom (....#2) while their guest is taking a shower? Would a potential father-in-law jam a syringe filled with sodium pentathol (truth serum)into his daughter's finance during their engagement party just to solidify his ""circle of trust?"" During the entire movie I was chomping a the bit waiting for one of these parents to grow up, which was unfortunately in the final scenes.<br/><br/>On a lighter note, the acting was quite good with DeNiro of course but the roles played by Hoffman and Streisand were quite impressive. Unfortunately the teen-movie writing and bad directing overcame any evident of acting. This film may have been a little bit easier to swallow, if the the original didn't exist which set the bar and the tone of the comedic level. Unfortunately it's another sequel that misses the mark and depends on the addition of other ""A"" list actors in the cast and the success of the original to draw in audiences."
"sjmcollins-1","4","11","21","25 February 2005"," Vastly inferior sequel has a few cute moments
","(Spoiler) Meet The Parents was one of the funniest movies of the decade, as we witnessed put-upon everyman Ben Stiller terrorized by every guy's nightmare, the over-protective father-in-law, ready to believe the worst at all times, played famously by Robert DeNiro. There were a couple of slapstick scenes in the film that I still laugh at after numerous viewings, and much of the interaction rang true between Stiller and DeNiro. Nothing really rings true in Meet The Fockers, as the conflict between Stiller and DeNiro is replaced by Greg Focker's zany parents, played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. Hoffman and Streisand play likable enough characters, but don't seem too likely to have raised a kid like Greg. Their over-sexed, ultra-liberal characters are kind of charming, but not really laugh out loud funny. Director Jay Roach then goes for the lowest common denominator--the cute baby. Jack is now overly obsessed with his grandson, and the movie continuously cuts to his reaction shots--he cries when Greg talks to him, he laughs when someone gets kicked in the groin, etc. He also says a profanity for his first word, and repeats it constantly. I found it kind of stupid the first time. You can practically see the kid's mother/father offscreen coaching him through the word. Ben Stiller repeats his Along Came Polly/There's Something About Mary/Meet The Parents persona, but he gets shoved to the background a little in favor of Hoffman and Streisand, and it costs the film big. Sequels are good, even great, when there's more story to tell--but this just solidifies the notion that comedies should just quit while they're ahead."

The only bright spot is Dustin Hoffman who plays the eccentric Focker with relish. Streisand is totally wasted in this movie, and Ben Stiller has the same blank non-expression all through the film. DeNiro's character gets tiresome and irritating after about the first 30 minutes. The title says it all. Absolutely awful!"

No joke.<br/><br/>With a cast like that, it could have been so much more, so funny, but in every way this was a letdown.<br/><br/>There was not even one laugh-out-loud thing, and only a few that even brought out a snicker.

","Initially, when I heard about this sequel a few years ago, I was kind of excited. The first film was enjoyable enough, with some true moments of 'laugh out loud' genius. As time moved on, I grew more and more concerned. The news of the Dustin Hoffman casting was decent enough, but Streisand concerned me. Then the trailers came, and I saw a few amusing moments, but a lot of repetition of the first film. Well, I can honestly say, with my hand on my heart, that I laughed more at Churchill: The Hollywood Years than Meet The Fockers! Picking up a few years after events of the first film, it is rapidly approaching the wedding and is about time for the parents of both families to meet. How will the uptight Jack (De Niro) cope when he meets the relaxed, and oversexed, Focker family? No doubt hilarity will ensue, and many hijinx will occur. Wellthat depends on your idea of hilarity. Here's a quick test for you Focker.Focker..Focker.Focker..Focker! Are you giggling like a madman? If so, this is the film for you! If not, and for some bizarre reason you don't find the constant repetition of the first films jokes funny, then just watch the trailer. You will save yourself 1 hour 55 mins, and will have seen all the best bit (which themselves are borrowed from other comedies). The comedy of the first simply suffers from being stretched out into another film, and somehow the magic is missing. Stiller and De Niro just seem to be going through the motions, and for some reason, despite the 'resolve the differences' ending of the last film, the relationship between the two is still strained.<br/><br/>The news that a third film is being planned (Little Fockers) is distressing, to say the least, having seen what this film does with one 'comedy child' role! This is a film which shouldn't have been made, and the fact it did so well in the US reflects more on the popularity of the first than the quality of this dreadful sequel! It's like Father of the Bride 2 all over again! Dreadful!"

There were a few chuckles here and there but by and large, the jokes fall flat often and with resounding thuds. I think the best way to enjoy this film, kids, is to take your parents. Make it a nice family event. You might not be laughing but listening to your mom cackle should give you some pleasure. On a side note, it's becoming very clear to me that too many cooks in the kitchen is a good way to spoil a movie. The studio really needs to just sit down and say to one or two guys... we're going to trust you. Here's Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman. Go have fun.

Where for example did the baby come from? Sure, it is explained but why in hell is it needed? Comedy value? I think not.<br/><br/>Then, once ""the Focker household"" is reached, the ""story"" as much as it is, reaches a standstill. One of the most prolific actors and one of the most famous singers of all time both put on poor performances and fail to provide one laugh in all the film.<br/><br/>The ""jokes"" all seem tired and laboured, the situations are all dragged on too long and seeming comedy opportunities are missed completely.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, it seems to actually get worse... that is until the two best characters in the film appear for 5 minute sections each. A highway cop with a comedy accent and a character from the first film who is obviously due for an appearance. Ben Stiller fans can probably guess.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very poor show. Drivel you could say. This is, in all honesty, one of the worst films I have seen in the last few years. Not quite reaching the terrible lows of Christmas with The Kranks....but dangerously close. If Ben Stiller is going to star in so many films, he needs to make sure they aren't a pile of Hollywood-processed tat before auditioning.<br/><br/>I cannot really recommend this to anyone.

Ben Stiller, his lipsticked-mouth always open in surprise and his eyes rimmed in black like a raccoon, makes certain his overly-pancaked face is in close-up at all available times; this must have been contagious, because the cameraman plasters the screen with everybody's mug, which wouldn't be so bad except that their confusion over the stupidity of the plot is magnified. Jokes are flayed around desperately in the hopes of hitting a target (even the end-credits joke-reel fails). Loud instead of funny, everything is underlined and then milked for a chuckle. There are terrible sequences and running jokes in this movie, jokes that are even out of character (like Robert De Niro and the strap-on breast). It doesn't work.

It's not just that the bathroom humor is distasteful - it's distracting. You often wonder when seeing a sophomoric film what it would have been like without the crude humor. You don't have to wonder, in this case - the same film exists without the crassness of the sequel.

In that movie he made with Jennifer Anniston, there was a lot of bowel and toilet gags. Okay. Fair enough. But in THIS movie, barely a year later, we see a dog flushed down the toilet by a cat, and we hear Dustin Hoffman utter the words ""If it's yellow, let it mellow, if it's brown, flush it down."" Not to mention Robert DeNiro talking about making ""number one"" and ""number two."" So this lightweight comedy starts in the toilet and never gets far from it. A highlight? Barbara Streisand.

The cream on Dustin Hoffman's face...not funny. The football game...foolishness. From beginning to end...humorless. Dustin Hoffman is introduced crossing arms in front of the camera as if doing Karate. Is that supposed to be humorous? It looked idiotic.<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine how a comedy could be entirely humorless with such celebrated actors. What a waste. But then it starts with the script and this script is poor. The attempts at acting for this script turned moldy. The producers and director are as much to blame for using this script.

The problem is Ben Stiller's parents (Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman) are depicted as crazy freaks. So their exaggerated behaviour is just a logical consequence and not funny. In a British film the parents would have been normal and then the fun would have come from their behaving in a freaky way.

If they were making their money on pictures like this so they could afford to do indie films that they care about, that would be nice. But it's been a long time since I saw the once-revered De Niro, Streisand, Hoffman or Danner name in a first-rate film. Or have first-rate films just disappeared into the seeming desert of creativity currently afflicting US cinema?"

","Did the actors read the script before accepting their roles? Dustin Hoffman accepted one of the most porous roles for a credited actor. Most of what he does is so abstract that it's not funny. A lot of the humor in the movie is predictable. Because of that I found it to be a bit embarrassing. I felt sorry for the actors in the movie instead of feeling for the characters. This movie never made it out of the infield. Dustin's character was not believable. It seemed the entire movie revolved around him instead of using Ben Stiller as the one who made us all feel so incredibly uncomfortable in the first movie. The writers seemed to forget Ben is the one who masters satire."

","Meet the Fockers is the sequel to Meet the Parents, which was a very funny movie starring Robert DeNiro, Blythe Danner, and Ben Stiller, in which Greg (Stiller) has to meet his fiancé's (Teri Polo) parents, Jack and Dina (DeNiro and Danner) so he can ask Jack for her hand in marriage. Sadly enough, Meet the Fockers, even with the extra star power of Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand as Greg's parents, fails to deliver the goods as well as it's predecessor.<br/><br/>This movie follows shortly after the first one, and Greg has planned a trip for his fiancé and her parents to meet his family before they get married. There is a major clashing of personalities between Jack, who is an uptight former CIA agent, and Greg's father, a former stay-at-home dad, and mother, a geriatric sex therapist. Since this is a sequel, it has to be compared to the first movie. This one just wasn't as funny, and the devices that were used to carry the jokes seemed desperate. Sure, there are some funny moments, but the humor is tired since we've seen it already."

If I were 10 or 12 years old I probably would find this movie funny or cool. Well I'm not in my teens or 20's any longer. There were a few good moments in this film but they are outweighed by the breast and penis jokes. The ""signing"" baby's funny moments are all dealing with breasts and breast milk, farting or pooping.

There were many times in this movie when it was so close, and with Dustin Hoffman and the rest of the cast, it should have been funny.<br/><br/>There may have been lots of funny stuff in the second hour, but I was not willing to wait it out.

What's more is the fact that they continually milk the joke of saying the last name of Stiller's character over and over again. I guess that's their way of sneaking in excessive profanity in a movie while still keeping it at a PG-13 rating, so they can line their pockets with greater profits.

They do what they can with the setup and the screenplay, but this movie can only have been designed as cringe comedy --- there is no visible attempt at other kinds of humour --- and the result is all cringe, but no comedy.<br/><br/>My one note of praise and wonderment is for Bradley and Spencer Pickren who play Little Jack, the de Niro character's grandson, who has not yet learned to talk but who has an extensive language of signing with the hands to communicate with his family --- well, with his grandfather anyway.

Then, it's set up again and killed over and over. To make the movie long enough, we get subplots involving animal hijinks and a babysitting gig gone wrong. Har. The casting is all just for the stunt. Once we see who the new parents are, we laugh momentarily with recognition, but then no one does anything. The script is so contrived and lazy it sets up scenes that go absolutely nowhere, some that don't even seem finished.

The humor of this entire movie is every bit as shallow as the Focker/F***er pun that the title implies. It was particularly sad to see talented actors such as Robert Deniro and Dustin Hoffman try hopelessly to restart their now-pathetic careers with this sub-standard vehicle for Ben Stiller (who keeps repeating his ""There's Something About Mary"" role). The whole situation between Robert Deniro's character and the little baby nephew was just tedious and unfunny, and the fact that the movie tries to generate laughs by showing a baby picking up on foul language from others shows how low the writers went for humor. And Barbra Streisand is just outright annoying. Overall, this movie is just a jumble of desperate toilet humor, and sex jokes, and is a complete disgrace."

"Alan_F","2","7","13","18 July 2005"," Not really a disappointment
","Before reviewing this movie, I would like to make a few points:- Firstly, I am a big Robert de Niro fan. Ten years ago I would have stated unequivocally that he was the finest movie actor ever, with a number of powerful performances to his credit. These days I still cherish him, but am less certain of his greatness.<br/><br/>Secondly, I am not trying to be provocative or unpleasant or offencive in writing this review, but to simply put forward an opinion for discussion. I would welcome responses, of all kinds, to my email address (ba_hinks@hotmail.com).<br/><br/>Thirdly, I have to confess that I approached this movie with trepidation, with the prejudice that I was not going to like it. Nevertheless, when the opportunity to see it came up I was prepared to take it.<br/><br/>The first disappointment about this movie is the juvenility of its humour (humor for the Americans!), starting with its title, which contain a word which sounds closely like a crude Anglo-Saxon term for having sex (oooh, how rude!!), but is also a genuine surname arising from the Dutch aircraft designer Anton Fokker. I wonder what the target audience for this humour is - surely only children under the age of about 12 find the hint of coarse language amusing? Or is there a vast swathe of conservative middle-age matrons who, scared of using the 'F word' themselves find the threat of it dangling before their noses dangerously exciting? There is further 'nudge, nudge, wink wink' (as we Brits say, from the Monty Python sketch) sex-related humour through Barbara Streisand's character, and the over-amorous dog, plus some (dog-down-the) toilet humour thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>The second disappointment is the sheer predictability of the plot. Two very different families, in terms of personalities, careers, background etc. are linked by a single commonality - their children wish to wed. Simple movie logic suggests that the differences will cause frequent confrontation and misunderstanding as both sets of parents attempt to dominate with their preferred version of reality, but that they will come together in the end, united by the love their children have for each other. And - surprise, surprise - the movie follows that immensely predictable path to a conclusion that could have be written within five minutes of the beginning.<br/><br/>The third disappointment is the involvement of two giants of the screen in Robert de Niro and Dustin Hoffmann (the other actors are appropriate to this level of excrement). I realise that de Niro is a producer of the movie, so has a vested interest additional to his acting role, but he is not a comic actor and his legacy is tarnished by performances such as this.<br/><br/>The only aspect of this movie which was not a disappointment to me was the fact that I predicted that I would dislike it, and that it would be embarrassing and unfunny. I was not disappointed to have been proved correct - although I would have preferred to have been proved wrong."

","Meet the Fockers is an average comedy. There are a few laughs, the new characters work quite well, I found Dustin Hoffman to be particularly funny; but the movie lacks the edge of the original. The movie had all the cringe worthy moments of the first film but three years on they don't have the same effect. The writers have recognised that the film required a new angle but rather than taking a clever witty tact they have gone for lowest common denominator humour, which I think cheapens the film. The concept was itself an obvious follow on from the first movie. Essentially this move is more of the same but the same just isn't as funny the second time around. I hope for the sake of the original that they don't make ""meet the little focker""."

(Maybe that's a bad example considering the financial reward Mr. Ebert commands). I went to see Fockers for one and only one reason, TO LAUGH. I watched Finding Neverland and Fockers back to back in two evenings, in that order. In watching Neverland, I couldn't help having my eyes moist, even just a little. In watching Fockers, the tears just rolled, uncontrollably, the way they always do when one is laughing so hard.<br/><br/>Some, actually most, of the ""humour"" is right down low so if you can't shed your intellectual hide and let your hair down, you're just wasting your money and don't deserve any sympathy. But if you can, you're in for a hell of a time, thanks to Hoffman (good old Dustin, not the equally gifted actor Philip Seymore) and Streisand. De Niro's you-never-know-if-it's-agony-or-ecstasy grimace continues to be deadly effective. Stiller is always a natural for the lovable, more-average-than-average guy next door.<br/><br/>There is also this family thing that hits home every time, because we see ourselves in these relationships: father, mother, son, daughter, in-laws. With the characters, we laugh at ourselves as well as share some of the warm moments we have experienced in our own daily lives.<br/><br/>While most of the funny lines are direct pokes at your reflexes, there are some better ones. My favourite is Streisand's (to De Niro), ""So you try to avoid confusing the little kid by strapping an artificial boob to your chest?"""

","I really looked forward to this movie because I loved Meet the Parents and I thought that this cast couldn't go wrong. Well, it could! In my opinion, this movie plays on humor that is perpetually situated below the belt. There were very few laughs from the audience I was with and quite a few questions from the child in the seat behind me(phew...am I glad I wasn't the one having to explain what was going on!) To say this movie is crude is understating the fact and some of the conversation even made me cringe. The fact that Barbara Streisand looked the same as she did in the 60's with the same curly wig and bell-bottoms, I found rather distracting but not nearly as cringe-worthy as the intensely inappropriate questions she asks her son, despite the fact she's supposed to be a trained therapist.<br/><br/>I really can't believe that this cast thought their lines were funny. It was like having Dustin Hoffman and Robert de Niro delivering garbage. A complete waste of their brilliant talent. And the same goes for Ben Stiller.

My wife first pointed it out to me early on in the movie and from that point on our main attention was to watch for it and tap each other on the knee when we saw it. Now, I've seen the microphone appear at the top of movie before but usually only once, maybe twice. In this movie it appeared at least every 5 minutes. At times the Grey fuzzy wind-cover of the Mic looked like someone was dangling a dead cat above Dustin Hoffman's head. I can understand a flaw like this in a low budget independent film or a home movie but this is a big budget film with Hoffman, DeNiro, and Streisand for goodness sake.

","Dear ones: I have seen today the movie "" Meet the Fockers"" a movie with no value whatsoever, making me disgusted and appalled by the low class comedy, the dialog,the gross presentation of different moments,and to top all this I realize the low standard of those great "" House Names "" actors that will compromise themselves to such level for money, fame and who knows what other motives,inless they don't realize what garbage is, which will be really sad. It is funny that with the Globe and Oscar awards coming on, there are on the market all kinds of fast made movies, with big house names, one more mediocre then the other in artistic value,which plays no role on the fact that those movies are presented and nominated like the best of the year in directing as well as acting,totally overlooking the real fantastic performance of Jim Caviezel In The Passion Of The Christ as best actor with no equal in his craft and Mel Gibson as Director just because of spite, sabotage, conspiracy and political reasons. If Hollywood thinks that people with real values are stupid, they are living in a world of their own, where they can not see the difference between sexy and vulgar, classy,refined or gross, good taste material or blue material, morality and immorality,Godly or Ungodly, real Faith or Religion. I say this in sadness. It does not matter that you are from the left or from the right if your heart is in the right place - THE CENTER - From the heart comes everything which is good and true in one hand or bad and untrue.

","I really enjoyed ""Meet the Parents"" and was afraid to see the sequel because I was afraid i would be disappointed. After seeing it, I was shocked at how disappointed I was with this film. Apparently, Barbra Streisand turned down the film several times before agreeing to do it. She should have gone with her gut instinct. ""Meet the Fockers"" is mediocre, cheap and embarrassing. It is full of bathroom humor and sex jokes. The actors did the best they could with the uninteresting script. Ben Stiller played the same uptight character who was in ""Along Came Polly.""<br/><br/>I regret seeing this film."
"BWalcoff","5","4","8","26 December 2004"," A fair movie, but a disappointment none the less
","The critics absolutely ripped this movie apart in the papers by me (The Philadelphia Inquirer) They gave it one and a half stars out of four which I felt was a little bit to harsh. If I was rating it on the common 4 star rating system, it would get a flat two out of four stars. Some scenes were funny, for example when Gaylord (Ben Stiller) is left alone with his soon to be nephew, who is an infant. As an overall I compare this movie to ""American Wedding"". Just a bunch of jokes and gags that were trying to be duplicated from the first movie. Robert Deniro's character just comes off as down right mean and mental rather than humorous. You will laugh at the movie if you enjoyed the first one but it does not compare."

"StevePulaski","3","2","3","29 July 2015"," Makes the original film look worthy of praise
","The only thing worse than an unnecessary sequel is a sequel that can't figure out anything new or invigorating to do with its material, so it resorts to recycling the same structure, humor, and plot-points from the original film. Meet the Fockers is a uniformly lazy picture, yet only slightly placing itself a few notches below its grossly overrated predecessor. The film all but affirms the purpose of its franchise's existence is to subject Ben Stiller to one lifeless comedic setpiece after another, to make Robert De Niro a continuously intolerable character, and to take a cast that practically oozes personality and make them a boring assortment of caricatures.<br/><br/>It all starts with the rehashed plot; this time, instead of Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) meeting his fiancée Pam Byrnes' (Teri Polo) parents, and enduring the awkwardness and uncertainty that follows, Pam, her notoriously strict father Jack (Robert De Niro), and her mother Dina (Blythe Danner) will travel from Oyster Bay, New York to Long Island by RV to meet Greg's mother and father. Also going along for the ride is Little Jack, Jack's one-year-old nephew who he simultaneously cuddles and teaches how to be a grown up despite still being an infant.<br/><br/>One of the first shocks to Greg's family is, despite Greg being so controlling and tightly wound, Greg's parents, Bernie and Roz (Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand), are so liberal and relaxed. The two welcome Jack and Dina with open arms, despite an evident behavioral shock taking place during casual conversation, as Bernie and Roz love to be open and free to discuss sex with their friends. Real drama, however, sets in when Greg reconnects with his old housekeeper Isabel Villalobos (Alanna Ubach), whom he slept with at a young age. Isabel now has a son that looks mysteriously like Greg and was birthed in a window similar to when him and Isabel slept together. As one can imagine, this causes immense discomfort between Greg and Pam, all while Jack is still trying to get Greg to fess up, as he believes he still isn't nearly as honest as he claims to be.<br/><br/>The overblown nature of these films is what kills their vibe; their unsubtle humor works against every joke in a way that discredits the situation and the subsequent events. These films would work much better had to been conducted on a realistic scale, but when you have a cat who can flush a toilet, a baby who hears over three dozen simple words a day, yet his first word is a polysyllabic profanity, Greg's parents are such mind-numbing dolts who have no idea how to treat guests, and their is the possibility of an illegitimate son nobody spoke about, then the film becomes so far off course in its narrative it might as well be science-fiction.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Meet the Fockers, as you'd expect, cops out with over a dozen jokes about Greg's birthname of ""Gaylord Focker."" This shows nothing else besides lazy writing on part of Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg, as they continue to cherrypick elements from the previous film. However, if Meet the Parents was good for anything, aside from being a sitcom display of humor, it was also slightly original and tapped into the nervewracking idea most men have when it comes to meeting their girlfriend or fiancée's parents. It reached out and explored that often unexplored area of anxiety and nervousness that stems from what should theoretically be a very positive and respectful time for both parties. However, due to the desire to not only impress, but wow, there is a discernible level of anxiety that takes over and frequently makes the first couple interactions so awkward and unsettling.<br/><br/>Yet Meet the Parents, as stated, what a sitcom display of such events; a bogus, redundant collection of overblown scenarios that Meet the Fockers replicates in an even more mediocre fashion. Talent that has proved themselves worthy of high recognition succumbs to the repetitive nature of situational antics, most of which fall flat on their face and provide nothing else for the characters to do besides frantically run around and scream bloody murder at every turn. Meet the Fockers is a monotonous exercise that, in turn, makes its mediocre predecessor appear worth of praise.<br/><br/>Starring: Ben Stiller, Teri Polo, Robert De Niro, Blythe Danner, Dustin Hoffman, Barbara Streisand, and Alanna Ubach. Directed by: Jay Roach."

","I haven't seen the original (""Meet The Family"") and so came to all these characters afresh, which I appreciate probably wasn't the case for most of its viewers. On the strength of this, would I go back and watch its predecessor, well, maybe...<br/><br/>This movie is a strange mix of the infantile and mildly prurient, the producers possibly hoping that the mix comes together with a ""family movie"" at its centre although for me I saw the swings between these two extremes as far too obvious, not to say crude. I mean all that stuff about Barbra Streisand's sex-therapy teachings, humping pets and De Niro's artificial boob, plus the not-even-funny-the-first-time play on words on the title family's name.<br/><br/>Of the big star talent on show, I actually liked Hoffman and Streisand's turns as Stiller's touchy-feely (and then some!) parents, both having a romp with their crazy characters. Unfortunately De Niro (like Meryl Streep) only really has one comedic mode, the same grizzly sourpuss he initiated in ""Analyze This"" - you suspect that Hoffman could have played his part but not the other way round. Stiller straight-mans it for all he's worth - he's a likable enough actor, as is his hapless character, but even without knowing much about his other screen roles, he seems to be in the same comedic typecast cul-de-sac of the likes of Jim Carrey or worse Adam Sandler.<br/><br/>The narrative is paper-thin and seems to move along a plot-line of placing each character in the most embarrassing situation, usually with sexual connotations) especially Stiller's. And, sorry, movies which rely on babies or pets (or both) for cheap laughs just don't work for me.<br/><br/>No, Hoffman and Streisand apart, this movie barely left an impression on me and thankfully Ben doesn't seem to have seen fit to add another sequel to this particular series, thus sparing us the likes of Al Pacino and Julie Andrews as a psychopathic uncle and prim and proper aunt..."
"buffsin2003","5","2","3","6 June 2009"," A truly shallow movie that feels more like a Hollywood cash in than the sequel the first movie deserved
","I consider myself to be a big fan of ""Meet The Parents."" It's one of the movies from my generation that will surely live on as a classic years from now. Perhaps the most notable thing about MTP is how well it fares on repeat viewings- It's just as fresh and funny today as it was when it came out. So, there was no doubt I was excited when I heard about ""Meet The Fockers."" While most of the time I am wary of sequels being pointless cash ins, it was different with this. The thought of the crew from the first movie going to meet a new set of parents seemed like it could make this sequel another classic- perhaps even better than the first.<br/><br/>Instead of a classic, we got a movie that lacked the personality, depth, and overall likability of the first one. I can remember enjoying this movie in the theater, but knowing that it didn't quite reach my expectations. When I got it on DVD, it took one showing before I realized that this movie was not very special- it was a movie that took a terrific premise, an all-star cast, and mountains of potential, and decided to squander it all by creating what felt like a soulless Hollywood cash-in.<br/><br/>A good way to examine how this movie failed is to compare similar scenes from this movie and its predecessor. The one type of scene that stands out to me most is the dinner table scenes. In ""Meet The Parents,"" the dinner table scene was one of the most memorable, everything from Greg's rendition of a table prayer to him trying to back over his previous lie about breast pumps by telling a story about how he milked a cat as a boy was classic. Instead of hilarious conversation delivered perfectly by terrific characters, we have (mostly) the same characters sitting around a table, performing shallow, disgusting sight gags, where a piece of foreskin winds up in the fondue pot. I don't necessarily dislike raunchy comedy, but it doesn't always work in this series, and unfortunately, it almost never worked in this movie.<br/><br/>The strong point of the original movie was the way it wove so many different awkward situations and mini-disasters together, and how it managed to be much more than the average ""disaster comedy,"" thanks to a great script and outstanding performances from Stiller and De Niro. Thankfully, Stiller still brought his A-game for this sequel. De Niro did a fine job as well, but there are times in this movie where his character is easy to despise. In the original movie, we knew that his character was a jerk that showed respect to no one but himself, but we were still able to look at the situation and meet his actions with some recognition of understanding- I mean, who could blame Jack for being angry about Greg accidentally burning down his daughters Wedding altar? In this movie, Jack seems to be looking for reasons to bring Greg down, and instead of talking misunderstandings over like a mature adult, he simply results to despicable acts and temper tantrums to get his way.<br/><br/>In addition to the stars of the original movie, this movie, of course, adds the Focker parents, played by Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffman. Unfortunately, I was not happy with these characters. I'm not much of a Streisand fan, so I guess it was understandable for me not to like her performance. Hoffman does a pretty good job, but his character seems too over the top to be funny at times. This set of parents are extremely sex crazed (which, of course, leads to more junior high level gross out humor) and pretty much smother their son Greg, most notably with the shrine they created for him, which is full of 9th place medals. Unfortunately, I thought they wasted the great premise of the movie with these two characters- they could have been done in a much better and smarter way. You might notice that I didn't take too much time describing these characters, but that's only because I spent as much time explaining them as the writers did creating them.<br/><br/>Oh, and I can't forget the worst addition to the series made by this movie- Jack's grandson, Little Jack, who is, quite frankly, an annoying little baby that's nothing more than a distraction. Giving Jack a Grandson to bring along is an idea that looked great on paper, but ended up transitioning poorly onto the screen (sort of like this whole movie) Basically, the kid comes along to make stupid baby sounds and look cute in front of the camera. His first words provide for some fairly memorable moments, but by the time that happens, you'll have grown so tired of the kid that it won't be all that funny. The main problem about the baby is how the camera will always cut to him, to show him laughing or making some other dumb noise in response to one of the grown up's adult problems, as if he is some wise, super intelligent baby that still craps his pants. In retrospect, the baby adds a thick, completely unnecessary layer of cheesiness and kindergarten level humor to a movie that is intended for more adult audiences. Seriously, the way he is used reminds me of a way some sort of live action Nickelodeon or Disney movie would use a baby.<br/><br/>The pieces of squandered potential in this movie are starting to add up, and it is with sadness that I look back on this movie and see something that could have been so great be turned into nothing but a shallow, soulless husk of its predecessor.. With ""Meet The Fockers,"" we wound up with a truly shallow movie that feels more like a Hollywood cash in than the sequel that the first movie deserved."
"Goobertron","2","2","3","22 May 2005"," huge disappointment
","I have some major problems with Meet the Fockers. Besides the fact that it uses tired and uninspired jokes and the script is lame, The Fockers are what really get to me. In Meet the Parents I saw this really conservative and uptight father in De Niro. I felt Stiller's humility because I could actually relate to his situation, or at least imagine myself in his situation sometime in the future. This is what made the movie so good. It was hard to watch because I could imagine the movie happening in real life to a certain extent. Greg's parents are completely unbelievable, in that I could NEVER imagine the story in Meet the Fockers taking place in real life. The Fockers are so extremely laid back and open about sex that they seem fake. Let me tell you: I know a few people who have some qualities that the Fockers, but none of them have sex books scattered around their house. None of them would, in a million years, talk about circumcision at the dinner table, ESPECIALLY when they are with their daughter's fiancé's parents. Not that I demand realism in movies. Its just that Meet the Fockers was a hit because it wasn't a typical Hollywood comedy. It was a great movie in my opinion, and in many other opinions as well, because of its realistic awkwardness and humility felt by Stiller. Meet the Fockers takes every last bit of that realism away. I'm sure you know certain people who enjoyed Meet the Parents for the same reasons I did, and you also know people who liked Meet the Fockers a lot better than Meet the Parents because of its crude and over-the-top humor. Meet the Parents was an original comedy. Meet the Fockers uses the same formula that so many other Hollywood comedies use these days. Thats why it is such a disappointment."

","I was so thrilled when I heard they were making a sequel to Meet The parents because I loved that movie. And even though most of the times you get disappointed with sequels with this one I wasn't. It was totally in the line of its predecessor. Maybe not as good but still way better the thousands of other wannabe comedies. This time it's about meeting the parents of Gaylord Focker and if you know Jack Byrnes you know there will be problems when he meets the Fockers. The lifestyle of Bernie and Rozalie Focker (played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand) is quite the opposite of Jack Byrnes' lifestyle and vision and so it has to clash. Again the funniest moments are between De Niro and Stiller, even though I thought Hoffman was very funny too in some parts. A good sequel if you liked the first one. If you don't like Ben Stiller and his comedy then just skip the movie because that's all you are going to get."

","I'm not a prude nor a highbrow. I fall on the floor listening to Chris Rock and other witty but blue comics. But this was one of the lamest, unfunnily crude, bathroom humor movies I've seen in a long while. I sensed we were in trouble when Dustin Hoffman announced that they were having plumbing and water shortage problems. But surely there's a wittier way to make a little joke about that without saying ""If it's yellow, let it mellow; if it's brown, flush it down."" That's just crude; maybe OK to say within a family, but not funny on the big screen. The senior sexual therapy angle may have been cute, but they beat that to death. And are we really to believe that the girl's mother would get all breathy having her earlobes rubbed in public at a mall by a lady she thinks is weird? I kept waiting for something witty or amusing to happen, but I got tired of diNiro being such a hopeless tight-a__ nuisance and gave up about half way through. I wonder why he, Streisand, and Hoffman would have taken on such a lame and crude script. I loved Dodgeball and Something About Mary - so it's not the lowbrow humor that turns me off, it's when it's done so clumsily. Those other movies were pretty witty, brilliant by comparison."

Instead, it's a complete mess. I don't even know how to describe this movie. It goes on for what seems like five hours, during which a bunch of stuff happens, and none of it is funny. Ben Stiller stands around giving that stupid pucker-faced wrinkly-eyebrowed expression he uses in every damn one of his movies, and whines. Blythe Danner wanders around saying her only line--""Oh, Jack""--over and over again. Teri Polo stands in the background without doing anything. A baby swears and points at breasts. A dog humps things. A foreskin falls in a fondue pot. On and on and on. I hate this movie. I can't figure out if Hoffman and De Niro were trying to get recognized again, if they just wanted a few extra bucks, or if they're just plain going senile.

"TheMovieMark","Null","7","18","22 December 2004"," A slapstick sitcom version that is a shadow of its predecessor
","When you're making a sequel to a very successful movie, you've really got a lot to live up to. Some sequels take that challenge and work hard to live up to or exceed expectations. Even if the sequel doesn't exceed the original, you hope it'll at least give a valiant effort. Meet the Fockers, however, went with a different approach. It takes everything that worked in the first movie, throws it out the door, and substitutes it with lame, formulaic, and repetitive gags.<br/><br/>Don't believe me? Here are a few jokes that were not only run into the ground, but were buried 10 feet beneath it and covered with cement: * A dog humping stuff. Is that still considered funny? If you think so, then is it funny to repeat the gag about 5 times WITHIN ONE MOVIE??? If you think so, then may I ask why you set your comedic bar so low? * Barbra Streisand is a sex therapist. Oooh look, she works with old people! She teaches them how to lap dance! Hardy har. I wasn't able to laugh at that because I was too busy trying to avoid throwing up on the person sitting in front of me. Plus, Streisand has lots of sex books and statues, so you know that's rife with unoriginal jokes that we've seen plenty of times in other less-than-spectacular movies. And folks, the last thing I needed to see in life was Streisand's boobs covered in whip cream. Sheesh. Well, maybe that's not the *last* thing I needed to see, but it's not high on my list.<br/><br/>* Dustin Hoffman is a big IL' goof-ball! Wackiness and goofiness is fine, but within the context of this movie it would've worked better if it were done in a believable fashion. Hoffman's character sits on the toilet while De Niro takes a shower ... IN THE SAME BATHROOM! Is that believable? Hoffman's character used to be a lawyer, so you'd assume he'd have some sort of intelligence. Now if De Niro had gotten out of the shower and straight-up kicked Hoffman in the face, then THAT would've been funny, but he just politely asks for some privacy. And come on, am I really expected to laugh when Hoffman dances and falls into a food table? That's the best the writers could come up with? I suppose that might work in a high school skit on ""club day,"" but it really doesn't cut it when you're making a major motion picture.<br/><br/>* The overuse of puns on the ""Focker"" name. Been there, done that. Something new, clever, and original would've been nice.<br/><br/>There was a lot of potential here. You knew Stiller's parents had to be crazy, so there was room for loads of laughs once they met up with Mr. CIA Robert De Niro. Unfortunately, it's a concept that is much better in theory than it was in its execution. Hoffman and Streisand just didn't do it for me, plus the fact that I inherently dislike Streisand didn't help.<br/><br/>I still think they should've used Jerry Stiller (Ben's real dad) and Estelle Harris. If you remember, they were George Costanza's parents on Seinfeld, and they're two of the most dysfunctional parents to ever appear on television. I think they (or two characters who were similarly neurotic) would've worked much better.<br/><br/>There are some laughs here but nothing to compare to the original. I was never really bored, but I never did more than politely chuckle or smile. Were my expectations too high? Not really because I didn't expect this to be as good as the first. My main disappointment comes from knowing that this *could* have been really good.<br/><br/>I know a lot of people at the screening really enjoyed it. I guess some people are just more willing to settle for a slapstick sitcom version that is a shadow of its predecessor than I am.<br/><br/>THE GIST Meet the Fockers isn't horrible, and I never felt compelled to sprint for the exit (except for when Streisand was teaching the old people how to lap dance), but there just aren't any sidesplitting, aisle-rolling guffaws here. If you don't set your comedic bar very high, then you may be satisfied. But if, like me, you're a big fan of Meet the Parents, then you, like I, might be sorely disappointed with this sequel.<br/><br/>I would suggest waiting to make this a rental, but if you're dying to see it on the big screen then make it a matinée."

Arthur II: On the Rocks, Arthur, Pink Panther, Pink Panther Strikes Again, Analyze That, Analyze This, you get the bloody point, right?

Barbra... she should have pick a different film because she came off like a dusty IL' sports car with flat tires and cobwebs yet, no matter how dilapidated it looks, underneath you still believes there's a sports car in there somewhere but it is what ya see, if ya know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>We could have used Stiller stepping it up to keep things really interesting and pick up the slack yet they wrote him a bit toward the back and thats too bad.<br/><br/>Just with all the talent and pull they had behind this to make it 'really' funny and entertaining, you'd think they would have. Yet a gun with no bullets is still just a hunk of metal. Naw, they weren't shooting blanks yet the powder was a bit too wet for me.<br/><br/>Most of you will probably be happy saying your money was spent well, yet I believe those more hardcore watchers not wanting just a cookie cutter production will be disappointed a bit with the results.<br/><br/>6.5 outta 10"

","Yes, I hated Meet the Parents. I was sick of De Niro's character after about five minutes. He works much better toned down in this film, but he's still annoying. But forget about him. This film works because of Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman sometimes takes it a little too far, but not as badly as De Niro did in the original. Streisand shows why she's still on the radar after an eight-year absence from the big screen, even a political conservative would have to admit it.<br/><br/>The humor is still a little too lowbrow for me, but this was still better than a typical Jim Carrey movie (like Bruce Almighty. I also tired of the characters pushing the limits of polite conversation on their first meeting. Just because the Fockers are liberated aging hippies, doesn't mean that the film should resort to playing out like an episode of Dharma & Greg. I can stay home and watch that in reruns for free.<br/><br/>I am sure a third installment will be made, maybe with Pam and Greg having a baby, and maybe De Niro will be toned down even more, but please let that be it! Note to the people of Jacksonville, Florida who were at my screening: Come on, was it really THAT funny? Didn't you see that blue dog in the commercial and trailers umpteen times? Oh well, if you enjoy a good guffaw simply for the sake of guffaw-ing, I won't rain on your parade."

","This is one of those movies where you know there's been a joke and you're supposed to laugh, but you kind of have to make yourself do so. There are a couple of surprises but most of the gags can be seen a mile away unless you force yourself not to look. I think the performances were all pretty good but the writing just didn't deliver. Maybe it'd be funnier if I wasn't conservative, because the moral of the story is that conservatives, even national heroes like DeNeiro, are intolerant jerks that ruin the world for everyone else.<br/><br/>Anyway, unless you have a lot of free time for somewhat funny fluff with lots of poop jokes and exploitation of babies who have been taught to swear, watch something worthwhile instead."
"katydid4819","6","3","7","30 December 2004"," Don't bother with the Fockers - See the original
","Meet the Fockers boasts an all-star cast, a box-office gold premise, and after all, it is the sequel to Meet the Parents. Why wouldn't you want to see it? Truth be told, it's not a bad movie. Actually, it's better than most of the run-of-the-mill comedies that get made these days. The problem with making sequels to successful movies is that the standard has been raised to heights not likely to be past. That's why you make sequels to movies like The Princess Diaries that have a built in audience already and weren't that great the first time around. If the sequel is better, both films benefit.<br/><br/>The problem with this film lies in its desire to milk its built in jokes to death. This is essentially cheating in the comic department. It means you're too lazy to work for new laughs. Of course, if you are the follow up to Meet the Parents, you have to have a token Focker or Jinxy joke. What makes a movie, book, TV show or conversation memorable, however, is something unique. You need to conquer new territory and claim it as your own.<br/><br/>Everyone is back form the first film. Jack is still the leader and Dina the token wife figure. Greg, or Gaylord as he is referred to now, still suffers the male nurse jokes and, as sweet as he is, we don't know how Pam puts up with all that he does. His mistakes can be forgiven but after a while you reach a point where it's overkill and even the audience is embarrassed. And speaking of embarrassed, there are the Fockers, Bernie and Roz. Not only do you have to wonder why Greg would ever let anyone meet these people but you also have to wonder how they don't notice that not everyone is as open and comfortable with their lifestyle. For example, Roz is a sex therapist who holds class in their backyard. You would think these people had never met a conservative before.<br/><br/>There is no lack of sex humor here. In fact, often it's not humor but just a mention of Greg's deflowering with the Spanish maid when he was fifteen. Or the thumbing though Greg's baby pictures only to end up with his foreskin in the fondue pot. This is how every scene progresses, and while it's funny at first, after a time you begin to wonder how old the screenwriters are.<br/><br/>Although those evolved could probably have had a more fulfilling experience doing another film, their careers will probably be momentarily boosted by this. People like this type of film and it is a nice escape. After all, it's far from reality. My rating is for the great cast and the over all good effort but the film has the fate of the $5 bin. ***/*****"

","I give this 4 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>This is a sequel to Meet the Parents. The story is basically that the parents of both the bride and groom meet to get know each other. The movie had its moments of laughter but not enough compared to the first movie. A friend a mine and I had an argument over my low rating for this movie, arguing that this movie should stand alone rather than be compared to the original but I think this is totally incorrect. It was due to the strength of the original movie that gave the impetus to make this sequel and unfortunately, the sequel just did not measure up to the original.<br/><br/>I have to confess, one of my biggest problem was casting Barbara Streisand as the mother of the groom. I just cannot stand her. She is annoying both on screen and offscreen. I tried hard to not let that influence my rating of this movie but subsconsciously, it probably did. I did like Dustin Hoffman as the father of the groom. It's refreshing to see him play a comedic role now and then.<br/><br/>It is not a movie that you need to go out and see in theater. You could wait and just rent it."

Her family had kept their bloodline secret for hundreds of years fearing reprisals for being British Stuart King Direct Descendants.<br/><br/>Robert De Niros character plays the straight man well. Barbara Streisand proves that she is still a great actress. The baby little Jack steals a lot of the scenes. Other Robert De Niro movies are worth watching also. <br/><br/>Apparently the following message was sent from the Earths Moon during the Kennedy administration. Moon 168 Readback:""Backside back Hide Jack Attack ER"" It turns out that the Friendly Ki Alien creators of Humans had used either the Earths moon or a satellite to search for Jack The Ripper in 1889 and had determined him to be James Marbrick and that his diary was hidden in the house that he lived in. ER referred to the danger faced by the egg of the Queen Mother (my Grandmother) still inside her mother as well as all other British people due to a badly mercury poisoned Jack the Ripper. This riddle of the Creators was not solved for decades until workmen found the diary of Jack The Ripper hidden under some floor boards. Was the book turned on its back I wonder. Do not worry I am law abiding. Jack Kennedy and Elizabeth Regina are also the two people whose clones are starting Human life on Earth over. Hopefully Ben Stiller will star in some more comedies."

","'Meet the Fockers' the the sequel to 'Meet the Parents', which was a very good romantic comedy film involving a guy named Gaylord Focker who tries to fit in with his girlfriend's family. 'Meet the Fockers', however, is a horrible sequel with in-your-face comedy, which maybe only generated a couple of small laughs in the 1.5 hours of film. The humour in this film is not nearly as subtle as the original, and it is a ruder sense of humour which focuses primarily on sex. 'Meet the Parents' is a much better film with subtle humour across a wide range, and there is a sense of feeling for the characters, while the characters are thrown around in 'Meet the Fockers' to be as rude as they can be. (Humour such as the scene where the foreskin accidentally finds its way thrown into a pot of hot chocolate is rather disgusting - in my sense of humour - and not at all funny, but I guess that some people did find this funny.) I would suggest you see 'Meet the Parents' and do not bother with this film. It is completely different from the humour in 'Meet the Parents' that it is not a good sequel anyway. I am cringing about this poor film at this very moment and wishing that I had my money back."
"lemon_magic","7","2","4","12 November 2005"," Four words to convince you to see it: ""Streisand does screwball comedy""
","I am of mixed minds when it comes to Barbra Streisand (see my long,involved screed about ""The Mirror Has Two Faces""), but I will readily admit two things in her favor: the woman can sing the *ss off of a Broadway show tune, and the woman can play screwball comedy to perfection. <br/><br/>That's why I like ""Meet The Fockers"" so much. Yes, the film is actually fairly sweet and sympathetic within its ""comedic farce"" settings. Yes, Robert DeNiro is compelling yet funny as an ex-CIA man who is wrapped a little too tight. Yes, there are plenty of gross-out jokes, and plenty of silly word plays and puns on the Focker family name. Yes, Dustin Hoffman is great in a very broadly played role (watching his character practice Capoeira is a hoot). <br/><br/>But the real pleasure here is watching Streisand do what she does best on screen: real screwball comedy. Not romantic comedy (""Mirror Has Two Faces"", which was for fans only), not romantic drama (""A Star Is Born""), not all those other genres she tackled because she wanted to be Taken Seriously...but simple, funny comedy in which she puts aside her need to be regarded as A Great Beauty (30 Years Younger Than Her Real Age) and simply plays a somewhat dippy, marvelously warm and funny older mother. She is every bit of Hoffman's and DeNiro's match, and she almost totally overwhelms poor Stiller and the other female leads. <br/><br/>She's great. She's funny. She's adorable. She's doing what she does best. The movie is worth seeing just to see her (and Hoffman) in action. <br/><br/>If you are any kind of fan of her early, funny movies (""What's Up Doc?"", ""Funny Girl""), you should check out ""Meet The Fockers"". You will find much to enjoy, along with a pretty fair family comedy."

Luckily I only paid $2.50 to rent this dog instead of theater prices. I would not recommend this movie to anyone with an average or above average IQ. I found only a couple of scene even slightly funny. The pretense of Ros Fockers occupation was funny and some of the scenes involving the grand baby were funny.

","By now, we should know that in movies, when WASPs meet ethnic people, there are some wacko situations, as ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" showed. But when the ethnic people are Jews, then it really gets crazy.<br/><br/>""Meet the Fockers"" makes use of this. Having been accepted by the Byrneses, Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) decides to introduce them to his parents in Florida. His parents are Bernie (Dustin Hoffman), who distrusts the government, and Roz (Barbra Streisand), a sex therapist. The Byrneses are very laid back, to say the least, and after a little while with the very open Fockers, Jack (Robert DeNiro) once again starts considering Greg unfit for his daughter Pam (Teri Polo), especially since he and Dina (Blythe Danner) are trying to raise their grandson to be tough, while Bernie and Roz want to dote on him as they did Greg.<br/><br/>Watching this movie, I had to wonder what kind of parents Bernie and Roz were to name their son like they did. Of course, all the Focker relatives had embarrassing names. What a family! The movie is mostly an excuse to be silly, and silly it was. But the good kind of silly. I just wonder how it would be to experience the Byrnes-Focker reunion. Either way, ""Meet the Fockers"" is hilarious."

There were a few good moments but it all seemed rather laboured. A pity really as it wouldn't have taken much to improve it significantly. The fault lay in the screenplay as the actors did as much as you could expect of them. It was lovely to see Barbara Streisand with her earthy presence and De Niro, Stiller and co were fine. However, there was a lack of range in the humour and an overly constrained plot which was not helped by the vast majority of the film taking place in a handful of similar sets.<br/><br/>Worth seeing but nothing like as entertaining as the first film."

","I didn't see the first film, Meet The Parents, and it doesn't seem that I missed much. I figured that Streisand had to be worth a look and she is, in fact she and Hoffman steal whatever there is to steal. The success of Robert de Niro has always eluded me and he does nothing here to convince me he is anything more than a journeyman actor at best. If a performance consists of pulling faces then yes, he's a great actor but I like a little more than that if anybody asks you. Teri Polo is unbelievable as Stiller's fiancÃ©, by which I mean that I can't believe what anybody let alone Stiller would see in someone so wooden and unprepossessing. Okay there are some gags and some situation comedy and it's okay to see once but that's it."

","""Meet the Fockers"" is easy to critique. Just go back and watch ""Meet the Parents"", change the location, add two Hollywood legends doing perhaps the worst work of their careers and you have this smelly mess of a movie. The standard crew from the first installment (the engaged Ben Stiller and Teri Polo and Polo's parents Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner) take to the road in a massively large recreational vehicle to meet Stiller's parents (Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand). The typical problems then take place as the friction we felt in the original between Stiller and De Niro is compounded by the friction between De Niro and Stiller's parents. ""Meet the Fockers"" is too long and dumb to be endearing. The routine of the first installment became tiring long before this stinker was ever dreamed up. 2.5 out of 5 stars."

","Meet the Fockers is the second weekend from hell for Greg Focker (Ben Stiller), a male nurse engaged to marry Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). The first weekend-from-hell was Greg' introduction to the parents of the bride Jack and Dina Byrnes (Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner}. respectively. Greg and his future in-laws, traveling in Jack' million dollar bus, head south to meet his parents Bernie and Roz (Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, respectively) in their Florida home. A cultural collision awaits both families. Jack, a retired CIA agent strung as tight as a drum, and his wife Dina are in a word, WASPs. The Fockers on the other hand are Jewish; Bernie is a stay-at-home civil rights lawyer and Roz is a sex therapist with a home 'office'. Greg Focker just wants to survive this weekend with all his body parts in tact. The Byrnes' would be happy if they avoided all bodily contact. The Fockers intend to wash the families' dirty laundry and share Greg's teenage sexual exploits with the Cuban maid.<br/><br/>Meet the Fockers is a forking bad film with a shop-warn story line, obvious gags and a predictable outcome. The story line is a knockoff of the TV situation comedy now in reruns, Dharma and Greg (1997) sans the talented Jenna Elfman. This film is a casting nightmare. Barbra Streisand in the role of a sex therapist is a casting oxymoron. It's well known that Streisand suffers stage fright; perhaps this is just a survival instinct at work. Dustin Hoffman paired with Streisand gives the film ethnic overkill without expanding the scope or characteristics of the cast. Robert De Niro demonstrates why sequels rarely work; his character is stale and he looks like he's in pain. Blythe Danner is perfectly cast, but her role is marginal and there are few opportunities given her to rescue the film. Teri Polo as the young bride-to-be projects as the 36-year-old bleached blond actress that she is, not as virginal young bride. Conversely, Ben Stiller at about the same age is a pretty good fit.<br/><br/>Meet the Fockers is lowbrow comedy that milks a pretty successful and creative prequel for all it's worth. The best scenes and lines were cherry picked for the previews, so frequent moviegoers may feel like they've already seen this film."

For me, what made the original so great was the subtle awkwardness between Stiller and DeNiro.(i.e. ""That was beautiful, so much love and yet also so much...information."" I think Dusty and Streisand were too over the top, and the humor was a little broad and crude for my taste. A circumcised penis foreskin landing in food doesn't really do it for me. Nor did Streisand riding DeNiro ""like Seabiscuit.""

The story is messy and it is not as clever as the first one. I also don't think the story is as relatable as the first movie... I mean does this ever really happen? It's known that meeting your significant others parents is not so fun, which is the scenario the first movie played with, and exaggerated. But when is it ever important for the two families to meet? So much as to like each other?
I don't know maybe I don't know... but I don't think that's a real thing. So this movie isn't quite as relatable, as its not pulling off a real world struggle.<br/><br/>I will say that Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand we're actually very funny.

The two of them as hippy, life-loving retirees is so perfectly suited to a family who named their son Gaylord.<br/><br/>Stiller and DeNiro continue to excel in their roles, while Blythe Danner gets a bit more to do and shows what an underrated gem of a woman she is. Hoffman is absolutely hilarious but Streisand steals the show as a woman of wholesome warmth and complete openness. Its really nice to see Greg's parents take his side when Jack gets stuck into him, and its a natural momentum to see Danner and Polo's characters start to edge away from him, allowing him to continue the arc his character began at the end of last film.<br/><br/>The comedy felt a bit cheaper sometimes, and the presence of Little Jack seemed only to exist to set up a handful of jokes about fake breasts and the ""asshole"" gag. A few plot holes are lazily addressed in one of my greatest pet peeves. You're darn right its awkward to have the ex-boyfriend act as the Minister. But we have to have Owen Wilson make a cameo appearance so who cares? However, the film is warm and often very funny, making it as worthy a comedy sequel as can be expected today."

I also believe that ""Meet the Fockers"" is a comedy movie that you just have to watch it and laugh from your bottoms of your heart."

","You read the top right. If it's broken why fix it? Meet The Fockers is the continued story of Greg Focker and the unique family he is trying to marry into. Only this time, Greg is introducing his parents to his in-laws and they are more dysfunctional than his in-laws. Now don't get me wrong, this is still a movie I would watch once and leave to oblivion. The same form of comedy is used as in the first, it's awkward but better performed I think. It's the best of the Focker Trilogy, which is garbage as a whole. However, Greg's parents are brilliantly cast and are the best part of the movie. Just saying my favorite part of the movie was either when Greg is drugged by his father-in-law or when they flush Mojo, the Fockers' family dog. They were the high points in a very mediocre/bad movie that can be forgotten with little effort, but this movie is still way better than the first. Do not go out your way to watch it or rent it, it's not worth it."

","MEET THE FOCKERS is a family comedy in which two ill-matched couples meet over a weekend, argue and fight with each other, and then agree in the end to sanction the wedding of their children. A familiar plot, allowing plenty of opportunity for comic situations with a soupçon of sentiment. What is perhaps most remarkable about this film is the not only talent assembled - Robert de Niro, Barbra Streisand, Dustin Hoffman, Ben Stiller and Blythe Danner - but how director Jay Roach manages to waste it throughout the film's over-stretched 155-minute running time. Yes, it might be fun to watch de Niro hamming it up as a retired CIA officer with an obsession for surveillance; or witness Hoffman overact fearfully as a middle-aged man pretending to be young; or look at Stiller trying and failing to keep the two families on an even keel. But when the film ends up trying to get laughs out of a libidinous chihuahua chasing an aggressive cat, we sense the desperation running through it. The best part about it comes right at the end, when Owen Wilson turns in a cameo as Kevin Rawley, charged with the responsibility of marrying the (un)lucky couple; through eye-work alone he manages to raise more laughs than in the previous 110 or so minutes."

","In 2004, half of the 10 highest-grossing movies were sequels to previous box-office winners released less than 2 or 3 years before: ""Shrek 2"", ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", ""Spider-Man 2"", ""Ocean Twelve"" and naturally, ""Meet the Fockers"". It's also worth noticing that four of these five sequels were second installments. Obviously, you don't change a winning recipe is a motto followed by many producers, and who can blame them in an industry driven by money and profit?<br/><br/>But I'm not trying to be cynical, not yet. The reason I raise these statistics is because they prove indeed that the sequel of a good movie will always attract viewers, as if it was covering half-of the marketing budget just by being a sequel. The trick is to follow a pattern that succeeded and inject enough newness to surprise the viewers. The point is to never get too distant from the original material and still be new. Well, that can work with plot-driven movies and linear narrative; however, it's more difficult to be original when a film is the continuation of a situation-driven comedy, like ""Meet the Parents"".<br/><br/>The original film was about being an outsider, about a clash resulting from a triangular love : Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) loved his girlfriend, Pam (Teri Polo), Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) loved his daughter, so both guys had to get along despite their different mentalities. Naturally, at the end, they both started to appreciate each other, the peace pipe was smoked and all went well that ended well, so there had to be another plot device for the comic-of-opposition, so after an exhaustive brainstorm they thought: how about discovering Greg's family? And the casting of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as the Fockers' couple retired in Hawaii, could only be encouraging.<br/><br/>The effect would be doubled, first we have to replay the games with equal rules, it's time for good old Jack Byrnes to learn about the Fockers' customs and philosophy of life, and put in perspective his 'personal' methods. How someone who believes his daughter never had sex before marriage would deal with a sex-therapist? How would a constipated, overly-protective man deal with spontaneous persons who believe in letting nature speaks, and people to follow their instincts? Secondly, it would be exciting to discover what kind of parents could raise a boy like Gaylord Focker.<br/><br/>The problem is that the two premises cancel each other, the Fockers' irritate Byrnes because they're free-spirited, open-minded, everything he's not, but that's the way they are, and they never try to be something else, it's mildly funny but it's nothing compared to Greg's attempt to please Jack that turns out to be disasters. The second problem is that the parents are so optimistic, so jovial and upbeat, she believes in sex as the greatest medium of expression, he's a lawyer who believes that winning is not the most essential thing, how could they end up conceiving a guy like Greg.<br/><br/>Maybe it was the only way to turn Greg into the victim of both his parents and in-laws, following an unnecessary subplot where Jack suspects Greg to have a child with his former nurse (Alana Urbach), it doesn't quite work, not better than the drugs allegations in the former one. At the end, what is left to enjoy in ""Meet the Fockers"" is very communicative performance from Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand and probably, one of the greatest child-acting performances ever, through the cute Little Jack who'd learn one word from Gaylord Focker.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, at the end, they marry, they celebrate the wedding, everyone's happy, but nothing is much left to enjoy, it's fun, but nothing else. There was a true potential to let the differences between the Byrnes and the Fockers to escalate until the kind of confrontation where even the Fockers would acknowledge some flaws in their education, something that would justify why Greg is so ashamed of them. There could have been a much more hilarious climax (literally) during the massage scene, but instead of having an orgasm, Jack hurts his back again and gets upset.<br/><br/>So many wasted opportunities, but well, except for Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, the film doesn't provide much more originality, except for the funniest part of the film, the opening where everything goes perfectly fine for Greg, from the taxis to the airports, that was a clever way to put some distance from the original one, a pity that the rest didn't match it. But I guess the first opus' success asked for a sequel, even with declining quality. <br/><br/>Did I mention ""Little Jack""? Yeah? So I guess it's time to conclude this review.<br/><br/>."

","I love Meet the Fockers! Love everything about it. It's so funny! More so so very good. Every scene is great. Maybe it's not as funny as Meet the Parents the original. Nor as goooood......But personally, I love Meet the Fockers by far more. And nothing personal against the original. Meet the Fockers has a greater cast is all. Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman as Rozalin and Bernie Focker is exactly what this sequel needed. Oh my Gosh, they are so funny. The best! They interact hilariously with Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner as Jack and Dina Byrnes, who are great! I love them! There is a real lovely chemistry happening between Danner, De Niro, Hoffman, and Streisand, and those four stars make this movie. I love Ben Stiller as Greg Focker. He's great. But Stiller takes a backseat to the shenanigans of Greg and Pam's parents. ""Honey, I'm in the mood for a chimichanga. So make a chimichanga!"" Bernie and Roz are the funniest! Stiller does a fine job holding his own against such great actors, and Teri Polo does too. Dustin Hoffman is phenomenal. Barbra Streisand stills looks so very crazily attractive. Robert De Niro completely falls into his character for his comedic role as Jack Byrnes giving the character great depth making Jack Byrnes intensely interesting but in such at sometime a little offbeat for a comedy but still I feel mostly appropriately light for a comedy allowing the character to be..........attractive. Speaking of attractive! Blythe Danner!...Oh my God! Simply lovely. Simply beautiful. She is the most gorgeous. Oh, goodness. Barbra, I think I'm getting a little verklempt. Talk amongst yourselves. Here I'll give you a topic. Blythe Danner is the sexiest woman alive. Discuss! I love you, Blythe! Teri Polo returns to her role as Pam and couldn't be sweeter or sincerer. Meet the Fockers is the real best. It has great heart. One of my favorite comedies. One of my favorite movies too! I can watch it a million times and it will always be funny because it never gets old! ""Honey, I'm in the mood for a chimichanga. So make a chimichanga!"""

They all go to meet Gaylord's parents--Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Razalin (Barbra Streisand). His parents are liberal and free-wheeling--hers aren't. Sparks fly.<br/><br/>The only reason I saw this was for the cast. We have some wonderful actors here--De Niro, Hoffman, Danner and Streisand. They all can do comedy and make the movie pleasant. All in all it's very OK. It moves quick, the comedy isn't too crude (hence the PG-13 rating) and Stiller and Polo make a nice pleasant couple. My only problems are Stiller's character going through some needlessly violent slapstick, De Niro's character is WAY too unpleasant (especially at the end) and the beautiful Danner is criminally underused. Still it works as a nice mild comedy."

","The second Focker film takes the growing relationships further by introducing Greg's parents to the Byrnes' mother and father. Things don't go off without a hitch or ten as both parties take a different approach to lifestyles and parenting: one free-spirited, the other planned.<br/><br/>The name ""Greg Focker"" should be synonymous with disaster. Everywhere he goes and every situation he finds himself in causes more accidents to take place than student drivers on road tests. You can expect almost everything to go wrong and trying to figure out where it's coming from involves some obvious setups but also a number of curve balls to throw the viewer off. This is also filled with one-off zingers that you might not expect, though they pass through with cartoonish shock instead of a rewarding layered buildup.<br/><br/>Jack Byrnes is a three-step ahead guy at his core, down to the blueprints of his armored RV to get to the tropical Focker residence with Greg's parents awaiting with open arms and liberal views. Barbra Streisand, playing Rozalin Focker, injects the first strong female personality that doesn't act like a wallflower with her open advice as a sexual therapist. Greg soon becomes a referee to separate the tension and anxiety with both parties attempting to either humble themselves to accommodate or change the other person to their own way. One can relate to him as embarrassing moments are brought up, such as a wall of ""accomplishments,"" a detailed scrap book and even revealing his first time. New characters are introduced, including the little grandson of Greg's girlfriend's sister who's training for brilliance, as well as the seductive nanny with spiced up accent and a questionable son.<br/><br/>The characters often play their roles deadpan with chaos going on around them. This takes serious subjects about relationships and puts an over-the-top spin on them. Compared to ""Meet the Parents,"" it's much more outlandish, though with more scenarios that ring with Saturday morning cartoon flavor than what could really happen. This slips in some messages without getting too serious or sentimental that deal with compromising your differences to get along with others and splitting away from the life your parents preplanned for you. The second film was somewhat entertaining and came with some memorable scenes, though it doesn't hold the freshness and power of the first film even with some of the same jokes retreaded."

","I think the funniest character in this movie is an unlikely one. It was the baby. Gaylord was up to his usual shenanigans again because of the pressure he is under to please his future father in law. The highlight of the movie was the contrast in lifestyles and generally mentalities of the Focker family and the Byrnes family. The Fockers think that the Barnes family is uptight and the Byrnes family think that the Focker family leaves a lot to be desired in terms of disciplines and principles. The baby, the pets and of course Pam and Gaylord are caught in the middle of this fiasco trying to please both families. It makes for an interesting story line where at the end a resolution must be made for the sake of the happiness of Gaylord and his wife to be of course centering on Jack's ability to yield and compromise for the sake of his daughter's future. I would definitely recommend this one for a night of laughs and humor. Personally I think it was more intriguing than Meet the Parents."

Following the exploits of the previous film, ""Meet The Parents"", Gaylord Focker, Ben Stiller, introduces his fiancée's parents, excellently portrayed by Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner to his family, with the obvious humorous consequences.<br/><br/>Dustin Hoffman is on form and Barbra Streisand, who I honestly cannot recall seeing in anything but this franchise in the last twenty years, is not bad either as the laid-back titular Fockers. Stiller's and his lies are sidelined here, as the focus is on the conflict between the parents themselves, but all is resolved by the end, obviously and even though Owen Wilson's cameo is pretty contrived and we could have done without it, it had its moments.<br/><br/>""Meet The Fockers"" is marginally better than ""Meet The Parents"", I think because the characters boundaries were more clearly defined, the jokes were funnier and tended to be less reliant on the awkwardness. This lighter offering was more than worth the watch and made me laugh which all you can ask from a comedy."

De Niro's character is very conservative, so let's make these guys ultra-liberal, it's kinda easy. Still, the movie has a sort of inherent sweetness, which mainly becomes apparent near the ending.

Maybe I was just in a more receptive mood when I saw this sequel - the humour is undoubtedly of the toilet variety - but I found myself chuckling out loud on a number of occasions while watching this which is something that doesn't happen too often these days.<br/><br/>Dustin Hoffman makes the biggest impression with his laid-back hippyish father of the bridegroom, while Robert De Niro plays his familiar rigid stick-in-the-mud. De Niro doesn't come out of their interplay too well here to be honest; Hoffman easily overshadows him and he really looks like he's waiting for knocking-off time for much of the film. Mind you, that could be said for many of his performances these days: his choice of roles has proved fairly dubious since Di Caprio replaced him as Scorsese's favourite actor, and perhaps that's why he so often looks jaded on-screen.<br/><br/>Barbra Streisand comes out of screen retirement to play Ben Stiller's sex therapist mother and you have to wonder why. Any number of competent (but less iconic) actresses could have played the role as there isn't really that much screen time - or laughs - given to her.<br/><br/>While it might not manage to sustain its pace throughout its slightly over-long running time, Meet the Fokkers proves to be entertaining enough to prevent you from feeling you've been wasting your time."

","'Meet the Fockers' means meeting Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. That's all you have to know, and that's the best part of the film, of which script is utterly lame, and of which set-pieces are not as funny as they should be. But the Fockers, I mean, the husband and wife played by Hoffman and Streisand are so lovable, silly, and most of all, believable that you can forget all the unnecessary part of the film, and enjoy yourself watching the vintage comic acting from the couple. Greg, no, Gaylord (Ben Stiller) and Pam (Teri Polo) come back as the lovers who are going to marry soon. This time, they have a bigger problem than before, and that is that they have to introduce the uptight father of the future bride, ex-CIA agent Jack to the parents of the Fockers. And the two Fockers house husband Bernie and sex therapist Roz (Hoffman and Streisand) are far from ordinary parents, who can casually talk about the 'first time' of their much, much beloved son at the dinner. And to Greg's dismay, they are truly enjoying the embarrassing conversations. And it is only natural that Jack find them a lot more embarrassing and even rude when ex-hippie Bernie makes fun of CLIA (L stands for 'lack of') right before the proud Jack. The ice never breaks between the two families when they pretend it does, and the awkward relations, which get more and more awkward as the story goes on, are seen in the center of the comedy. Unfortunately however, the script never gels. It has sparks sometimes, but clearly we see misfires oftener. There are several reasons for that ineffectiveness. Ben Stiller and Teri Polo do not look like a couple loving each other, and there are too many familiar kinds of gags involving toilet, dirty words, and a baby. To me, the greatest problem is that all the set-pieces are tired retread of 'Meet the Parents.' Instead of volleyball in the original, you see football. If a cat is not good enough, there is a dog. And I admit Robert DeNiro is good, and I can say he is as good as in the first one, but don't you think that he is doing too many comedies these days? But the couple of Hoffman and Streisand is a different thing, special gift from these veterans. They almost single-handedly save the film from the uninspired mess with their hilarious comic acting. The actors themselves may not be your favorite, but you should forget your liking or disliking for now, because these parents are so charming and credible. Especially Dustin Hoffman does one of his best performances in recent years. Probably the character of Bernie is so close to his own that some seem to say that the way Hoffman keeps on bubbling funny nonsense is exactly the impression we have about him during his interviews, and you can believe their words simply by watching the extraordinary but likable character he plays. Obviously Hoffman is in his element. Despite the weak script and the weaker husband-wife descriptions of Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner, 'Meet the Fockers' is better than I expected. Of course, that does not mean very much when I usually don't expect much from the sequels. But the family of 'The Fockers' of the film's title are genuinely fun to see, and I am ready to revisit their home, even if I didn't find the film itself particularly great."

","I loved 'Meet the parents'. It was a great movie. My sister purchased the double box set, with 'Meet the fockers' included.<br/><br/>After re watching the first movie to set the vibe, I was looking forward to watching the sequel, that I had not yet seen, straight afterwards.<br/><br/>What a disappointment.<br/><br/>The first thing I will say is that 'Meet the fockers' just doesn't have the same charm and warmth of the first movie. The gags seem more desperate and the whole thing just seems kind of forced.<br/><br/>The original characters persona's are slightly different too.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller's role has changed. In the first movie, he is the guy who can do nothing right, as he struggles to try and impress the respectable, stuck up and perfect father of his girlfriend, and has to try and fit in with their snobbish friends and family, who all seem to share the same attitude and persona as De Niro. Seeing him fail at everything is hilarious viewing. In 'Meet the fockers' he is no longer the lovable fool, but is reduced to being the man stuck in the middle of a clash between his parents and his future father in law, whilst being the butt of a few 'nurse' and 'focker' jokes that we've all heard before. Slight glimmers of his former role are still there, as he fails to win over the affections of jinx the cat, and the unlikable grandson of De Niro, but its not enough.<br/><br/>Next is the role of De Niro. They seem to have turned him in to more of an oddball in this film. It was slightly there in the first movie, but not stressed as much, as most of it was down to his former job. They play on his 'zany' side, and that respectability, and upper class mentality seems to have vanished. He has been reduced to a strange obsessive guy, who just appears to be an unsociable grump. He becomes the butt of Stillers parents jokes, when you expected it to be the other way round. He spends half the movie biting his tongue, when the guy we know from the first movie would have been straight in there running his mouth and belittling them, as he tries to make them conform to his extra high standards. The chemistry between him and Stiller is not the same.<br/><br/>The addition of Stiller's parents, Streisand and Hoffman, seemed like a great idea, and fireworks were expected. It just didn't really work. There was little chemistry between Stiller and his parents, especially noticeable, between him and his father. There are so many missed opportunities (which I won't list because this is a standard review) that would have been great. De Niro was reduced to being the weaker character, which was not a smart move. A guy like him can not be changed with such ease, which made the whole thing unrealistic, as did the over the top performances from Streisand and Hoffman.<br/><br/>Teri Polo gets pushed to the back in this movie, and there's not much that can really be said about her role. The 'loyal' and 'loving' fiancée is the only way to describe her really. She seemed more dominant and head strong in the first movie.<br/><br/>Bylthe Danner's character (De Niro's wife) has been reduced to an impressionable and kinda goofy women who adopts the 'Focker' way of life from the word go, and totally forgets any morals or values she held before. Once again, unlikely.<br/><br/>Missing characters from the first movie, such as the pot head younger brother (who has been sent away to military school), Pams sister and her husband, Owen Wilson and Jacks snobbish best friends, make the Brynes clan incomplete.<br/><br/>Owen Wilson's cameo at the end was weak, as his character had also changed, and is no longer the jealous, rich, stylish high flyer that we remembered. He seems to have become spiritual, and is a different man.<br/><br/>The addition of Jack's grandson was weak, and he got far too much screen time, also giving the movie a childish feel.<br/><br/>I barely cracked a smile through this movie. The jokes were unfunny and limited, as well as being rather predictable and cheap.<br/><br/>Gags from the first movie are simply reused and modified, which is kind of lazy in my opinion. Either that, or they were trying to purposely copy the first movie because it worked.<br/><br/>The whole thing was abit of a mess, mainly due to poor writing and directing.<br/><br/>Now for the positive things....<br/><br/><ul><li>Jinx the cat was on form.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There were a few funny moments, including a scene with a power hungry policeman, who has his own way of laying down the law.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Glimpes of the 'Secret agent Jack' are still there.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Ben Stiller is still quite funny.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Surprisingly manages to hold your attention throughout.</li></ul><br/><br/>If you loved the first movie, then you have to watch the sequel really, because it is worth a watch.<br/><br/>I have been quite brutal with this review, but its not so bad that I would tell people to avoid it, as the movie is OK. Its just that the standard was set high with the first movie, and the sequel was disappointing, hence the low score.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 10 from me :)"

Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streishand do an excellent job as playing the Fockers and the constant humor makes this movie a very satisfying one. Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller all pair as very great leading men material in this comedy, they have a decent chemistry mixed between all of their separate experiences in movies.<br/><br/>10/10, not as good as the original but still worth watching many times."

"zardoz-13","10","0","0","18 June 2008"," ""MTF"" evokes more laughs than its side-splitting predecessor.
","Anybody who laughed themselves silly watching the Ben Stiller & Robert De Niro in-laws farce ""Meet The Parents"" (2000) will probably find its long-overdue sequel ""Meet The Fockers"" incredibly hilarious from fade-in to fade-out. Rare remains the sequel that surpasses the original, but ""MTF"" evokes more laughs than its side-splitting predecessor. Not surprisingly, ""MTF"" gets even more mileage out of the suggestively obscene surname of the Ben Stiller protagonist: Greg Focker. For example, we learn about Greg's cousins: Randy and Orney as well as his uncle Dom. In fact, director Jay Roach convinced the Motion Picture Producers of America (the MPPA) to let the title stand, because some families have Focker as their last name! Whether the family name appears on a caller ID or a book cover, the filmmakers never miss a chance to use the name for the sake of comedy. Furthermore, much of the laughter this time around arises from lowest common denominator gags of the ""American Pie"" variety rather than the catastrophic Murphy's Laws lunacy of ""MTP."" Good sequels build on the foundation of the original, and the highlight of ""MTF"" is the inspired casting of Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffman as Ben Stiller's parents. Streisand hasn't had this much loopy fun on-screen since 1972 when she drove Ryan O'Neal nuts in Peter Bogdanovich's ""What's Up, Doc?"" Meanwhile, Dustin Hoffman of ""Tootsie"" steals the show with his outrageously energetic antics. You've never see Hoffman as hammy as he is here. When they appear together in a scene, Hoffman and Streisand dominate it, even with DeNiro in the same room. In ""MTP,"" Ben Stiller struggled to make a good impression on his fiancée's uptight, WASPy father, a recently retired CIA psychological profiler (Robert DeNiro of ""Analyze This"") who took an immediate dislike to him because he was a male nurse. In ""MTF,"" Stiller finds himself caught in the middle between his own loony-tunes parents and his suspicious future father-in-law. One-fourth of the humor is watching Stiller act like a referee, the second-fourth is the Streisand/Hoffman casting as his crazy folks, the third-fourth is DeNiro making a boob out of himself, and the last fourth is a top-drawer performance by twins Spencer and Bradley as Little Jack.<br/><br/>No, you don't really need to have seen ""MTP"" to laugh your fanny off at ""MTF."" If you like to laugh out loud, and crude, uncouth clowning doesn't offend you, you'll have a giddy good time. Basically, scenarists John Herzfeld and John Hamburg (who penned the original) have recycled the same predicament, but they put Robert DeNiro's Jack Byrnes at the mercy of Greg's parents, Bernie and Roz (Dustin Hoffman & Barbara Streisand), rather than making Greg the butt of all the jokes. One of the funnier Greg jokes is the revelation about how our hero lost his virginity. The dinner scene where one of Greg's treasured keepsakes from the baby delivery room that his parents have preserved is another. As the film unspools, Jack has agreed grudgingly to meet Greg's parents. Instead of flying off to Florida to meet the Fockers, Jack hauls his wife Dina (Blythe Danner of ""The Prince of Tides""), their grandson Little Jack (twins Spencer & Bradley Picken) along with Pam (Teri Polo of ""Mystery Date"") and Greg in an RV that resembles something out of a James Bond spy thriller. Yes, Jack cooks up a scene here as good as the lie-detector test in ""MTP."" The impressionable grandson belongs to Pam's nephew, and Little Jack is so young that Jack still prefers to feed him freshly-pumped mother's milk from a life-like breast prosthesis that the elder Jack wears strapped across his chest like a shoulder holster. You guessed it, ""MTP"" contains gross, physical humor. The sight of a closely-cropped, scowling Robert DeNiro of ""Taxi Driver"" fame sporting a single, false female breast had the audience that I sat with howling for their lives. Thoroughly manipulative as always, Jack intends to raise Little Jack using the denial method. In other words, Jack doesn't indulge Little Jack. He tenders him tough love. No TV. No candy. No Sympathy. When they meet Roz and Bernie, Jack and Dina confront their worse nightmare. Roz earns her living as a sex therapist who writes self-help books like ""Is Your Vagina Happy?"" and ""Meet Your Orgasm."" Bernie is a former lawyer turned house-husband who loves to lock the doors and cover Roz with shaving cream. Another sight-gag that comes into good use is a hat that Bernie hangs on the bedroom door knob. As free-wheeling, hippies from the 1960s, you can imagine how they crate on poor Jack and criticize his parenting methods. When Jack isn't looking, Bernie and Roz spoil Little Jack. Alas, when bad luck prone Greg tries to spoil Little Jack, he accidentally teaches the toddler a profane word that the little guy does his level best to wear out in front of everybody.<br/><br/>Director Jay Roach (who helmed the ""Austin Powers"" trilogy) gets away with more than you'd think this time. One subplot involves a toilet-trained kitty and a small dog with an addiction to sex. Combine the two and imagine the worst. The scene where Roz gives Jack a massage is probably the funniest that you'll ever see Barbara Streisand in with an actor the stature of Robert DeNiro. Sure, the humor is slapstick but it rarely stops slapping. The only drawback to a classic like ""MTF"" is that too many people will still be laughing when crucial dialogue is delivered immediately after a joke. Altogether, rude, crude, and contagiously funny, ""Meet the Fockers"" will knock you off your rocker!"
"EUyeshima","5","0","0","17 April 2008"," Streisand and Hoffman Lend Buoyancy as Mother and Father Focker in a Minor League Comedy
","It shouldn't be too big a surprise that this movie is a fairly mediocre Hollywood confection, but I did have a whimper of a hope that this was going to be an edgier social commentary given the comedy potential of the situation. Alas, it would be too much to expect director Jay Roach to be in the same league as David O. Russell or Alexander Payne given that his track record is mostly made up of Austin Powers movies. I never saw the original ""Meet the Parents"", so luckily I don't have that point of comparison, but one can easily fill in the blanks with this soft-centered sequel. Written by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg, the plot seems ready-made from an instant pudding mix. Having given permission to Gaylord Focker to marry their daughter Pam, the white-bread Byrnes family from Oyster Bay now prepares to meet their new in-laws in Florida (of course).<br/><br/>Simple enough, but the big surprise is that Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand (third and fourth-billed, no less) seem to be having such a great time playing Bernie and Roz Focker that you can almost overlook the script deficiencies. Each had auspicious film debuts over 35 years ago (he in ""The Graduate"", she in ""Funny Girl""), and they have known each other since their struggling New York days in the early sixties. That history is helpful in explaining their natural chemistry here, and you're left wondering why these two never worked together before. Streisand, in particular, seems relaxed as a free-wheeling, caftan-wearing, opinionated sex therapist, which seems like a send-up of her self-important psychiatrist in her own ""The Prince of Tides"". For once, she's not bathed in candlelight in some Harlequin romance with a blonde gentile unable to commit. Rather, she lends credibility to a grounded character in an often hilariously passionate marriage to a physical and intellectual equal, and at certain moments in this film, I don't think I've liked Streisand more on screen.<br/><br/>If Hoffman seems less surprising, it's only because he has already proved to be a masterful comic actor with ""Tootsie"" and ""Wag the Dog"". Even when the running gags (a passion for capoeira, overzealous displays of affection) get tired, he still imbues his caricature with a zestful spirit. The remaining elements of the film seem tired in comparison, and unfortunately I have to include the original stars. Perhaps it's because they are recycling behavior that would be hard to refresh a second time. Robert DeNiro's tiresome portrayal of Jack Byrnes, the intimidating ex-CIA spook, is particularly disappointing and not so much because the actor is slumming (which he is) but because his character works on only one motivation, to humiliate and eventually eject his future son-in-law from the ""circle of trust"". There are hints that the summit meeting of Hoffman, DeNiro and Streisand would turn into something more substantial, but the sitcom dimensions of the script quickly extinguish the possibilities. Ben Stiller, who is the actual protagonist of this comedy, seems to be sitting back as his character, Gaylord, recedes into the background. He has exactly one funny scene on his own, when he spouts his honest feelings after being injected with a ""truth serum"".<br/><br/>The whole subplot with Gaylord being accused of fathering his former family housekeeper's son seems tired and superfluous. I like Blythe Danner as Jack's wife, Dina, looking to resuscitate some spark in their marriage, and Teri Polo, who actually seems sharp and worthwhile as the fiancée at the center of the story. But neither is given much to do except a funny scene where Roz uses hand puppets to teach Dina how to get sex out of Jack. If seeing DeNiro wearing a homemade rubber ""manary gland"" sounds hilarious, by all means go see this movie. For me, it just made me think how it would be great to see Hoffman and Streisand re-team in a James Brooks comedy, how DeNiro should go back to Scorsese for career guidance and how Stiller may want to take a break before he plays yet another nebbish character. By the way, I'm guessing Streisand's ""A Star Is Born""-era hairdo is an in-joke to her partner since her character's name was Esther Hoffman. Now that's the kind of subtlety this comedy needed.<br/><br/>The 2005 DVD features two versions of the film - the theatrical cut and a completely unnecessary extended cut, which edits in several deleted scenes. Like the DVD treatment for ""Ray"", the additions are announced to the viewer through a blinking gimmick and consequently inhibit the flow of the narrative. It's better to see these understandably excised scenes separate from the film. Roach and editor/co-producer Jon Poll provide a so-so commentary track, and there is also a fitfully funny blooper reel. Several disposable shorts are included, among them ""Fockers' Family Portrait"" featuring brief snippets from Hoffman, Streisand and Stiller; a behind-the-scenes look at Jinx the Cat (""Inside the Litter Box""); another behind-the-scenes look, this time at the infant (""The Adventures of a Baby Wrangler""); a five-minute featurette on ""The Manary Gland""; and a Today Show interview with the entire cast."

","Ben Stiller (Zoolander) stars as Greg Gaylord Focker, an uncomfortable man who takes his fiancé's family to meet his parents, who prove to be quite different people than Jack Byrnes (De Niro) would ever imagine. The sequel to the popular 2000 hit comedy Meet the Parents is intriguing, if slightly bizarre and predictable, with a strong cast leading the way.<br/><br/>Very similar to Meet the Parents, this sequel uses physical humour, embarrassing situations and a variety of characters to justify the comedy genre and does so well enough with a few good moments involving Ben Stiller. However it does feel very comparable to the last film and like so many other comedies, it is a tried and tested format but works well enough.<br/><br/>Like the first film, its all about meeting people who are very different and the contrasts work well, with Hoffman's (Rain Man) and Streisand's very unique way of living compared to Byrne's professional and organised way of life, its interesting to observe different lifestyles.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly consistent with up and down moments but coming towards the end it really goes off track and exaggerates a bit.<br/><br/>The acting is good enough, though with the list of A-listers here you would no doubt expect better.<br/><br/>The direction isn't the best though the settings are good, and the use bus is interesting to see and a unique device.<br/><br/>Overall its an average comedy with a few good jokes. The acting and direction isn't the best but it's the writing that lets the film down the most with not enough intensity and interest to really get the characters going."

","Even though I had no memory of the previous film, besides the obvious moments (e.g. dropping the mother's ashes), I had a feeling this wasn't going to be better. From director Jay Roach (Austin Powers) this sequel has its tiny moments of hilarity, but not enough concentration on a story. Basically Gaylord Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) has had to put up with meeting the parents of his fiancée Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo), more prominently the uptight ex-CIA father Jack (Robert De Niro). But now he has to deal with Pam's parents meeting Greg's before any wedding can take place. Greg's father Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) is the retired hippie lawyer, and his mother Roz (Barbra Streisand) is the open sex therapist. Greg obviously wants to keep his dignity, and make the Byrnes accept them, and the fact that they will have to get along after the wedding, if there's gonna be one! Also starring Blythe Danner as Dina Byrnes, Tim Blake Nelson as Officer Le Flore and Owen Wilson as Kevin Rawley. As I said, there are some amusing moments, most of them coming from Hoffman and Streisand, but I don't think anyone should bother with this film, apart from seeing the couple get married of course, a disappointing comedy sequel.

But for me, I didn't enjoy much, or at all, and I longed to see him with (De Niro) in something good, that has an exigency instead of THIS!<br/><br/>Well, I liked the idea of the movie itself as a sequel. Because after the torture of the bridegroom in part one, by the hands of that serious rigorous intelligence man, now we have the opportunity to witness the opposite when we see the torture of that old officer by the hands of that bridegroom's family.

Meanwhile, the Burns are Christian, conservative, and live in cold New England. You can imagine the gap that has to be bridged between these two families. <br/><br/>They might never have crossed paths (and probably would have been happier!) but their children fell in love in the Big Apple and are planning to marry.<br/><br/>Gaylord Fokker, played by Ben Stiller, has grown up to be a nurturer himself, just like his stay at home father.

For fans of the first film, this should be a treat! <br/><br/>For me, I'm getting my fill of Ben Stiller. He doesn't seem to really have a lot of range and his style isn't so amazing. What's the last great film he had? I loved ""Dodgeball"" and his cameos are always nice (""Happy Gilmore"", for example) but he seems to play the same guy over and over (Gaylord Focker really isn't much different from the Ben Stiller in ""There's Something About Mary"").<br/><br/>Also, this film relies almost entirely on potty humor. Some people will really be happy about the humor, whereas I prefer a more witty and sarcastic film. Cats flushing toilets, sexual elderly people, fake breasts. Not my sort of thing, really.<br/><br/>The film was a good pace, so it was easily watchable even if it wasn't my style. And the addition of Dustin Hoffman to the cast was great. Robert DeNiro really runs the plot (I think he overshadows Stiller on many occasions), but Dustin Hoffman is the gem here. (In a recent review for ""Stranger Than Fiction"", I say much the same thing. But it's true -- Hoffman has a subtlety about him where he blends perfectly into his roles and seems more lifelike than the rest of the cast.) <br/><br/>Barbara Streisand was also nice, which is odd because she's Barbra Streisand. The rest of the cast was unremarkable (though I must give credit to the casting director or whoever found the Jorge character... great job).<br/><br/>If you're into Ben Stiller and/or ""Meet The Parents"", you'll get something out of this.

"pacoruban","5","0","0","26 December 2006"," Great cast of actors....but just not very funny
","""Meet the Fockers"" casts a group of actors who had the potential to make this movie very funny indeed: Robert DeNiro showed that he could do comedy very well in ""Meet the Parents"" and ""Analyze This"", I love Dustin Hoffmann's movies in general, and of course, Ben Stiller is a veteran of many crazy comedies.<br/><br/>However, the main problem with this movie is the script. I was even more puzzled with the poor writing after seeing that the script for ""Fockers"" was written by exactly the same people as ""Parents"". What happened? Was the original just a one-off for them or were they pressured into rushing through a sequel? The jokes and subplots are rehashes of the ones from the the original movie: e.g. we now have a Football match in the Fockers' garden instead of the water polo game (but with different people getting injured) and the ""big secret"" in the sequel involves Pam's pregnancy instead of a fake Mr Jinx. The producers must have decided that since the original jokes were so successful, a winning formula should not be tampered with. There could have been golden moments in this movie. Over dinner, Hoffmann and DeNiro are about to become engaged in an argument over the CIA (or the ""CLIA"" as Hoffmann puts it -- Central Lack of Intelligence Agency). I was really looking forward to the confrontation, but it was never played out to the full. What a pity.<br/><br/>It was during the final 20-30 minutes of the movie that the quality really took a nose dive. I found the part involving Greg's potential bastard son, Jorge, very forced. It was as if Jorge was introduced into the plot just to embarrass Greg. Also, the Highway Patrol Officer character at the end was terribly overacted...perhaps this was supposed to make the movie more funny (if so, I don't think it worked)? One of the main strengths of the original movie is that characters like Jack Byrnes and the Annoying Air Stewardess are somewhat believable. Perhaps the characters are slightly exaggerated but we've all seen people who have a Jack Byrnes streak about them. As a result, Jorge and the Officer don't really have a place in this movie.<br/><br/>Still, the main characters save this film from being truly mediocre. The interactions between Hoffmann, DeNiro, Streisand and Stiller is fun (but not, unfortunately, funny) to watch. Wouldn't it be great to have a Dad like Bernard Focker (but perhaps a *little* less zany)?! I loved that he practices capoeira -- that's a classic =). Also the beginning of the movie involving the journey to the Byrnes' house was quite funny for me because, unexpectedly, everything goes completely smoothly! The Annoying Air Stewardess makes a brief reappearance, but she's not so annoying this time.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is fun to watch for the main characters. Unfortunately, it's fairly devoid of laughs in general."

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>I actually saw Meet The Fockers first, not Meet The Parents. I love Meet The Fockers, so I saw the original. I liked this one better. It is way more funny than Meet the Parents, and come on, Greg's parents are embarrassing to watch. You actually feel sorry for Greg. I mean, his fiancée's parents meet his wacky parents, it is really disturbing. His parents might be the most embarrassing parents ever.<br/><br/>Here is the plot of this film. Greg is engaged to Pam. Unfortuanely for Greg she and her parents want to meet Greg's parents. They travel to Florida in Pam's father Jack's RV. Like I said before, Greg's parents turn out to be really embarrassing. I think you what I mean. Anyway, Jack does not really like Greg's parents. Unfortuanely for Greg again he finds out that Pam is pregnant. Pam does not want her father to know that she is. They reschedule their wedding. Then Jack finds a teenager that he thinks he is Greg's son. He gives Greg truth serum. Greg admits that Pam is pregnant to Jack. Then Jack finds out that the teenager is not Greg's son. He wants to leave. He drives off in his RV. Greg and his father go after him. They all are arrested. They get out and Greg marries Pam.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very funny film and is very good. Like I said they are hugely embarrassing moments in this film that you would not want to watch. Also there is a really good scene in which Greg needs to babysit Pam's nephew. It goes all wrong. Little Jack, which is the nephew, learns a profanity, watches Scarface, and gets glue all over him. Anyway, this is a laugh-out-loud film.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>Recommended Films: Meet the Parents."

","SPOILERS THROUGH:<br/><br/>The last thing I expected was to like the sequel to ""Meet The Parents"", a movie I didn't even like that much and that I thought was over rated. Yet I did like the sequel, ""Meet The Fockers"" very much. And that's unusual for me. I don't even usually watch sequels, let alone from movies I didn't like that much in the first place. But this movie is very funny, in a belly laughing kind of way, not a great movie, but a fun entertaining One.<br/><br/>The main reason I liked this was the same reason I didn't like the first one. With the first one, there were Plenty of laughs but it was always at Greg's expense and there was a meanness present that was a major turn off. It was almost a black comedy but one I thought was highly over rated. With Fockers, although some meanness is present, the pureness of comedy is much stronger then the first one. People play off each other not against each other, and you laugh with them rather then at them. There is some very good comedy in this and another reason is because the characters are very funny in and of themselves but in a way that is accessible to the audience and easy to relate to.<br/><br/>The Fokker's themselves are real, fully developed people and Hoffman and Streisand are utterly hilarious. They work incredibly together and project a sense of fun as well as going for the comedic. It was tremendously enjoyable watching them and seeing the zany antics they and the rest of the cast, got up to. The movie moved smoothly as well, the pace was excellent and the laughs, while not constant, were very funny when they did happen.<br/><br/>De Niro I thought was excellent in the first one and here he is still great. This is one where nobody really outshines the other though, and even the supporting cast(the baby, the police officer etc) were hilarious. The Fokker's are one of those families one just wants to see more of. Their fun, their funny, and even Ben Stiller, who I'm not a major fan of, came across as tremendously likable and much more fun then in the first one. I'm drawing comparisons because it seems like many people preferred ""Meet The Parents"" over ""Meet The Fockers"" and with me it's the other way around. I'd give this movie an easy 7.<br/><br/>The scene where Greg, gets up and starts telling the truth was hysterical and reminded me a bit of ""Liar Liar"". I would definitely recommend this movie. It was pleasant surprise to like a movie I went into thinking would be absolutely terrible."

","This does not even come close to being as funny as the first movie, however it still made me laugh. Hunky and Geeky Ben Stiller and Stern Overprotective Robert DeNiro are what really make the movie work. But of course the best performance of the movie came from ""Little Jack!"" What brings the movie downhill is the overdone outrageousness of Hoffman and Streisand. Sure we expect them to be much more liberal than DeNiro's family. However they are almost a little too crazy, and were actually quite irritating! Streisand is without question the most irritating person in the entire movie. There is a scene were she gives DeNiro a message and basically climbs on top of them. I'm sorry but I've never seen a message therapist like THAT before, this scene was pretty stupid, even for a comedy. Blythe Danner and a majority of the other characters are basically just their for the sake of being their. Danner was much funnier in the first movie.

"DavidSim240183","8","0","0","28 May 2006"," One of those sequels that grows on you.
","Meet the Parents is one of my all time favourite comedies. It was an hilarious escalation of humiliations for the hapless Ben Stiller, and proved that hard man Robert De Niro had a real talent for comedy. At the end of my review for MTP, I said I couldn't wait for the sequel. When I first saw Meet the Fockers, I was disappointed with it. It didn't provide the same gut-busting laugh out loud moments the first one had. I didn't touch the DVD for months after that. When it came onto Sky Digital just this weekend, I decided to give it another chance. And a strange thing happened. I found myself enjoying it.<br/><br/>The very next night, I put the DVD back in the player, and I enjoyed it a little more than before. I realised I had judged MTF a little too harshly. I'd just decided initially it lacked the zest of the original and left it at that. But what I came to find out is that the jokes are there alright, but it's altered its format from last time. Stupidly I was hoping for more of the same, when I should have noticed the film has adapted the plot of MTP to evolve the characters so they can encounter a whole new set of hurdles.<br/><br/>For anyone unfamiliar with MTP, it followed the story of Greg Focker and Pam Byrnes. Greg wanted to marry Pam, but first he had to win the approval of her stern, paranoid ex-CIA father Jack Byrnes. It was an uphill struggle to say the least. Desecrated mother remains, giving black eyes to family members, and even cat painting. But in the end, Greg and Jack finally met on equal ground, and Jack gave his blessing to the marriage.<br/><br/>Now its a short time later, and Greg has to introduce his parents to the Byrnes. Jack, Greg, Pam, Dina (Blythe Danner, Jack's wife), their grandson Little Jack and Mr Jinx the cat get in Jack's hi-tech RV and head off to Florida to meet the Fockers.<br/><br/>Bernie and Roz Focker (Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand) are a couple of ultra liberal hippies who insist on sharing everything. They are especially proud of their son and show it in a shrine dedicated to him, complete with 9th place ribbons. Bernie was a lawyer, but when Greg was born he took paternity leave and never went back to work. Roz is a sex therapist who specialises in helping geriatrics meet their orgasm.<br/><br/>Oil and water doesn't even enter into it. MTF has a similar structure to MTP. Their are various dinner table scenes that lead to embarrassments for Greg (look out for the foreskin on the fondue), the volleyball game of MTP has been replaced with a game of football that gets a bit too competitive, and a final heart to heart (to heart) in a prison cell.<br/><br/>In some ways, MTF could be regarded as rehashing what made the original so funny. But it isn't really. It's given whole new dimensions with the inclusion of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. Their casting was inspired because they make such a believable husband and wife, and there is real affection between them. You buy every scene they share together. Even the scenes with whipped cream.<br/><br/>One thing I liked about MTF is the fact it kept the focus on this tight little circle. The original's only fault was it kept the focus on De Niro and Stiller and neglected the other characters. But here all of them are given plenty to do. From Jack teaching LJ to talk (and later cursing, his first word is a curse word!), Dina getting in touch with her inner orgasm, Pam standing by her man through and through, Greg getting doped up on truth serum and even Jinx gets fresh with the Focker's dog Moses. In more ways than one.<br/><br/>This film and the first are like an extended episode of Frasier. The way farcical situations are explored to logical conclusions. Pam turns out to be pregnant, and the plot follows how everybody finds out, except for Jack. Filled with mix ups, mixed signals and wrong impressions, there is also a running gag about a son that Greg may have fathered to the Fockers housekeeper Isabelle. The resemblance is strong, but as is often the case with the Byrnes/Focker clan, things are seldom as they seem in the Circle of Trust.<br/><br/>Not all the gags hit the mark. Jack's manary gland starts off amusing but gets overused. Jack, Bernie and Greg all getting arrested feels rather contrived. It doesn't quite have the explosive satisfaction you got from the first film with Greg going loony at a stewardess (who makes a cameo in MTF's inspired opening scenes) and facing off with Jack.<br/><br/>It also feels about 20 minutes too long and could have done with some tighter editing. But MTF has some very endearing performances, and it does seem to improve with every viewing. Ben Stiller again proves what a great comedian he is with the way he can hold his own against so many seasoned veterans. It's also worth it to see Greg and Pam walk down the aisle, and there's an hilarious cameo from Owen Wilson as Kevin (MTP's scene stealer), Pam's ex.<br/><br/>I don't know if they intend to turn this into a trilogy, but if they do, at least that sounds far more interesting than the endless Matrix films or the sometimes overbearing Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Look out for a little Focker on the way."

","This sequel to the hit comedy MEET THE PARENTS exceeded everyone's wildest expectations when it grossed nearly $280 million at the US box office, and became the highest grossing live action comedy of all time. Although audiences seemed to love this lowbrow culture clash comedy, most film critics were seemingly merciless in their hatred of the film. In the end, the film is solidly enjoyable, and perhaps is even superior to the somewhat one-note original film. The picture ends up delivering more or less what it promises, so it's difficult to fathom exactly what type of movie that most critics and naysayers were expecting.<br/><br/>The likable Ben Stiller had been on a hot streak of successful films for a good five years or so before the release of FOCKERS, and he has emerged into a remarkably good straight man - managing to find laughs without pushing too hard. Robert De Niro, unarguably one the screen's finest dramatic actors of all-time, has staged an amazing third-quarter career revival as a comedic actor in the last few years, and he has never appeared more comfortable playing comedic aggression as he does here. The film's major casting ace, however, is the dynamic one-two punch of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as Stiller's free-wheeling parents. Hoffman and Streisand literally radiate with an irresistibly genuine warmth and a combustible comedic energy that completely steals every scene in which they appear; if there is to be a third FOCKER film, I hope that Hoffman and Streisand are given the starring roles!<br/><br/>If the film has a downside, it is certainly the often ho-hum nature of the script, which somehow manages to be somewhat unfocused and completely predictable at the same time. Also, I do wish that the film-makers had given the lovely Blythe Danner and Teri Polo more to do this time around, as they often seem heavily underutilized in the presence of heavy weights like De Niro, Hoffman, and Streisand. The film succeeds, however, thanks to it's ensemble of extremely likable character and it's powerhouse cast that overcomes even the most well-worn screenplay. While it will never be a critical favorite, MEET THE FOCKERS is an amusing, sometimes hilarious, farce that is much better than many of the so-called ""comedies"" of the last few years."

In the first movie we're introduced to Pam's parents; now we're going to meet Greg's. Played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand it seemed that they would be perfect complements to De Niro.

I must admit upon hearing there was going to be a sequel to MEET THE PARENTS, I expected something along the lines of watching Greg and Jack Burns (De Niro) learning how to get along as son-in-law and father-in-law, but this sequel skips right over that period of adjustment and has Greg and Jack almost friendly with each other as they prepare to meet their in-laws, who are nothing like the straight-laced Burns family. Bernie Focker (Hoffman) is a stay-at-home husband and wife Roz (Streisand) is a sexual therapist and naturally they are the polar opposites of Jack and Dina Burns, wild, free-spirited people who say what is on their mind at all times and don't seem to care if people hear them having sex in their bedroom. Personally, I think Hoffman practically steals this film as the fiercely loyal yet slightly demented Bernie Focker, whether it's defending his son's lack of scholastic achievements or working diligently at satisfying his wife's sexual appetite. Hoffman just seems to be having a ball here and it really shows in his performance and it's not easy stealing scenes from Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro but Hoffman does just that. Even Streisand is more controlled than usual and gives a nicely modulated performance as Greg's sexually uninhibited Mom. Even though it wasn't the story I was expecting, I found MEET THE FOCKERS quite entertaining, anchored by a brilliant comic turn by Dustin Hoffman as Bernie Focker."

Greg (Ben Stiller) delivers a baby in the ER for the first time. The Parents say they want to name the baby after him and when they see his name tag you just can't help to start laughing. Then Greg and his Fiancé Pam (Teri Polo) have unusually great luck traveling to New York to visit Pam's parents Jack (Robert De Niro) and Dina (Blythe Danner) Byrnes and Little Jack the son of Pam's sister. Then instead of taking a plane down to Miami to visit Greg's parents Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz (Barbra Streisand) Focker they take Jack's new RV. When Greg calls his parents to tell them that he will be arriving earlier you get to hear a funny answering machine greeting from his parents answering machine. In Miami the Byrnes and Focker families meet and are completely opposites. Roz is a sex therapist for senior citizens and Bernie is a retired lawyer and a stay at home house father. Roz and Bernie talk a lot about sex and show their feelings while Jack and Dina don't. Roz and Bernie show everyone a shrine they made for Greg which includes many last place ribbons and awards that no one would be proud of. They also mention that Greg lost his virginity to their hot Hispanic housekeeper Isabel. That night when the Fockers go to see the fancy RV their dog Moses gets chased into the bathroom and Jinx the cat flushed him down the toilet. The next day Pam tells Greg that she is pregnant but not to tell anyone. There is a hilarious scene where Greg, Dina, Bernie, Jack, and Roz all play football in the backyard. Later that day Jack meets Isabel's son Jorge and was told that Jorge never met his father. Jack immediately suspects that Greg is Jorge's long lost dad. At the Focker house Greg accidentally says asshole while he is babysitting Little Jack and suddenly little Jack starts saying asshole over and over again. He conducts a DNA analysis with a CIA buddy of his and the results show that there is a 97% chance that Greg is Jorge's father. That night there is a party in honor of Greg and Pam and the Byrnes family gets to meet the fifty other Fockers at the party. Jack had invited Jorge to the party and he introduced him to Greg. When Greg refused to admit that he was Jorge's father Jack injected sodium penethol into Greg which makes him tell the truth. Greg gives a speech soon after and admits that he still masturbates to Pam, he thinks Dina is hot, he is Jorge's real father, and that Pam is pregnant. The next day Jack and Little Jack leave and Bernie and Greg follow him. There is a hilarious scene where Greg, Bernie, and Jack get arrested. In jail Jack tells Greg that his buddy from the CIA called and told him that there was a mistake and that Greg wasn't Jorge's real father. After being freed from jail Greg and Pam get married that weekend with a friend of the Byrnes family Kevin (Owen Wilson) as the interfaith minister. In the end of the Wedding Roz told Jack some of her sex secrets that she teaches in her classes and he goes into the RV and has sex with Dina. A must see for people of all ages. You won't go five minutes without laughing while watching this movie. If you rent this on DVD make sure you watch the extra scenes. One funny one was where Jack and Little Jack watch a video surveillance of Little Jack's crib. Another good one shows Jorge and his real father meet Greg at the wedding. This was one of the best movies Ben Stiller has done and you will not be disappointed."

","I don't know if this is true or not, but I was watching Fox News last week and I only caught the tail end of this, but supposively there is going to be a third sequel to ""Meet The Parents"". Is this true? Has anyone else heard about this, and if so, what will it be about? I think it would be neat to see Greg and Pam married with a new baby on the way. I can only imagine what that would be like.<br/><br/>Another thing, in the original movie, Greg says he grew up in Detroit, yet when the Byrnes' go to meet his parents, they are living in Florida. I would assume they may have moved there to enjoy retirement, but then we see Greg's nanny in Florida too, which means he must have grown up there. I'm confused...could Greg have lied in the first movie and said he grew up in Detroit when he really grew up in Florida? Any ideas?"

","Having been a movie-goer for over 50 years now, it was impossible for me to separate the actors from their characters in ""Meet The Fockers."" But that was fine, I enjoyed it. We have De Niro, Hoffman, and Streisand (and to a lesser extent Danner), entertainment and screen legends, playing these funny, stupid characters. How far they have come, from the days when they likely would only have played serious parts. As all of us get older, and we fully realize that we no loner have to prove ourselves, it gets to be fun again, like it was when we were children. Watching these veteran actors be silly was as fun for me as was the actual story.<br/><br/>Even though this is a sequel to ""Meet The Parents"", the movie takes its own deranged but fresh approach to the upcoming wedding of Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) and Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). While the first movie focused on Greg's attempt to get Pam's parents to accept him, this sequel focuses on the first time the four parents get together. The setting is Focker Island in southern Florida.<br/><br/>One of the funny sidelines is the 15-year-old son of the former maid. The boy looks just like a younger Greg Focker. Is this his son, conceived when Greg was only a teenager, messing around with the maid? All in all a silly movie, but a very enjoyable one."

The good thing about this movie was the way Bobby DeNiro behaved toward the AMAZING Dusty Hoffman. Yes, their chemistry was great. I got a little annoyed at the constant was Dusty was obsessing with sex non stop with the democrat Streisand, but deferment, it was part of the movie. Ben Stiller delivered the goods as he always does. That kid who was his ""kind of kid"" was a dead ringer for Ben ""the great actor"" Stiller. I laughed so hard that I thought I was going to lose my temper! Yes, this movie was good. Not as good as the FIRST one, but still it was good. Joaquin Phoenix was not even CONSIDERED to do this role. Apparently Joaquin Phoenix is not much of a comedy actor. My other FAVOURITE PART of this MOVIE was when Ben Stiller walked in on Dusty and Barbara, and Barbara had whipped cream on her breasts and Dusty's face was covered with it. Strange, but odd.

","I was expecting something fairly poor before I watched this, but I have to say that this was a pleasant surprise. So many sequels have been obvious cash-ins that you have to be sceptical about follow-up films. Thankfully this is good humoured fun. The big names from Meet the Parents are all back, De Niro again stealing the show as the control freak ex-CIA dad! Stiller is also on fine form as the unlucky Greg. Basically, this is something of a rehash of film 1, but its done very well. Dustin Hoffman was an inspired choice as Greg's dad, whilst Barbara Streisand is surprisingly good as his mum. By having such wacky and off-the-wall parents for Greg, there's a great contrast to the serious and up-tight parents that we met in film 1. The parental clash seems to be between ultra-Republicans and laid back liberals, but this makes for some good comedy. There are plenty of embarrassing moments in this, which repeats the theme of film 1. Worth watching."

","Working in the business world, you are constantly told that by hitting your goal, you are just working to your average potential. If you exceed that goal, then you are surpassing your potential. Nearly everyday this is mentioned to me in some form or another, yet I wonder why it wouldn't apply to the business of Hollywood? The bar for Meet the Fockers was set, but for some strange reason, the actors only worked to their goal, and never exceeded it. Riding high off the hysterical Meet the Parents, I thought that this film would bring a new chapter into this ""original"" story, but instead director Jay Roach decided to stick with Hollywood standards and recycle the same jokes using different players. I don't know why I am so surprised, I witnessed this before when Roach directed the sequels to Austin Powers. The original film was inventive, original, and hysterical, while the other two films just seemed to recycle the same formula from that original film. The same could be seen in Meet the Fockers. From a similar plot structure, to undefined, clichéd characters, to a complete lack of humor, Meet the Fockers hit their goal, but chose not to exceed it in any way.<br/><br/>For a comedy film, I felt this just didn't quite have the punch from the original film. While there were a couple of lines that I found myself chuckling at, there weren't any of those ""laugh-out-loud"" moments that I experienced with Meet the Parents. The actors who were in the original seemed bland and really just going through the motions, while the new elements (Streisand and Hoffman) seemed over the top, nearly tipping the structure all together. There was no balance. It was almost as if director Jay Roach was asking us to forget about DeNiro and Danner, and focus more on Streisand and Hoffman. We needed a stronger, more comedic balance in this family. While I do think that there was chemistry between these four players, it was never fully matched or developed. Their jokes also make for bad comedy. Have we not learned yet that bathroom humor is a thing of the past? There seemed to be more of these than the intelligent humor reached in Meet the Parents. Secondly, how many times can we hear the word ""Focker"" and laugh at it. I believe that it was overused in the first film, and deeply buried in this film. If these were the two anchoring jokes for the film, we are definitely on the wrong road of comedy. Roach had a very funny film on his hands here, but strangely, he focused on repeating similar jokes from the original, ultimately lowering this film from hysterical, to humorous.<br/><br/>I mentioned above about how the actors were not reaching to their potential, and I do believe it to be true. DeNiro seemed bland throughout this entire film. There was no surprise or inviting element to him. Ben Stiller, literally, needs to take a break for a bit. His humor seems to be slowly fading with each film that he creates. He seems to jump head-first into the big budget films, when I really think that he could make a bigger impact on the smaller, independent pictures. Hoffman's character seemed forced. I could tell that he was having fun, in fact the whole cast was having fun, but no work was getting done. Hoffman had this one-dimensional character that only seemed alive because of Streisand's wacky shenanigans. Finally, there was the muted Teri Polo, whose character was so exciting that I nearly thought that she was dropped midway through this film. Again, I cannot state this enough, there was so much potential wasted in this film that I nearly imagined new ways to make this film as the film was still playing. Hoffman and DeNiro together should have created a match in comedy heaven, but instead ""ha-ha"" purgatory seemed more apt.<br/><br/>Finally, I would like to say that nothing in this film surprised me. I kept waiting to get to the point in the movie where I would finally say, ""This is why this film was created"", but it never arrived. Roach hit the potential bar, but chose not to go above it. He knew he had enough money invested in it if he continued to use repetitive jokes and situations that creativity and originality was completely thrown out the window. It was sad to witness such greats fall, but I just wish there was more to this film  not in length, but in girth. Meet the Fockers is a perfect example of Hollywood creating just to meet budgets and create revenue. It was a formidable idea, but the finished product probably never reflected this idea. I was massively disappointed.<br/><br/>Overall, there were some chuckles from me as I watched this film, but never any laughter. From the reviews and friends who spoke so highly of this film, I was expecting to be blown away by the possibility of a comedic sequel that worked, but perhaps I was setting the bar too high. Stiller does seem tired, as did the rest of the cast except for the newbies that never quite balanced out this picture. Everyone seemed so clichéd that you could literally pick out their characters from other comedy films from across the ages. A majority of the blame I bring on Roach's shoulders, as he needed to break his normal, tired, Hollywood recycled mold of film-making. I wasn't overly impressed with this film and would probably suggest skipping it. It carries none of the power, originality, or creative genius that Meet the Parents did.<br/><br/>Grade: *** out of *****"

","How much can we expect of a comedy? Hilarity, jokes, and antics will doubtlessly pop into our must list. But is there anything more significant? We probably shake our head and give a contemptuous grin. Nonetheless, with that in mind, ""Meet the Fockers"" is going to subvert and further rejuvenate our obsolete ideas with novelty. Carrying the triumphant halo from ""Meet the Parents,"" this sequel would like to, not surprisingly, excite the audience's laughter all the way out of the theater by its exquisite, sometimes even bawdy, wordplay everywhere. On the other hand, the exceptional cast, combined in force with a still-riveting theme and ingenious directing, satisfies the taste of various audiences even more.<br/><br/>As a follow-up to the previous installment, the main focus in the film is simplehow the newlywed-to-be Greg and Pam settle the marriage issue down and above all, the two incompatible families forced to live under one roof for a weekend. Although the plot may be humdrum and within expectation, the successful part lies in that it is four years since ""Meet the Parents"" entertained young and old, so lots of people's memory of it has somewhat dwindled away. All the gags thus won't be regarded as some resurrection of platitude. For instance, old school Jack Byrne, always reminiscent of CIA old days, still emphasizes the essence of ""circle of trust,"" which turns him into a giggle this time. What can be considered original is baby Jacky, or little sign language expert. He further lightens the aura of the film, but the shame is that the kiddo contributes little to the overall development of the theme.<br/><br/>If ""Meet the Fockers"" becomes another box office sensation worldwide,Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman should take the credit for it. Most of the film's conflicts as well as pleasantry derive from the direct clash among Dustin and De Niro, the former with a screw loose and the latter being over-judgmental. The contrastive roles lend force to the intensity of the movie. Barbra performs quite well as a sex therapist, who helps mend up the insipid sex life of Jack and Dina. She fully exposes the idiosyncrasy of an avant-garde but considerate woman. As for Ben Stiller, he actually does a better job compared to his previous acting, even though his role is paranoid and freaked out by incidents throughout. I like his interpretation of an edgy young guy attempting to cater to both sides of parents. On the whole, the casting manages to freshen up the old material and makes it captivating.<br/><br/>When it comes to a good comedy, skillful directing is a prerequisite. Puns and jokes compose the major part of ""Meet the Fockers."" Some of them do hit the right nail on the head. Upon hearing ""Central Lack of Intelligence,"" I couldn't help clapping hands wildly. Moreover, Hoffman's role sparks some witty rhymes from time to time, while De Niro remains a poker face. The cultural distinction in the film then emerges. But inevitably, some plots falls flat. The pun ""Focker"" has been overexploited so much that it has becomes stale to elicit any kind of jokes from it. Murphy's Law is another worn out paradigm, such as the broken windshield without insurance in this comedy. But it is already quite corny to the degree that can only cause some odds-and-ends chuckles. Despite the flaws, Jay Roach's efforts on interweaving two episodes together are still worth a big hand.<br/><br/>The sharp, hilarious undertone of ""Meet the Fockers"" certainly makes it a great coffee spitter. Easy-to-follow themes from the last installment, talents of actors and actresses, and the tactful use of comedic elements and cultural issues by the director keep the audience sitting back and laughing till we choke on our mouth water. Some finicky critics may not recommend it by saying that it is way too tacky. But who cares? I am pretty sure that a lot of people are looking forward to ""Meet the"" series in the years to come. Fockers, you rock!"
"Kueko","9","0","0","13 May 2005"," ""Fockers"" is better than the original
","""Meet The Fockers"" breaks the mould in comedy sequel tradition by being better and funnier than the first, without simply playing out the same situations with a twist. It even makes the bold step of slightly altering the formula that made ""Meet The Parents"" such a hit.<br/><br/>Just like in ""Meet The Parents,"" Gaylord Focker (Stiller) is still tentatively trying to appease his fiancé's (Polo) overbearing father, Jack Byrnes (De Niro), who is quite possibly more intimidating now that Gaylord is in Jack's ""trust circle."" Despite the smiles and awkward pleasantries, it's clear to everyone that tension still runs deep between father and future son-in-law, and what better way to strengthen the bond between Focker and Byrnes than to have both families meet? Of course, anyone who would name their child Gaylord must be astronomically different from the tightly wound Byrnes family, and therein lies the premise. But you already knew that.<br/><br/>The one true strength ""Meet The Fockers ""possesses that sets it apart from its predecessor is its basis in characters. While ""Meet The Parents"" was all about putting Gaylord in the worst, most humiliating situations possible, ""Meet The Fockers"" is about polar opposites and how they interact. That's not to say, however, that there aren't plenty of humiliating moments for poor Gaylord Focker  there are plenty. More on that later. Another driving force behind this sequel's success is its storytelling, an element that is greatly strengthened this time around. The storyline is more cohesive, and there is a clearer sense of plot structure, rather than simply skit after skit. Similarly, there is more attention paid to setting up the climax, so the audience truly feels a sense of satisfaction by the movie's end.<br/><br/>The success of Meet The Parents can be attributed to a single factor: situational comedy, or, more specifically, putting Gaylord into as many embarrassing situations as possible, while his fiancé's parents watch in horror. In ""Meet The Fockers,"" Gaylord isn't alone in a world of Byrnes; this time the Byrnes are put into equally awkward situations as the sex-obsessed Fockers say one crude thing after another. That isn't to say they are unlikable. If that were true, the movie would fail. But it does mean that much of the movie's humour comes in the form of a sex-related joke. It's not necessarily a terrible thing, after all, it is very funny, but it somehow cheapens the comedy.<br/><br/>""Meet The Fockers"" is a hilarious movie that does its predecessor one better, never stooping to simply rehashing the best jokes from ""Meet The Parents."" Strong characters, clever (although wince-inducing) situations, and a strong storyline make ""Meet The Fockers"" even better than ""Meet The Parents,"" and most definitely worth seeing."

It isn't without its flaws however, but neither was the first one. Though in this movie DeNiro's character seems to have reverted back to the way he was during ""Meet the Parents"" and in some aspects he seems even worse this time. The RV seems a bit much too, I don't think they just give those out in the CIA. However, those minor faults aside it is well worth a look. I love the way the movie started out with everything going perfect for Focker and his bride to be, but you know the exact moment when the tides begin to turn with a simple bloody nose.

There is still some of that in this movie, but here Stiller has help to stand up to De Niro's uptight character. That help comes in the form of Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffmann as Stiller's parents. These two appear to be having the time of their lives in this movie. The energy they display gives the movie the boost it needs to be more than a rerun of the first movie. My only gripe is that the film is needlessly long and has an unnecessary subplot involving Stiller's more housekeeper.

","Meet the Fockers is the sequel to the wildly popular film made in 2000, Meet the Parents. The sequel includes much of the same cast, as Ben Stiller reprises his role of male nurse, Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker, and Robert DeNiro once again plays the straight laced, former CIA agent and father-in-law, Jack Byrnes. The premise of the sequel is that after winning over the in-laws, Stiller now has to go through the painful process of introducing his fiancée's family to his own parents, played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand. The conservative, buttoned-up Byrnes family plays the perfect apple to the orange of Hoffman's and Streisand's over tanned, over sexed past-their-prime hippies. Unfortunately, this is about as far as the humor goes.<br/><br/>There are plenty of chuckles to be had as the site gags, physical humor and misunderstandings run rampant. But that same humor that seemed fresh, light and honest in Parents, seems contrived, tired and played out in Fockers. As is prone to happen in a sequel, jokes that worked in the first movie were seemingly regurgitated to fit the new story line. DeNiro's ""interrogation"" of future son-in-law Stiller seemed clever in the original but more like a cliché in the sequel. Likewise, the jokes about being a male nurse and the humor found in the different ways to pronounce Focker just don't seem the same the second time around.<br/><br/>It's kind of like when a child learns to talk. You expect a baby to well, talk like a baby; and it's cute. But when that child is five and still talking like a baby, it's not that cute anymore. In fact, it's kind of annoying; much like this movie."

Dustin Hoffman is an absolute riot as the Focker patriarch, and once you see her you feel that only Barbara Striesand could have fulfilled the role as his wife. They mesh wonderfully. Meanwhile, Stiller's character undergoes the torture of having his future in-laws (and future wife) learning much more than they need to, which only amuses the audience more. While somewhat overshadowed by the elder Fockers in this sequel to Meet the Parents, Robert DeNiro is again wonderful as the up-tight former CIA agent who is to be Gaylord Focker's pappy-in-law.

More of Owen Wilson would have made this movie more humorous, he is a very funny actor. Teri Polo looked strained in the role. As a couple with Stiller, they seemed as boring as people who had been married years, not newly engaged.

However, where the new arrivals shined, the underlying theme was the feeling that you'd ""been there, seen that"" as you watch this movie.<br/><br/>In ""Meet The Parents,"" the magic was the unease of Ben Stiller in trying to fit in with Deniro and Co. It seemed more genuine than this sequel. I honestly felt this movie was somewhat forced, with the acting half-robotic, or going through the motions.<br/><br/>And Teri Polo looks TOTALLY different in this one...not sure what happened, there. Thought she looked much better in the first. I thought her role could have been a lot more...it seemed like she was almost a minor character in this film.<br/><br/>Either way, this is a good one to sit through if you'd like a few laughs. It's not awful...I just don't think it was as good as the first movie. Owen Wilson makes a cameo appearance, but it was totally unnecessary. 6 out of 10 stars."

","I admit the whole Gay Focker thing is a bit contrived and a bit overdone. How many bad days can this guy possibly have? And I also can admit that Robert Deniro's character of a meddling father/spy is old again after the first half an hour, but the comedic genius of Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman as the parents of gay. Too funny. I have never laughed so hard and smiled so long during a movie in my life. It was a great comeback for her after what was it, ten years.. I am glad she got to work her old chemistry with Dustin. Pretty sweet. I love the feel of the film, the kind of relaxed feeling that you get at Fockers house. I guess the moral of the movie is, love your family. No matter how weird they are, no matter how embarrassing."

","I've read a number of reviews--over a dozen--of this flick, and I've yet to come across a single one that mentions the sheer ineptitude of the filmmakers, namely the fact that various microphones show up in over forty shots in the film. FORTY SHOTS! What I don't understand is that critics seem to be politely ignoring this, rather than doing their jobs and, well, criticizing it. I mean, forty shots. All tepid and lowest-common-denominator comedy aside, this is Ed Wood caliber, folks. The fact that this movie is garnering such big bucks at the box office, so riddled with sophomoric and unapologetic blunders, speaks very lowly of the average American moviegoer's appetite for junk. I teach composition courses. Were a student to hand over a paper so filled with punctuation errors, grammatical flaws, and bad spelling that it wasn't readable, I'd have to say, ""Here, do it over, and do it better. It's unacceptable this way."" That's what MEET THE FOCKERS is: bad movie grammar. Nothing ruins the silver-screen illusion (or a tasteless joke about strap-on breasts, foreskin, or foul-mouthed babies) like a big black metal rod thrusting in DeNiro's mug. Where do we go from here?

","I wanted to see this in the theater because Meet the Parents was so good. I laughed so many times during that movie, but the sequel was terrible. I hardly cracked a smile. All it is is sexual humor and it gets boring. I felt bad for the parents who brought their 10 year old kids to this expecting to see a lot of cat humor or mistaken identity. Instead it was close to an R rating because of the sex talk and raunchy words.<br/><br/>And Greg's parents, the Fockers, were not funny. Hoffman and Streisand were bad. The baby with the head butt provided a little smile. And DeNiros's character had some funny moments too.<br/><br/>It seemed like I kept waiting for something to make me laugh, and it never did. I nearly fell asleep during the last half hour, and I'm sure I missed some dialogue.

","Not as good as MEET THE PARENTS, but still a decent sequel with star power going for it if not the most clever gag writing.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first film and yet found myself shifting back and forth during the course of this follow-up; I was chuckling one minute but then shaking my head the next, wondering why too much of the material tended to rely on cheap sex jokes and non-clever toilet humor (I'm no prude but jeez - can anyone write ANYTHING else for a laugh these days?). It also felt as though there were too many obvious references to routines that worked well already in the original, just to let you know the filmmakers didn't forget them.<br/><br/>One thing is for certain -- Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand were ideally cast as Ben Stiller's parents, The Fockers. That in itself makes this sequel worth the watch. At times it was hard to swallow that any married couple could be so irresponsibly perverse and inconsiderate during such a crucial first meeting with their future in-laws, but then again I suppose that's supposed to provide the whole basis for this film's existence. By the time it's all over, most fans who liked PARENTS should come away from FOCKERS feeling that they've had at least some fun with it. Just how ""much"" fun will vary from viewer to viewer, though."

Streisand's in-your-face sex therapist, while cute at first, wore thin rapidly. Hoffman looked great, and had a couple of cute scenes, but like his on-screen wife, he too made me weary. Danner seemed intoxicated throughout the mess of a movie, and what was director Jay Roach thinking when he left in the scenes with the truth serum and the sub-plot about the illegitimate son? Stupid, degrading and not funny. Stiller, the butt of attack from the entire cast, including Little Jack, was able to project his stress and anguish directly to my digestive tract.

","The tagline for this film is: ""And you thought your parents were embarrassing."" I presume this tagline refers to how the actors in the film must feel.

The fact that the reviews and ratings are not MUCH worse is easily explained by the fact that many potential viewers with even a modicum of good taste were warned away by the title and promotional material which, at least, is fair in that it portrays the film to be just as asinine and low-brow as it actually is. The film is amazing in that it leaves me in awe over how sadly our culture has sunk when a film like this, and like many similar films, can actually do quite well at the box office.

","""Meet the Fockers"" is a semi-jovial, semi-obscene (and surprisingly crude) followup to its 2000 hilarious predecessor. While ""Parents"" featured the ungainly, hapless Greg (Stiller) taking pains to impress his soon-to-be in-laws the Byrnes (De Niro and Danner) with disastrous results, ""Fockers"" concentrates on the hysterical escapades of Greg and Pam's seemingly opposite parents: the Byrnes are prudent, stealthy, and leery, while the Fockers are, well... overzealous, excessively perverted, and free-spirited sunshiners; sounds like additional catastrophe for a Focker-Byrnes reunion! The Fockers (Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand) enjoy partying and sexual innuendo, while the Byrnes (and mostly Jack) strive to familiarize an innocuous baby boy to the complexities and mendacities of the real world. So ensues a sometimes amusing, if frothy and sexually obscene(from the director of ""Austin Powers""!), which never quite achieves the shrewd ""comic scenarios"" that made its predecessor such an outrageous hit. It's a more zany and feudal affair, yet not necessarily laugh-out-loud hilarious. At times the Fockers Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand are more of an annoyance than a comedic relief, their propensities rife with the typical Hollywood overload of sexual innuendos and philosophical condescension, and I found their natures to be misplaced for a different genre of comedy other than an otherwise promising ""in-laws fiasco"". I would have rather enjoyed seeing these couples collide culturally and ethically, rather than the Fockers discussing their egregious intimate details at the table and around the house! Note to Mike Roach and writer John Hamburg: the original's premise of ""I'm watching you"" and ""Who's outwitting who"" was plenty more hilarious than ""I'll give you a massage"" and ""keep the hat on the door when you're getting it on"". There are moments of jovial comedy, ironically when DeNiro and Stiller are butting heads once again, with DeNiro determined to undermine and ruin his ""unworthy atrocity of a son-in-law""; the height of comedy is where DeNiro injects a truth-telling serum into Stiller and Stiller finds himself on stage making rabid confessions. My favorite character here is of course, Jack Byrnes, every guy's worst nightmare for a father-in-law, constantly intimidating and threatening, planting hidden cameras around the house, and investigating personal background searches to destroy any chances you may have with his precious daughter- and DeNiro is exceedingly brilliant in this part. ""Meet the Fockers"" is a comedy which perhaps attempts to overdo its ingenious predecessor in expanding its resources beyond the diligent cleverness and compatibility that propelled ""Parents"" in injecting a trashy sexual joke or two into a perfectly effective mix of humor. It entertains not when Hoffman (whose character, all things considered, is good-natured) and Streisand (to me, a contemptible character) ""get it on"" both verbally and physically, but rather, when we realize that the Byrnes and the Fockers are virtually incompatible, and the ex-CIA (Central Un-intelligent Agency, according to Bernie Focker) watchdog Jack Byrnes declares, ""I'm not so sure this wedding is a good idea. I don't like what I'm seeing from these Fockers."" All-in-all, a comedy that tries too hard to achieve unnecessary hilarity and spoils a perfectly entertaining and hysterical premise, yet still supplying some moments of the jovial genius that was the premise of ""Meet the Parents"". Maybe the third installment should be ""Meet the Kids"" or ""Meet the Dogs""... or perhaps the premise is expired enough. **1/2 out of ****"

It was the innocent, slapstick type of comedy that made the fist movie as funny as it was and kept the audience laughing. Purchasing the first movie is a must but I wouldn't think of investing in the sequel.

Nothing as painful to watch as this, but the emotions are still the same. The beginning of the movie is wonderful and unexpected, which just set the stage for hilarious disasters later on. Even Streisand, who I was skeptical about, keeps a great sense of humor the whole film, and I am so glad she was in it! This is no high brow film, but a great comedy for couples young and old.

","The Mrs Focker is a sex therapist, and that drives much of what passes for humor in the movie: the tension between propriety and openness.

This is the aspect that I found most amusing, if pressed on the issue. Sequels often fail to live up to their promise, and it may be only that stringing two good movies in a row is difficult.

"gregsrants","6","2","6","30 December 2004"," As good as the first
","Back in October 2000, Jay Roach teamed Ben Stiller with Robert DeNiro in the comedy Meet the Parents. The film was about an average man with an anything but average name that meets his girlfriend's parents for the first time. Expectations for the film were optimistic. DeNiro had hit box office gold teaming with Billy Crystal in Analyze This just one year previous and Dreamworks was hoping that their $50 million plus investment on a family comedy would pay dividends. No one expected the $330 million worldwide gross.<br/><br/>So, since money makes studio executives dance un-rhythmically around the Hollywood sign, it is no surprise that four years later we are again following the misadventures of Gaylord Focker (Stiller) in the apt titled sequel, Meet the Fockers. <br/><br/>Now in order to have a successful comedic sequel there are a few details on the checklist that need to be addressed:<br/><br/>Number one: Get the original stars back for a second go-round. Check. This didn't seem to be much of a problem other than finding scheduling time amongst two of the hardest actors in Hollywood (DeNiro has been in 9 movies since Meet the Parents and Stiller 10 with 6 titles this year alone). The rest of the cast including Pam and Dina Byrnes (Teri Polo and Bylthe Danner) are thrust so far into the background, that they could have been replaced without notice. As an added bonus, director Jay Roach (Austin Powers) was back behind the camera, thus making the first day of production like a reunion rather than a workday.<br/><br/>Number two: Advance the story. Check. At the conclusion of Meet the Parents, Focker was able to convince Jack Byrnes (DeNiro) of his sincerity towards his daughter  even though he had to go through a lie detector test to prove it. This time around, Focker introduces the two families before the wedding. Now that he has gained acceptance, can his parents win them over?<br/><br/>Number Three: Try to strengthen the appeal with new characters, preferably Hollywood talent. Check. In what was a real coo for the producers, the Fockers are played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand who along with DeNiro make this movie the showcase for award winning performers. Also joining the cast is a small baby that speaks sign language and a dog that will be the fodder to the Byrnes' toilet flushing cat.<br/><br/>And finally, number Four: Don't sway too far from what made the first film successful. Check. Unfortunately this is a check I wish the film didn't receive. The comparisons to the original are too blatant. The lie detector kit that was so prominent in the first installment is now a truth serum in the second. A pick-up football game replaces the water volleyball game and both pictures felt the need to show us bloody noses for some reason. About the only recurring idea that worked as fresh as the original is the variations of how to use Fockers in a sentence. <br/><br/>Most of the laughs in Meet the Fockers comes from the parental Fockers. Although it is always good to see Streisand back on screen again (especially in a role that she seems to be having the time of her life portraying), it is Hoffman's weird and wacky Bernie Focker that elevates the film to any status. Whether he is lying in front of a mobile home in protest, wiping charcoal under his eyes before the final play of a football match or explaining how the toilets work, Hoffman hasn't been this good or this funny since Wag the Dog back in 1997. <br/><br/>But where the strength of the bit/new characters are refreshing, it is the recurring characters and the unnecessary sub-plots that really divert this movie from rising above the crowd. And when Jack is able to go to his CIA office hidden below the bed in the mobile home, the movie sinks to a level of almost slapstick when the rest of the movie around it is better than that. <br/><br/>Meet the Fockers was a welcome breath of fresh comedy during the final month of the year when heavy hitting drama vow for our spending dollar. Just don't to be expecting sidesplitting laughter. Instead, you will get a warm, meaningless comedy that will without doubt produce a trilogy if the movie makes anywhere close to the money of the first. <br/><br/>Mother Focker anyone? <br/><br/>www.gregsrants.com"

","""It's nice, all of us being here together, don't you think?""<br/><br/>Ben Stiller followed up the hit 2000 comedy Meet the Parents with a slightly lukewarm revisit of Gaylord Focker, this time with his own parents in tow. It's not as funny as the first movie, but it's also not a complete blight on the quality of the first film.<br/><br/>The plot this time around revolves around the meeting of Greg's and Pam's parents, as the soon to be in-laws have yet to be introduced. As you could probably guess, Jack (a returning Robert De Niro) clashes with the free-spirited and unorthodox Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz (Barbra Streisand). Conflict and the occasional humorous situation results.<br/><br/>With such a great cast, It's a little disappointing that this feels like such a re-tread, and that so many of jokes are hit or miss. Greg once again finds himself straying outside of the circle of trust, there are more jokes about him being a nurse, a dog that likes to hump things, and a baby who curses. It's a bit of an understatement to say that Meet the Fockers starts off slowly. Still, there are some laughs to be had, and at the very least, watching this will get you caught up on events before the third (and much funnier looking) movie in the series rolls into theaters this winter. <br/><br/>Fans of the first movie or Ben Stiller should check this out, but you should also keep your expectations at a moderate level. The fresh faces add some fun, but the writing is a little stale."

","Folks in the U.S. are apparently more sentimental than we hardier Euro types, or at least that's what Hollywood believes. So meet the Fockers has the obligatory feelgood ending when each and every loose end is neatly tied up in the final ten minutes (or it could have been eleven) and for this viewer rather left a rather artificial sugary taste to what at times was a quite inspired film. I must admit that I haven't seen the prequel Meet The Parents so I cannot say whether or not this is better, worse, as good as or as bad as that film. What I can say is that when Meet The Fockers scores, which it does do every so often, it is invariably the achievement of the five main characters. In other hands a pretty ordinary script might otherwise have made a truly dreadful film. Hoffman and Streisand in particular gell nicely as the quirky, hippy parents who son Ben Stiller loves but who he worries about so much when tight-arsed Jack is around. One nice touch was Dina, Jack's wife, who is shown to be a woman in her own right though a long-suffering wife. Overall this is par for the course, a standard Tinseltown comedy and its moments and occasional good jokes are down to the cast. Don't expect a great deal and you won't be disappointed. You'll get what this was always intended to be, undemanding fodder with a few laughs."

","In Meet the Parents, Ben Stiller was a jittery boyfriend planning to ask for his girlfriend's hand and desperate to win the approval of her parents, particularly ex-CIA borderline psychotic dad Robert DeNiro, only to find his efforts consistently blowing up in his face through a series of Murphy's Law-style shenanigans. It was not trying to be the greatest film ever made and generated enough genuine belly laughs and pleasantness to rank as a success. Certainly part of the success was generated from the prickly chemistry between DeNiro and Stiller, and the fact that pretty much anyone could identify with the well-meaning efforts made by Stiller that did not pan out. Naturally a sequel was concocted wherein the future in-laws would now meet Stiller's folks. Sadly the pleasantness and belly laughs of the original are missing in action, despite amping up the cast. DeNiro's conservative ex-CIA psycho is etched to such a one-note extreme that he seems to be one-day shy of becoming an ax murderer. Stiller has been reduced to doing nothing but stare slack-jawed from the sidelines. Similar to the first film, both Teri Polo (as the girlfriend) and Blythe Danner (as her mom) are treated as slightly better than props. As Stiller's parents, the casting department scores the coup of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. In fairness, I dreaded Streisand, but surprisingly found her playing the only character that could seemingly exist outside of this film and one of the few to not irritate me beyond measure. She is not given anything particularly funny to do, but she does play her role well enough. By contrast Hoffman, portraying the kind of touchy-feely overly emotional liberal that exists only in the minds of crummy screenwriters and FOX News pundits, is excruciating to endure. Watching he and DeNiro, both of them playing extreme caricatures that could not possibly survive in the real world detached from this woeful film, is nearly surreal in its badness. The comedy at large is dreadful - with much of it being divided between the Fockers hormone-crazed dog that DeNiro's cat tries to flush down the toilet in a painfully strained moment, and DeNiro's obnoxious tot grandson (is there another kind?) that he has dragged along for cheap reaction shots. Competition for the film's lowest moment (aside from any time Hoffman opens his mouth) is fierce. Normally I would defer to the introduction of the Focker's busty Latin maid (who also provided Stiller's first sexual experience), which results in unending shots of the baby grandson leering at her cleavage. However, the worst is given an entire time-consuming subplot to pad out this already odious film, wherein DeNiro becomes convinced that the maid's good-natured teenage son is really Stiller's love child. With no proof whatsoever and no thought to the consequences this would have an innocent bystander, DeNiro shoots up Stiller with sodium pentathol, convinces him the teen is his child, and then systematically sets in motion the public humiliation of BOTH Stiller and the teen. Thereafter, the plot strand is dropped - with no further appearance by the kid nor any inference that anyone has told him this was all a lie. This entire scenario must take up roughly 30+ minutes of screen time, generates nary one laugh, and then is completely forgotten like there were not people other than Stiller who were injured by DeNiro's machinations. Owen Wilson makes a brief return at the end (seriously he and Stiller should be banned from working together), but charitable viewers may forget he is in it. There is talk of another sequel, but I have seen enough Fockers (and members of DeNiro's family) to last a lifetime after this sequel."

","Given the casting of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as Ben Stiller's parents, along with Robert DeNiro back as the hot-tempered Jack Byrnes, you'd think that ""Meet the Fockers"" would be a tremendously funny movie. Alas, I was very disappointed. The gags and dialogue don't work nearly as well as in the first film. What kind of screenwriter would think that attaching a fake breast to Robert DeNiro, or having a toddler utter profanities, or giving Greg Focker an illegitimate son, would be funny to watch?

The rest of the cast is better. The real trick is to see which actors walk away from this one without embarrassing themselves. Dustin Hoffman and Blythe Danner are both quite good-- genuine and fun to watch.<br/><br/>Streisand is hard to watch. De Niro isn't bad except for the bit with the fake boobs. That is so out of character for the CIA agent he's playing that you just cringe.<br/><br/>The deeper problem though, beyond the endless bad shtick, is the premise. So many movies have done the whole romance where the lovable ethnic family shows the uptight WASPs how to get in touch with their true feelings. Big Fat Greek Wedding did it well, this one just reminds you of what a sad cliché that plot is.<br/><br/>This film has four good laughs and nothing that seems to capture the human heart."

The characters have some depth and their reactions to one another are precious.

Own it. When you put 3 of my favourite actors into a comedy, I'm bound to be pleased...unless it's in a shameless sequel. ""Meet The Fockers"" takes us to meet Greg's parents, played by Dustin Hoffman and Barabar Streisand. Don't get me wrong they're great actors, I loved ""Rainman"" and ....actually can't think of any Streisand movie I've seen but I hear she was massive in the 70's. Their characters are terrible though- two sex crazed lunatic extroverts. Greg obviously knows they won't get on great with Pam's folks..and he's proved right. While they are there, there are of course lots of unbelievable accidents and events, each more over the top than the last (and less funny than anything in the first, except maybe when Greg babysits).<br/><br/>I didn't laugh during the movie at all. Maybe smiled twice. Maybe it was funnier than I thought but I just felt so ripped off and dirty I was slightly tainted. It was clear the producers thought ""Man I can't believe how much people liked Meet The Parents. Let's do it again, add a couple of characters played by big stars to rope in some more people and sack all the writers except the guy who wrote that bit where Greg smokes on the roof and sets the house on fire.

","Didn't really think this would be any good, but I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it on cable the other night. The best part of the movie for me was the appearance of Little Jack, played by the Pickren twins, Spencer and Bradley, who have been doing the signing language since they were weeks old. Their mother, Wendy, was a pediatric occupational therapist, and she had been teaching it to them; by the time they were 11 months old, she writes at their official website, pickren twins dot com, they were already communicating with her in this way. So what you see in the film is genuine.<br/><br/>What I loved even more than the signing (and their incredibly astute reactions throughout the film) is when Stiller's character inadvertently teaches Little Jack the 'A' word - to hear the kid saying it during the rest of the movie is absolutely hilarious; the film is worth seeing for this alone. Streisand and Hoffman are also high points, with their very specific characterizations. All in all, a very funny and worthwhile sequel. And educational, to boot."

","This sequel to the original was very flat and not very funny. I watched the extended version on DVD and the method of showing the added scenes was distracting. My main comment concerns the total stereotyping of Hispanics in the movie. I was very offended by the depiction of Gaylord's maid/nanny. She was the stereotypical Latin seductress, with her breasts hanging out and having sex with a 19 year old boy. She was the devoted slave willing to give her body to the master, a Latina Sally Hemmings. The racial stereotyping in this movie was blatant. I would advise all Hispanics to boycott the movie. The depiction of the Jewish family was just as bad, but I will leave that to a Jewish reviewer. The humor was juvenile and relied much to heavily on bathroom jokes. All in all a pretty bad movie"
"edwardholub","2","1","2","21 June 2005"," A few notches below your average I Love Lucy episode
","With a script pulled from a cesspool, the performers pretty much did what they could. Meet the Parents was a VERY mean spirited comedy that was more infuriating than funny. Meet the Fockers is a little milder. Jack Burns is one twisted individual. There are attempts at humor, but they are all vanquished because you never know when Burns is going to freak out and hit someone. The only funny sequence was the message therapy with Streisand and DeNiro, mainly because of the editing and comic timing which were good. And what's this new trend in animal cruelty meant to be funny? That's very irresponsible. I'm a dog lover and even though I don't care for cats, feline punishment is a real turnoff during a comedy."

When that occurred, you could always figure that they had spent all their money and were desperate. While I don't think that's the case with Hoffman or Streisand, that's what it looked like to me. This was a poorly written story with a bad script, and no matter how many times a joke or two came across, I always felt as though I was watching a great cast performing below my expectations. Apparently, the money was good. I'm very disappointed with Streisand, Hoffman, and Deniro for agreeing to put up with such nonsense."

This film features nothing but low sexual references/humor in order to keep the audience laughing; it just so happens that this was not the case for me. After about 30 minutes into the movie the ""sex"" jokes got lame, and the only thing keeping the movie going at that point is a baby that says ""@$$hole"" repeatedly and Ben Stiller trying to make us laugh with his stupidity.

","I'm not normally one who watches sequels without watching the original but when your new flatmate (one of three) plugs in her DVD, why not go with the flow and enjoy what gets thrown in the tray? Thus, it was that I sat down and watched ""Meet The Fockers"", the sequel to the enormously popular comedy ""Meet The Parents"". Stiller has never recaptured his form from his best film ""There's Something About Mary"" but here, he is completely upstaged by three old timers, two pets and a baby.<br/><br/>Stiller reprises as the bizarrely named Gaylord Focker, the hopeless klutz engaged to Dina Byrnes (Blythe Danner). Her parents, former CIA agent Jack (Robert De Niro) and long-suffering mother Pam (Teri Polo), were 'met' in the first film so here, Gaylord takes his future in-laws (together with Pam's baby nephew Little Jack) and his future wife to meet his parents. But there is a problem. Obsessive Jack believes that Gay's father Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) is a high-flying lawyer and his mother Roz (Barbara Streisand) is a therapist but it isn't quite like that and to make matters worse, Dina discovers she's pregnant.<br/><br/>In truth, ""Fockers"" is a very undemanding sequel which is basic in its approach to humour and fairly low in its ambition. However, it does this with such skill and slapstick fun that you fairly quickly get swept up and enjoy it. ""Fockers"" has so many gems that hit the target, such as the toilet battle between the Focker's dog and the Byrnes' cat. It certainly helps if you've seen ""Meet The Parents"" (which I haven't) because I simply found each character too exaggerated to be really funny. And the humour is simple - people falling off chairs for no reason and frequent repetition of the name ""Focker"". But slapstick humour is a dying art and when it's done as well as it is here then you welcome it with open arms.<br/><br/>Despite being the lead, Stiller rarely stretches beyond his ""wide-eyed loser"" role. De Niro shows an unexpected comic flair as the buttoned-up, anally retentive father-in-law from Hell but Hoffman is his equal, visibly enjoying himself in screen as the polar opposite of Byrne. Streisand launches an unbelievable comeback as the kooky sex therapist and probably gets the acting nods because she simply hasn't done any for so long. ""Meet The Fockers"" is a strictly low-brow affair but one with such enthusiasm and energy that you'd be hard-pressed not to be taken in by it. Funny and enjoyable but ultimately shallow and not that deep. Still, it's better than a Einstein glove-puppet..."

And the ""fish out of water"" humor begins as the fiancée's intensely anal former CIA father comes face to face with an entirely different way of life. While all ends in a predictably happy ending, it's the bumps along the rocky road to matrimony that make this film an entertaining show.<br/><br/>By the way, I had no idea Barbra Streisand was in such great shape, and when was the last time you saw her in a lousy movie? Exactly. This is a well honed and well executed funny sequel. And it's way better than Christmas WITH THE KRANKS. <br/><br/>However, the potty jokes get a little old, and they keep popping up throughout the entire film. So if you hate that kind of humor, it's not going away in the first ten.<br/><br/>Of all the attributes of this comedy, I'd say the best part was seeing all the terrific actors seem so real.

Only one of the sources of continuity used..another is Bernard and Raz Focker living in Detroit..if you pay attention to Meet The Parents..when Pam finds out Gregs score on the M-Cats...she says ""I have my sources, Gaylord or Gregs parents sent me them from Detroit"" and if you pay attention to Meet the Fockers, bernard says..""We were freezing our butts off in Detroit"".

","Starring: Ben Stiller, Robert DeNiro, Dustin Hoffman, Barbara Streisand So most of us watched Meet the Parents, right? Oddly enough, first time I saw Meet the Parents, I didn't like it that much. It just picked on poor Greg (Stiller) too much. I started to like it more with time, and now I can appreciate it a bit better.<br/><br/>The sequel, Meet the Fockers, I found far more amusing. It picks up a few months after the first movie. Greg and Pam are set to get married pretty soon, but the parents still need to meet. Greg is a little bit apprehensive about this meeting because he knows what Pam's dad Jack (DeNiro) is like, and he knows what his parents (Hoffman and Streisand) are like. I mean, a stiff necked ex-CIA agent and a couple aging hippies? It's like watching an episode of Dharma and Greg. Wait, I'll bet that's where they got the inspiration for this movie So the Byrnes' drive out to the Focker threshold to meet the new in-laws, and it's at about this point that the movie gets really hilarious. Dustin Hoffman plays Greg's dad Bernie so well I think he's absolutely hilarious.<br/><br/>I think the reason I probably liked this one better than the original is that it's less harsh on Greg. Sure, his parents are embarrassing, but things don't go as bad. Or at least they don't go as bad in the same way. Things do still turn out pretty bad. I mean, how would you react if your parents brought out a scrapbook from your childhood and your foreskin was in it? Yikes. I think I'd die, but I'd take my parents with me.<br/><br/>I'm not really sure what else to say about this movie. Some of the humour is pretty crude and overtly sexual, but it's not too too bad. It could have been a lot worse.<br/><br/>Those who liked Meet the Parents will definitely want to Meet the Fockers.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: 3 out of 4 (worth a view)"

I didn't have any problem to find out very quickly who was who in this movie and what their relationships with each other were. So, even though this is a sequel, it can also be seen on its own, just like I did.<br/><br/>Greg 'Gaylord' Focker (what's in a name???) is going to marry his fiancée. He has met her parents, but his parents haven't seen her and her family yet. Her father, Jack Byrnes, is an ex-CIA agent who likes strict rules and regulations. Just to give an example: He has taught his cat how to use the toilet... Greg's parents are the complete opposite of the Byrnes family. They are hippies who don't have any problems talking about sexuality, circumcision...<br/><br/>Of course this movie is full of gags and jokes, that's why it is a comedy of course, but sometimes it gets all a bit annoying. For instance when the baby says his first word, he says 'asshole'. That's very funny the first time, even funny the second and the third time, but after that it gets incredibly annoying and you start wishing he shuts his mouth or learns a new word quickly. However, there are good parts too. I loved Jack's command post in his camper for instance.<br/><br/>Overall this isn't such a bad movie, I've seen a lot worse comedies, but overall this isn't exactly the most intelligent movie either.

Granted, Meet the Fockers did have some hilarious moments...the dog chasing the cat and the conclusion....the baby's 1st word...Dustion Hoffman...But there were jokes in this movie which were aimed more at making teens laugh than their older target audience.

The character of the baby for me was annoying and unnecessary, and brought the film down to a rubbishy kid's comedy level. The overall structure of the film is very similar to the original, so if you liked that you might like this one too. Although the film had a few chuckles, the drawn out scenes seemed awkward and static.

","If you have seen the first movie (Meet the Parents), you can anticipate the story line in this one: Dina (Blythe Danner) and Jack Byrnes (De Niro) finally meet Greg's (Stiller) parents Roz (Streisand) and Bernie Focker (Hoffman). Since the Byrnes' are very uptight, the Fockers must be quite the opposite. Hoffman and Streisand actually did their jobs perfectly and are the highlight of the movie. What spoils everything is, that Greg doesn't know his own parents and acts with surprise to everything they do. Boring. Many of the 'funny' scenes are highly predictable (boring again) or not funny at all. Like showing a middle finger to a one-year old could be funny? Anyway, the baby character could easily be excluded from the film. And the worst character? Definitively Owen Wilson. The audience at the theater went silent at his arrival on the scene. If you have seen Meet the Parents, you will be disappointed with this movie. It simply does not match up.

","To think that ""Meet the Fockers"" went to become one of America's highest grossing films that came out during the Christmas holidays, is a tribute to the people that had the foresight and business acumen to think they had a sure hit with this sequel to ""Meet the Parents"" The director, Jay Roach, capitalizes on his prior work. In this one, by juxtaposing two different cultures, he must have thought sparks would fly all over the place. While the picture is mildly pleasant, it is still not as funny as it should have been with all the talented people he had on board.<br/><br/>In a way, it's a sad state of affairs for some of the most best regarded actors of a generation ago to see themselves in this picture. We never thought we'd see the days when a Dustin Hoffman, or a Robert DeNiro would be reduced to playing these cardboard characters, or be in such a comedy that doesn't give us an indication of what excellent work they ever did in their careers.<br/><br/>While in ""Meet the Parents"" there was a certain chemistry between Mr. DeNiro and Mr. Stiller, there's nothing of the sort in this one. Barbra Streisand is reduced to play a stereotype of a liberal sex therapist. While it might have looked good in the written page, it doesn't translate as anything funny on the screen. Blythe Danner doesn't have anything to do.<br/><br/>In retrospect, this picture, like many others, are sold to the public by the well made trailers we saw before the actual film came out.

","The first film was spontaneous, funny and entertaining. The use of ""Focker"" was incidental and part of a long list of buffoonery to make Greg a dunce. The DeNiro character was unexpected and a good foil for Stiller.<br/><br/>The sequel proves that a sequel can be a bomb, in spades. It is gross, it is vulgar. When you need an infant to repeat a...hole 10+ times, imbecilic characters to say Focker 20+ times and a foreskin to fall into the fondue, you have a veritable Sahara of humor. You could see the ""jokes"" coming from two hours away. Stiller, a good comic, and Babs, a decent actress, are helpless victims of an atrocious script. The DeNiro character rapidly fades to black after Stiller throws the brick.......brick, good analogy. Why Hoffman takes roles in turkeys like this one, starting with WAG THE DOG, is beyond comprehension. DeNiro could have advanced relief for our collective misery by running him over when he had the chance. As was mentioned on this Web, people who get a charge out of the word ""Focker"" will truly enjoy this movie. Other than that, this DVD will collect much dust on store shelves."
"jofitz27","5","1","2","5 February 2005"," Not a patch on the original
","2000 came. So did comedy classic ""Meet the Parents"". A truly original comedy hoot, director Jay roach bought the ""you know it's gonna be classic"" formation of Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro together, as a husband-to-be and very sincere (yet hilarious) overprotective father De Niro. When I heard of a sequel, I wasn't sure at all what to expect. Sure, the original was genius, but sequels usually aren't a patch on their predecessors. As was the case with ""Meet The Fockers"".<br/><br/>So, on comes the pairing of ""Gaylord"" and ""Pam"". Off to visit her and his parents, they fly across on first class (just everything seems to be going their way) and then, after collecting her parents, are off to his. After meeting over-welcoming ""Bernie"" and hilarious sex-therapist ""Roz"", we get the general impression where the film is going. At first, the dog-humping joke is funny. But five times later? You get a feeling they're running out of ideas. The sexual jokes are the highlight of the film, but, after a while, they seem to lose their edge. Don't get me wrong, this is a sort-of funny film, but after the outstanding original, this painfully hit-and-miss comedy just doesn't quite cut it.<br/><br/>**/ out of ***** (2 and a half out of 5)"

","I was really disappointed by the second instalment of the series. I was really waiting for this movie given that Meet the Parents was so nice. I think the story falls completely apart and that there is no real scenario. Barbra Streisand is really rusty in terms of acting. She doesn't express very much. Even the Yiddish Mame side of her character is not really sincere (although it should be quite natural for her). Dustin Hoffman is not really showing what he can really do. He is such a good comedian and I was really waiting for his performance here... Still there are a few funny gags and Little Jack is very cute but still... I left the theatre a bit disappointed..."

So why did I just see him in Hide and Seek...well, anyway he was much better in Hide and Seek. Meet the Fockers is funny and I like Ben Stiller, but he has become a one-trick-pony. He needs to stretch a little beyond the nebbish/putz image. De Niro was so irritating in this, but to be fair the rest of the cast made it watchable.

","Meet the Parents was good; I liked the De Niro/Stiller combination, and it made me laugh. Unfortunately, the sequel was boring. The only thing that saved it from the trash bin was the impeccable casting, ie. Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. The chemistry between the pair was very palpable and they were a joy to watch. Scenes between Hoffman and De Niro were rather entertaining too, and they induced a few laughs in me.<br/><br/>Still, the movie's strategy of recycling tried-and-tested sex jokes ultimately failed it in my opinion. It got to a point where it became so predictable that it descended into the fiery depths of banality. Meet the Fockers is a great piece of evidence that illustrates the vast difference between American comedies and British comedies; just compare this to, say, Love Actually, and you'd get my point. Perhaps Meet the Fockers will score with people who don't really like to think, but its low-brow, un-intelligent brand of toilet and sexual humour is something I've seen so many times already that it failed to hold my interest for a significant period of time.<br/><br/>In short, a waste of talent and money.

","Meet the Parents was about funny events happening and Meet the Fockers was about funny things being said.

I wanted some funny events to transpire, but nothing did. I was hungry for new, different material, but there was none to be found.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm alone in feeling this way, but I have a lot more respect for comedians that can make people laugh without relying the sex jokes.

","Without Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffmann playing the Fockers, this movie would be horrible. I say that because the other characters just don't hold provide anything fresh, including Gaylord Focker. It's a nice story with some funny surprises but there is nothing timeless like Jinxy cat urinating on Jack's mothers ashes scene or the airplane/luggage scenes from Meet the Parents. I laughed a few times but not near as much or as loud as I did for Meet the Parents.<br/><br/>We meet a couple characters from Greg's past but beyond his parents there are no other Fockers shown in the movie which was a big disappointment. I wanted to see the polar opposites of Pam's family and his old friends, like the way Greg got to meet Pam's old boyfriend Kevin and the doctor friends of the Byrnes who ripped on Greg for being a male nurse. I think that they had a good idea for this movie but it didn't really meet its potential. Meet the Fockers is not really worth seeing at a theater, wait until rental."

","In Ishtar, Hoffman was funny for about ten seconds. Here, Hoffman deserves an award for his comedic talent. He is not only the best thing about the movie, Hoffman gives one of his most interesting performances since the Graduate. Yes, this is not his ""Rain Man"" award winning role, but it is close to one of his best. As soon as h is introduced, everything Hoffman does is funny. Everything that comes out of his mouth is either a punch line or something so odd that you have to laugh at it. Everything else in the movie blends, but without Hoffman the movie is less than Meet the Parents. Instead, this is a sequel worth watching. It pushes the envelop in what to say and see.

","This film is definitely not as family friendly as the first movie. It has been about 2 years since the first movie, so I was left wondering why Jack Burns & Greg Focker still have unresolved issues with one another. Is it completely realistic to believe that something that has not been worked out in 2 years can then be worked out in just a few days? The Streissand sex-therapist role felt a little forced and overbearing at times. This movie is simply just too long and works way too hard to try and be funny. While the first movie was just funny by being creative, many of the jokes simply seem to fall flat and lack the originality of the first movie; luckily there are enough humorous scenes in the movie so that even when a string of jokes fall flat, they tend to get lost in the shuffle. I tried hard to like this movie and I did laugh quite a bit, but this one is definitely not worth the regular price - definitely see this one but be ready for gross-out sexual humor - and make sure to catch the matinée.<br/><br/>6/10"
"MovieAddict2016","6","2","8","25 April 2005"," Amusing, watchable, a few laugh-out-loud moments, and Hoffman and Streisand are a humorous addition -- but overall not as good as the original
","""Meet the Fockers"" had a lot of potential but I think its downfall is that it never really goes anywhere. Clocking in at an hour and fifty-five minutes, it is not only longer than its predecessor, but repeats itself too often. In typical Jay Roach style, the director once again basically remakes his original film (also see the first ""Austin Powers"" sequel) through eerily similar scenes -- for example the football game in ""Fockers"" is a clear re-do of the water volleyball game in ""Parents,"" ending yet again with someone being injured -- but the film still manages to create just enough new gags to make it worthwhile. This is a generally amiable picture worthy of a night's entertainment. It is not, however, anywhere near as memorable as the first film -- which not only surprised me, but to this day lingers in my memory. (I still haven't forgotten the dinner sequence with the cat and the mother's ashes. That was brief comedic genius.) ""Meet the Fockers"" is just a bit too obvious. It's a sequel made for money. Its cast is obviously having a great time -- Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand are chewing up the scenery -- but it's far from a respectable and intelligent sequel. (Then again, who expected it to be?) Bottom line is: A fun movie, just not great.<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment in ""Fockers"" is the transformation of De Niro's character, Jack Byrnes. In the original, Jack was a very strict disciplinarian, ex-CIA man. In ""Fockers"" De Niro seems to turn his original portrayal into a parody of itself -- Jack was believable in the original, to some degree, and here he is just a bit too broad to find convincing. Although the opening Democrat/Republican comparison between Hoffman's character Bernie (liberal Jewish) and Jack (uptight conservative) is pretty amusing, especially nowadays, it goes on a bit too long afterwards. At an hour and a half, we don't need another reminder than Hoffman is a liberal and De Niro's character is not. During this, Jack generally acts like a real jerk, and not only devolves past what he was in the first film, but becomes WORSE - he once again disbelieves Greg (Ben Stiller), and it's just sort of tiring because we've already been through this stuff in the first film.<br/><br/>Also, perhaps it is just me, but I found De Niro a great deal less likable than he was in the first film. In that, there was a certain element of understanding attached to his actions -- in ""Fockers"" he really does just come across as a mean, sarcastic guy and although De Niro is still very funny, he's nowhere near as funny as he was in ""Parents,"" which built its laughs on absurdity in the face of realism, and not vice versa.<br/><br/>""Fockers"" is a pleasant sequel that delivers enough entertainment for a Friday or Saturday night viewing. Hoffman in particular is an excellent addition to the series and not only has fun in his role, but delivers the most laughs. And his chemistry with De Niro is, once again, very funny. (Even more so than ""Wag the Dog."") But in the end, I thought to myself, ""Haven't I seen something like this already?"" And I realized a ""Meet the Little Focker"" better pull something new out of its hat or it's going to become a pretty tiresome ordeal. They should stop now, or come up with some new jokes -- the culture clash jokes can only remain funny so long....<br/><br/>Overall rating: 3/5"
"Joshbc88","9","2","8","26 December 2004"," A New Jewish (and Family) Masterpiece
","This is a nice film about how two completely opposite families meet under the simple circumstances that two people love each other.. It is a warm story about Greg and Pam when the Byrneses meet the Fockers. It is funny, it is thrilling, and it is almost half in Yiddish, thanks to the utterly fantastic performance by Barbra Streisand. Some may say that Dustin Hoffman acts great in this film, but Barbra Streisand depicts what she believes is herself... if she were a PhD in sex therapy. Robert DeNiro is the same lovable dad, except a lot further off the deep end with the pitiful, hateful anger that any dad may have before his first-born daughter's wedding to a person who is so different from himself and his family. To be honest, the entire Focker-Byrnes family is very comparable to my own, which makes it somewhat easier to reflect on. The Fockers- a Northern USA family, moved to Miami. Simple yet outgoing and sometimes a little loud with expressions. The Byrneses- Long Island common family, who may never move away, who somewhat flirts with their success over others, shyly and quietly. They bask their uniqueness, yet hide many things, while allowing for social mobility and freedom by using the ""Circle of Trust."" 9.3/10 *'s because the first film REALLY helps- a lot, yet it's not perfect because some things are not revisited from the first movie."

It's a logical move, given the success to the movie, and a natural continuation to meeting the other set of parents, what more one whose family name sounds so much like an expletive.<br/><br/>The film wastes no time in reminding you why the first was successful, with obvious jabs on the male nursing profession and his Gaylord M Focker name. The first 5 minutes sums up everything you liked about the first film nicely - ""I'm Watching You"" hand gestures, circle of trust, etc, before embarking on the inane journey to Focker Isle, where things get, a little crazier.<br/><br/>Our favourite characters like the kitty cat are back, and joined with another madcap hump-everything-that-moves doggie. In addition, we have a baby on board who adds a new dimension to innocence.<br/><br/>Although some plot bits are recycled from the first, like the use of hidden cameras by De Niro, and then playbacked for hilarious effect during the end credits, none of it seems contrived and you just wanna sit through and lap all of it up.<br/><br/>Definite must see this holiday season."

","Meet the Fockers (2004): Dir: Jay Roach / Cast: Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Barbara Streisand, Teri Polo: Sequel that regards anticipation or expectation of one's character or personality. Ben Stiller and his fiancé are tying the knot but her parents must meet his parents so her father loads up the motor home and off they go to Florida. Simple setup descends into sitcom situations and a misguided scene towards the end regarding a cop. More focused than Meet the Parents, which is also directed by Jay Roach. This is his second comedy franchise after having directed the Austin Powers films. While an improvement over the first film it is still a battle of trust between Stiller and Robert De Niro, only this time meeting the parents is replaced with preparing for marriage. And the whole subplot regarding De Niro's nephew is unnecessary. On the plus side Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand steal scenes as Stiller's parents. Hoffman is an ex-lawyer turned stay at home father, and Streisand is a sex therapist for the elderly. It is obvious that a reunion will be met but despite its flaws, this is more durable to sit through. Teri Polo as Stiller's wife is every bit as cardboard here as she was in the first film. Her role should be solid but instead it is a filler. Well made sequel with a theme regarding how our parents' lifestyle can embarrass despite honest intentions. Score: 5 ½ / 10"

Had the dog been named Mohammad and been flushed down the toilet, Hollywood would have burned as Paris is now (6 Nov. 2005) and international, anti-American riots, such as those after the false report of a Koran being flushed down the toilet at Gitmo, would have broken out.

It was refreshing to see a comedy that was funny based on the merits of the writing and the acting, rather than depending on base humor and sight gags. Dustin Hoffman was superb and DeNiro gives a performance where you forget it is DeNiro you are watching, which is great considering all of the expectations that come with him. The laughs never let up and the story, in the end, is about accepting your family for who they are and about dealing with the obstacles that life throws at you. If there is a negative about the film, I think it is the editing. It felt really choppy in a few spots. But that did not prevent me from enjoying the film.

"JAKastner","6","1","3","16 January 2005"," The Moose Hole - 'Focker'ed Up!
","The story for Meet the Fockers no where near meets the magnificence or the brilliant humor of the original. Unlike Meet the Parents, in which the filmmakers simply ran with newfound ideas and allowed the storyline to flow consistently with little interruption, the sequel forces too much down the throats of its audience. It acts in the same way as the finale to The Matrix trilogy did in that the fanfare had built up so many ideas and theories as how it should be done that by the time it was released, no matter what would have been done or not, it was bound to disappoint someone. Sadly enough, this is the card Meet the Fockers is dealt having been released so long, nearly four years, after the original surprise hit.<br/><br/>Both Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller return to the roles they made famous four years ago, Jack Byrnes, the ultra-conservative recently retired CIA agent, and Greg ""Gaylord"" Focker, the male nurse vying for Jack's daughter's hand in marriage. They work well together once again but not quite at the level they did in the original film. Perhaps since the audience knows how they act against each other already, there are not that many surprises left and therefore less tension and humor to present to the audience. Seeing the Focker family in all their humiliating glory is the most prominent reason why this film should never have made it off the drawing board. Sure, it is quite humorous to simply imagine all the possibilities that could have been developed from this group, but when actually taking the initiative and presenting them in fresh and blood forms in front of our faces, it turns out not to be quite as pleasing as we would have thought. Choosing Dustin Hoffman for the role of Greg's father, Bernie Focker, a former lawyer and stay-at-home father, may have seemed like quite an odd choice at first, especially considering he has not had much experience in the way of flat-out comedies such as this, but now we can see why the decision was made  the man is absolutely hilarious. Who knew a talented actor such as Hoffman had this sort of comedic talent inside of him? After witnessing his performance in this film, he should seriously consider doing more of these types of films as he works quite well at least in this character. Bernie acts as a direct representation of some of the best, if not the most blundering, aspects Greg possesses. He always seems to be doing his best to please everyone but no matter what he does or how hard he tries, it perpetually ends up going badly or embarrassing for someone. The exception here is that Bernie is more cool, collected, and sound about these types of situations then Greg is. For some reason or another, everyone on the planet, Ben Stiller above everyone else, thought Barbra Streisand should play the role of Greg's mother, Roz Focker, the sexual therapist for the elderly, in the highly anticipated sequel. Whether they truly desired to see her perform once again on screen for the first time in nearly nine years or if they had to seriously consider the most annoying and embarrassing liberal hippie and her name just kept automatically coming up, the point remains the same the she works only in limited capacities. Barbra, in a way representing the film as a whole, is laughable, but not so funny as to make her performance all that memorable or worth the price of repeated admission. Most of her jokes are sexual in nature and though some of them are decent gut-busters to begin with, they grow quite old as the film drags on until a certain point where they are no longer funny and are just disgusting.<br/><br/>Overall, the sequel to the 2000 comedy smash-hit is not quite as horrific as the filmmakers certainly could have made it, but neither is it as exhilarating and original as the first film was either. Here is yet another prime example as to why Hollywood should be prevented from being so God damn greedy as to ruin a practically pristine and memorable stand-alone film as Meet the Parents with an unnecessary and vapid sequel. After such dismaying disasters as The Whole Ten Yards and Analysis That  another film starring Robert De Niro  you would think that studio executives would have gotten that message not to bite off more then they can chew. Meet the Fockers is so testable that it should be placed on a pike in front of the entrance of every movie studio in the state of California as a constant terrifying reminder that there are some things in this world that should never be tempered with  tangible stand-alone films most of all. Honestly, the only audience members that may ever receive personal satisfaction from this lack-luster sequel in any way whatsoever will be hardcore conservatives knowing that from now on they can refer to Barbra Streisand, the queen of the banshees in Hollywood, as Mother Focker, which is worth more then anyone will know. But considering they would have to endure seeing at least twenty minutes worth of footage with her cleavage blazoned on the screen, not to mention paying money to gouge out their own eyes, they do themselves a favor and not waste their money, or their eyes, on this. True, not all of Meet the Fockers is a complete disaster. In fact it does offer quite a few laughable moments but unfortunately most audience members will find themselves forcing a laugh rather then just letting loose as real comedies should have you do."

","After reading some of the reviews here, I have to wonder how some of this site's reviewers of Meet the Fockers misunderstand the intention of the filmmakers. The Fockers movie is a farce that deliberately suspends reality, is helium-weight, its ""sexual"" and ""bathroom"" references rooted in the tradition of vaudeville wackiness, and any comparison to Battleship Potemkin or other referenced ""art house"" movies is a waste of time. There is room for films that have no particular statement to make other than to amuse, be sophomoric and slapstick, and entertain. It's a sad day when a bean-brained absurd comedy becomes the fodder for those who want to talk about the moral split in America. On the other hand though, if Meet the Fockers is supposed to be a satirical piece about modern mores, then ""yeah, the filmmakers probably failed because their ideas on the subject don't agree with 'yours'"". So, lighten up fledgling film critics, let those who want to laugh without guilt do so."

","Meet the Fockers is the sequel to the hit Meet the Parents (2000). In this film Gaylord (Greg) Focker, played by Ben Stiller, and Pam Byrnes, played by Terri Polo, worry about the first meeting of their parents before their planned marriage.<br/><br/>Of course stuff hits the fan as uptight Jack Byrnes, played by Robert De Niro, meets Bernie Focker, played by Dustin Hoffman, and Roz Focker, played by Barbara Streisand.<br/><br/>The Fockers are elder hippy types (free love and self esteem) who utterly love their Greg. Jack hates it. He is about being a winner on a winning team.<br/><br/>Greg isn't happy either. His parents are themselves and they embarrass him constantly.<br/><br/>This is a funny movie with more laughs than the first. Of course they mine the gutter for some laughs but the more mature humor is excellent.<br/><br/>I went to see the movie because of Stiller. I find him funny as the nervous uptight guy who tries so hard to do the right thing then sees it blow up in his face. He is a lovable loser. However in Meet the Fockers, Greg seems normal and on occasion seems to fade in the background when Hoffman and Streisand are on the screen. I was a bit disappointed with Greg this go around.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro did another good job as Jack. I was expecting him to do his mafia stuff at several points. That would have been extra funny.<br/><br/>I was surprised with Hoffman and Streisand. Dustin is plain loopy through most of the film and he is a hoot to watch. Some other actors have said that is how he is off screen. I would love to hang out with him.<br/><br/>Barbara Streisand just shines in her role as Roz. It reminded me of the comedies she did in the 70's like ""For Pete's Sake"" and ""Main Event"".<br/><br/>While the movie was funny and fun to watch there were some issues I had with it.<br/><br/>I did like the moment where Jack calls Greg out on a lie he told in the first movie. For those of us who saw the first one, that was a good laugh. Where the aside to the first film missed the mark was when Greg and Pam run into the flight attendant that had Greg arrested in the first movie. Greg sort of acted like he knew her but the writers missed a great chance at a joke there. It have been that Stiller underplayed the meeting.<br/><br/>The character of Jack Jr. - Jack's toddler grandson just wasn't needed. There was a bit where Greg is watching the tike and the trouble that comes from that but overall they should have not had the baby.<br/><br/>The subplot with Greg's childhood Nanny was a bit on the tasteless side and didn't help the film. The speech that Greg makes at the party was painful to watch - the humor was much too dark on that one.<br/><br/>Except for those issues I kind of hope they do a 3rd film."
"kobe1413","6","1","3","1 January 2005"," Sequel that compares to original
","Meet the Fockers is a good movie that has an outstanding cast. Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, and Barbara Streisand are very funny. They intertwine subtle comedy with overt references, playing off each other. They seem to having fun, and the audience shares in the enjoyment.<br/><br/>However, what makes the film truly funny, and allows it to rise above the rest of the typical comic fare is the pacing in the writing and by director Jay Roach. Roach's experience with the first film, as well as the Austin Powers series, helps guide the film by keeping the story on track. Shots are not wasted.<br/><br/>I give it a 7 out of 10. Not as good as the first, though, in part because Owen Wilson is not a major player in this one."
"noralee","4","1","3","31 December 2004"," Being Fockerized Becomes A Jewish Hug
","I didn't see the precursor to ""Meet the Fockers,"" but so much of it has entered general popular culture that I could get all the references, plus the young noisy audience I saw it with helpfully shouted out all the links.<br/><br/>This audience loved the easy-going slapstick and physical humor the best. The sight gags with the nephew baby are at the ""Look Who's Talking"" level.<br/><br/>While much of the movie is just plain silly and predictable, the old pro's Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand and Robert DeNiro are having so much fun that they are completely irresistible.<br/><br/>Streisand in particular avoids the usual stereotypes of a Jewish mother by creating a character who is a bit kooky, as a sex therapist for senior citizens, but, as her husband admiringly says, ""a very strong woman."" I particularly liked how Hoffman, playing real mensch, defends their relationship with their son to the in-laws, that the worst they can be accused of is loving him. The script, mostly by the same writers as the original, doesn't let Blythe Danner portray any of the brittle manipulativeness she masterfully displays in the Showtime series ""Huff."" This may be the most benign image of secular Jews since Barry Levinson's Baltimore nostalgia-fest with Jews here being portrayed as earthy, honest and emotional. Streisand throws in less Yiddish than Michael Meyers used in imitating his mother-in-law on ""Saturday Night Live."" The closing wedding tries for compromise in that they are married under a huppah canopy, with a yarmulke-wearing gag ""interfaith minister"" (Owen Wilson in a cameo recall from the first movie) who clumsily does a kiddush blessing on the wine for no particular reason, instead of the traditional breaking of the glass. The daughter takes her stand by declaring herself a Focker and his parents triumphantly assert that her family has been Fockerized  a new kind of assimilation strategy, though the audience mostly responded to the pun.<br/><br/>What was odd was that the writers or the director were so afraid that their portrayal of the Jewish parents might seem offensive that they added on a coda over the credits where Ben Stiller, more in his real persona than as ""Gaylord Focker,"" redundantly and explicitly defends his family for hugging, loving and being in touch with their emotions. The audience stayed through this tirade expecting a jokey punchline and were confused that there wasn't really any.<br/><br/>While Randy Newman did the music, there's only two originals of his breezy songs, over the opening and closing credits, and they are not particularly outstanding. It is odd that several classic rock songs are thrown in."

"jon.h.ochiai","7","1","5","30 December 2004"," The Inner Circle
","Director Jay Roach's ""Meet the Fockers"" is funnier than it's predecessor, ""Meet the Parents"" (also directed by Roach). Although it basically is a collection of outrageous gags, that really has no point. After watching the story on screen by John Hamburg and James Herzfeld, one leaves having laughed a lot, and remembering it was more or less about the future in-laws meeting. The jokes in ""Meet the Fockers"" are very funny, but not particularly clever. It is dominated by bathroom humor, and sex jokes. This is puzzling given the caliber of the casting.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller returns as Greg (aka Gaylord) Focker, who is traveling with his fiancé, Pam (Teri Polo), along with her parents, Jack Byrnes (Robert DeNiro) and his wife Dina (Blythe Danner), to visit Greg's parents Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz (Barbara Streisand) in Florida. Of course the Fockers are the polar opposite of the Byrnes. Roz (Streisand) is a sex therapist for senior citizens which is introduced in a hilarious fashion. Bernie is an attorney of some sort. Recall that Jack Byrnes is a retired CIA operative, and Dina was a homemaker. To illustrate Jack's anal retentive instincts, we have his sign-language trained grandson, Little Jack (Spencer/Bradeley Pickren). Little Jack also has a nursing practice that is both hysterical, and a little creepy. Anyway, things do not go smoothly in the family bonding department. Ultimately, Greg is excluded from Jack's Inner Circle. There are some great gags involving fondue, family football, and truth serum. This time around Stiller's Greg is edgy and has more character. In ""Meet the Parents"" I found Greg an annoying spineless punk. I think he benefits more from this story, because he is the more normal character in this parental freak show. Hoffman, Streisand, and Danner are good. DeNiro as Jack is completely psycho. He pulls back in the end, but for the most part his Jack is unlikeable. This may have been a miscalculation.<br/><br/>There will probably be another sequel. Though I really did not see the point of this one. Comedies are a funny thing. I think a classic comedy makes you laugh a whole lot, and at the same time has some sort of redeeming or human quality. ""Meet the Fockers"" is very funny, but is not a classic comedy."

It was that funny. However, I'm surprised it got a PG-13 rating. The sexual references and content would probably merit an R. It's pretty much a PG-13 rated version of ""There's Something About Mary."" My advice is to see it without the teen-agers since the sexual overtones are not appropriate for them at their age."

There were quite a few laughs but in some scenes you just KNOW whats going to happen & that takes the fun out of that particular scene. Ben Stiller's character, Gaylord Focker, spent WAY too much time telling his parents to be themselves/to not be themselves. Come on, this is supposed to be a COMEDY (you know- ha ha funny funny), give some laughs, not a wanna-be heartfelt talk with the parents!! I think that personally I expected this movie to be 10 times better & funnier that Meet The Parents, but then again, isn't one of Ben Stiller's latest movie releases DodgeBall?? Perhaps he left his funny bone behind when he started filming that terrible movie.. Long story short, I thought Meet The Fockers was OK, but I'm disappointed I spent $9.00 on a movie ticket when I'd have much rather spent $3.50 at Hollywood Video & been able to pause to pee...."

","In this entertaining follow-up to the 2000 hit ""Meet the Parents,"" the Byrnes family goes to visit the parents of Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) and more trouble ensues. Robert De Niro is hilarious, and Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand, as the Fockers, bring zest and life to an otherwise formulaic script. There are some truly funny moments, and this is a worthy comedy that is almost as good as its predecessor, but it falls short due to a little too much raunchiness and not enough of the underlying themes of family love and bonding that made the original so special. The whole cast returns though, with everyone stepping comfortably back into their original roles. They try very hard to make the funniest movie ever, and they don't succeed. What results is just an average, funny, worthy trip to the movies."

On the one had the fockers are open, like to hug and kiss, talk about sexuality, are proud of their child irrespective of material success. The other family the Byrnes are very uptight, reserved and dominated by a type Alpha male.<br/><br/>This is where Streisand, Hoffman and in particular De Niro shine.

","I HATE sequels, but this one wasn't bad at all. Although I have to say that the first one was better, i have to give a lot of credit for Dustin Hoffman's character. He truly was the life of this movie. I loved how there were familiar faces once again. Most sequels only bring back the main characters, but even the most minute...example would be the flight attendant who over reacted with Stiller's character on the first movie. One thing that I didn't like about this movie was how Mother Byrnes character seemed more blank than before. SHe seemed almost retarded. I don't know. Pam seemed expressionless throughout the show. I think her character was better the first round."

","There is a reason that this is not as funny as the first one: we expected it to be funnier! It is impossible to overcome the charm of the unknown, but the producers delivered the price of the ticket and a lot more with some good laughs. Of course, the plot and the situations were contrived, but who cares? This is a funny movie and I recommend it highly. One thing you should be aware of before going into this movie is that the emphasis is no longer on the relationship between Greg and his fiancée. The emphasis will be on the families that are interacting. If there is one thing that I would have done differently I would have made absolutely sure that Terry Polo was more of an integral part of this script. She is almost a prop and as solid of an actress as she is, it is almost a crime to waste that type of talent. Mr. Jinx, though, was his usually catty self and the movie rates highly with me personally for its charm and humor."

From the beginning of the movie, the theater roared with laughter...most obvious was the large group of people who just couldn't stop laughing. I was one of them, this movie builds and builds...it's NOT 'one laugh after the other....it 'IS' ""one laugh 'on top of' the other"", genuine great comedy...it references and ties-in with Part I...a flawless continuation...one part was so heinously directed that I jumped out of my seat along with numerous others who were blown away by this hilarious part...there was a 6.0 (richter scale) type scream in unison and a few 'hundred' people shrieked, screamed, laughed, coughed, cackled uncontrollably, clapped and couldn't get it together before the next hilarious thing happened. I'm asthmatic and I had my inhaler with me...I'm glad I did! This is the hardest I have laughed since ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"", ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""Elf"" and the ""Meet the Parents"".

","What sets ""Meet the Fockers"" above the level of standard comic shtick is the wonderful original performances of Hoffman, Streisand, and De Niro (and De Niro's wife as well, her name escapes me). Hoffman and Streisand completely sell the role of Gaylord Focker's parents. Hoffman in particular is brilliant. He brilliantly conveys the sensitivity, quirkiness and eccentricity that must be inherent in two people who would bestow the moniker ""Gaylord Focker"" upon their son.<br/><br/>Possible spoilers...<br/><br/>Hoffman's ex-attorney turned stay-at-home father completely fits his comic persona, while Streisand is hilarious as a sex-therapist without going completely over the edge. ""Meet the Fockers"" is, as its name implies, mostly centered on Gaylord's parents, but Robert De Niro delivers one of the best comic performances of his career as the deadpan, overly serious, control-freak father of Gaylord's fiancé. Suffice it to say, the story itself is not all that spectacular, but the director wisely allows the characters to dictate the comic element of the movie. Good job.

It doesn't have as many outrageous situations, but nevertheless I was constantly engaged in seeing what happens to the characters throughout the entire movie (not a usual feat in cinema nowadays).

"phishyboy20","9","1","8","23 December 2004"," At times unrealistic, , but overall, a very good film
","I saw ""Meet the Fockers"" last night and was pleasantly surprised. I went into the movie with low expectations, but left the theater more than satisfied.<br/><br/>The plot is at times somewhat unrealistic. Hoffman's and Streisand's characters can be a little over the top and there are a few plot strands that seem rather contrived. However, the great acting and the hilarious script made me more than willing to suspend disbelief and just go with story.<br/><br/>Beyond its comic value, in a sense, this film taps into the current cultural divide in America, with the liberal, free-spirited, and open-minded mindset represented by the Fockers, and the traditional, conservative mindset represented by Jack Byrnes (DeNero's character). Streisand and Hoffman play a sex therapist and former attorney turned stay-at-home dad, respectively, while, of course, DeNero plays a former CIA agent. The tension between the two poles allows for some great scenes.<br/><br/>And, of course, Stiller's character is stuck in between, trying to negotiate his way through the tension and keep things running smoothly. He makes repeated attempts at pleasing Jack, but such efforts are largely futile. For most of the film, he suppresses his own instinctual impulses to try to do things Jack's way. Of course, doing things ""Jack's way"" does not work for Greg, and he ends up apologizing for his inability to succeed using the Jack method. But as the story progresses, he becomes less apologetic, and by the end of the film, he takes an affirmative leap and transforms as a character, rejecting his former submissive and Jack-pleasing self, and adopting a more take-charge attitude. Only by being himself does Greg gain the respect of his new father-in-law (Jack), even if that true self subscribes to a very different ideology than does Jack.<br/><br/>It is very rare for me to leave a movie theater fully satisfied, but ""Meet the Fockers"" was definitely worth every penny that I paid for the ticket. Not surprisingly, it wasn't quite as good as the original, but, comparatively, was a much better sequel than most. 9/10."

","It's easy to get expectations too high for this movie, considering that ""Meet the Parents"" is now considered a modern classic, and this one has Streisand, Hoffman and De Niro, three people who've never made a movie together. (Although Hoffman and De Niro have worked together before, most notably in another comedy, ""Wag the Dog."") With that type of pedigree, you'd expect a Best Picture contender, and on that level it disappoints. It's not even as good as the first one, but it's still a lot of fun.<br/><br/>In this one, Stiller, his fiancé and her parents (and their grandson, Little Jack) head to Florida to meet Greg's hippie-ish parents. Being on his home turf should make Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) feel more in control of his surroundings, but guess again as everything begins to spiral out of control for him, thanks partly to his well-meaning parents.<br/><br/>Easily the two scene-stealers are Hoffman and Streisand, who have a lot of fun acting as over-the-top sexually-active and sexually-open parents. This, of course, turns Ben Stiller's parents-to-parents introductory weekend into a Freudian nightmare made worse by control freak Jack Byrnes (De Niro) and his ""circle of trust"" high standards.<br/><br/>The movie goes further overboard with the toilet jokes this time than the first, something unnecessary considering the on-screen talent who were clearly having a lot of infectious fun making this film. In fact, Streisand clearly hasn't just let herself cut loose this way since her '70s comedies that co-starred Ryan O'Neal, yet she still isn't given enough to do. I could've lived with some scenes running longer if it meant more Barbra and fewer toilet jokes used as unneeded crutches. Hoffman, on the other hand, acts as if he could play Focker's dad forever and you actually find yourself looking forward to seeing him in the next scene.<br/><br/>To sum it up...the movie isn't as great as its pedigree would suggest but it still entertains. Seven out of ten..."

","Meet the Fockers is a continuing saga of Meet the Parents. In this film, Pam Byrnes' (Teri Polo) parents, Dina and Jack, (Blythe Danner and Robert Di Niro) meet Greg/Gaylord Focker's (Ben Stiller) parents, Roz and Bernie (Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman). Greg, Pam, and Dina all road trip in Jack's custom RV, which looks more like a music band touring bus or ""liberty coach"" bus, accompanied by hidden CIA spy gadgetry. Roz and Bernie live in an eclectic tropical themed Miami home. Roz is a senior sex therapist, and Bernie is a retired trial attorney, who has found his touchy feely side, probably through his wife's advocacy of verbally and physically, expressing the emotional self. Barbra plays the role super. I feel like if she was asking me the intimate questions, like Dina, I actually wouldn't have any problem giving her answers, since her nature presents itself easy and helpful. Any over analysis would make me laugh in a good session of comic relief.<br/><br/>When the families meet, it is sort of like the Flintstones  Wilma and Fred (Fockers) meet the Bunkers  Edith and Archie (Byrnes). As for Bernie, he is so out in left field that I can't quite pass shock before finding laughter. But really, I still find laughter. The last movie I saw him in was Confidence, so it could have slowed my creative leap reflexes. Dina is the usual attention starved wife, from her husband Jack, who now appears to have an obsessive/compulsive fetish, with caring for their grandchild, little Jack. I wish Dina had a stronger role, possibly showing how she can rise above pouting over her husband's lack of obvious intimacy, and finding something that she likes, that will in turn, somehow have him take a better notice to his failings, in intimately recognizing her, sort of in that Vanessa and Austin Powers type of mode. Greg is portrayed as too much of the underdog, by Jack's regimented routine and his mother's free sex style questioning. Further, he thinks that he might be the father, to the exotic Hispanic cook, Isabel's (Alana Ubach) son. Even his Dad's homemade Greg wall shrine completely embarrasses Greg. Poor Greg. (sounds good in Marsha tone.) We look at him having the most fun when he is injected with sodium penathol, by Jack, since for most of the movie, he is suffering from family idiosyncrasy overload. Poor Greg (in regular concerned tone.) Much of the comedy attempts to center jokes around little grandchild Jack, which seems to be an odd emphasis, and misdirection. Maybe it reflects the situation when parents or grandparents do not have much going on in their own lives, so a child becomes a center to their world, which is an obvious intended comic hook, to the film. But, the idea does not play out all too funny.<br/><br/>The feeling of actor improvisation gives the film that more carefree and unscripted vibe, but nevertheless, the script in its entirety, never truly reaches full funny bone status, though good intentions are evidently prevalent. (How intellectually nerdy was that synopsis.) I enjoy all of these actors so much, and even more, for the fact that some having played serious roles, gladly warmed themselves up to moving, yet again, into the comedy role. The film may not have offered complete jelly-belly laughing humor to its audience, but it may have well offered ""senior"" sex tips to those in the frozen or frustration zone, thanks in part to the lead instructor, Roz! It's never too soon to start thinking about signing up for co-educational couples yoga."

","'Meet the Parents' was the surprise hit of 2000. 'Meet the Fockers' will be a mediocre hit for late '04/early '05.<br/><br/>This time around Greg has to introduce the Byrnes' to the Fockers, Greg's family. A stay-at-home dad played by Hoffman and a sex therapist for the elderly played by Streisand was a good way to portray the world's most embarrassing parents.<br/><br/>I can't talk about this without ruining it or spoiling it so i'll just have to say if you laughed hard at the 'Parents' you'll at least laugh 80% that amount with the 'Fockers'. The only thing that takes away occasionally is that there may be TOO many sex jokes. This is sometimes unnecessary but then you think 'How could they be any MORE embarrassing?' you just throw in a sex joke that would make you turn red and cover your face as Greg 'Gaylord M.' Focker does through the whole movie. Definitely worth it for the laughs. Funnier than 'Along Came Polly', Definitely funnier than 'Envy' (that one was trash), Probably just as funny as 'Dodgeball' (maybe funnier). BUT, it is NOT funnier than 'Meet The Parents'. It is still a laugh riot, but again you're guaranteed 80% of the amount of laughs you got the first time. The downfall is sometimes the jokes are repetitive of the first. But you gotta love seeing it like the first time you saw the original. It's a great film filled with laughs but nothing too original or groundbreaking in comedy like the first. At times Repetitive, at times original, all times HILARIOUS."

Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner return as Jack and Dina, the right-wing parents of Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo), while Pam's fiancé Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller) introduces the whole crew to his parents: sex therapist Roz (Barbra Streisand) and lawyer-turned-stay-at-home-dad Bernie (Dustin Hoffman).<br/><br/>One set of parents is embarrassingly liberal and the other embarrassingly conservative. One thing the movie does well is to ridicule both sides equally, but that's about where it stops. Imagine what Preston Sturges could have done with this setup.<br/><br/>During their careers, these actors have worked with the likes of Vincente Minnelli, William Wyler, Sam Peckinpah, Sergio Leone, Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. Now, here they are with Jay Roach, who directed the Austin Powers films, as well as the horrible Meet the Parents.<br/><br/>Whereas Meet the Parents had one or two funny, organic moments that arose within the moment, this time Roach sticks to the script like rancid glue, allowing for not one second of life or improvisation. It even uses the old scene in which Greg makes an ass of himself in front of everyone, this time under the influence of a truth serum. Even Stiller looks bored and tired with this aging shtick.<br/><br/>Of the film's high-class actors, only Streisand avoids embarrassment. She has sunk into her role -- her first screen appearance since 1996's The Mirror Has Two Faces -- in a way that lets her enjoy it. The other actors can barely hide their shame, but Streisand appears not to be too concerned about this outing. Her easy grace is the film's only selling point."

","After rewatching Meet the Fockers several years after its original release and my prior first time viewing, my initial thoughs about the film have changed since upon then. After the success of Meet the Parents (2000), the sequel Meet the Fockers was anticipated to be big and great. It wasn't great, yet good with several decent moments and some interesting premise. The plot was typically the same, expect both families meet each other, and they have problems with each other. Their families are complete opposites and don't interact well while being around one another. The movie started real slow, it got slightly better towards the end when the secrets got revealed but even that wasn't all that great. Some of the sexual things they thought were jokes. In particular, such as DeNiro wearing a breast pad on his chest, the same circle of trust, the dog humping, the constant use of the word ""Focker"" (especially by DeNiro), the sexual convos at their dinner the baby signals, etc. All those things which the directors assumed was funny, really wasn't. First the baby was a distraction and most of his scenes felt distasteful. Though one continuous running subplot was DeNiro making accusations that Greg had a 15 son by his affair with his old-time Latina maid. There were many great moments, however what made the film a success is the overall chemistry between the cast, specifically the tension between the Focker family, and DeNiro. Overall this movie was a disaster and the actors should be ashamed of themselves big-time. It was a complete disappointment."

","... but then maybe you'd rather not since this is largely a mediocre movie and you may wonder why Streisand and Hoffman agreed to appear in it, even if Hoffman almost makes it worth watching. (I said almost). It's a sequel to ""Meet the Parents"" and someone thought it might be funny to put the work 'focker' into the title. (That's about as funny as it gets). Consequently, it's a lazy movie and a waste of the considerable talents involved. The original was no great shakes, (DeNiro is far from being a natural comic talent), but it passed the time amiably enough and had a couple of good visual gags. Here, in the absence of anything substantially original, the same jokes are basically retold but are a lot less funny the second time around. One to miss, I'm afraid."

I've watched the movie many times and never put it down since. I believe Meet the Parents was where I first believe Ben Stiller to be my favorite comedy actor. From there, I've seen dozens of outstanding movies by him, particularly Zoolander. And here came Meet the Fockers, the supposed sequel of the delightful, mild comedy of Meet the Parents. That had to end right there.<br/><br/>Meet the Fockers was beyond the simplistic jokes of Meet the Parents. Sure, it did have an outstanding cast, including Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffman as an addition to the original cast, but the jokes were just too much, that it didn't feel like a Meet the Parents-like movie anymore. The jokes were mostly sexual and crude, and were meant for one laugh rather than most. Making some of the most ridiculous jokes ever, I couldn't bear watching the movie. The progress of the film was also cliché. It was the same exact thing as Meet the Parents, but with a new height in its jokes.

Ben Stiller is amazing though, if you have seen him in any of his films he is fabulous, I watch this film over and over again.

The female stars were OK. Stiller's embarrassment of his parent's quirks and desire to impress his future in-laws is really comical. Meanwhile, the overly conservative Jack Byrnes(DeNiro)scans the Fokkers for reasons to prove why they do not ""qualify"" to be married into his family. I've never been a real DeNiro fan, but loved him in this movie. This could be one of the best performances in Robert DeNiro's career. <br/><br/>I'm normally disappointed and get quite irritated with profanity/vulgar language in films, but the strong performances and incredible humor really overshadowed the various instances of off-color language.<br/><br/>For certain this movie is a 9 and maybe even a 10."

","I confess I do not like Barbra Streisand, except when she is singing. I never understood her diva status and I do not buy that she has big comic talent. She worked very little in the last twenty years, did only four films or so, and if she was planning some come-back 'Meet the Fockers' failed to be the opportunity.<br/><br/>The film is based very much on ethnic stereotypes comedy. It can be funny sometimes, especially when characters and situations help - but this does not materializes here, despite of the promises. All the situation is so unreal, the conflict is schematic and predictable, that the best comic scenes of the movie - and there are a few - are gags completely unrelated to the subject, which could figure in any other comedy film.<br/><br/>De Niro and Dustin Hoffman can do no harm, they are too good actors to be bad whatever they play, and they probably enjoyed doing this film. I personally do not like Ben Stiller, I do not find him interesting or funny, and this film did not make me change my opinion. Streisand's character is supposed to provide the counter-weight to De Niro's toughness and meld him by the end, but because of the lack of chemistry between the two all the ending seems even more artificial than it is. A lot of stars talent was spent in this film, but the result is below average Hollywood kitsch."

It had it's moments. But the thing is that the first movie, Meet The Parents is an original movie. It didn't have to be very funny to be such a good movie. The first wasn't even that funny, but I still enjoyed it. It's like, when they made the sequel, they thought it needs to be more funny than the first.

This is supposed to be a PG-13 movie, but it's so close for an R rating. Of course I'm allowed to see this movie, but what about the younger viewers. The film has brief nudity and some strong sexual humor. Thats why they tried to make it so funny, by adding so many sex related jokes.

"Roving_eye","4","0","1","1 July 2005"," Simply can't carry the weight of a sequel to Meet the Parents
","The problem with sequels is that the audience already know a lot. To keep them happy you have to come up with something more than the norm, more than just a continuation. The elements of surprise, the twists have to be inculcated to keep the viewer from boredom. And this film fails miserably on all accounts of that. To make things worse the entire movie is so obvious from the trailer that it makes one wonder why nothing was left to the imagination. Definitely the WORST trailer ever. If you've seen the trailer or even if you haven't, you will now before seeing the movie that its about the Byrnes meeting the Fockers(OK if you haven't seen Meet the Parents, you're not really going to get most of the characterizations). Well anyways, what you're going to be expecting is the strict methodical Mr. Focker will meet the laid back hippie parents of Ben Stiller. You're going to expect most of the humor being derived from this mismatch, and you're going to expect everything ends OK. That's exactly what happens. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzz. Its almost as if you can predict everything. This has got to be the most unimaginative pathetic sequel ever made, and should be taught in film schools how not to make a sequel. Even the 'humor' is so predictable. Still the same nurse, name jokes and the obvious embarrassment Ben Stiller is going to face from his parents care-free style while trying to keep it under covers throughout. The only extra character they introduce is a baby who does sign language, and has no relevance to the plot. For example what they could have done is possibly beating Mr. Byrne in his own game by making Dustin Hoffman to be a sophisticated martinet himself something which Robert De Niro couldn't handle. Or the Fockers could have been this super successful couple that would feel Pam isn't good enough for their son, and turn the tables on De Niro reminding him of his poor parenting... or something which would have had punch. This movie is just lame, and its as if they're trying to get you to laugh by laughing themselves instead of being funny."
"grahamclarke","3","0","1","22 June 2005"," sad indeed
","Had lesser talents been involved, ""Meet the Fockers"" would simply be another dumb comedy; the kind that relies on flushing dogs down toilets for laughs. However the talents involved happen to be Robert De Nero, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand and Blythe Danner, each having delivered indelible performances in their times. (If you an uncertain about Danner, check out ""Eccentricities of a Nightingale). After watching ""Meet the Fockers"" the paramount question that looms is what could have lured this bunch of luminaries to a movie like this.<br/><br/>Well there's always money. No matter how rich people may be, big bucks are not easy to turn down. But more likely it's that almost desperate need to be in the limelight, to have a lead in a big movie. God knows Hollywood has not much to offer folk their age. Actors of their vast experience must surely know crap when they read a script. Did their prodigious egos convince themselves that they could make it work ? This is nothing new for De Nero. A while back he relinquished any attempt at a serious film career. That is not to say that actors of his class should not do comedy. (He was wonderful in ""Midnight Run"".) Hoffman seems for the most part like he's having fun. Streisand however, seems tense and forced in most of her scenes. It's very much a case of ""what was she thinking"". She who had a reputation for being so picky about her roles, returns to the screen after eight years to play an appallingly written, stereotypical overbearing Jewish mother.<br/><br/>Sad indeed."
"Boundaries","4","0","1","19 June 2005"," Bland in a large quantity.
","While society abundantly faced a horrific amount of misleading and unnecessary sequels from decent to great films attracting most general audiences, some of those films actually deserved a continuation in its story for having an enjoyable plot and rich ideas. Meet the Parents (2000) was one of those films. Although not a particular favorite, it had everything leveled up as a satire: sarcastic humor, never-ending sequences of Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller) messing around and making certain things worst, all blended with a little dash of paranoia and witty ideas. As the film ended with Stiller proposing to his girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) a continuation seemed demandable; as much as the final shot of Teri's strict and former CIA father Jack (Robert De Niro) mentioning how they should meet Gaylord's parents (despite of his odd first name).<br/><br/>Meet the Fockers (2004) seemed promising to continue that same style of Meet the Parents, and although I had been waiting to watch its continuation for a while, I had some feeling that it was going to be bland in a way. It was more than bland; it was disappointing and rigged with a lack of planning, good dialogue, and moments. It's unfortunate, seeing as the film has talented actors such as Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, and Ben Stiller; and even THEY don't save the crumbling plot of the film.<br/><br/>As there is a large change of details and story lines in this film compared to Meet the Parents, this one is far too predictable at almost all moments end up as a stale conjunction of elements and ideas being tossed around. And as what happens in this film, we see Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller) and his fiancée Pam (Teri Polo) traveling over to her parents Jack and Dina Byrnes (Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner) house, which both made a large happening for the whole hilarious plot construction in Meet the Parents. So in turns out we see Jack doting on his younger grandson, slapstick humor of Stiller getting a hit on the head by the baby to attempt to gain laughs And so on and so forth. That's just example of how the humor works in a nutshell when it comes to this film. <br/><br/>While we accompany the drive down to the Focker family, with Danner's slow acting and Stiller confused as usual, they reach Gaylord's parents house. His father, Bernie Focker (Dustin Hoffman) is a happy loving kind of guy, along with his wife Roz (Barbra Streisand) who is a sex therapist that tries to hide her job to Pam's parents. The rest that follows along in the film gets kind of humorous at some times, but the bland volume and awful script intervals for it to contain too much humor, such as Pam announcing her pregnancy. We see such moments like Gaylord's awful ""Hall of Fame,"" with 9th place ribbons, the dog falling down the toilet, a lot of sexual jokes to attempt to appraise the audience's mood (as much as Roz asking to help Dina's sex life,) and other good ideas that get wasted when it all comes together in the style of this film. Hoffman's acting practically saves the entire film, with his great talent, optimism and energy, while all the rest of the cast only brought an extra tear of despair and boredom to my eye as the film progressed. <br/><br/>In the end, Meet the Fockers is a film for anyone who really wants to take a shot and attempt to enjoy the so-called successor of Meet the Parents. Just keep in mind that the film is an example how De Niro's talent is going down the drain, as much as a lot of the film industry. That is my ""Circle of Trust"" to you."
"The_Void","5","0","1","5 June 2005"," It's not bad, but it's hardly brilliant either
","This redundant and superfluous sequel to 2000's Meet the Parents is an enjoyable, if not overly brilliant, piece of fluff. Of course, cinema could have done without this production, but since it's been made and I enjoyed the first one, I figured I'd enjoy this one too. However, simply put; this film isn't as good as the original because it's gone way over the top with it's quirky characters and instead of being something of a muddled commentary on in-laws like the first one; this is more of a film where a load of incompatible characters have been thrown into a mixing pot together. This isn't all bad however, as it does make for some nice entertainment and it also allows room for some nice jokes. While the film doesn't offer anything in the way of intelligent humour that you'll remember for a while after the final credits, it does supply the audience with nice set piece gags that are very funny at the time of watching. My personal favourite of the set-pieces involves Ben Stiller, a baby and...Scarface.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro has been getting lots of stick lately due to the fact that, with the exception of his relatively small role in Jackie Brown, he hasn't been in a really good film since 1993's A Bronx Tale and This Boy's Life. However, his performances haven't diminished and even though the material he has to work with here isn't exactly of the highest standard, he still makes the best of the role and is easily the highlight of the movie. Returning from the original is Ben Stiller, who does just fine as the eager-to-please son-in-law, and the rather incognito Teri Polo and Blythe Danner, who don't really get to do much. Joining them is the duo of Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streishand, who play Stiller's parents; the 'amusingly' titled ""Fockers"". The material for them is weak, but they both look like they're having fun, and a few of their gags are funny. On the whole; this movie will be remembered more for it's name than it's hilarious gags, but if you find yourself with nothing better to do than watch this movie...well, it's better than nothing."
"Ric-7","5","0","1","5 June 2005"," Missed opportunity
","When you have a cast which includes three persons who have won Oscars for acting and one who has won a Tony for acting, the result should be much, much better than this. The choice of Streisand and Hoffman as the elder Fockers was inspired, and it is a shame that the script and direction did not exhibit similar inspiration.<br/><br/>The problem, in my opinion, was that the set-up evolved into a La Cage Aux Folles idea: to hide one's parents from one's prospective in-laws. It would have been wonderful to allow Blythe Danner to do something more than merely to tut-tut at Robert De Niro, or to allow De Niro to do something more than make faces, or to let Streisand put De Niro in his place.<br/><br/>The film was amiable, with a few good jokes, some of which went on a bit too long. And if you watch the deleted scenes on DVD, there is one total misfire that you can only be grateful they did not include in the theatrical version (and should not have included on the DVD, it is so awful)."
"TheNorthernMonkee","7","0","1","1 June 2005"," repetitive of original, but funny nonetheless
","SPOILERS In 2000, as he continued to regress (having originally started with comedy), Robert De Niro appeared in mediocre comedy ""Meet the Parents"". Playing former CIA man Jack Byrnes, De Niro was the highlight in an occasionally funny, but most irritating little film. Four years later, and not surprising considering the success of the original, and a sequel was released. Reuniting the old cast, with a few new additions, ""Meet the Fockers"" is a repetitive version of the original film, albeit with fresh laughs.<br/><br/>Happily living with Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo), Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) is implanted into his menacing future step-father's circle of trust. With the wedding around the corner though, things begin to get complicated when strict conservative Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) comes face to face with Greg's liberal hippy parents Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz (Barbra Streisand).<br/><br/>In her first film appearance for eight years, Barbra Streisand is one of many positives to come out of ""Meet the Fockers"". As sex therapist Roz Focker, Streisand is often hilarious, and always on top of her game.<br/><br/>Part of the successful return of veteran Streisand is definitely down the simple fact that she works so unbelievably well with on screen husband Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman is a screen legend and over the years, whilst putting in some magnificent serious performances, he has always been finest at comedy. Films like ""Tootsie"" and ""The Graduate"" have shown Hoffman's talent and in the ""Fockers"" he doesn't disappear. Combined, these two newcomers to the past feel like old regulars and before long you feel like you've known them for years.<br/><br/>Not wanting to be outdone though, it's also worth pointing out that returning cast members De Niro, Polo, Stiller, Blythe Danner and Owen Wilson (in a hilarious brief cameo) are all on top form, never putting a foot wrong and providing us with some classic moments. Stiller in particular is once more great as Greg Focker as he grows further into the role and attempts to unite the warring families.<br/><br/>Aside from the superb acting, it's worth focusing on the key aspect of ""Meet the Fockers"". As a sequel, often the story of this film is a rehash of sketches used to effect in the first film. Referring to the predecessor on many occasions, it has a scene with a baby replacing a scene with a cat, scenes of arrest in remarkable similarity to previous scenes of arrest, and countless other jokes done in the previous film which are now replayed in an almost spoof like way.<br/><br/>The weird thing therefore about ""Meet the Fockers"" is that despite most of it's jokes being rehashed equivalents of the previous film, it feels strangely more entertaining. Causing a larger number of belly laughs than the previous film, it's not an original work by any stretch of the imagination, but it IS funny.<br/><br/>New cast members and rehashed jokes don't sound like the best plans for a sequel, but amazingly in ""Meet the Fockers"" they work. Brilliantly acted by all, the film never ceases to poke fun at the original film, whilst simultaneously creating some excellent moments of laughter. It may not be original entertainment, but ""Meet the Fockers"" is certainly fun to watch."

","""Meet the Parents"" was one of the best and most commercially successful mainstream comedies of recent years, a hilarious tale of a young man trying his damnedest to impress his prospective father-in-law - an ex-CIA agent with some mighty strange ideas about interpersonal relationships - and being thwarted at every turn.<br/><br/>Now comes the sequel, ""Meet the Fockers,"" in which the young, affianced couple, Greg and Pam, take her parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes, to meet his parents, Bernie and Roz Focker, a pair of freethinking flower children left over from the '60's (she's a psychologist who specializes in sex therapy for geriatrics) who have little in common with the uptight, conservative Jack, a man with a few eccentricities of his own to account for.<br/><br/>One of the reasons why ""Meet the Parents"" worked so well as a comedy was that, no matter how absurdly preposterous and slapstick-y the scenes became, the humor always remained rooted in a universal, believable premise. We always felt for Greg because we could identify with his predicament. By bringing in this second set of parents, ""Meet the Fockers"" begins to feel less like a human comedy and more like a strained sitcom, one in which the characters and situations become subordinated to the laughs and all sense of reality flies out the window. That's not necessarily a bad thing, since many of the jokes here are, indeed, very funny, but one still misses the heart that made the original film such a first-rate comic charmer.<br/><br/>That being said, ""Meet the Fockers"" is still a lot of fun to watch, primarily thanks to the high-caliber cast that has been assembled for the occasion. Joining the original players - Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner - are Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, two old pros who seem to be having the time of their professional lives plowing full-throttle through this material. The material itself is a bit on the crude side, with lines that are not quite sophisticated or subtle enough to qualify as double entendres. Add to that a few too many jokes about mammary gland function and scenes involving dog humping and you will quickly realize that the writers are aiming for a fairly low common denominator audience here (the title is the first dead give away, I suppose). Nevertheless, some of these bits do actually result in some genuine laugh-out-loud moments, thanks primarily to the caliber of the performances.<br/><br/>No one will be confusing this with Oscar Wilde or George Bernard Shaw, that's for sure, but ""Meet the Fockers"" offers a fun time for those who prefer their comedy aimed a wee bit lower."
"paul-1155","3","0","1","28 April 2005"," Warrants deconstruction
","This is a movie that I instinctively avoided seeing. The name alone suggested problems. But since a couple of people I know went to see it in the theaters--and I was inclined to be judgmental--I thought I should take a look.<br/><br/>In the early 70s Jean-Luc Godard made a movie in which Jane Fonda and Charles Aznavour play husband and wife. It was a sort of political movie. Soon after the movie was finished Jane Fonda made her infamous trip to Vietnam. After that trip Godard and his co-director for the movie with Fonda produced a one-hour film which consists of the two directors (we only heard their voices) analyzing a photo of Fonda in Vietnam that got published in French periodicals.<br/><br/>I am not sure, but I think it was an example of what is called deconstruction. What seemed like an innocuous photo of a serious Jane Fonda listening to a Vietnamese person--turned out to be pregnant with meaning. They went on and on.<br/><br/>I think the movie Meet the Fockers would be a good candidate for such deconstruction (if that is what Godard and friend were doing). I have noticed on several occasions that highly-regarded American actors and actresses allow themselves to participate in embarrassingly bad movies.<br/><br/>There seems to be a sort of moral or cultural blind spot among Hollywood types that makes this possible. <br/><br/>One thing that must be taken into account is that this movie was rated PG-13. It should be rated R, but then how many people would watch it? I can only assume that it is aimed at the adolescent audience. One possible mitigating factor in liking the movie could be youth. Things that seem trite when you have been around for a while might be entertaining when you are young--especially if you get pleasure out of naughtiness. But this movie cannot be naughty to an adult.<br/><br/>You get the impression with some of these movies that they negotiated with the censors to the degree that one more swear word and it would have to be rated R. In other words, the idea is to get in as much objectionable material in as possible without a change of rating. It is also clear that what is now rated PG-13 would have been rated R not very many years ago. There are many R-rated movies I would rather have my children watch than this and other PG-13 movies.<br/><br/>I think I have now been liberated from the 'two thumbs up' guide. Roeper gives the movie thumbs up and Ebert likes it more than he should, although he gives it thumbs down. So many good movies get made (e.g. Seagull's Laughter), such that someone's _recommending_ this movie is not a good sign.<br/><br/>The style of acting bears some resemblance to a falsetto in singing.<br/><br/>I said this movie warrants deconstruction. I have not done that here. I would be interested in reading a sophisticated critique of the movie. As a movie, it doesn't really warrant any critique at all. But as a symptom of something wrong with Hollywood, I think it might be quite instructive. Its problems are somewhat similar to those of Stuck on You--a British film."

Like all comedies by Jay Roach, this one has great flair for sexually immature remarks, crude jokes, and the kind of high-school humor that is only understood by, well, high-schoolers. Yes, it did have its funnier moments, and Dustin Hoffman lights up the picture, but as far as really cutting up a good laugh, I was disappointed.

A liberal, carefree Florida retired couple, they couldn't clash any more with the Byrneses (of course, would it be much of a movie if they did?) The two families go through mishaps and misunderstandings, with very funny results.<br/><br/>One complaint I had with Parents is the sheer impossibility of some of the antics. Someone basically burning a house down, and then letting human waste cover the yard? Not only is it improbable, it's also crude. Focker only really had one scene of toilet humor (literally), and other than that, it was all slapstick or wordplay. Very funny slapstick and wordplay, I might add. Hoffman and Streisand play amazingly well off each other and everyone else. The casting of those two is probably the best casting choice of the year. This may be Hoffman's best role since The Graduate-no lie. The completely off the wall way he plays Bernie is great and really works well for the movie. In fact, all of the performances are great.<br/><br/>Not only that, but it's also funny as hell. It's mainly the typical zany mishap comedy, but there's a lot of great dialogue, too. The addition of a baby, Little Jack, added a good amount of humor (adding to the minor ""breast pump"" issue of the first movie). But LJ seemed to just be a necessity, to show that, yes, the two movies are different (as if the addition of Hoffman and Streisand weren't enough). Still, the laughs were constant and strong, something that can't really be said about almost any other comedy that's come out within the past five or so years (except for, of course Parents). Although I've been so tardy with my reviews (and I saw Fockers late in its run), I'd really suggest this movie. If you liked Parents, you'll like this one even more.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10 Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor, language and a brief drug reference."

Every one can relate to this thema: I am not married, not a father but i have a brother who faces this. So, it is funny to see how the characters live the same events. Sometimes we can think, ""it is true"", other times, ""it's funny they try this""....In other words, the movie is interesting because there is a communication between the screenplay & the audience life...<br/><br/>But, to make a good communication, you need good medium.

","Of course this film is a sequel, and sequels are generally less better than the originals - not so in this case, this is almost as good as the first film without the ""novelty"" aspect. Robert De Niro is the best of the lot but I thought Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffmann were very interesting additions to the family ! Of course you can't produce a clone of the first film ! Novelty has to be introduced but there are several re-hashes of jokes from the first film and recurring themes but with new additions. I don't think the Director could have done better as far as sequels go !! I have seen the film twice in the last three weeks, once in the UK and the ten days later in Paris, France. Second sitting, I caught up on some jokes I missed the first time round ! I'll definitely be adding this one to my DVD collection when it comes out !! It's the ""clash of characters"" between De Niro and Hoffmann that really wins the day in this one, plus the expressions of the little baby boy ( which is a novelty ) compared to the first film.<br/><br/>What WAS missing was a nice theme tune to replace the INIMITABLE ""WHEN YOU'RE A FOOL IN LOVE"" from the first film. I think sound-track-wise this sequel is far less well endowed than its predecessor. In France the film has the curious title ""Mes Parents, Mon Beau-père et moi"" ( My parents, my father-in-law and I !!!)"

","I saw this film the other day and I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Streisand. Usually she over-dominates a film but here she is quite prepared to share the limelight with all the other actors. And not one person remarks that she is really beautiful! Even her legs and fingernails were less in evidence. Both she and Dustin Hoffman (who doesn't show enough of his comic talents) were hilarious as a couple who're still living in the 1970s.<br/><br/>I must say, though, I was disappointed in the performances of the other two actors, Robert de Niro and Blythe Danner. The latter was wasted and not given enough to do, and the former looks too grim and determined to have a lighter side. And how come their grandson still needs breastfeeding when he's clearly shown to have quite a few teeth? I'm not a mother but know perfectly well that infants are weaned after a few months. The whole storyline of the fake breast was dumb, to say the least."

","Although I have not seen 'Meet the Parents' (2000), I liked 'Meet the Fockers' a lot more than I thought.<br/><br/>The story: Gaylord 'Greg' Focker (Ben Stiller) is getting married to Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). He met her parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes (Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner) last time around, so now it's time to meet Greg's parents, the Fockers.<br/><br/>It's safe to say that the Fockers differ from the Byrnes: Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) is a retired lawyer who has put up a 'Wall of Gaylord' that displays many awards Greg won as a kid; however, they're mostly for last place. Roz (Barbra Streisand), on the other hand, is a sex therapist for senior citizens and has a whole room full of sex-related art. Needless to say, personalities clash, old secrets are revealed, and hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>I've always had a liking for Ben Stiller, even in some of his less-than-inspired projects, and he's great here, particularly in a drug-induced monologue late in the film. Robert De Niro plays his role as straight as he possibly can to all the weirdness going on around him. Hoffman is the complete opposite of De Niro, and the two veterans have some great scenes together. I enjoyed Streisand's performance (her profession is funnier than it sounds), and the rest of the cast does a good job keeping up with this manic fun.<br/><br/>I laughed so hard during this movie I thought I was going to die of laughter. That thankfully didn't happen, but I still fully recommend 'Meet the Fockers'. 10/10."

So as the movie traveled on he suddenly improved in affection and started laughing and enjoying himself, and believe me, if you would see him before the movie you would never guess that a smile would appear on that face. So the movie had been on for an hour and his face was dying red. It turned so many colors in that two hours that I got scared and wondered if he was okay. But now I know that it was just because of laughter. So when the movie got over, we bought two more tickets and watched it again because neither of us had got enough.

","I went into this movie with pretty low expectations. I'd read reviews in the press that suggested it wasn't up to much, and so when I really enjoyed Meet the Fockers I was nicely surprised.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie is a simple one. Greg and Dina have decided to marry, and having finally won over the formidable Jack Byrnes in the original movie, the time has come to introduce the parents to each other.<br/><br/>Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Striesand are well cast in the roles of Gaylord's (Greg) embarrassing hippie parents, who are as you would expect, a world away from stuffy and conservative Jack.<br/><br/>Where this film perhaps falls down a little compared to the original is in the setting. In Meet the Parents anyone can identify with the situation Greg enters. Presented with an uncompromising father and close-knit family harbouring a shared secret he falls foul of his constant attempts to impress and terrible luck.<br/><br/>In Meet the Fockers the film hangs more on the diametrically opposed Bernie (Hoffman) and Jack (De Niro). While this works, it perhaps a little harder for many people to immediately identify with.<br/><br/>That said the film contains many genuinely funny moments and set-pieces, and unlike the first film, none of the humour feels over-exposed.<br/><br/>My one disappointment in Meet the Fockers came from Jack. Fantastic in the first film, his character somehow seemed to have lost much of his punch, becoming more difficult and awkward than intimidating.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Meet the Fockers, and while it's not as engrossing as the original, it is funny and certainly worth watching."
"Bantam","8","0","1","7 February 2005"," One of the best sequels...
","... ever. I've seen the first one and it was good. At times too much slapstick comedy, but it was a good movie, especially due to DeNiro's superb acting and his quirky character.<br/><br/>Usually I do not care too much for sequels, because they are aimed towards making some money and are mostly lame. Not in this case, even though it raked in a ridiculous amount of money. DeNiro is one of my favorite actors, so I thought it can't be that bad, if he accepted to star in it - he can't be that desperate, can he?. But the all-star cast of that movie, especially with a powerful Hoffman and an adorable Streisand is a perfect 'circle'. Stiller is just trying to be funny, but unfortunately he can't deliver in the vicinity of such awesome performances. Even Blythe Danner, who stars in !Huff - and she does a superb job - out-acts Stiller. Stiller tries, but he neither reaches the level of acting nor has he the experience, he is just a comedian, not a good actor.<br/><br/>The story runs along the lines of the first movie, except the both families get to meet each other. That provides for some comic momentum, as well as the totally different characters of the family provide for some hilarious sit-com. The story if somewhat predictable, especially towards the end, but that does not really matter, because that is not the point. Hoffman and DeNiro just act it out, so to speak, and it is just a joy to watch them both in full swing. More than one time I was not only smiling, or giggling, I was laughing out loud and slapping my thighs because these two are awesome. <br/><br/>There are few scenes where they transport so much humor, without being too 'humoristic', if you catch my drift. If you have seen it, you will know. Just pay attention to it. My favorite scene is the one where Hoffman tries to hinder DeNiro from leaving with his RV. Absolutely awesome!<br/><br/>I did not give it the whole 10, because of a few small glitches in the storyline, mostly because of Stiller, who plays good, but simply can't keep up with the others. And last, but not least, because of the prospect of another sequel, which is certainly possible due to the commercial success the movie had. So, 'just' a niner from me."

Dustin Hoffman truly steals the show with his great acting, unlike Ben Stiller who plays the same guy in every movie.

","The success of the movie relies on the comedic performances of the duo formed by De Niro and Hoffman. Blythe Danner and Barbara Streissand deliver expectations though their characters don't ask for too much. Ben Stiller's comedic resources rely too much on his facial expressions and body language. Still the man is funny and gives a good performance. Teri Polo is just OK. <br/><br/>The situations are funny but not as creative as in the previous movie. The audience expects extremely funny situations but that doesn't happens and it's not that necessary. In my opinion, the situations from the previous movie repeat in the sequel but now the situation is against De Niro. There are sub-plots that just didn't catch the viewers' attention because weren't very necessary. For example, the confusion about Greg's ""son"" didn't develop because a situation like that would ruin the movie's charm. The way the scene is explained is just too silly. <br/><br/>""Meet the Fockers"" is an average comedy with the usual funny situations, sex jokes, and double sense humor. Not a movie that will make you laugh out loud but will surely entertain you. In my opinion, not better than ""Meet the Parents"" but it has to be watched because of it's cast."
"Victor Field","7","0","1","5 February 2005"," Isn't this just a ""Carry On"" movie with A-list talent? No, thankfully.
","""Meet the Parents"" was probably the best of Robert DeNiro's numerous forays into the lighter side, though it's a long way away from the terrific ""Tribeca"" TV series he executive produced. ""Meet the Fockers"" is even further away - this is, in some senses, a crude comedy that wouldn't get much notice or be taken too seriously if its stars were all under the age of 30, but since none of them are, and since three of the four stars have Oscars to their name, it's a horse of a different colour. But like the slight but engaging original, this has more going for it than jokes about a male nurse called Gaylord Focker.<br/><br/>The movie's pitting a relatively straightlaced couple (DeNiro and Gwynnie's mum) against a much more free-living pair (lawyer Dustin Hoffman and sex therapist Barbra Streisand) isn't the most original premise, and writers Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg and director Jay Roach occasionally... okay, not that occasionally... go for the cheap gag (""Honk if you're horny"" indeed - and is that Erica Campbell as the driver of the bus, or just wishful thinking on my part?) - but the cast's enthusiastic playing is very hard to resist, with Hoffman a standout as the kind of dad who's so embarrassing most of us will relate in a second. Somehow if he, DeNiro and Barbra Streisand had been in the same movie in the 1970s it's hard to imagine it would be like this (especially since Streisand, never renowned for the smallness of her ego, is billed fourth!).<br/><br/>Where the movie really scores isn't in jokes about the Fockers's dog humping the Byrnes's cat (!!!), but in the way it leavens the comedy with the subtext about trust, which is ultimately what the movie is really about. This may well strike some viewers as unnecessary schmaltz, but without it the movie wouldn't have anything at its heart. While the added dimension has its drawbacks (it does seem a bit too long), in the end ""Meet the Fockers"" is more than a gross-out comedy for grownups; everyone looks as if they're having a good time, and ultimately so will many viewers, even if it does repeat some elements of the first one (but then, most sequels do). Ultimately, I liked it."

The first while was a bit bland, but the comedy really emerged in the latter half, especially with the addition of Hoffman and streisand (sporting quite the plastic surgery, talk about smooth, doll-like, plasticity skin... wow).<br/><br/>This kind of comedy is situational. It takes situations and explores the comic possibilities inherent in it. It pushes situations to the limit. In that sense, it takes you on a roller-coaster ride that is highly entertaining, albeit imperfect. owen Wilson's cameo was unforgettable as the inter-faith preacher. Hoffman was a little over the top, but it worked. Some of the ""sincere, touching"" moments didn't seem to fit in this movie, and streisand was annoying, with her plasticity face bouncing around and her new agey attitude (ample cleavage shots served as a not so unpleasant distraction, but you have to wonder about the naturalness of those assets). Some really classic moments, like the statues with giant members and the books about having a happy vagina.<br/><br/>But overall it has a sort of ""been there, seen that"" feel, but not enough to detract from the enjoyment of it. It just has loads in common with other movies of the same ilk, from Meatballs to Naked Gun. People caught in awkward situations, with a healthy dose of potty humour thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>I was amused. It's nice to see DeNiro in fine form. Ben Stiller was hilarious and the bit about his ""fifteen year old son"" who acts exactly like him and looks damn similar really cracked me up as well. Blythe Danner is just gorgeous and classy.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies with lots of physical comedy and classic moments that stick with you, much like the type of humour from the old screwball comedies from days of yore such as Bringing Up Baby. It's well done and a nice, ripping yarn. Like I stated, it's not perfect and far from classic, but it's a satisfying sequel to the original, which, in all honesty, is more consistently funny. You may want to rent it, though, as opposed to running out to the nearest cinema."

Whilst the run ins of the two sets of parents are entirely predictable, they are carried off with such enthusiastic charm that it is hard not to get into the spirit of it and enjoy a few laughs.

I still wanted to see it, but I couldn't expect much of it. Meet the Parents was very good, so I would give this one a fair chance. Nothing better to do to end the holidays. So is the focking sequel in the circle of trust?<br/><br/>Plot: 1.9/2.5: Gaylord (he prefers Greg) Focker (Stiller) and Pamela Byrnes (Polo) are almost ready to get married. There is just one thing left to do before they make everything final. Pam's parents, Jack (deNiro) and Dina (Danner) have to meet Greg's parents, Bernie (Hoffman) and Roz (Streisand). As we know from the first, Jack Byrnes is an uptight ex-CIA agent. So when he meets the Fockers, as you can guess, he is completely out of place with their eccentricity. This seems like a very paint by numbers type movie, and as much of that as it is, it has an impeccable way of placing all these characters into situations suited to make Jack and Greg as uncomfortable as humanly possible, whether it be trying to hide Pam's recently found out pregnancy, a bastard child or Jack's grandson's first word (the grandson being Debbie's son, who does not appear in this movie). The plot isn't too important, and while it is paint-by-numbers, who cares?<br/><br/>Comedy: 2.5/2.5: Meet the Fockers is simply hilarious. There is no other way to put it. It has been so long since a truly funny movie like Airplane or even Scary Movie has come along, I have begun to forget what a comedy is supposed to be. This is what I call a comedy. This is just one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It is a little off-the-wall. When one character can say ""And one more thing about my vasectomy"" and it sounds normal, you know that this is pretty off-the-wall. It isn't quite the same type of comedy as the original. This one is much funnier than the first. This is gold.<br/><br/>Acting: 2.5/2.5: OK, this isn't a movie to showcase the acting from. However, the actors are incredible here. DeNiro (Analyze This) is playing it straight like never before. He is having fun, but he tries enough to be like his old Goodfellas-esquire roles to separate from the rest of the cast. Hoffman (Rain Man) and Streisand (A Star Is Born) are having lots of fun, and it shows as these two carry this movie from the first time we see them. These are two Oscar winning actors having the time of their lives, and it works great. Stiller (Zoolander) may only be good in small doses, but that's what we get here. He's everywhere, but the Ben Stiller in him only comes out a couple times, so it's funny but not overused or tiring. Polo (Beyond Borders), while still mainly in the background, does have a few more lines and works well. Danner (The X Files) is much more in this one, up from a practically nothing role in the original, and while she still isn't too prominent, a few good bits go her way. The actors are not in an award-type movie, but they do exactly the best we could want.<br/><br/>Entertainment: 2.4/2.5: There is some complaining about this movie because the Fockers are too unbelievable. If they were believable, we'd have a bad movie. Some complaints about the reused jokes. They are reused because they're funny. They aren't often though. There are some Focker jokes, but they're only here and there. Sure, it is somewhat crude and offensive in areas, but nowhere near as crude and offensive as most funny comedies out there. It's usually the crudeness that produces comedy, so if that's the price, I'll pay it. Meet the Fockers is entertaining for anyone.<br/><br/>Total: 93%: I can't believe my focking ears, but Meet the Fockers is even better than the original and easily one of, if not the, funniest movie of the year. Despite some critics bashing it, you should see Meet the Fockers as soon as possible. Sneaking in right at the end is one of the best of the year."

","Where do I start? This is pun heaven! Imagine the possibilities! A pun film review of ""Meet the Fockers"" is as good as it gets for us punners. I'm a lucky focker! OK, let the focker pun games begin! ""Meet the Fockers"" has already met the dollars by striking box office bonanza. This sequel contains the same focking humor as its predecessor ""Meet the Parents"". However, ""Meet the Fockers"" introduces us to a ""Mother Focker"" and a ""Father Focker"". That would be the scene-stealing Dustin Hoffman & Barbara Streisand as Bernie and Roz Focker. They were so focking good! I am not going to bother to summarize the film's plot. You must know it by now. If you don't, you must be a dumb focker. Moreover, I am confident that most of you have seen this film and already have been ""Fockerized"". Of course, the same ""Circle of Trustees"" cast from ""Parents"" are back: Ben Stiller, Robert Deniro, Teri Polo, Blythe Danner, and Owen Wilson. However, it was the funny girl Streisand and the insane rainman Hoffman that stole the fockshow! **** Good"

","for once i thought that this movie was exceptionally funny, each actor played their character to a tee, and to top it off the one person that i thought shined throughout the movie was the baby (twin brothers in real life). Unlike most BAD sequels that are only done to make easy money, such as Terminator 3, i have to admit that meet the fockers beat out its first creation in meet the parents. I saw this film twice in the theatres, and from my personal experience that doesn't happen often, so that should tell you what i thought about the movie. As well the movie is not directed to one specific demographic, you don't have to be a genius to understand whats going on, even an 8 yr old could watch and be ammused, its great to take the girlfriend/wife or even bring along the family to watch it!!! p.s. if i remember correctly was it not the biggest box office hit on Christmas day?"

","Unfortunately, ""Meet the Fockers"" does not live up to the promise of its predecessor.

It's mildly entertaining and occasionally engaging, but it really requires that you've seen ""Meet the Parents"" to fully enjoy it. Many of the jokes are unfortunately recycled from the original, and bits and pieces of ""Flirting with Disaster"" can also be found here and there. The film is like a collage of many past comedies, but in the context of the first film.

Just when the movie starts to feel like the original, Babara Streisand and Dustin Hoffman enter the movie, and improve it in so many ways. The level of humor seems to go up and doesn't slump til the end of the movie. There are many surprises along the way. I don't want to say too much more though.

","Meet the Parents was an inspired comedy.It had a very funny premise,and delivered a bunch of great laughs.When the rumors for Meet the Fockers came out on the internet soon after,I was excited,I thought(and so did many other web pages) they'd use Ben Stiller's real parents,Seinfeld's Jerry Stiller,and Anne Meara,but they didn't.The film opens with Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker,who we all know by now is a male nurse,delivering his first baby.The father of the baby asks if he can the name the baby after Greg,he sees his name tag,and sees why Greg is hesitant.Well Greg gets to his apartment,where he calls his parents to remind,them that they are going.Well the rest of the day goes smoothly for Greg,and his wife to be Pam.They make it to her parents house.Where we find out Jack Byrnes is now a Grandfather,to Pam's sister's baby named Jack after Deniro's Byrnes .Pam's sister,and brother from Meet the Parents are absent in Meet the Fockers.They hit the road in Jack's camper,which looks like a tank,Greg even makes a joke about it.Along the way,Jack shows Greg his new invention,a breast feeding pump,that is molded from Little Jack's mothers breast,the joke is funny once,but they use it over and over in the movie.Jack discusses with Greg his legacy,and how he isn't sure Greg,or his family will fit in it.We now know that DeNiro's Jack hasn't changed much from Meet the Parents,and it progresses in Meet The Fockers.They reach Miami Florida,which is were we are introduced to Greg's parents Roz,and Bernie Focker.They are very different from Jack.Thats when the bulk of the film begins.Dustin Hoffman,and Barbara Streisand are great as Bernie,and Roz.They are very funny.Hoffman is particularly great as Bernie,a loving Dad,who has a Wall of Greg's Honorable mention ribbons.Hoffman,and Streisand have great chemistry as the loving Focker parents.But DeNiro's Byrnes goes a little too far,Robert DeNiro is an actor I admire a lot,but Jack Byrnes is an unlikable jerk in Meet the Fockers.He has a great talent for comedy too,Analyze This was a hilarious movie.But when you should be laughing at Greg's crazy actions,you actually don't think they are funny at all,and feel sorry for what Jack is doing to him,after trying so hard to earn his respect.There is one momment in Meet the Fockers,where Jack injects a truth shot in him,people in the theatre were laughing hard at it,but like I said earlier I felt sorry for Greg.Maybe I took Meet the Fockers a little too seriously.Maybe I should have relaxed and had a fun time.As for a third Focker outing,leave the parents out of it,and have it focus on Greg,and Pam starting a family.<br/><br/>2.5/4"
"dhaufrect-1","6","0","1","16 January 2005"," Very Funny Film
","""Meet The Fockers"" is a very funny film. The zenith of it's success is the performance given by Dustin Hoffman. He plays a middle aged Jewish lawyer who seems to have never practiced his trade. He is financially dependent on his wife, played by Barbara Streisand. She is a working sex therapist for the elderly, and the concept alone is a humorous one. She gives a fairly good performance in a role that is funny in it's own right. Ben Stiller plays their son who is introducing his in-laws to the folks in their humble abode in Florida. Robert DiNero is the retired CIA agent and father of the bride. He tries to maintain his inner circle of secrecy with his own family, but eventually bends under the psychological assault by the Fockers. The title is funny. Hoffman is funny, and the experience is worth the effort just for his performance alone. It is light, and can be a pleasing cinema experience. Do not look for a classic, but do find a very enjoyable couple of hours at the movies."

Maybe something that I would have been better off waiting for it to come out on video to see.

","Right now at the multiplex...if you want a dynamic biopic of an obsessive compulsive pilot, see 'The Aviator'. If you need a stunning reminder of the worst of human nature, see 'Hotel Rwanda'. Or if you want a boxing movie that's got much more going for it than just pugilism, see 'Million Dollar Baby'. Other studios have their best Oscar foot forward with those films, but Dreamworks is making the most money with their critic-proof comedy sequel, 'Meet The Fockers'. And I'm a bit surprised to say this---it's pretty funny.<br/><br/>DeNiro and Stiller are joined by Hoffman and Streisand in this go-round. Dusty and Babs play Stiller's hippie parents, which is too much for uptight CIA whiz DeNiro to handle. Director Jay Roach has 4 huge stars to deal with, but he juggles them all quite well. Hoffman is the treat here and he's a wonderfully zany addition. Streisand is okay too. Other cast members do basically what they did in 'Meet The Parents', which is to look good and play off the headliners. There's a baby in the picture now too---DeNiro's cute grandson. The big fight that nearly breaks up the family circle (similar plot development as in the first film) kills some of the smiles for a while, but things get back on track before it's over.<br/><br/>So bring some chums because this is a crowd picture. It's bound to be funnier if you're with a bunch of people. And it's amazing how many chuckles they can get from the cast saying, ""Focker"". So will there be a 'Meet The Children' or some kind of 3rd installment? Since this franchise and 'Shrek' are Dreamworks' cash cows, Stiller and Teri Polo better have some kids in a hurry. The taxi driver and the graduate as dueling grandfathers would be even more comic gold."

One of the jokes in the movie includes the parents ""shrine"" dedicated to their son's ""achievements."" This includes ""9th place ribbons"" and a trophy that reads ""world's greatest male nurse."" Bernie and Roz are the type of couple that are out there but see themselves as normal. Everyone else around them is just closed in and not in touch with their feelings.

Basically, if you saw ""Meet the Parents"", then you've seen this one already without having to sit through it because it's essentially the same movie. Greg (Ben stiller) and Amy (Teri Polo) are engaged and after surviving the Byrnes family, it's now time to meet the Fockers.<br/><br/>Greg's folks (Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffman) are eccentric, loving, extremely left winged liberals and they play it to such a hilt that it's almost cartoonish at times. The Byrnes, of course are led by ex-CIA psycho dad Robert Deniro who wants nothing but the best for his daughter and family. Naturally, the two families clash and the events in the film are comical at times, but also very predictable. DeNiro brings his cute grandson along for the trip and when Greg is asked to watch the baby, you just know the first word out of the kids mouth won't be ""mama"" or ""dada"".<br/><br/>It's nice to see Hoffman and Barbra on screen together. It's obviously stunt casting, but it almost works. Streisand even has her 70's giant frizz hair that she parlayed in movies like ""Star Is Born"" and ""Main Event"". Hoffman is just a left winged weirdo at times that was a bit hard to take. I think better casting might have been Ben's real dad, Jerry Stiller and Estelle Harris (Seinfeld). That way you'd still have a bit of stunt casting with a more believable and nutty set of parents. Sort of a ""Meet the Costanzas"", if you will.<br/><br/>This movie is cute, charming, and funny at times, but save this one for the video store. It's just not worth the price of admission. (**1/2)"

They were the exact opposite of Pam's parents yet they were believable parents not too out of the extraordinary. Both supplied very funny moments.<br/><br/>The last film prospered from very funny supporting characters which this film seemed to lack. The baby jokes were mostly forced and there was not enough Jinxy Cat.<br/><br/>This is not to say that ""Meet The Fockers"" was a bad film. I found that there were some very funny moments. I also found that there were some very dull moments as well.<br/><br/>Meet The Fockers= **1/2 out of **** Meet The Parents=***1/2 out of ****"
"mlsbas-1","10","0","2","2 January 2005"," How often does a sequel overshadow the original?
","Where does one begin? Delightful story line - casting A1A - scenery more than excellent ! The return of Robert DeNiro and the ever-beautiful Blythe Danner was a no-brainer. The cute couple, of course, worked. But, who would have thought to match up Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand? When I first heard of this pairing, I thought: ""HUH?"" What a thoroughly enjoyable experience to see these two masters of their craft make movie magic in this story.<br/><br/>Dustin Hoffman was deliciously outrageous - what a wonderful role for him, at this point in his career. Barbra Streisand was equally outrageous, and has NEVER been more beautiful ! Even though she didn't sing (would not have worked in this film - Shucks!), it was a stroke of genius to place her in this role. She's so great at playing the Jewish card, as she has been throughout her career.<br/><br/>An excellent feature of the film, ala James Bond, was Robert DeNiro's RV - seeing the ""secret hatch"" where his covert stuff could be executed was very cool. Equally enjoyable was his character's ""softening up"" at the end - actually being willing to become more human.<br/><br/>Best Film Of The Year Oscar ? Why Not ?"

","Gaylord Focker(Stiller) and Pam Brynes(Polo) from the original prequel ""Meet the Parents"" are now engaged to be married. Before they can tie the knot, Jack Brynes(De Niro),an ex-CIA agent, wants to approve of his soon to be son-in-law's parents. All hell is set loose when Jack Brynes meets Roz Focker(Streisand) and Bernie Focker(Hoffman). They have completely different cultures, beliefs, morals, views, and ethics. Gaylord Focker wants Jack's approval so much that he would constantly kiss up to him and lie about certain things. Throughout most of the movie Jack Brynes finds many reasons to disapprove of the Gaylord's parents and even what he believes to be a new reason to disapprove of Gaylord. <br/><br/>And there is the simple plot of ""Meet the Fockers"". This movie was fun to watch yet not as entertaining as the prequel. The comedic base seemed to greatly resemble the first movie. Many of the same things re-occurred in this sequel such as Greg's constant screwing up and covering up, Jack trying to get Gaylord to admit to lying and being untrustworthy, and the movie again ending with Jack's distrust and disapproval turning into acceptance. Although the plot seemed very redundant, it was still very hilarious. <br/><br/>The spectacular cast in this movie was reason enough to view it. There was no denying the on-screen chemistry between Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro. Even four years after they're original duo, they still haven't lost their magic. Together, they're acting could only be described as dynamic. <br/><br/>My rating would have to be a 6/10."

","I just got done watching this film and i noticed it didn't have the same feel to it as the original. I was a big fan of the first but compared to this movie the first one doesn't even come close to how fantastic this movie was. I like this one a lot better and i think the film was the best comedy this year, in fact in years! Don't spend your time on a comedy like fat Albert. go see this it is worth the hour and fourtyfive minutes of sitting in the theater. I strongly recommend this! I give the actors An A+ I give the Director An A+ I give the Writer An A+ and i especially give this film a Big A+! One more thing try not to die Laughing!"

","It was a hilarious movie. I laughed so hard all the time. Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman offer a good contrast to the roles of Blythe Danner and Robert Deniro. It has a lot of sexual innuendo, so don't take children so young to the movie. They have opposite types of parents, Greg Focker's parents are a new age hippie type of parents, while the Byrnes family is a more conservative, uppity family. Greg Focker's parents talk about sex all the time because his mom is a sex therapist. So it creates plenty of tension and misunderstanding and it creates very humorous scenes. There is also an interesting plot twist in the movie also that adds to the misunderstanding and surprise. The actors are brilliant. Everyone is a great actor, I say it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I strongly recommend everyone to go see it."
"normano","8","0","2","30 December 2004"," Better than the original!
","I saw this with my wife and was pleasantly surprised. I thought it was going to be more of the same from the original but after seeing a preview of the ""footy ball"" scene on Jay Leno I thought we should give it a try.<br/><br/>With the original I found the grilling of Gaylord by his potential father-in-law funny and amusing. But when the whole movie is full of it, it gets very annoying very quickly. Fortunately for this sequel, it has a saving grace in the form of Gaylords parents, Bernie and Roz. What a breath of fresh air. I feel stuffy and uptight while watching DeNiro (maybe cos DeNiro's character is stuffy and uptight) but when it switches to Bernie and Roz I relax and the laughs came out a lot easier.<br/><br/>Maybe I felt for Gaylord after going through the same thing when I was in the process of marrying my wife.<br/><br/>I have a 1.5 year old son but the baby in the movie just annoyed me. The baby in the movie though was quite smart in baby signing.<br/><br/>This movie is good fun. A more balanced experience than the first movie and my wife and I definitely enjoyed it more. Unfortunately after this movie my wife and I saw the ridiculous Oceans 12. Maybe we should've just gone home after seeing Meet The Fockers..."
"dusticle","7","0","2","26 December 2004"," funny, but that's it
","directed by: jay roach my vote: 6.5 (rounded to 7) i saw the movie opening day (december 22). 3rd showing of the day at the theater. i at first was surprised to see no sold out show times. then i was surprised to find the theater i was in wasn't half full. i then saw the movie. i laughed a lot. i cracked up a lot. i chocked on my cookie dough bites and squirted coke out my nose. yes, it was very funny. much funnier than meet the parents.<br/><br/>that's it recycled story, recycled jokes, classic clichÃ©s, not to mention the return of Kevin. all included in meet the fockers. i love Dustin Hoffman has the head focker, the once-was lawyer, and Barbra Streisand as the mother focker, the sex therapist. sadly it's the only other thing i love about meet the fockers.<br/><br/>i won't see it at the theater again. i'll buy it used at Hollywood video in a couple of years."
